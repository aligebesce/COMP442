Because I'm because John Gummer's responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they?
Whereas Robert Atkins has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area.
People of one
I don't know that's what I imagine.
people of one  of the environment and the other's Secretary of State for the Environment.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
It's just bizarre rules of procedure.
There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State.
Yeah.
To be honest I think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court magician come in
Wave their wand and recite the Lords Prayer.
Fair enough.
I assumed there would be a reason  assume there was going to be a good reason.
Erm so who else was on your  list of people we ought to write to
South East Cambridgeshire who's the Parl Parliamentary Secretary to John Gummer.
Who's the sorry your  and I can't

and these people are erm unpaid helpers to Ministers and Secretaries of State it says here.
Unpaid.
So
They're they're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to  find something for them  to report basically.

"Oh I didn't want to tell you this Phil, but"
What?

I only want one pound
Why?
"and er, like Christmas, erm, they have these things on the telly when there's about, every, every night there's like a fifteen minutes' programme, just before the close-down, of like, B B C One."
One?
"And there's people, like famous people of the telly just sitting and talking erm, and saying prayers every night, and walking around a typical area that means something to them."
Oh.
"And we watched it one night, and it was Mrs Hewitt off Eastenders."
"Oh, really?"
"And er, she was really"
"by Michael Aspel, weren't she, or Michael Parkinson?"
between them.
Yeah.
Aspel tomato.
"Erm, and so, we had a good old walk around there, and like this place where she was, I swear it's Highgate Cemetery where she was talking,"
"Oh, really?"
"and like she was pointing different things out about this cemetery, and, I mean, you know, you there can't be many cemeteries"
No.
"like that in, in London and she was in London, but we missed the beginning of it,"
Oh.
"and erm, mum was sorry that Mark had been on about it, she said, oh I bet that's where he goes, and erm, like the park beside it was just lovely,"
Yes.
"the whole thing, really, really nice area, and er, all just minutes away from central London, you know."
Oh.
"It was, it was really good."
Had a really nice three hours.
And er
Oh that was nice.
"Then he's gone off to Coventry, and then over to Manchester."
"So er,"
It's quite  to get on with your bruv .
"Yeah, because you know, we're always messing about, or  around, or, you know, never like you know, together, really"
Yeah.
"Because even when I go up to his place, like it's always been, like dropping him off, always being in a hurry."
"I mean, I sat in his room, had a coffee today, it was like, I actually sat here and relaxed and always being on the move, you know."
I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
"Eighty gardens, oh  made me laugh."
"Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens."
"Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be"
"Well I expect now, they've got about five ."
"I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty"
"Oh look,tractor  ."
I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
Mm.
And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
Mm.
But if they can use that er beautiful water
Ah right.
"to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well."
I know a lot of people say they shouldn't
Good idea .
"have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go."
"Yeah, I agree, if people did ."
"I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right,were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful,palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of  is it?"
.
"It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?"
What Buckingham Palace?
Mm.
"I don't know, I didn't realise."
"At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building"
Mm.
"and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than"
Well that was Buckingham Palace was er .
Oh yes.
.
Oh yeah.
.
"No, would you tell me what sort of word it is remembering what we did at the beginning of the week"
"yeah, but that's the, what it means, I want to know what kind of a word it is"
Yes I know it's spelt
Is it a verb?
"No it's not a verb, come on, what is it"
A noun
"Yes it's a noun, it's a name of something isn't it?"
"Because we were doing that at the beginning of the week, a scare, you could actually get"
"right, so can you put it back into, into a sentence again then"
Shirley?
"You've got a scare on, I saw Dracula"
"We've got a scare on, we saw Dracula, yes, that was it."
Right what's the next word?
Share
"Share, what does share mean?"
You share out
"You share out, can you put that in a sentence?"
I like to share out my sweets
"Oh that's lovely, I like to share out my sweets"
digging
"Digging, they're going onto double Gs now, why would it be double G?"
One put dig and then and then -ing
"Yes, but there is a rule isn't there"
Oh yeah
"Ah yes, Trevor"
"because, because, is it cos of erm, if you put D"
"no, not quite, you're nearly right, come on"
Is it because the I sounds like
"yes you would actually get, a magic E right, or a magic I making that vowel right say its long name, so it would be quite difficult to say dig giding"
"Right, lets try the next one, what's the next one?"
er bigger
"bigger that's for the same reason, there you've got an E, and so because you've got the E we can double the G to make the I go on, go on say short for"
"Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it?"
"And it's only an hour or so away, so  perhaps you should say that"
get a weekend in
I wonder where there is a cheap place to
where you can old furniture.
"Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored"
"No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture"
Oh no
all furniture
you've got no chance
mm.
"No I mean, what is he, different"
"in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is"

"Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my babe  I'm a tell her, we've, we've"
"I mean, a couple of them I like"
"I remember a go, a go with some of them that I thought I could do, but realised I can't do, do you know what I mean?"
"I, I, I was, about, what I, I do, I bought an Elvis Presley one er a Tom Jones one, that drinks one, you know, that I like, it's, it's"
"well I like singing it, what I mean, I think what it is I'm looking for the old, I'm not being funny, I'm looking for the old voice"
"I don't like me voice, I'm not liking it at all and I think that's what putting me off on taping it and listening to myself after, I don't, I like, I like to"
"I shouldn't do it, I'm not gonna do it any more, I'm not gonna tape me own voice and listen to it  I just"

And then you'll need a P S V
Well
licence.
"but, but that's, that's  that's easily remedied if you could get a er  a driving licence holder  to take them  oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents  or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.
"But I did also say  to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them  after I've discussed with Miss ."
I only know one person  I only know one bus driver with children.
There's ambulance drivers.
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.
Er  this  letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
Yes.
Says any
that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're not
To sixteen.
you're not reducing the size of the bus.
Well I think that's crazy.
And someone who's been just used to driving a car  are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
Well
tuition?
"Well I, I"
Whether it's got  whether it's got sixteen people in it or  twenty nine
Well er
it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
I drive the minibus at the hospital
I know.
"which only takes four wheelchairs  and of course there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them."
"I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just"
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
No.
and just drive
"and just, I hid under my sleeping bag, er, then, I thought er the mon what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on, you know, all, all night"
John
"Well he did say that the monster was rather large, he looked like a bird"
with some feathers plucked out
What else could you bring in his bag?
Anything else he could of put in the hat Liam?
"He vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping, but he didn't describe"
"Where, where"
"Yeah, where"
So he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back
Yeah
"and what he went through in, in"
that couldn't he?
Yeah
"Right, the people who have not read an essay out yet, I want you to sit, just a minute Michael, next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please, right boys do that now then, yes, could you take yours to show"

"Right erm, can I start by asking you, can you tell me your full name please?"
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Wouldn't Sue do them?

"I bet she had, I bet she had er"
no I know she's got a
You really want one with a three
I thought she had a band saw no
I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you?
And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you?
"Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there"
"huge, to that their costs mm"
I'll have to pay
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw
thirty pound a tooth
"Yeah, god worse than"
erm
"mm, how many have you got to now cut?"
"and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there?"
"I haven't got anything that deep, the"
only goes to about five inches
"What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you"
No
Why?
"at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off"
To reverse them
and turn it over
"Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way"
To make your first cut
Yeah
you have to take the guard off and the
"knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm  where's the guard goes at the top"
"my Lord do, do we agree to that now or by tomorrow morning?"
well I would think if it could lodged during the course of the next ten days or so
"certainly, it'll be done by tomorrow morning"
"I'm, I'm, if there any question over it, the reason why I said ten days I'm already sitting in London for, until the end of next week and therefore if there were any question, it's obvious that it came before me, and that"
it'll be done by tomorrow morning
yes
thank you
"yes, yes, that can be prepared and erm a copy of that to doctor  and"
certainly
"doctor  if you don't agree with what it says, erm, you can obviously mention that to  and  er  er along speedily say in the course of this week, the matter can be mentioned in formal to me, erm one morning at ten o'clock next week I would of thought."
In terms of I need to appeal this one
"oh yes, leave to appeal, erm  it doesn't seem to me that this is an appropriate case for leave, or at least for me to grant leave, doctor"
All court rise

"That's what Robert wants then, to do a bit of training and start like getting"
"I'm not like overly fat or anything, I'm the right weight for what I'm, for my height like but I've just got a pot belly"
"They've got a spare room in my mum's flat so  I just took it over and put a weights bench in and, what else, a rowing machine  and I started to do some weights"
I never knew you had all those.

Yeah
"but er  I was the only one that ever  used it  and I used it about once or twice and then, like  like, I used it for about"
Hi there.

Or er
"We've got, you know the"
"All the worst stuff comes at the start of next year   electro-magnetic induction, electron physics,stuff, all the shitty stuff I think"
course but
"Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams."
All right.
Did you watch that animated version that you recorded.
Yeah.
Does it give you the gist of the story?
"It,half an hour long."
Well I think it's longer than half an hour.
They probably should
an hour at the most.
Given you er  erm
The film is about hour and five minutes.
You can probably have a video of it as long  of another version.
Well it's does help to see different  versions because  you see that different people interpret the
Why do you
Mm?
"Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got  different ways of doing it."
When I was studying  I went to  Open Air Theatre  and  I saw  a version there  on Christopher  er what's his name  that chubby fellow with the glasses  Christopher Biggins that's it.
"He was playing Puck  and when I went to see the  Company  doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er  a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"They did it in a completely  slapstick farce way  you know th the men who were dressed up  women they  balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite  different."
How they
"Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of  of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would  would have a different way of doing it."
Okay.
There's a comedienne  erm  she apparently was born in Wales.
Mhm.
Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her.
Two Ton Tessie?
"She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from  quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had  might well have had a Welsh  nurse."
So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy.
Mm.
"She did it as she would have  thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that."
Mm.
And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet
"Get down, get down oh yeah, yeah."
I got through quite a few bits and pieces that was
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do
"Yeah, yeah"
Yes I know
Hello there
Good afternoon
how's the family?
Abnormal
"Yeah   At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and"
"I noticed the little girl with her, yes."
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today
Huh
"said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever  said I'm in a hurry  then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er"
Who you don't know from Adam
"A spaniel  which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T"
Off the lead like?
"Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide"
then he was watching him like this then he ran
Away from it or
"ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know"
"I said he  he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one"
"Spaniel , yeah."
"he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning  on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches"
Stitches
"so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know"
Mm
stop him getting dirt
keep going
in it or whatever
Yeah
And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress.
"Now I don't what Italy and those  Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn."
Mhm.
But  the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress.
"Yeah, I mean  now plays  of  Shakespeare and  they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing  well either First or Second World War  uniforms."
Yes.
It was very different then.
"Yeah, well it's just different  directors have different  things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or  they think that using a certain  well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will  will have more of an impact, you know will"
"One thing I was wondering about you know they  they talk about erm  in  Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the  the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used."
Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature
Yes.
"Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it."
Does that help with it?
I suppose
Pardon?
Well you should do.
And what about  I bought some  revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature
Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing  Romeo and Juliet.
So if you look in those you may find there's some help there.
Yeah.
"Come in, good morning."
"Hello, well what's your mum been doing to you this morning ?"
.

"the apocalypse and all the people  atheists and   one where ah the Christians, Christians over there please   well I'm sorry to tell you but the jews were right"
Er do you remember the one where ?
"No, he'd gone up to the traffic lights and this cyclist sort of like cycled up, jumped off his bike and wheeled it round the corner so he"
"Yeah, he jumps out"
I like the one  car park
Yeah he got trapped in a car park and he couldn't get out for ages and ages and then as he got out he crashed into another car.
"Ah that's, that's it there."
Well did you see the one where he's getting changed
What's that?
he was getting changed in the car and he put a brick on the pedal and all
"Yes, yes he was going to work and he put the brick on the pedal while he's  jumped in the back pulling on his trousers  and st st steering with"
And cleaning his teeth
steering with his foot.
He gets into the back seat and he's got his feet over the fr the front seat steering with his foot
"Ah that's the same one he's making a lunch or something in, in the park"
Yeah.
The bit where he's on the beach
he's just down to the beach
Yeah.
"and there's this guy sitting  sitting beside him, you know sunbathing and stuff, and er  he doesn't know what to do"
Oh the teacher told us this one.
"he sticks, he sticks the, the"
Trunks.
"the trunks on top of his trousers, unbuttons himself and pulls them down, and he gets, he's er really, really awkward the way he does it and all the rest of it and gets, he finally gets his trousers off, pulls up his er trunks and your man gets up, pulls off his towel, gets out his white stick and"
"Oh he, he went swimming one time and that was pretty good"
"I can't remember what that bit was, I think he just stood on top"
"Yes he crawled, crawled to the edge of the"
Oh that's right and then this wee kid got up and jumped off didn't he?
So  that's the next stage.
Go.

Well my name is er Mr Laurence  er o of the Treasurer of the  in Edinburgh area.
And erm what was your date of birth?
"My date of birth was the thirty first of the, of the seventh, O nine."
Which makes me now approximately seventy six years of age.

"What I remember of the housing conditions when I was then residing in Motherwell, a mining er community."
And known that particular time as the steel town of Scotland.
Was erm the whole town taken up with these sort of two occupations?
"Yes, it was all mining and steelworks."
Was all .
"In fact the Ravenscraig, present Ravenscraig was built up on the first place from a steelworks known then as Corral Steelworks."
Mhm.
"And D L Steelworks and Lanarkshire Steelworks, these er steelworks, all amalgamated which is now known as the Ravenscraig Steelworks."
Mhm.

"There was no, all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to, had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate, that was the only certificate issued in those days."
A qualifying certificate.
Er how old were you when you left the school?
I was er four I left the school at fourteen years of age and I was down the pit the following day.
The following day?
Mm.
What do you remember about working in the pit?
Well the working in the pit and the first and the first time I went down the pit er the pit was er John Watson's number four colliery in Motherwell.
And er I went with my dad and got into the cage which takes you down to the pit bottom and er er er immediately the cage left the surface it just dropped like a stone and I myself was frightened that the bottom of the cage collapsed completely.
Because my stomach come up and met my heart

"Er you probably don't do it  erm  you know er so brazenly probably the back of your mind but again key staff, you are key staff er yeah if you actually prepare somebody to take over your job when you're not there sort of thing."
So in a way it's a succession plan.

Now controversial stuff here in the Sporting Life David Ashforth.
Now Jerry Bailey the man who rode Ah Kong This is at a press conference after the Breeders' Cup.
Jerry Bailey typically articulate was being asked about his success on Ah Kong He described how he had moved alongside a European ridden horse.
He didn't know which one it was he just knew it wa was a European rider.
How did he know that?
The Americans all sniggered.
Bailey smirked a bit.
Well he replied he was kind of flopping about.
And everyone laughed.
Well all the Americans did.
We didn't.
That was Walter Swinburne he was talking about.
"And Bailey's comments are backed up by the trainer Derek Meredith who says American jockeys are better, they ride closer to the horse they're neater and they are stronger too."
There was a warm hum of approval from the American hacks.
"You were there John, what did you think of all that ?"
I wasn't part of the warm hum of approval
I don't suppose so.
and Mr Meredith was a failed jockey in England.
He ended up riding a few jumpers in France so its erm although he's a good trainer now I don't think he's an authority and it's poppycock er frankly.
But when  appear over here they're a great success.
Is there anything in it?
Oh of course they're of course they are a great success.
They are top class jockeys.
But our top class jockeys in America do not flop about they use a slightly different style.
Admittedly they're a little bit less streamlined but if you're going to say that that makes a serious difference
but what's the difference in the courses
as well over here that our our guys have to cope with.
true
The tracks in America okay we go over there and we say they're tight they're quite difficult to ride.
"There's nothing like an Epsom, there's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with"
Yes.
"Then John,, said well didn't you ask her this morning then!"
And Joan says oh no I forgot!
"Well   and even that didn't jog his memory, that he should have asked her to judge it!"
What a dozy !
You know
Who's judging it then?
"Well Mary  going to judge it and, would he let her do it on her own, no  he followed her round, making comments here, making comments there, trying to influence her  fact is, this'll make you laugh, you know the wall displays  you know th erm the books, Where's Wally   Where's Wally  you have this  page, of really tiny little things and you have to find Wally, who's  a person, right?"
Yeah.
"In minute detail, hidden on the page is something, you remember how Simon had books like that"
Yeah.
"In where's Lisa, Where's Freddie, anyway it's Where's Wally, for that  he said er  I think I'll get a picture of somebody  and er course he   I said you gonna call it Where's Wally?"
He said no I'm wanna call it Where's the Wally!
"Milly said  cos we'd been talking about this all day and they, the children had been saying to John  you gonna have a picture of yourself in Where's the Wally thing?"
And erm  Milly said ha can't think of a more suitable candidate  and swept off !

"Erm but obviously there's er a, a need, the need to advise the project engineer, and the project manager, erm following the possession."
"Can I, can I raise a small point on that?"
That is
Mm.
"a number of my staff have repeatedly asked me the question, what is a project engineer?"
"And I've told them what a B E S one is and they said, why?"
Why are works ones different then?
"Maybe just locally, at local garages but as far as, far as being the all national or anything like that, there was never  anything I  with the tramcars."
"Were the erm the relations with the bosses and the workers quite good, on the ?"
"Very good, very good."
Oh.
"Even with the inspectors too, there was always a good er  going with the, the people in those days."
Mhm.
And was this quite a well paid job?
"Well it erm it was average, it was average."
Yes.
And er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that?
Oh yes.
Ex exactly the same as  going to the present day.
You had the split shifts and the down shifts and maybe we were called for er a
"What did you do after you left, you left the trams?"
After I left the trams then er I went er I went away to East Kilbride.
I used to work for a certain er c er creamery there.
Er
"getting milk, separating milk er pasteurizing milk and  like that."
Was East Kilbride one of the erm one of the new towns?
"it was er now it was, now at the start of the new town er present East Kilbride a new town, it was known as a new town and it was just starting to build up."
And I had better chances of getting a proper house for myself and my family which was then two daughters and my wife and I.
So we actually went there to better ourselves and try and get a h a reasonable house to sort of live in and
Was there a lot of encouragement given to people to move out  premises?
"Oh yes, at that time there was, yes."
Oh yes.
If they accepted it of course.
"Was it er easy finding a job at that time as well, in the, in the new towns?"
Oh yes.
"It was being that the, the Rolls Royce  Saturday, came in to East Kilbride and, and American firms like that were coming along."
Singer sewing machines and sort of things like that.
"They were all coming into East Kilbride, there was b cos after all there was starting off a new town and they was building up then from it."
What were the erm conditions like in the creamery where you worked?
"today, somewhere  never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you  Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash"
Right I'm going to work in the workshop
"I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it."
You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it?
"Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two"
"Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?"
Or
No.
"Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?"
Let's turn that down
Can't turn it out.
Power isn't it?
"Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you?"
I don't know
Use your
Fantastic that

"I'm looking for something somewhere   Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh  Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you  it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a"
No
See how she goes.
Erm
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them
"Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood."
Possibly have
stones
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the
"Oh  I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for"

"Mm, and it"

"Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?"
Eleven or twelve wasn't he?
It just cannot work every time.
Right.
"The on the, the, the, the procedures should be flexible er written in such a flexible way"
Yeah.
that those idiosyncrasies of the different sections can be accommodated.
Th they should reflect the best practice shouldn't they?
Yes.
"The best practice in, sometimes in M and E is, is quite different from the best practice in the"
Mm.
civils.
Right.
Le okay.
"We can talk genera generalities till the, the cows come home."
"I believe that, that that procedure could apply to you the same as it can to Roger and Terry"
Yeah.
and Dennis and Alan.
"Er and if, if y if there is a resource problem then you David and I need to address that"
Mm.
erm and find a solution.
"If when we address it we find that th the procedure is inappropriate, then we should change the procedure."
I agree with you .
Mm?
Yeah.
Okay?
"Er D two stop three, receipt of appointment contracts."
"Erm what we're trying to do here is to get the clerical sections more involved in the projects, and in passing the paper backwards and forwards."
"Er and we're identifying that the clerical sections are required to do a certain number of things when the project arrives, like erm recording the project in the index book, creating a correspondence file, creating project admin wallets, and the like."
So it's sort of er three things we're trying to do there.
"What, what was the reference of the urgent work one?"
"I, I've got that down as D two point three"
Was it three point two?
Mm.
And there used to be a a lean to just there.
That doorway is still there.
"C C eighteen sixty seven, Charles ."
"Er it's not the date the place was built, it's the date it er the last time that that particular area was erm rebuilt."
"They had a number of fires over the years at  's Mill, er and one was in eighteen sixty six or sixty seven."
Erm and er that rebuilding was the was when erm that part of the job was er was done.
There's a picture that I obtained from actually Ruth  who was who was a Miss .
"Erm and it shows it's the twenty I think it's the twenty second or twenty third I've got it at home, er of October nineteen fourteen, this."
"Erm and it's the the livery of the first full load of coal, into round the back of the er  's Mill, erm and there's there's fifteen eight ton  Railway wagons there, full of coal, just erm coming."
"And it's an  twelve twenty seven, Railway, M R on the front as as standard."
"And er bit misty, but that's looking out from the signal box, you can just, possibly just about make out there, and at the back erm the er er with the the erm station master's house etcetera."
"Er that was taken out I say in in due course,"
"but erm er I think that er that picture I borrowed, I mean with her permission of course, erm and er I think it was hung up in the bathroom or somewhere, which was not the best place for a photograph to be really."
"And so I took  with I say with her blessing, took a er a picture of it for posterity."
". Erm that's a er rather nice picture, erm which has never been published, not at the moment anyhow."
"Erm and it was one that erm er Mr  gave me, many years ago when I was involved with the  Cricket Club, about nineteen seventy seven I think it was."
"He knew I was interested in railways and his grand grandfather I think, or uncle was er  photographer of the town."
And this was a photograph erm taken from the roof of the engine shed.
And about er I'd guess about nineteen nineteen.
Nineteen twenty perhaps.
And you're looking up towards .
I don't know why I'm not really using this er this pointer.
Well perhaps cos you can't see it.
Erm the er  Arms over there.
The cattle dock here.
"Er a loading gauge just here, to ensure that er anything coming out of that er er that had been loaded in the goods shed was not erm overloaded, and likely to hit tunnels and bridges and so on."
"There's the wagon turntable, that we mentioned."
That end loading er and ramp at er the end.
That's a er that's a  Railway horsebox there.
Erm and the line running into the goods shed there.
Erm you've got er fire buckets on the end.
"Er a warning not to trespass or something,careful about that."
Alright.
I'll give you something to
"I'm going tomorrow morning there anyway cos Roy's just given me a call, they've got some problems with  screw support bearings locking up, but er I'll go over there some time"
Right.
.
Yeah .
Yeah.
.
So I'll  Sally .
"Okay, is that happiness?"
"Right, yeah okay."
Erm just the  one's me main concern.
I mean the others you know it's it's what we get and and  sort of thing.
With them it's it's yeah.
Mm.
Erm I'm not happy with them and I don't know how you get round it .
Knowing what's happening there.
Well er at the end of the day it may be one that we're gonna we're gonna lose but erm
Mm.
If it is
Love the ultimate four letter word and were about to use it all over your television screen.
"Where do you start with love, every body wants to love, every body wants to be loved, every one at some time or another is disappointed by love and while its difficult sometimes talking about it not talking about it can have some really serious consequences, so let's try to get to the heart of it tonight, one hundred women are prepared to share their wisdom if not their secrets, I'd like to start off by seeing if we can differentiate between loving and being in love."
"Have you ever been in love?, are you now?, button one for yes, button two for no  and in this hundred, woof ninety three people have been in love, what, what happened?,"
"I mean what, what how did you know you were in love?"
"How did you know that was, that, that was what it was?, yes"
Temporary madness
can
only temporary
"er, well it does wear off you can't, you can't, you can't"
sustain it indefinitely
"and what, what were the symptoms in your case?"
And the  where the meeting of the day is at Lingfield Park.
First race there twelve twenty because there are eight races so an action-packed good value afternoon there.
An eighth of an inch of rain overnight but that shouldn't make any difference at all but a wet windy day.
No reported hazards.
Doesn't look a brilliant day does it weatherwise at the races  clouds.
Wetherby by the way  Tuesday third annual charity meeting in aid of the International Spinal Research Trust.
It's on Tuesday sixteenth of November.
A lot of local people have certainly er given generously so should be a good day's racing.
Always is at Wetherby if you can win there you can win anywhere.
But what about the guy who's won the Channel Four champion tipster competition for last week?
Let me first of all give you his name and I'll tell you what this guy's damn brilliant.
It is Robert  from  road in  in Oxfordshire who got an amazing a hundred and thirty points.
Now I say amazing let's just see where he got his winners.
"Now  that okay no problems there,second and third but look at this, he gave the first second and third and they didn't even have a handicap."
"Er the  Looking for a Rainbow, Flight Lieutenant, all skill of course, well you deserve that."
Well done Robert  and you get five hundred pounds.
We'll have another champion tipster competition in a fortnight here on Channel Four which will be coming from Newcastle.
Now let's test your turf knowledge as we go into the commercial break.
This er turf trivia today has been sent in by S  who comes from Great Lumley in County Down.
Know it well.
"He asks quite simply  with which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson Gold Cup four years running in nineteen sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one?"
You get scratching those  heads and I'll give you the answer in three minutes from now.
Okay did you get it right?
"With which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson in sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one four years running."
"They were  Jupiter Boy, Gay Trip, Chatham and Gay Trip again."
What an incredible performance that was.
Three different horses won it four years running.
The late and much missed Fred Rival By the way I saw Mercy at the horse of the year show a few weeks ago.
Still looking as good as ever.
"Erm  non runners, non runners there were three in so far, two of them were at Cheltenham."
They are Far Senior in the first in the twelve fifty and Panto Prince did not run in the Mackeson at two o'clock.
And Canderbill is out of the one fifteen at Nottingham.
"I I wrote to Atkins saying as Minister for the Environment er, Please support the energy conversation bill because it's dead good."
Presumably I can also write to John Gummer saying  is dead good.
Am I right to write to the others saying I or should
Oh yeah.
"I write to Gerry  saying say, Please prod Robert Atkins and remind him that the energy conservation bill's dead good in case he's forgotten."
Erm no I think the former I think the Parliamentary
But I can write to him in his capacity as Robert Atkins' Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Yes.
Cos otherwise it looks like writing to random M Ps.
I think you're sort of drawing drawing their attention to the public concern over that sort of phrase.
And widespread  cross party support.
Yes.
Honest guv.
wishy-washy statements for your audience.
I presume getting letters out is more important than high quality prose here is it?
Oh yes.
Just a couple
Cos I mean
of lines will do.
name name dropping the supporters I mean for to those Tories telling them that the that the association for county councils for example is a backer probably counts more than telling them that that   is a backer .
Yeah well I think particularly
or green particularly
doing their own I just take the letters I've already written to other people change one sentence and change the er name on
That's fine so
comrade.
Printed off on my er employer's er computer and er put it in one of their envelopes and try to steal a stamp from them.
We're gonna get it all down Andy don't worry.
How wide is the Green Party's main bill associated with  do you think?
Well in the main lobbyist has been Ron  who's the who's our elected campaigns officers and he's quite literally been spending time treading the the hallowed halls of Westminster
I mean in the media.
In the media I mean I haven't seen much about it in the media.
Er
Matters arising proposed and seconded that they be accepted  recommendations
"Yeah  no no, because there was no matters arising."
Just put that on so you can  proposing and seconding .
"Confusing, isn't it?"
"No, not really!"
Right
Secretary's report
Can we have the secretary's report.
Yeah.
"Erm  secretary's report, it's much the same as last year  er, we had two trips  this year  two coach trips  one to the Yorkshire Aquarist Festival in Ap was it April?"
"I think it was April, wasn't it?"
And one to the British Aquarist Festival in October.
"They were both enjoyable  erm  I can't really say which I enjoyed the most  er, I thought they were both very good  and of course good value for the money  because they don't charge very much for the fares  well I don't think they do."
"Erm  then we had the  three-way inter-club  table show  with Hulton and Skelmersdale and St Helens  erm  the first one was  St Helens  and that was the only  wasn't it, about April  and we won that  we, we  it was a whitewash really, wasn't it?"
"Erm  then we had one at Sk Hulton in July  and we won that  er, not quite as much of a whitewash was it?"
Nevertheless we won handsomely.
And the third one was at Skelm
Which was not organized because we don't know anyone
"which was   we don't know who won  we don't know what the score was but we think that   but we're, we're assuming that that's because they bring out all their secret showmen  who don't sh travel  they have a little core, hard core of  that don't travel  but they, they bring them out"
"they bring them out at their own table shows and, and it's"
Appropriate that we should  that much
Well that appears to be so .
I never cared for results  never cared for results at all.
Robert is
We never saw a fish either.
No.
"I don't think erm  on reflection, I don't think that a three-way table show is a good thing."
"I would prefer to see an inter-club with Skelm and an inter-club with Hulton I think they get too big, two clubs is too difficult to organize when there's three  cos you, you're getting  it's not , it's the"
It's not that   the show secretary was er  at  club  had not done his job.
At Skelmersdale?
Yeah.
I mean he's in the auction when he should be with them  writing the labels.
"I'm no longer, yes."
"The next, the next question is is jealousy another powerful promoter of family black sheep."
I'm not quite sure what that means.
Is is is is jealousy another power promoter of family black sheep.
"It is jealousy that pushes people into being  black sheep, into er doing something which is not acceptable."
"Yes, I think it can  part of it."
Mm.
Mm.
"You know one sees, rightly or wrongly, that the other one is having preferential treatment."
"Yeah, yeah."
And getting attention seeking.
"It could well have been the jealousy of the older brother, what caused him to be thought of as a black sheep."
"Black sheep, yes, yeah  So jealousy is quite powerful, could could be the driving force, between sons, yes."
sons.
In those days when there's land expected.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"This, by the way, erm, it it is applied with this study, and that is during the thirties, particularly on the, well it it actually carried on into the forties, but but the, there was a almost a  character in many plays, where one one character was, in effect, the family black sheep."
"Erm, there was  in Eden End, erm, there was another character in erm,there was a further one in"
"Oh, yes."
Yeah.
"Now, all these were black sheep, they were the nicest of the lot, and there was no, they were the ones you turned to, if you wanted to discuss your troubles."
"Not the other respectable brigade, and indeed in Eden End, the whole play turns on the jealousy of the sister, who remained at home."
Mm.
"The the family black sheep, the other sister went, er, er, left home to go on the stage."
"But of course, when she came back, all sorts of things began to happen, that's by the way."
"One other little point, in Brideshead Revisited, there's a character who never appears, she's always spoken about, and thwarted and that is  the man who Brideshead marries, and she says, talking to Julia, Julie was no better than she should have been."
"You know, she says, in every Catholic family, er, there is always a relapse person, and it's usually the nicest."
Aw.
Mm.
So even Evelyn Waugh's  told this story.
"Yes,"
"Yes, yes, yeah."
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got
Hold on.
Wha how  where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.
"There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals."
"And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a proggie mat exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat
Well
exhibition?
"well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it."
And various other art things.
"But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden  up."
"But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital."
"But then I thought, perhaps  if  that"
I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here
Well they won't
to go Ashington Hospital to do a
"they won't so the they, they"
garden.
"the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all"
No.
to pay for that.
I would expect
But then
that's a very low priority.
"well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing."
They won't get the money.
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming.
"But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see."
I saw him around two weeks ago at Wetherby and er I think he'll run well.
He was ten to one earlier in the week and the rain will have helped.
Yes I mean if it if it does go to good to soft he will like the ground.
There's a couple in there that would prefer it faster.
Mm.
Erm but at that sort of price I think he's opposable.
Well let's see what we can oppose him with.
"Bradley Star is a very nice horse he's a classy performer this one, Josh Gifford's horses are in tremendous form and I was talking to the man who who rides him Deckland Murphy he's my next door neighbour he thinks he'll run a big race."
"He would be my pick I must say, of them  He's he's"
The trouble is he's run he's run some marvellous races but somehow when it comes to the crunch and er in in in better class races he just gets just gets beat.
He loves Cheltenham though I mean he's had four firsts and a second
"Erm, he's only won I admit"
yeah
he's only once been beaten at Cheltenham .
Erm another I know er I've spoken to Deckland Murphy as well being the Newmarket's jumps jockey and erm they think he's the Gold Cup horse well if he is he's gonna have to put in a good performance today then I'd stick with him.
Think he's gonna win?
Yeah exactly.
It's a it's a very very good race this and one of the good horses is a horse called General Idea.
Now what a training performance this would be if this horse could win because he's trained by Dermott Wilde and do you remember ten days ago he sent out Vintage Crop to win the Melbourne Cup down in Australia.
Well the word from Ireland this week is that this horse is jumping out of its skin.
The only problem is that the ground now might well have gone against this horse.
But he did win the Galway Plate earlier this summer.
This is fast ground
At Galway and that's the problem with General Idea as you say Derek er if it gets softer like at Cheltenham that will be very much against him.
But er it doesn't look like a steeplechase but  it is in fact
a two mile  steeplechase the Galway Plate and General Idea running really well from  and  Express  but the ground's the problem.
and lighter weight as well last year and has more weight today so he's had he would have had to have improved about four or five pounds to win today?
That's right.
And there's very li very little between him and er the the other ex-Irish horse Second Schedule.
Exactly.
Well let's have a look we've got er Second Schedule.
Now he's recently joined David Nicholson's stable.
How you going to know exactly where the boundaries go or i in between some land-lock countries  that you got it in the right position
How many land-lock countries are there in South America?
"Well enough anyway, I mean I thought you were giving me something easier to do not"
Well I think  why would you do it tonight if I didn't have it?
Yes
Say I didn't have it tomorrow you'd
well
do it tonight?
probably ni or tomorrow I was gonna do that.
"I seem to think you should take the easy bit, cos that's gonna be miles too hard!"
"No I like to balance it, I ju there's some balance there, there's some easy ones and some hard ones."
I'll tell you what's best for Michael.
I don't feel that's very good  because you're just gonna get children totally pull out of it unless they're
No.
really really good.
Children are allowed to go
"You find that if if if i in a team, if there's teams  i you find that in a singles, but if there's a team e if everybody feels the everybody feels they can contribute something to it  when you've got"
You can have those
"allowed to be the idea of that, you don't wanna make it"
Yeah I know
too easy
No there are no husbands allowed to be with any wife  and children can attach themselves to which group they want.
"So work out the groups, you work out the groups."
Well there's going to be  apart from your father there's going to be seven adults.
"Listen, a man with a woman  but not wi not  by marriage  cos say like Andy with Nanna"
"Well I could go with two children, I expect."
"Well write down the names let's have a go at, let's work out, let's work out the teams"
"Cos I'm the cleverest person, I can go with two teenies!"
"lo , write down the names."
Modest!
No and I could be the only adult with two children cos I'm so clever.
Write down the names and th work out some balanced teams then for me please.
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that
Oh easily
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it?
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water
And water
"erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole"
Yes
so if you just put the
well
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere
Yeah
"I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it?"
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee
"Hello, hello, hello"
if he's on there just shout at him will you because
oh he's in here
he's by the radiator aren't you beaut?
"He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you?"
"Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is  it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it."
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes
"one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document"
Yeah
"to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along"
Personally I would of
Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it?
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical
"you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see"
Oh
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that
"oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it?"
.
"Yes, I I think, in cer in in most cases that would happen, wouldn't it, if if if the child starts off with a feeling of insecurity, with possible instability."
Mm.
Then a powerful father is going to make the situation  worse.
Because him being the only son.
Mm.
"He was probably spoilt by his sisters, and and got more or less what he wanted as a child, and"
As a child.
"Carried on  you know, what I want, I get."
Mm.
in adulthood.
"What is this, thirty, thirty, how old was he, thirty-one when he died."
Thirty-one.
"Oh, yes."
"Thirty-one very very young age, for someone, apparently so so talented to die."
Think there were drugs as well as the drink.
"Oh well, that"
"Yes, yes, yes, yeah."
"Not mentioned there, but doubtless."
"That is, that is true."
"Okay, the next thing, erm, accurate or not, Trevor and I have already sa erm, talked about this, erm, many an Adult School members will remember the enthusiasm and popularity that surrounded the future Edward the eighth, when he was Prince of Wales."
"Prince of Wales it is suggested erm, was a black sheep of the family."
"Here it was thought, was a man who understood the people and  for them."
"Someone with a genuine concern for the wounded of World War One, the miners of South Wales, the unemployed, for, and homeless in general."
"In slightly less than a year, citizens high expectations had been shattered and it was all over."
"As John Parker put it, in the King of Fools, he had it all, wealth, charm, good looks, and he threw it all away on an American divorcee, who even his closest advisers considered an adventuress."
On the folly of his Nazis connections.
"On the absurdity of his get rich quick schemes, which involved him with shady financiers."
Why?
"This much travelled man, with all of his promise was at best, a controversial figure, and at worst a family black sheep."
"He could have said with Hamlet, The Time is Out of Joint, and Cursed Spit that Ever I was Born to Set it Right."
"Edward, known as David to his family, did not want the role of Kingship, but then, neither did his brother Bertie."
What does against animal testing mean?
These are the kind of things that are actually on cosmetic products.
Mm.
"It could mean, erm, against animal testing but I go along with it anyway."
"It could mean erm  cruelty free, er erm who de defines in that case, what cruelty is?"
"Er, not, not tested on animals might mean, by me  by but by someone else!"
And it all sells products!
"And, beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er, trying to put forward an E C  erm, directive on th er, the labelling of cosmetics, but it's very, very difficult!"
"And, mainly because of those kind of problems."
Yeah.
Yep.
"What do you mean by  erm, not tested on animals?"
The finished product?
The ingredient?
Ingredients are tested for other reasons too  not necessarily just for the cosmetic and toiletry trade.
"I think that one of the outstanding erm  criticisms that I would make  of the whole programme, in research with animals, is the fact that only two licences have been revoked I think you said"
Mhm.
"on  now, I think it's a bit like factory inspectors, and I talk from experience on this, er  th o i me , everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors"
Mhm.
arrive!
"If you report something you always get the same reply, nothing wrong when we went round!"
Mm.
"I'd like to move with th er, I I think tha wi given wi , though we haven't got all that much time, can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm  the use of animals in recreation and er  Lisa particularly mentioned hunting, now, she thinks hunting should be banned, do you?"
Do you think hunting animals should be banned?
"Various animals that  hunted in this country, foxes, in some places deer, hares are coursed er in some places."
Well well!
There's an interesting result!
"Seventy nine of you think yes, hunting should be banned."
"For the minority, twenty one say, no."
Would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no?
Yes?
"Well I I so , should er  be unhappy to see the, the the red-coated huntsmen  a an abolished scenario."
as the dances are concerned.
And another thing is the young ones don't dance.
They can
Do you mean by young ones my generation ?
"I mean , yes, well maybe you can but I do but the the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like Carl and them, they can disco but they they can't waltz or  er foxtrot or"
How did you learn to waltz then?
"Just by going to dances, just by going to dances, we just, you just picked it up, your your partner could do it and you just learnt from there."
Mhm.
That's one thing I've always been a quick learner which has been quite
Mhm.
I think Jane's got  er that as well.
She seem to be able to pick thing sup.
Does she like dancing?
Not as fa not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up.
Mhm.
"It was the same in the the pantomimes when Lily has learnt learnt the dancing, I could er after she had showed us about twice I could I could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps."
So it's quite an advantage.
So did you go to dances quite a lot before you were married  ?
Oh yes in  aye.
Was that the place where everybody went to
To the Town Hall.
young lads and lasses would get together ?
"Lasses would yes, aye, to the dances."
"And they used to run  er buses to different places, you know, you used to go to different places, and ."
And what kind of band played for the dances when you were in  then?
"Bands like what Tommy has, you know accordion bands."
That er they were all more or less that kind of band.
So by the time you came here it would mostly just be Tommy that was playing?
"Roundabouts, er the only one I can remember is Tommy round about, you know playing er in the Hall."
"And , it was just these kind of bands that"
Mhm.
"were in those days, the accordion bands."
"Thanks, bye bye."
You can stay of course!
Don't blame you!
Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business.
Do you all have sight of that?
"It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para."
"2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you."
Are you agreed?
Agreed.
So that we can get on with this work.
Thank you very much indeed.
On to item six and seven.
You'll remember we do this on an annual basis.
It's very efficiently organised for us to do.
"We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers."
"Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford."
"Thanks, Chair."
"Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair."
"This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,"
She does?
She's one of the members you can come to.
So Katherine can answer the details on the report.
Right.
"Welcome, Katherine."
I didn't realize that's who you are.
I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes!
"So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage?"
"I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford."
Right
That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention.
"So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag."
"Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford."
going on.
"that falls down Hugh, is that people assume because they've commented that, that when it comes out in its final version it'll reflect their particular comment."
"They never get a feedback saying, thanks for those comments but I've  those because, because I thought somebody else's"
comments were more
a lot more slice .
No.
No.
"Not not, not"
It's just a modification from
Yeah.
the slices
"L lots of the revisions are not sliced and certainly in, in cases like this where"
Mm.
it is a er er a specific
Direct.
"request or a direct request that something is changed, then it"
is given to in this particular case the Dave  s of the world or other function heads and told
I would still like to issue
that.
"Er a and I think we issue it and then t in Jim's situation, erm I think what you tell your staff is that this, this has been issued, and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization."
Or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look.
"Well surely it, it just means that in in Jim's organization"
"I, I don't see the problem."
that when specifically requested w will apply in
in ninety nine percent of the cases.
That will be reflected in the quality plan anyway.
So
Yeah.
where's
Yes.
the problem?
Mm.
"Well I can draw the E I P to a close, sorry?"
Why?
Do we?
"Mr Mr Donson, yes, oh that's right, we posed a question to you on the elephant analogy."
What is the equivalent on affordable housing?
"I thinking about it over erm er coffee sir, I I I think the answer is an adder erm because its smaller than an elephant, it's indigenous to the United Kingdom, it blends into the landscape, but if you ignore it it could be just as injurious to your health."
Excellent.
.
Well with that I think I can draw the E I P to a close .
Can I say it it's er we've had a a good day from my point of view anyway.
"Erm some days have been better than others but I I I have in retrospect enjoyed it,heartbroke though it is."
"Er and from our point of view er erm the panel, erm this is only the end of the beginning for us because we've got a lot of other work to do."
Er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions.
"I'm also particularly grateful for, and I said yesterday, to our two friends in the right hand corner here who've er done some sterling work."
I'm grateful to North Yorkshire and through you to the Strensall people for the arrangements and the use of the Village Hall and I think I must commend Mr Whipp for his fortitude through the last week or so.
Because even if he wasn't participating he was sitting listening.
Thank you very much.
"Chairman before before you do finally er pack your bag and zoom off back to wherever it is you're going, could I on behalf of the county council and all of our participants here today and those who've been around in the last fortnight thank you and Miss Whittaker and your assistant able assistants er Mrs Binns and Dave  in the programme office for the sterling work they've done."
And for making the E I P erm an interesting and er fortnight and I think er commending on the way that you er and your colleagues have handled it er all the way through and er we hope that er at the end of the day we'll get something back from you fairly quickly which er we'll act upon.
I won't promise
Thank you very much Chairman.
I shan't promise before Christmas..
Hiya.
Hello.
Oh oh here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.
Well Miss  come and have your head cut off.
Erm
She's got asthma.
Right.
Mhm.
right okay what sort of.
Do you make presentations now?
meetings
yep so it's it's about meetings?
yep
"great, thanks, Tom"
"erm, my name's   from Edinburgh a couple of jobs  one which is  the sort of presentations I do tends to be one to one  the hardest one for me as I say meetings with quite a lot of people there"
right
"erm, I think I want to try and improve my presentation"
"right, so it's the actual presentation skills themselves"
that's right
and what we actually do when we're standing up so that it becomes more effective yeah?
Great.
my name's  I'm from Tarmac Construction Plant at  depot  I'm office manager and I'm also in charge of the stores hiring all the plant and equipment for all the sites in our area
right
I also  as many stores as possible
of course
erm I don't make presentations as such but erm I do have one to one discussions with on the sites on what plant they need and stores
"right, yep"
basically I hope to be more  effective in talking to  as I can
"right, so it's about persuasion isn't it?"
yeah
"right,Mike"
"I'm  I'm a site agent for Tarmac Construction at  erm I attend quite a few erm presentations really, tender interviews often going to the clients management meetings, site meetings and then like a lot of you the one to one situation."
sure
apart from most of those
right
erm I'd like to be able to present something in front of me which prompts me a bit better than I do at the moment I tend to get lost in what's in front of me.
"right, right so that's that's partly to do with you your preparation isn't it but it's if I put the word script"
yeah
we'll I know what we mean yep  how do you prepare what what you physically have in front of you so that you're able to put the point over effectively
"yeah right yep great, Dave"
Mm.
"There are no there were no big property owners, no big coal, I mean the colliery company only owned sixty houses, I think, which were sold to the tenants, er when the lease ran out."
W what about the the health service in Nottingham?
In  ?
Er in ?
Sorry.
Erm health service?
Erm what do you mean?
The Doctors?
Mm.
"Oh well you had er some very well loved Doctors, we had the black doctor, Dr , he was er West Indian, he took over from another one, Dr , who was also West Indian, I gathered, I never knew Dr ."
"But Dr  was a good cricketer, erm he also wrote a very You could also read what Dr  put, and he was also said that he sent people to hospital very quickly."
"Erm then there was the er  and he m Dr , and er Dr  and then it became Dr , who is still there."
"Erm Dr  was the medical officer of health, part time, and Dr  was a character, he always had a white carnation, he rode round in a carriage on occasions, and he er wrote copperplate."
"That's when I had to put these things onto dea er put death certificates into  th their the doctor's certificate into  English , erm they were pretty good,t others weren't so g , er you know, weren't so good."
"I have been accused, too, of saying that, You tell your Doctor, I'd know what you, I knew what you'd die of,because they had their own things, their own pet hobbyhorses."
"Erm myocardio degeneration and chronic bronchitis, and erm probably quite accurate, but er short of breaking your neck I think you, bronchitis was the killer, in ."
Mm.
So yo you had to fill in births and deaths certificates?
"Oh yes, I had to co copy them, and er you know, you got these things, but the registrar he was , you know, he was man."
Mm.
Have you s ?
"Did you see many changes in , over the pre-war era?"
"Yes erm  during the h the Probably one of the reasons I was set on to start with, was the tremendous amount of house building."
"I mean, John , who was a local builder, sold a house a day for five years, which is some building."
"And you can see John, whichever way you go into , you'll see John  types E and G, the semi-detached on  Road, Lane and  Road, and  Road."
You'll see them everywhere.
"And one or two people are very honest, they call the  House,because they borrowed the money from Halifax Building Society .."
What about transport in ?
Transport?
Oh well now it isn't a patch on what it was.
"Erm yo there was so many trains into Nottingham, into Victoria at twelve minutes, it took you thirty minutes into the Midland Station, having called at  and , and all sorts of places on the way."
"That is being taken to good money they say, it was the professional's choice yesterday the faces were all backing it yesterday."
"The five to one will last to the end of the ten minute guarantee at the shops, it will then go four and by the  General Pershing could be as low as seven to two or a hundred to thirty according to Ladbrokes."
Hills have had erm  each way for  Nephew and Our Margaret but the focus of the betting today with this rain coming at Cheltenham is going to be Gordon Richard's General Pershing and he's gonna go off a short price.
Is your money going to be on the favourite?
Er my money's gone on Storm Storm Alert about ten days ago at twelves and
Mm.
that's almost certainly enough to nail it to the floor I would have thought.
Are you worried that you were obviously worried about this rain as well?
Er likes it likes the ground.
It needs the ground.
Mhm.
And I've said that you know I'd rather it was on the soft but whether it will get
Yeah.
the trip or not we'll find out this afternoon.
It's gonna be a cracking good race at  too.
But what about the other race meetings today?
Let's have the early news.
Oakes.
Yes.
Wind's up.
"There's no danger of the river rising so fast  it floods the course as it sometimes does but sadly  as you can see, rain overnight and it's raining now."
And do watch out for those roadworks on the M four just by the M twenty five junction.
Well at Nottingham as well as first race twelve forty five there's a wedding.
The prospective Mr and Mrs Martin are celebrating their wedding in a private hospitality suite and as well as er entertaining their guests they're sponsoring the Andy and Tracy wedding day novelties chase.
And they have a runner in .
So all the very best to them.
"The going however whether their horse will like it or not is good from good to firm and there's a non runner in the one fifteen that's number one urgh Canderbill, there we go."
That's about a third of an inch of rain overnight and again it's gonna be wet for the rest of the day.
When you go into the course follow signs for Colic Park.
celebrating your wedding with  Chase but this is Ayr and it's the only dry spot in the British Isles.
There was no rain overnight so that the ground er is good with just a few soft places.
No hazards on the roads.
"And the same in most of our organizations in this country at the present day, and that's what's wrong."
It's holding them back.
"When you've got a left, a right and a centre, you've got three different parties within a party."
So the Labour Party got united then at that time?
"Oh definitely, very well united, yes."
Then.
"But don't forget that was just after the war and er the Labour were beginning to build up, getting things better, run better country than they were  previous p people."
Did the Labour Party gain a lot of support after the war?
"Oh yes, aye they did oh."
"Oh aye proved it, they got in."
E eventually they got into parliament.
"Erm now did your er Labour Party membership lapse after, after that time?"
Er yes it did lapse.
"Because I had seen my young brother-in-law and I says I'm gonna be like that then, didn't fe er feel any of this er at that time."
"Me,as the district council."
I couldn't see myself doing it so as I said I wasn't going to make a fool of myself by putting my name as being nominated forward er as a candidate etcetera  lose interest  that's the first thing that happened because they knew I was an outspoken bloke.
"I knew  spoke too much  next nominee, next candidate for ."
"And I felt it wasn't up to them, I didn't have enough experience I wanted to gain some more experience but it just fell away, lapse."
"And erm you're, you're not a member of the Labour Party again?"
No I'm not a member of the Labour Party yet.
Oh.
"You see the pre the present system we've got  Scottish Old Age Pensioners is non sectarian, non political."
You understand?
Is this er does that actually debar from belonging to er
"Oh I could have er er well it doesn't debar me but I feel it, it would it wouldn't be right, for me being a Labour Party member sitting on a, a non-segregated and non-political gr er ah association,"
Mhm.
"Now er you, you mentioned your, your pensions association."
"Now you're area treasurer, aren't you, for the"
"Area treasurer, er Edinburgh area"
Can you tell me a bit about the organization and what its aims
"Well the aims  I'll just read this  and this says, this gives you most ."
This   the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association.
"What a shame, never mind."
"Right, I'll put my make up on"
Can you tell me where you want this umbrella tree?
Er
it needs a saucer of course
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one
Oh but that's in
Well
plant pot  altogether
"Well, just leave it there for now."
"Erm, I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops"
It's ten o'clock
I know.
I'll have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner .
Oh my head feels .
I do I haven't had a headache like this for
I wanted a carton of live yoghurt.
"I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start it was fruit flavoured, no it wasn't it was natural, but it said mild flavoured and I don't think it was the proper like the Greek style really live yoghurt that would have started all the fungus growing on it."
It is beginning to look like a proper .
"Er, ok, I'll go and get ready"
I don't think it matters but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I've got it standing on that brick to drain.
Wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the erm stems on it look as if as if , not mouldy, but er they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put another one in
green
"Those hyacinths in the corner are taking a long time to come out, aren't they?"
"I'd have though the tulip  in the coal scuttle, the tulips in the cauldron, I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely"
"I know, but they've straightened out"
but they've grown up again.
And those forget me nots that're called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers are coming out with tiny pinky purple flowers.
"Thirty odd, thirty"
"That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around there."
"Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last year."
Makes more.
"It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments."
When you think of it.
I know.
"and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse."
Oi.
"I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know,it it's totally unfair,"
They are.
"I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it."
Yeah.
You know what I mean.
"Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're wouldn't be half and a quarter."
"I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries."
I know.
Communist countries.
"Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing."
Watch she don't bite ya.
"I mean, communism in England,"
"in it's  in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor."
I know.
"The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for al for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em."
No.
"So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo the the"
isn't it.
"poorer people, they stop 'em getting educated."
That I'm I'm almost convinced.
Yeah.
"It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you can't get educated"
"un cutting back,"
"she was nearly retired, Billy"
"she was nearly retiring by the, no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for, two or three years after we came up here, but I would be in the choir just, maybe two or three years."
And then it
And did it
"it fell the choir fell folded up ,"
Folded up and she
"Aye, oh"
retired?
There was nobody else took it on.
Was there a church choir going at that time then?
"Yes, aye there would be, just the same ladies that have s been in it for years."
"But there were men in it for quite a while, I was wondering when that kind of faded out."
Oh that was faded out before
That was a good while before
Aye before we came up here.
"I wonder if, it Mr, was it  choir or his father or something that had it, I can if I can remember somebody saying."
So what was going on in the way of entertainments and things like that when you came to  ?
When I came up to live here?
"There was quite a few dances, in er, do you mean dances in the Town Hall?"
"Ah there would be  there well just one or two, not not every week or anything like that as far as I can remember."
Just a few over the winter?
"Just aye, aye, oh they didn't have them in the in the summer, and of course in them days well the  the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and"
It's hardly worth having a dance .
It's not worth having a dance.
"But I heard the Town Hall was having one, not the Town, was it the Town Hall or Community Council having one between, I think it's the Town Hall, between Christmas and New Year and really I don't think it's worth their while  having them then."
Do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a=less dances and things then?
Do you mean the bars being op oh I think
And clubs.
I think so really
Do you think it's the main thing ?
"I think that's what's really, it's killed them  as far"
Mhm.
He should know about them shouldn't he?
"Well we must  that's why, certainly have to, before"
Could you drag him along  to a meeting?
Yeah well that's what  they said we could do that.
I'll write that down.
"Erm, is that okay for that I just have something that I read in New Scientist does everybody take it?"
No
Oh well I'll give you one to look at  it's just a little article about
Thank you.
recycling in in Egypt.
And I just liked reading it so much that I thought you'd like to read it too.
Don't have to read it now cos it's quite long.
It's it's  it's really hot  .
Cos they they reuse absolutely everything.
And they make they're living out of it.
In East German they are now drowning in rubbish because  they used to have a perfect recycling scheme  everything was collected and recycled cos they just didn't have the materials.
Now they are flooded with the West European goods  their recycling isn't worth any more.
On the other hand they haven't got the landfills and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they   I mean it's a health  hazard meanwhile.
One of the major problems they have to face.
Far East  lots of guys sort of collecting cardboard boxes and that's all they did they flatten down cardboard boxes and then another one did newspapers and whole newspapers and
The whole town is composed of a
Yeah.
it's like a big .
I just thought it was  interesting.
Erm  I did write er as was suggested asking about  erm facilities for cyclists in the potential  shopping centre development in Bishop's Stortford.
"And they are, they are interested in cyclists but from what I could make out reading this  they're not really going to help us a great deal."
If you want to pass it round and read it.
It's it's they're gonna use the green wedges that are already there and the existing footpaths which are already cycled along.
"What, what good is that to me?"
It's just  in Stortford it's not that easy for a cyclist is it?
No
And they've got all the places  say don't lean your bicycle here and you're not allowed to take it into Jackson
Yes that's right er I er believe in fact I know because the Duke says so in the Racing Post today the reason he's gone there is to get Adrian Maguire because Adrian has ridden him already in Ireland and the owner wanting to stick with Maguire which you can't blame him for
Exactly
As David Nicholson said he'll be taking orders from the jockey today instead of the other way around.
I don't imagine he says that very often.
Perhaps he's given the Duke his orders.
Oh I'd like to do that.
Now well let's have a look at this horse and another schedule because as I say he was trained in Ireland by Arthur  and er we saw them at Punchestown back in April where he finished second to another of his rivals today  Bishops Hall.
"As they come to the final fence Second Schedule being pressed by Ebony Jane and Bishops Hall on the nearside and over the last Second Schedule and Bishops Hall on the nearside, Ebony Jane in third, in fourth place is Joe White and racing into the closing stages it's Second Schedule with Bishops Hall on the nearside Graham Bradley again as they go to the line, Bishops Hall wins it for Harry , Second Schedule is second, Joe White is third, Ebony Jane four."
Bishops Hall doing it nicely under Brad and it's good to see him in the saddle today because he was offered the ride on Morley Street but he'd already said yes and he's a man of his word and he agreed to ride this horse.
And there's been a lot of hoo-ha in the Press about should be ride Morley Street or shouldn't he.
"Once you say yes you gotta stick to your word and Morley Street, good horse, but has a lot of weight today."
Lot of weight and again it's it's fences isn't it.
He'd last time tried over these he he wasn't at his best.
Erm  had a run on the flat so you know I mean I think we should be  but
"It's a it's a very bold thing of Toby Baldwin to run him in this race it seems to me, you know I mean he definitely appeared to not like  ."
Yes
It's only his third run and he's he's in the most competitive two and a half mile chase in the year.
But he oozes class and he's had a strange preparation.
You mention the flat race.
Let's let's have a look at that race.
It was at Newmarket just a couple of weeks ago.
And I can tell you he he does an an awful lot.
Here you can see him second last but making ground now.
Er My Patriarch and er is is taking the lead from Ritto who later ran so well in the Cesarovitch but just look at Morley Street now.
Here he comes past one past another past yet another into third place in the end  and that was an extraordinarily good performance.
No.
It's a very good turn of
foot for a for a jumper isn't it though ?
Very nice.
And he he very nearly won the Doncaster Cup wasn't it.
Yes I think it was the Doncaster Cup.
Yes mm.
On the deep
Oh on the deep
two or three gorges
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic
"That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and"
"Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep"
"I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new."
"I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean?"
"Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you?"
But
"Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er"
I
the sides are coming out er like this you see
"those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those"
"I, I like them"
"but, but I haven't got enough you see"
Yeah
but er
you won't get two that size will you?
"You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two"
it is a good er about one and five eighths
"Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there"
"Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of"
"Yeah, yeah"
here you see and it'll all be joined up.
"It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down"
"Mm, they're not really safe"
"Yeah,"
a band saw are you now are you?
"I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it"
Yeah
or something like that.
So you're looking for attention probably more than anything.
So attention seeking's one thing.
Have a good time.
Sorry?
To have a good time.
"Okay, you could  what, what would you be hoping to achieve during that good time?"
"Have a few laughs, what else though?"
What other things do you hope or do you think might happen shall we say?
To meet some nice people to go on holiday with.
"Right, meeting people."
Things like romance are very important with holidays.
"I mean, you all know about the image the cruiseliners have with wealthy widows and things like that."
"The Club Eighteen Thirty idea is much along similar lines, and if you look at a Club Eighteen Thirty brochure, the sort of activities people do together, bringing people together."
So this is all an important element.
Cuisine.
"Right, cuisine could be an important motivating factor."
Er basically stuffing yourself to excess for two weeks.
Drinking yourself to excess for two weeks for peanuts.
"Again, that would be something."
"But in general the people who are doing some of those things, a lot of it's probably escapism  certain type, complete break from their work."
What other things do you think you would hope to get as a result of your holiday?
Time to relax.
Right.
"Okay time to perhaps to relax, to reflect."
see various water sports
"Okay, so you can improve your prowess at windsurfing."
"And certainly there's the fitness, activity side, that can be an important motivating thing."
What else will you do on holiday?
All we've talked about so far is drinking and lying on a beach.
Sorry?
Sightseeing.
"Right, sightseeing."
"as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet  have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?"
No there's some there
Cooked?
"oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm"
what do you
erm
Are you gonna left that battery on
"well, well only temporarily, I only want this"
"it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to"
"right erm, just erm"
"It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging"
"oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?"
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom
Just down the bottom
Right  what you're going to have to do is erm
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it
"Yeah, yeah"
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
"I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it?"
"Er, well, put it on the floor"
Go in your basket go on
"Yes, I cannot give it much more"
"re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom"
"So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?"
Those four
Mm
to that section of the
"oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say"
it wouldn't split in half went for it and
Twelve inches across are they?
That way
The
I
only re yes by all means
our project quality plan check list reflects that.
.
Naturally your
Mm.
your way out is to get
"D Dave  to write a letter, saying for all projects I wish him to do"
Y no.
No.
No.
"Terry, Terry there's no point."
"All all that, all that"
That is stupid.
All that Jim's trying to do
the reason why
Is to change
"I, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way."
No.
No.
I know but
"It, it, it, it is stupid in, in so far as the more sens if we were gonna do that, all you'd do is you'd write"
the procedures in a different way.
Yeah.
The procedures
"were written in this way, because erm there was a move from a certain part of the organization to exclude the Q Ss from elements of work on an unreasonable to an unreasonable extent."
"Now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably, it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who's gonna do the site measure."
But at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct.
"These guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct, from an internal control point of view I want them to be involved in certifying that the price is correct."
That is how we came to the conclusion that they should be
"I, I, I  I certainly think there's a great deal of sense in it all."
Before we get bogged down.
"I haven't received the samples, er oh sorry I I'll moving on to what we're talking about."
The National Party are mounting a poster campaign for the elections.
For both elections which hope hopefully covers the Euros and the er locals starting at the beginning er towards the end of the local election campaign to running through to the  June.
And they said erm if you would like to see the designs write and ask for a sample so we wrote and I haven't actually received any samples yet.
But I have had a letter erm explaining where the billboards are in our area and how much they cost.
It's a very badly written letter actually.
"For one thing it starts,Dear Mrs Knightingale  which got my back up."
"Erm and then it goes on to say,Please find the enclosed the postal sites available in your area Miriam   who's the Green Party person who's organizing it  has provided the required areas and if you need any more details please don't hesitate to call me or my secretary."
And under the sites  may also  availability at the time of booking.
I look forward to hearing from you with your selections .
But introductory letter aside erm  interesting.
Can I just get clarification here?
Yes.
That letter almost sounds like we us around this table are expected to choose some of the sites.
Yeah.
We didn't just write for information as to what National Parties
"Erm well I just wrote Miriam and said, I saw your article in Green Week can you send me further details."
And this is what's happened so.
What it transpires is local parties who are interested enough get what's
Yeah.
get to try and choose site.
Right.
Erm now then it gives us a erm a price here which I think is weekly.
Because the availability columns are weekly so it makes sense that the price means weekly.
Erm and it has a number of different types W and F .
But if I run through the addresses I think it'll make sense because everybody will recognize where they are.
Erm in York Holgate Road which is twelve pounds a week.
Hundred and ten Fishergate which I think is the side of Jacksons that's fifteen pounds a week.
Erm in fact there's two there.
East Parade eighteen pounds a week.
Tang Hall Lane eighteen pounds.
"Erm and er this is coming in old Ordnance Survey map, coming in past the race course, at ."
"And er single track at the time, and running double track, and platforms either side, Erm a er wedge shape platform, nice wooden building there, another building there."
And and er er the platforms either side.
Signal box over here.
"Various sidings, er and the trains from  would come in to the left hand side of the top platform, erm and er would er go over here and and cut back and go out from this er this side."
"A little bit er  It's it's not a very good map the er Ordnance Survey map in the Nottingham Library, er local studies department."
About the best I could get off them.
Erm and I've I've obviously photographed it.
"Now there's a picture er in early B R days again, of the line coming in from  here and the very attractive in my opinion, wooden er structures, the shelter there."
"The racecourse at the back, fencing, platform here, wooden structure here, buildings erm and er you can just see the edge of er another canopy similar to that er on this side."
"This is taken from the er from a sta er from a signal box er just er over sort of where I am, er here roughly in in line."
And er well kept flower beds and so on.
"Barrow crossings here, signals and so on."
"There's another picture, now that's looking erm towards  up there, and the  branch coming in there, behind that er building."
"Very attractive, take note of what that looks like."
"A train waiting to go out go out to , er having met the er Nottingham Lincoln, or Lincoln Nottingham line which you can see just goes up the the back there."
And there's that wooden building there.
"The train having come in from , and just going er forward well I don't know erm before back to er er to ."
"I think that's an ex  carriage actually, but it makes you realize how small these things were."
"In B R days, not a very good picture, but an  B one Thompson, four six O B one on a erm probably a Birmingham  train, er real cross country."
And there's the   er in the platform there just having come in.
"Another picture er of the   not very good, but erm best I can do, best I've got."
"Again see the old wooden structures, rather nice lamps and so on."
That's what you've got now.
Don't know whether that's an improvement upon the wooden structures.
No I think not.
"That's where that rather nice, this is w this is the er the departure platform at ."
"And that's the platform arrival from Nottingham to Lincoln, on the  other side, the Lincoln to Nottingham one."
But er not terribly pretty.
There you can see that's looking up towards .
"Well the junction's gone completely, that was taken two or three years ago."
"And that's what you've got left, up there."
Mhm.
By plant well will be by plant .
Right.
"Erm M for mother four stop one, payment application by contractors."
"Erm there are quite a few in, in this series which follow the same sort of thing is that er, all projects all jobs on site er will have a quantity surveyor from Dave  's section."
Erm and will
Eh?
Nominated.
to do all the post-contract measure work.
Nominated.
Come on.
"Let's, what you're doing is you're winding them up Den."
I'm not.
I can't believe Dennis would be mischievous enough to wind anybody up on p on a subject that he's so disinterested in.
"That's, that isn't"
Yes.
Go on.
I've been told to change these procedures to.
just taken the knife out of your back.
Right.
"The project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements, normally attaining these personally."
"However when specifically requested by the project Q S, the resident engineer or the project engineer may obtain this information."
"A project Q S is responsible for agreeing all valuations and for processing all invoices for payment for physical work, and passing these to the client for payment."
So what's the change?
"Because on many jobs certainly smaller jobs, er the resident engineer or the project engineer would"
be doing the
"And normally normally they will do that and in, in the future"
Well
Yes it will.
"they can say, yeah,th the project Q S is just gonna say, measure me all"
That's right.
I haven't time to go and do that.
Well if there i if there in a
"no matter who, no matter what !"
If they're in a corrupt society  and when they get to that position they  they don't do anything about it and accept
Well they
it and take
they don't
"the bribes, well yes I agree this is the"
Yeah.
the
Yeah.
basis of the mafia isn't it?
"Ah, you see if  if you don't, I mean  it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life  but in big business and in politics  if you don't"
You have to modify your
"I'll tell you , I'll tell you how"
"No, no if you don't tow the line"
Exactly!
If you just don't
if you'd be elected
Yes  and you don't modify you  what happens?
You don't get anywhere!
You don't get elected which is what happened
Well
to the Labour government
No
last time!
"oh well, oh well apart apart from being"
No.
elected
fifty percent of the population
apart from that
"wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the  Labour government didn't get in  on that basis  so they had to modify their  and I mean as"
Well you can use that for any argument then
Yes it is.
Yeah.
To that charge Shaun David  do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Worships if I may interrupt the the this erm dispute about the  damage  which was  allegedly caused  I have mentioned it to Miss  this morning and she has  undertaken to make further enquiries.
"Erm  briefly, the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels  and Mr  denies that he broke  the second of the two, the one at the front door he says was broken  at some time earlier  on the evening on which he was involved."
"Unfortunately Miss  hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries  er, to  apportion the damage  and to take instructions as to the  the residue of what I've just said."
"It is suggested er, by both myself and er  my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week."
"Well it, it was adjourned last week for him to  with instructions your worship."
Yes we we've adjourned this case for one week  other enquiries can be made.
"So he doesn't have to, on conditional bail today?"
Well bail will be extended for one week.
"Well you know what that means Mr , you were told  this last week you will be  to surrender yourself to bail  next Tuesday at er ."
Hopefully the matter will proceed next week.
Can we go your worships?
"Yes, you can leave the court."
Case number one your worships please  Peter John .
Are you Peter John ?
That's right.
What's your date of birth?
Nineteen of the first sixty three.
What's your home address Mr ?
.
"You are charged with an offence which is contrary to section six of the road traffic act in nineteen seventy two  in  Wallby on the ninth of September  drove a motor vehicle  on  the A six seven one  Wallby by pass  having consumed alcohol  in such a quantity that the proportion of it, in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit."
Do you understand?
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Have you got your driving license with you Mr ?
"I haven't got it actually, no."
Why?
"Because, well I told the police at the time  that er  I've misplaced it  and er  my  is."
"What are you doing about getting er, a replacement?"
Well I haven't done anything at the moment because I di I didn't think it was worth it actually.
Oh here comes a nice man with er an injection.
Ah perhaps they're going to give me some vitamins.
Yes.
"And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm, I can't feel anything any more."
Yes it's it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals.
Erm we hate putting animals to sleep.
"In fact it was the Society's policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick, diseased."
Erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please please think before you get a pet.
"Why is it that in the north of England, particularly in this region of the north of England, we seem to be worse than anywhere else?"
I I don't think you are.
Now I've spent seventeen years in Hartlepool and yes that er
They hate monkeys in Hartlepool did you know that?
Found a honkey they monkey
I wasn't going to say anything the Kirkham Hotel.
they hung it.
Er yes and there's one hanging behind their door.
Er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the Society but you know since I've been down in Horsham I have found that the northeast is not alone.
There are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused.
The northeast isn't the only place.
Mm.
Ok thank you very much indeed er Chief Superintendent.
"And Pa Pat I don't think I don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say, Oh that's lovely we'll buy that for  Tommy er, and then Tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say, Well the dog was a a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself."
"May I just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy, we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on Christmas day and say to their elderly relative, We bought you a puppy."
The elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy.
Never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a captive person
Mm.
they've got to look after something.
And this is where the Society is called in er to look after that puppy.
Or just after Christmas usually between Christmas and New Year.
"We're called to waste ground, behind pet shops, a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted puppies, kittens that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before Christmas."
Good Alan thank you very much indeed.
You're very welcome.
Haven't really
local wood guides ?
Well Rob's got two
cos I'm just deciding on a new window frame.
And all the firms are claiming that they only get their hardwood from government  erm replanting programmes.
And one got a  stamp and a seal on that.
But whether that is acknowledged by our Friends of the Earth I don't know because I mean they have so many stamps and seals on
They won't give you names now will they?
The Friends of the Earth .
They won't give you names of companies any more.
"No but if this stamp, this acknowledgement."
Oh it's like a little  is it?
good government scheme or not.
Whether that is known  by Friends of the Earth as a good scheme or not.
I think  there's a day of action coming up on this sort of D I Y stuff.
so maybe we'll get some more information about that.
I'm gonna try and get the  book back from Rob.
Martin's an architect and  and it actually probably would be  you know it might be a good thing to actually sort of provoke a question with architects because they do specify these things and they're the ones who actually say  you know right we'll specify hardwood .
It's one of the decisions that are actually made by them in terms of what they use so  erm that could be something that is
Yeah
"round to architects just sort of provoking the question cos they, a lot of them have never thought about it"
Mm.
"and er  you know if they did erm I mean Martin asked about the, he asked about the good wood guide you know and I told them where they can get it but that they can have it in their office and put it in their library."
"You know so that, that's quite a good idea."
Yeah
"But that's so quickly out of date again you see the good wood  cos I mean they they have new government schemes, schemes every year don't they?"
Mm.
And new other schemes.
And
"What, at least it will enable you to know what the tropical species are because some of them have got quite weird and wonderful names and most people don't know what some of them are."
Mm.
I know mahogany is citello .
"I can't do job, it's course work, don't you understand?"
Well
"How am I suppose to copy up course work, it's my own work"
"Do, do you study that at home then?"
What?
A science or something
"Mum it's a tutor period, it means work"
Oh you'll have to work then
don't sit around for an hour doing nothing
I realise that Richard
but don't be stupid
"Look, if you've got work to copy up, why can't you study and work in"
Because he's a tutor
What do you do in it?
I have D R N L As to do
"Mm, I used to let my  when it's tutor period, get on and do some revision work"
Good grief.
"and it's much nicer it, they know what they've got to look at."
"I've got to go and see Wally in tomorrow for the forms, I ain't got any forms to fill in cos I'm officially not leaving, I'm only moving"
"That's right, that's right"
change of address
I don't know it yet
"it will be change, I can't say, is it, I mean I said it's a change of address, they know I'll probably be moved in four to six weeks"
Do get that out of your mouth please
Which is it gonna be?
I'm not signing or changing anything Richard until we have exchanged contracts
"Oh yeah, that's easy muck around do what I do"
"No Richard because the whole thing can fall through  when we have our survey done it might show a defect or something, we might pull out, when they have their survey done it might show a defect so they might pull out, you don't do anything Richard until the contracts have been exchanged, then you can start saying right I think that's, that's, every thing's definite"
Alright  we were doing company law  and
"Mm, mm"
"I was damn good I knew everything, first I had to watch the accounts and secondly I'm looking at all this stuff for when I start my business"
"Mm, mm"
This year alone.
"So if you total it up,Be er again and first of all  council  being a, being a council, and they succeeded very well."
"And  at the Leith, South Leith very very well and they just er  district council."
"Was there a lot of that sort of feeling around, that sort of protestant action"
"No no this one man this one, one man in the whole of Edinburgh district council was  protestant tax."
"What er caused them to put that for the  er group forward I could not tell you, but that's what he stood for, this protestant action."
"He was neither Liberal, Labour, Conservative, none of them, he was just, he"
Mm.
What had been a er election representative until
"Er er an election agent,election agent when you're er a er d doing the work of an election agent, you've got to be responsible for all the data going out concerning the running of the election."
"Making sure that your candidate attends every meeting, for er s you know during er an election campaign they've got to attend all the meetings."
"Well the election agent was the man responsible for getting that data through to the, the candidate to say that you're speaking at a meeting, such and such a night, and another meeting at such and such  so keeping the, keeps that candidate on his toes, all the time, during an election campaign until election's over and then of course er you know what  transpires after that I su it's either"
Was you involved in the Labour Party for a long time before erm before you were the election agent?
No.
No no no no.
No n never.
"Of course I had this spell er er don't forget I was five years as a prisoner of war, and  a lot of interest because I was a union member pra b previous to that you see?"
Was this what erm led you to join the Labour Party?
Your initials at a trade union
"Yeah yes, that was er actually yes er"
Mhm.
I wanted to see how it o o operated politically.
I'd heard a lot about er af er I've been in the Transport and General Workers' Union as a shop steward and so forth like that.
That this was interesting me.
"I want to know, find out the workings of it, politically."
What did erm how did you find the Labour Party at that time compares with the Labour Party now?
Oh much better.
W er united.
"It's not united at the present day, there are far too many lefts and rights and centres."
"If there's e if there any  party's operating at all, there's only one p one thing and that's centre."
"No lefts, no rights, centre."
United.
"M m yes, they talked about work  or work , and erm, but not about conditions particularly, and  was a medium pit for conditions."
"They talked about conditions at  which was a wet pit, and er how Hucknall was much better, anyhow and things like that."
But great talk about Union activities.
What were the Union activities?
"Er well, there was the highly immoral thing called overtime, erm if you had too much overtime you was keeping someone out of job."
Er you wanted a fair number of hours and you wanted a fair wage.
Er the Union was very  parochial .
Mm.
So the men in the house were all members of Nottingham Miners Association?
Yes.
What about the General Strike?
I suppose the strike would be an early
Well
memory for you?
Yeah.
"The General Strike,it's a strange memory  because I had to walk down  Pad er now, erm I forget what the proper word is now, er it's called  Walk, now ."
"sounds terr er terrible to me,because  Pad was the way to  Colliery, the last half mile along a dirt track."
"And er Granddad  was on maintenance, of course, and I used to have to take his meals, so I used to go past the er picket, along with many other people who were busy coal  out of the pit tip ."
"Er the picket was not as militant as it is now, and there were the talks of scabs, and things like that."
"But the Strike was, well we had the pit ponies up, and er we always used to go and feed them, and then we went, of course, to chapel for meals."
"I won't say soup kitchens because they weren't that at all, I mean, they weren't as civili You had a civilized meal, I know you sang grace before it, and said grace afterwards, but you had knifes, forks and spoons and chapel china."
Mm.
So how?
Do you remember how your grandfather and father felt about the Strike?
"Erm yes, they er, they felt they'd been let down by the Railway men, I think, or someone else at the beginning at the Strike, and they were out on a limb but er they'd got to make the best of it."
Mm.
Erm I think they thought they'd been let down at the end of it.
"Erm I was taken to h hear A J , the miners leader at the time, he was the best type perhaps, a Welsh Chapel Parson, erm on the recreation ground and on the marketplace, when thousands turned up,"
Mm.
attend .
"How how did people feel about , because well if you read read Alan Alan  book, then he's criticized very strongly as being too militant, and r well really Cri preferred to him."
How how did the the  miners?
"town built in our country with two motorways, and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up, it was nothing to do with our friends the  saboteurs."
"It was creeping suburbia then, it wasn't"
Creeping suburbia.
So wha
Yes.
"what do you do now with the, what do the old  the old hunt's people do?"
"Well we've, we just have to er, grin and bear it."
There is nowhere else to go for us.
Yes.
I would like to ask the saboteurs how they can justify  the fact that they ill-treat hounds and horses?
Now I
personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by saboteurs!
I feel this is cruelty to horses.
Yes.
"That's, that's just absolutely rubbish!"
I mean we don't
Well you
"can't, you can't"
"like er, you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe"
Generally speaking
Mm.
"erm, I mean  people who spend their entire Saturday doing something that they, I mean, I don't enjoy going out every Saturday!"
"I mean, I'd like to do the things that, my hobbies, but I go out there because I care and I see that I feel that it's necessary to, to actually stop these people tormenting an animal for fun  and if I'm that concerned about animals, I'm not gonna stoop to  to hurt a horse, or  or the hounds!"
"I mean I ride myself, I have dogs myself, I mean, it's just another excuse from the hunting fraternity, turn it round, blame the cruelty on the saboteurs when really  there wouldn't be any saboteurs if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun!"
Do you want to come back on that?
Yes.
"Erm we ha , we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that I would ask the speaker  who i , what"
Mm.
or who is the fox's predator?
"After all, the mouse has a cat, so what is the fox's predator?"
Do you know much about fox ecology?
Yes.
Erm o a barrow crossing er between platforms there.
There's a engine or carriage co er couple of carriages in there.
The gates are shut over there.
Signal box there.
"Er the er station master's house, the line disappearing off towards  over there."
"Erm  's Mill along here, and actually, you can actually just see there's a wagon there which says, L B S C."
"Now that's London, Brighton and South Coast."
What on earth's that doing there?
Er but er maybe it was erm collecting or delivering a load or something.
Er there you have the weighbridge.
"Er or weigh office, and again pretty little building, er the steeply pitched roof, the barge- boarding on it, erm and er multi-coloured er brick, there's a sort of whitish brick with erm er sort of pinkish er brick work er put in to er b by way of decoration."
And again you've got the same sort of thing.
That's the coal er th the the coal offices.
"There were three, well there we were in fact four coal merchants in the in the town."
"there was er  's, erm  's who were probably the biggest, Samuel  's, erm  's and  s."
"Erm I think that  's had gone out of the coal merchanting business erm probably by nineteen twenty or earlier, I think."
I haven't been able to trace anything er later than that.
"There you've got er a line of coal wagons, and so that's those'll be coming that is a more sort of general merchandise wagons which would be parked in there, loaded or unloaded, erm er shunted across the lines and er into that goods yard, goods shed for er loading and so on."
"Erm lamps, kerosene, wicks and all the rest of it would be kept there."
"Gentlemen's toilet, there."
"Erm and the driveway, er over there."
And again as I say it's rather a nice erm picture which erm er was given to me some time ago.
"A close up really, just showing you er more detail on er that wagon turntable, the buffer stops, rail built buffer stops, or just across there, fire buckets."
Erm and er there's the er loading gauge and there of course is the whitewashed erm cattle dock.
"Er and er so there's  the goods shed and the er door, the wooden door to provide excess er trucks into there."
"Er another picture I say really just erm closer up, erm and giving perhaps better detail."
You can see the er the pattern of the darker brickworks.
There's the sort of pinkish bricks.
"And again you can see the barge-boarding erm and rather attractive roof designs, er which er reflect er the rest of the architecture."
"Some of the some of the railways were very very functional, not and didn't bother too much about er what places looked like."
Railway was.
"Er they perhaps spent too much money that way, but to be fair, the  Railway was the biggest Well the  Railway  er on amalgamation in nineteen twenty three, was the biggest company, and biggest employer in this country."
Yes
So I asked if they wanted anything and she said a bed at the cottage hospital
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds
Oh you mean a bed?
You mean a special kind of mattress?
Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
"She just said a bed, so I told her there were special beds that we are very useful in fact very necessary in  cases and we tend to be short of them"
Ah ha
and a  bed costs two thousand pounds.
There's another one  can't remember the name of which costs a lot more
Ah ha
Something like five thousand .
"Anyway, I said I'd make enquiries as to what was wanted and I said because there's a new children's ward will open at the  hospital and perhaps they would ."
So I saw Mrs  and Mrs  said they were aiming to raise money for scanner appeal
Yes
They're also going to have a obstetric  department  first time
A what?
Obstetric and patients
Yes
and that obviously they would be tend to be other children with mother's there so they would need perhaps a play facility there and other children who goes to the E N T clinic can go to the  not just go to the outpatients  casualty
Yes
There's very limited facilities for children to play with.
"So, but I also approached Mrs Earl about a ."
"Anyway, she wanted me to go and see her."
"She said there was the scanner appeal, the  talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and there's an arts appeal and for arts facilities in hospital and all sorts of things."
"So I went back to Miss White and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that would be the best idea, not the ."
"I also told here it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital and the children from  invited to the hospital that day, that week sorry, it's gonna be a week in June so she wanted to know the details so I asked Mrs  t would she write to Miss White and give her all the details but she thought it would be far better if she went to see her and explain it all."
"She was going on Wednesday, I hope she went."
"Hold on, which one was going to see which one?"
Mrs  was going to see Miss White
.
"and I had, got  pick up two so I, I just had to give up, I phoned him up when I got here, apologise, he hasn't been in touch with Michael yet, I don't know why not, er, though why, er sorry"
"Erm, there used to be ."
"Sorry, there used to be a group at the College I think."
"Yes, yes."
"Well there used to be that's right,with you John,talking about college group just about that time ."
"Erm  yes and it's, it's funny thing I haven't sent things to the College with, with the other stuff that went out, but, er we have, I have spoken to Michael about College, yeah I mean ."
"So we didn't, yeah well if we've got someone's who's interested in starting a group, that's the time which to start, we did, yeah, but there was a group, er previous thing but I think that, there was one girl who was very er keen, but I think when she left it probably lapsed."
"Mm,"
But.
"yeah, yeah, I did, did discuss it with Michael, I'd forgotten that, I just remembered now ."
"Maybe, maybe I don't know if he's shy or anything, why he hasn't phoned up Michael yet, perhaps I ought to ask Michael to phone him then, he does , yes."
"Maybe, yes , we have, we have approved school or er student group officer so we should perhaps let him  you know, perhaps we should, perhaps we should come back to him or Michael could."
Mm.
"Well, shouldn't, shall I"
"Should imagine, mm."
"take that number from you, cos I'll, I'm probably going, probably be seeing Michael this week,."
Do you want the letter?.
"Yes, okay."
"Right, that's fine, well I, that would be very good if there was a group at the coll at the coll at the college, there ought to be one at the college"
Mm.
"of all, of all the"
Mm.
you know.
"Oh, he's only, he's only there till September till"
"Oh, great."
"he's only there till the Summer, by the way."
"Yes, well perhaps we could get it going quickly then"
.
"Right, erm, now, er, do you want to say something?"
"I did, yes, erm, when erm, we thought our prisoner was finished the co-ordinators wrote to me and said would I be interested, would our group be interested in erm, writing to Yugoslavia's still, because with the Civil War going on there's lots of cases coming up, for example there was a whole hospital full of patients that were taken prisoner  I don't know if they were actually physically removed or whether they were held in the hospital without access to medical treatment for something like ten days, and erm, Saria did say she'd help me last time and I wrote back and said yes, two of us could write once a month, well they're taken that very liberally  and, and, got two or three things from the already and erm, if anyone else is interested in writing an odd letter say once a month to Yugoslavia maybe they could erm, let me know later on.."
"Good, that's fine, right, any other business?"
Whilst there's a world economic malaise.
"Not sure you can blame the media altogether, I noticed you said there in almost these words er, John Major will the lead the Conservative party into the next election and the Conservatives will win."
You said exactly that I quote word for word in November nineteen ninety and a week later what happened?
You challenged Mrs Thatcher and brought her down.
Well it's interesting that er I mean these quotations get It must be very clever research.
Well you offered it.
"Yeah well okay, well I haven't I mean, I I did I did actually think that Mrs Thatcher would lead us into the election."
"Er I thought that it was wrong that she should, as everybody knows."
Er and I think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party.
That was my view and still my view and I think John Major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the pundits it has to be said.
er I hope I did everything I could to help.
As I did Mrs Thatcher.
Nobody worked harder in the nineteen eighty seven general election than I did.
Yeah but the point I'm making is that you thought that would happen then.
You say it may happen it is going to happen now.
Why should we believe it now any more than we believed it then .
"Well I I I mean there i thinking back, I didn't think at that stage, I hope I'm right about this,th that I had any idea that Geoffrey Howe was going to resign."
I never had the slightest intention of challenging Mrs Thatcher.
There was never my my view and and one day I shall if I ever get round to it I might set this all out.
My view was
Write your memoirs?
Yeah.
"In nineteen eighty six, my view was a very very clear one."
To survive.
I mean nobody thought I could do that.
I mean not many people who'd clashed with mrs thatcher did survive.
"But I did, that was my determination."
"John Major is beset with problems, you wouldn't"
Yeah.
argues that.
"In fact you said er again if if I may offer you one of your quotes erm, If you have back benchers who won't support you, that limits governments abilities to take decisions."
you said that a few months ago.
Give over one of the rooms to  people .
When is it?
It's er the first weekend in March.
Anyway shall we
Okay shall we move on.
Do you want to tell us all about the stall for for the energy conservation bill?
Certainly.
Yeah the stall was extremely successful.
We kicked off at eleven and went on till three and there were I think six people stuffing er in the course of the day Bob Andy Mark and myself and Chris .
A late showing from the man himself.
And erm I was particularly pleased to get Chris along because he was extremely effective.
Erm what we were doing was filling in these these postcards asking MPs to turn up on February the fourth to support the energy conservation bill when it has its er second reading in Parliament.
"And erm it was ex ex it was great having Chris along because erm he went out and grabbed everybody in the street, pulled them in onto the stall and er and got them got them to sign on the dotted line so to speak."
Er he came along after the the Heworth Green er demonstration.
Which he described incidentally as a bit of a damp .
And they all they all ran away very soon after the press left.
So so he came along and did some work for us.
Apart from that erm the scores on the doors forty six postcards were sent out which doesn't sound perhaps like very many but is in fact quite a lot of work when you're having to find people who's who people's MPs are for them and so on.
And we were we covered sixteen different MPs which is especially good news because Hugh Bailey normally supports the bill and as far as we know is likely to turn up and and vote for it.
But getting out to MPs like erm John Prescott the energy spokesperson for the Labour Party and so on.
And John Gummer.
John Gummer right yeah.
Lots of people who are marginal erm we don't know erm ourselves if if they're intending.
So this might help tip the balance.
And because  in with it it's a national campaign.
It's er it's all all to the good.
And so it's keeping up the the good work that's of of lobbying MPs to such a degree that they they've got to back it which is what's brought it to its second reading as one of the most popular er private member's bills in history.
Erm we received eleven pounds eighty seven in donations.
Er the cost of stamps was eight pounds seventy four and therefore our profit
profit was  three pounds thirteen pence .
Not bad for somebody who thought it was going to  cost us money .
So people gave us money for the stamps that we put on and other people gave us donations.
Er into the er into the bunker.
"In actual fact in later times erm, possibly when that er when this was no longer in use, erm they er put five, instead of two or three coal rails, on the bunker, erm they put five on at least a couple of the engines."
"To so it could accommodate more coal, erm and not have to return to base so frequently."
"Erm there's another picture, showing the er water er water crane, with a barrel."
Er and the erm and the hose and er and and lighting and so on.
And this was a little stage er for people to go and to erm transfer coal across.
"Now you can see on there, there's something at the back isn't there?"
Oh yes.
But I I don't know what it is.
I suspect it's er it's it's er it's some sort of little office at a guess.
But I would very very much like to er to find out er and get a picture of what is up there.
Or somebody could tell me.
Now that's a bit of a grotty picture put er it's useful to er er to give an idea of what was there.
"Now after the er there was a incident at erm the er engine shed, er the stabling of the locomotive was transferred away, erm and it used to travel at the end of the day over to the  er or , or  er engine shed, where it er stayed for the stayed for the night."
"Er and this is a picture of it and the  engine shed, with some ex-  locos."
Er which were normal at that time.
"Erm and er and basically that engine shed is where  's clothing factory is, erm just er at the side of  Road,."
And by the  Hill Bridge.
"A nineteen twenty four timetable, erm not many trains between  er and er and ."
"I say originally there were four, but by nineteen er thir nineteen twenty nine, erm basically the passenger service had ceased, although er we did get  there were minor special and so on, that that were run and race days, the stations and the er were used, but basically erm er the er the line beyond er  was er virtually entirely erm colliery er and and goods traffic."
But I say it it it became er quite increasingly important right up to its closure er of of er particularly for for catering for Bl for erm  pit.
"Er and indeed er a a triangle or a curve was put in near  to er bring to bring trains or enable trains to er er to turn round or go round and face Nottingham or come from Nottingham from  yard, and so on."
there's quite a quite a good service as you can see er between erm at least er  junction and .
virtually everything.
And that was maintained right through to the end.
"Erm a late picture, say on or about the day befor when it packed up which was erm July nineteen fifty nine for passenger servicing."
"And that was a sad day, erm and I've got the details, I think it was nineteen eighty one, er that it was finally bulldozed."
"And I think a lot of that er of the hard core and er went, and was buried near the rifle range, up erm at  's place."
Er just off  Road.
I think I'm right in that.
You can see that erm   good job of the knocking all the er stonework down and so on.
Rather sad .
"Well after the break, you can buy them, this is one of them, for as little as twenty five pounds, Elton John's been wearing something altogether more expensive at the High Court this week but  does it  look much better?"
Will you see the join when you join us?
"And men in wigs, next."
for a while I was in the Air Force and then  I lived in various parts of the country.
"But coming back to live in   like to call it, er in nineteen seventy five."
"And I know perfectly well that there's no way that er I could get my wife to move out of the town, she loves it."
And so so indeed do I.
"Anyhow, er this evening  very happy to provide a few pictures for you to have a look at, and hopefully with a bit of information."
"If there's anything you want to er er to ask me about, please don't hesitate to er to butt in at any time."
Erm can you all reasonably see what er what's going on?
Right this is er merely a map erm where we're dealing with  er local people.
It's er it's not so necessary probably er as where at times I've given talks in various parts of the country on on this area.
"Er but erm this gives an idea of the railway lines that er well basically were in this area, erm I suppose er still round about nineteen fifty sixty time."
Some of them had er already gone.
But that's that's er basically what was was around.
"And of course er the Nottingham, Lincoln y Lincoln line here."
The er main East Coast Main Line over here.
"The er mass of lines in the Nottingham area, and so on."
"And that is a real subject in itself, and I think you've probably had John  talking to you."
Have you not?
Er John's erm quite a whiz on that one.
"Erm anyhow, this evening, I'm proposing to just merely cover this particular area, particularly."
Erm and then just coming along here and er as far as  and and just coming back to there.
Erm let's have a look and see what we can we've got.
"Erm well as many of you know the first one of the first things that you see, if you're c approaching the town from from the A six one two, from er ."
"Or from , er is that building, which is the old  crossing keeper's house or cottage."
"Erm it has been altered somewhat since the original er railway days, but nevertheless it retains quite a bit of the old character erm and er the high pitched roofs erm and the ."
"Interestingly, of different styles on that."
"It's not such an attractive house as the station master's house, but nevertheless er it is one of only two railway buildings now left er in this town."
"And of course as many of you will know, the railway line er used to run just in front, here."
"There's another picture of it, as one er goes past on the road."
Yeah  the role
but he but it is the day to day d detailed development
of a project to meet the cost specification and timescale defined in the client's remit.
Undertake the requirements of the project quality plan.
"Undertaking all design construction, installation to meet all necessary current standards, statutory requirements,a and the civil engineering design manual er safety manual."
In a broad sense.
Mhm.
Which seems alright.
Yeah.
"L let us then debate, I mean you actually have a load of projects which are maybe two or three thousand pounds apiece"
Mm.
where I presume you would just wanna hand that out to some guy and say get on with it.
And that guy may be an M S one.
"The problem is a lot of those are not being managed properly by the M S ones, M S twos."
Right.
We will
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's debate that then when we get together.
Thanks for raising it Jim.
Fair point.
Have you read what
"It's, it's important that we nail it down very very quickly because the clients' reports depend very much upon the input of the project engineer."
Project engineer.
"The only, the, there is only the project engineer can get into the databases to put anything in, or, or their clerical support, to get anything into the general notes about that particular"
Yeah.
project.
I think we're meeting early next week isn
Yeah.
Tuesday isn't it?
Tuesday
So we'll bottom that Tuesday.
I don't want  otherwise you finish up with five separate er management procedures .
But also  is it necessary.
Jim
So we can make
let's issue that.
Because
"You, David and I need to sort out what we need to do to implement it"
Yeah.
and we will then implement it.
For you.
We've also gotta recognize clearly Dennis that civils and M and E cannot be stereotyped they are very very different engineering .
I'm s not suggesting they could.
And some management procedures cannot work very well in M and E as they can in civils.
Not because
Mm.
"you know we don't want to  in, in, in the civils team or what have you."
Indeed it works very well.
But in some cases some procedures cannot be worked on M and E
Yeah.
engineering.
They've got totally different algorithms.
Well it is supposed to be talking about managing the system and not d not taking people's e professional expertise away from them.
I mean but if
Yes.
if we are gonna have
It is a problem.
"procedures which are, don't quite fit you, then I think what we ought to be looking for is a certain amount of common ground between your procedure and our procedure, so there is not something, you're doing something completely different to the way the rest of us are doing it."
No.
I totally agree with you.
It's gotta be married together.
Totally agree with you.
"cannot stereotype every function, under a management procedure."
The pace okay.
The speed at which we speak okay.
yeah
Power and pace and pitch and pause.
Yes okay.
let's just go back to the pace then.
How does the pace want to be compared with normal con one to one conversation perhaps?
slightly slower
"Slightly slower just so that the words come over a bit clearer yes, so so people can actually take in what you say okay."
"Now the pause, how about the pause?"
To get attention
You do don't you
it gives emphasis it attracts people's attention
sorry
Pregnant pause
Pregnant pau that's right a pregnant pause isn't it?
I mean
But it's perhaps one of the most difficult things when you start out doing presentations isn't it.
Because you get that silence in the room and mmm you want to fill it  so but you're right the use of the pause effective and particularly with a variation in pitch that gives that emphasis the two combined together can be very very effective.
Okay so the power the pace the pitch and the pause all to do with voice and slight variations on those compared with normal one to one conversation  Okay.
So that's about the voice itself now under paralinguistics also comes that the concept of words.
Words are are I mean what are words?
A simple thing to say but what are words?
Expression
Yes er but what do they express then
Sorry
Feelings
could express feelings yes.
Facts
thoughts
Facts feelings yes thoughts absolutely there there there a code aren't they?
"I mean if you speak three different languages you could use three different words to put the same sort of thought of a picture dog, chien, hound there's probably an Italian and a  and that but if you speak the languages then different words different codes if you like are for the same idea."
Ah well more or less much the same as it is today.
That's what we got the union for.
That's what we got the union for.
"That's what we got the union for, to make sure that these things did not happen."
Mhm.
That we wouldn't be stepped upon.
Were you involved in er any strikes or anything?
"Yes, I was involved in the nineteen twenty six strike."
And in nineteen twenty er strike  going at the present day there was what we called the soup kitchens.
And every local village where there was a mine had these soup kitchens.
I do not forget  the other unions which were going at that present time helped us out quite a bit.
Though we los we actually lost the strike through no fault of our own.
"There was just because there wasn't enough money within all unions, not forget that there wasn't such a thing as a T U C then, this was in at the infancy when the unions first started, there wasn't such as a T U C, Trades Unions Congress."
"These were er in, in its infancy then and er we had a soup kitchen and er we, we got soup once a day, when we got issued with it."
"Each family took over a, a ration card."
"And you got so many slices of bread, so many pots of soup."
"And this was all done in old wash houses, where they used to have the boilers."
Where we used to b boil the water.
"And the soup was made in these boilers, and they were issued with their soup then."
And that was all we got.
What was it erm started the strike in the first place?
Well they started the strike as muddled as  as some greens come up and the men as union thought that was not right.
"Not forgetting in that most of the mines then, at that particular time, were nearly all privately owned."
Mhm.
Were nearly all privately owned.
Were nearly all privately owned.
"Most, right across the length and breadth of Great Britain, were all privately owned."
"Which the present administration of central government are doing their best to, under the same hammer as  it was in those days, so  it's just, this is just a repeat performance of the those days and the government today."
Was what it erm finally brought about the end of the strike in twenty six?
Pardon?
What was it finally brought about the end of the strike in nineteen twenty six?
"Well it were just like I  like I  the unions weren't as, as er financially well off as they were er at the present day."
He never put me on a heavy job until at such times he thinks I was fit .
Well that's the way I was treated when I came home.
By the the  I served five year then and I left that and I went into corporation transport which was tramcars then.
"And I went then from a, a timber mill and they  there's various different jobs I've been in since then, you know?"
What was the conditions like in the building trade after the war?
"Well er you know at that time there  in the building trade there was er what they term a, an essential work order."
"Which you had, the government, the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours' payment f of wages, forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not."
So that was an essential work order was  by the government in power then.
"That m er the firms must guarantee forty four hours wages for the man, doesn't matter what"
"Was, was this erm  to protect the men or to make sure that erm"
It's er it's more or less a
retainer for the men.
Aha.
"A retainer so that they could have, that man couldn't go in another job"
.
Aye.
Presumably this was cos there was a big erm a big surge on to rebuild the
"Oh yes, yes there was"
country
"yes, yeah."
Mhm.
"The, the present, the present day er in Edinburgh, the present day buildings that I helped to build up are now in Pilton and in fact er out in Saint  I built, that was a er built a  fact I did all the rough ."
"Both in Pilton and in present day er Pilton Circus which is er er there's a lot of er controversy going over er m making them, privatizing them and so forth but I l I was er the building of these things and did all the er the  work for them."
"Is that erm quite a dangerous job working on the, on the building sites?"
"Well it depending what, what sort of job you're doing."
"All depending what sort of job your job, it could be dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing."
"I mean you couldn't put a stranger on  a job that you, you yourself ."
But once you were qualified for the job you couldn't put a stranger on you had to ta teach that stranger a job.
Before what he was to
"Erm where did you go after the, after the building, the building work?"
"After the building I left er the building work and became a tram conductor where I went through a course in the, down at Shrub Hall went through a conductor's course."
"After going through the conductor's course I then went to Leith depot, old Leith depot er of the, with the tramcars."
If not entirely mine.
So I I would like to ask the meeting whether erm  I suppose  technically for advice on this topic.
think we can get away with putting out another newsletter on the seventh of February with a ballot in it anyway for these two things even though we didn't
Yes.
I think so.
I I mean er I doubt whether we'll we'll have a full slate in February anyway so I mean they'll probably be the option for people to come in later and we'll probably end up co-opting people later and er I think we should
Yeah alright.
I'm pleased you think that because it gets me off the hook now.
I think that because I don't think people wait until the deadline to er respond anyway.
Helen?
Erm I think technically we're actually constitutional because it doesn't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline.
It just says that we have to make the the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot.
So  they can do it from they can work it out for  themselves actually .
briefing.
Ah so so it's alright.
"So everybody who got the newsletter when they read it should have thought, Aha best look up"
I'm sorry
my copy of the  constitution  that I filed away so neatly when I received that months ago.
I think perhaps an apology and erm and an  in er the next newsletter might be appropriate for.
Otherwise we'll  phoning us up and complaining .
You'll probably be ringing people up anyway trying to get them to understand.
Yes I agree entirely.
I don't think people are going to be disappointed if they miss out .
Great.
Otherwise I if it's appropriate I'll say it looks like a great newsletter.
Yeah.
Right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of February.
Which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means I'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry.
So I'm collecting things to go in it.
Er those things should include well something about the box erm next next day or whatever I can find .
Details of about where and when.
I've got a thing from Steve about erm planning permission or application for Sizewell C that I didn't have room for in this newsletter.
And she were living in the parks.
Get up here.
Yeah.
"They used to give 'em subsidies to help 'em pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay in the, you know, their housing accommodation, or they've got to stop school."
"In summer holidays, er, the grant don't  they take that six weeks"
Off the grant.
"off the grant, so that actually they get six weeks money less, through the year, than they should do, where they're used to paying all through year"
"For twelve months, now they don't."
"Now, they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school."
No.
"So, you know, any girl that's not living at 'ome."
"She got to go out and work for that six weeks, to, to earn the money  feed the"
"And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only  corner."
"Yeah, but where can you get a job."
"Well, that's it."
Where can you job.
"Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ain't it."
Yeah.
corner.
"I mean, they're begging 'em you to ke they're begging you to keep 'em on at school, and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on."
"It's like other day,we were talking to this bloke like, and he were on about businesses, says you can't underst , oh he said something about finances,how difficult it is to get finance to start a business up  and er, he said, I know, he said you can't me, he said."
"You seen all these adverts about starting your own business, you know, governments like, you know, doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi , you know  hitting your head against a brick wall"
Yeah.
"The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance"
"straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance."
Yeah.
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that.
regulate.
I mean it's
"I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into."
"He's no insurance  no insurance whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it."
I know.
Any good news in the papers Alastair?
Well Derek for a change there is.
"And here in the Sporting Life there's the man who rode Gay Trip to Mackeson victory one of his Mackeson victories, Terry Biddlecombe."
Large as life and smiling.
He's been in the wars a bit since his racing career.
"He was one of my childhood heroes, a marvellous jockey and a great chap."
"He's been on the sauce basically but he's kicked the habit and he says of kicking the drinking habit  I've had a lot of help and a lot of good counselling, in the end it's up to me."
I don't want to be complacent but since March I seem to be winning .
Well that's great news.
"And a lot of people have rallied round Terry Biddlecombe, very popular man, Injured Jockeys' Fund among others and he's back in the back in the swim fully employed and in action for Mackeson today at er Cheltenham."
Here in the Mail Peter Scudimore wearing his new hack's hat.
Pipe can still meet the gold standard.
There are a lot of people saying that Mike Martin Pipe is not the force he was etcetera but there's been a change of policy down at  and if anyone thinks that Pipe has lost his touch they're talking twaddle.
He'll be back and he might be back at working men's prices.
You pay your money and you take your choice on the Mackeson and here J A Magrar in the Telegraph  idea represents Mackeson value .
He has some very harsh words for the Japanese about their ban on Frankie Detory saying it's shortsighted and harsh in the extreme and we'll all say yes to that.
Er in the Star Brad's a star.
This is Josh Gifford exclusive another one of these trainers learning to be a journalist.
Time some journalists learned to be trainers I think.
He says
I'm convinced he's a mu this is Bradbury he's a much better stronger horse this season and really do think he can bring the beer money back to Sussex.
We will see.
"And here today's bandwagon rolling tip,Pershing po poised to fulfil his promise , that's Paul Johnson in the Racing Post, John de Moreville in the Express  Pershing to strike his target  and now here is something of which nobody can be proud  Gosforth Park South Africa ."
This is in the Sporting Life and it's also in the Racing Post and this is a cynical move by the bookies to pick your pocket.
There are five race meetings today.
There are more dog cards than you shake a stick at yet the bookies are peddling this tripe from South Africa through the morning.
"Now in the first race the ten fifty, number nine is called Jew Wanna Bet"
Now when you hear that mentioned in the betting shops go no and pull the plugs out of the television.
"We do not want to bet thank you very much on South African racing, we've got quite enough of our own without the bookies ."
I like South Africa.
Well you're barmy.
We've got quite enough of our own without you peddling the
The prisoners of war were used as miners in the
Oh yes
camps?
yes.
Oh yes.
"We were used as miners, yes."
How did the pay and the conditions and such like in the army compare with erm being in the mines?
"Er the, the money, the money that I  money difference wasn't great but the fact was er who you were thinking about er when you did come out."
"You had a lot of, a lot of qualifications which you could get in the army in those days that you didn't have when you were in civil life."
"For instance you could learn to be a, a motor driver, you could learned to be an electrician, you could learn to be an engineer, you could learn to be anything."
"And you  through these courses and you got a certificate when you come out which er some of the  said to us, a fully qualified member of a, so these advantages were open to us then you see?"
Mm.
"So this was the, the main incentive for joining the army then?"
Pardon?
Was that the main incentive for joining the army?
Knowing that you gain qualifications?
Well my that was my  incentive  the mines.
Yeah.
"But as I've already told you  just, it was very ironical that I should l go back down the hole in er Germany again ."
"Were the conditions worse in the, in the German mines?"
In the ?
"Oh no, I  the mine, the mines in Germany at that time were far advanced of what er Britain's mines were."
"Cos they had different methods of doing the, digging the coal out, than they h than they had in Britain."
And I believe .
"Although I've not been down a mine since then, er the German mines to my er estimation were far more advanced than what the British mines were."
Were you made to work hard harder being a prisoner of war?
No harder than we did in Britain.
"You could not, no, a miner once he's been a miner, cannot go down er a pit and say to anyone down a pit, and say to anyone down a pit, that he's not a miner."
Because he gives his  right away.
"The experience he has gained in the mines at  immediately a man g a man who has been in the mines goes down there again his er n er he gives himself away, because, just because of the experiences."
"I saw an incidence er down in the, the mine a, a miner himself can tell, by the creak of a tree just where the heavy, heavy weight's coming on the, on the, the roof."
And where there's likely to be a fall.
I think that's where Dr  lives now isn't it.
"In the nineteen sixties an awful lot of er of stuff went, er or was just allowed to er to get into bad repair, and of course er B R weren't terribly interested so they just abandoned it."
"You can see again this er this decorative work on there, and again  most attractive er chimneys."
The er gents toilet.
A bit spartan but there it is.
And er the ladies one  look er there we are again.
"Going round the other side, where the sun was shining that way better."
Very attractive for modelling purposes this.
Looking close close up.
There you can see the sort of leaded light windows.
And the basically the whitish colour of the er the brick work.
"The doors to the waiting room etcetera, or to the booking office."
Inside.
Used to be panelled there I think.
But er rather dirty yellow buff interior.
"And again that's looking at the same time in nineteen seventy se seventy seven, seventy eight time, it's looking back into that er er driveway, and if you can remember the sort of the Victorian or Edwardian er photograph that er I showed you before, of er virtually that er that view."
Going back to seeing to to looking at the erm goods shed.
There you can see the main entrance.
"And that's where you went down slightly, er or erm carts, lorries, anything else went down there."
Erm normally there was a er  horse and cart here.
Er certainly until the I think probably until the end of the war.
"Erm I believe there ha there was a comma or a Yeah, I think there was a comma vehicle that was used, er later on."
It may have come from York I don't know.
"Er I suppose that's where they er did a lot of the office work, a wooden shed built on to it."
"You can see the buttresses, and again the rather attractive brickwork that even even on a goods shed, a functional goods shed."
"Now that's the entrance and there is where the er there used to be the erm er  wagon turntable out here, and the entrance for the trucks was er through that doorway."
"I won't say through the door,looks as if it has been."
But er there.
I'm afraid the er er the end loading ramp and a lot of the other stuff had gone by then.
Interior.
"There you can see the er wooden staging, and this is where the wagons were brought in, er and were unloaded onto this wooden staging, and the delivery vehicles would come down this er sort of rampway, erm between er well either side,the staging either side."
And you can just see some of the er you can just see the timberwork on the in the roofing.
Yes.
"But Hughie is saying as far the works office is concerned, he wants to regularize the system with this procedure."
And as I understood you
Yeah.
"again, you wanted the, the, to regularize the system with within the B E S office."
"We well I do, unless that doesn't make sense."
"Now I can't see why it doesn't make sense, but if Jim came to me and said, look Hugh, that's bloody silly."
"I mean our objective is to give the, the client a good efficient cost-effective service, that doesn't meet those"
objectives.
"But D Dave, Dave, Dave could not handle, in B E S, what he handles on the civil side."
In what respect?
H he is not staffed up to do what
could quite easily ask you to do all the erm
Running around
"the actual measure the site measurements, but the agreeing, the valuations, and the processing of the invoices, he does himself."
And that is w well within what this procedure says.
I mean he does the invoices now doesn't he?
Well I understood so.
"Or the, the certification to the client."
Yes he does he does the certificate.
Yeah.
"So really all it, all the, this would"
involve them
"doing would be to say, would you project engineers er or, or engineers collect the in information on site, provide it to the quantity surveyors so they can check it against the spirit of the contract, and make sure that er what's proposed to be certified they're happy with."
Well it doesn't say that though.
Yes.
It
Sorry.
It's
Let's
"What I'm, what I'm saying is if, if you want to really stir people up, bring in a procedure within telling them what you're doing, and then imple implement it at a later date and people will say, this is not quality."
Hey Jim
The erm type thing means what means little codes mean or does that give us any indication as to what these sites are?
No there isn't a key unfortunately.
Oh.
I'll tell you now if the poster says Labour isn't working I'm not having it.
Yeah what which is the nearest one to a Conservative Club?
Cos there's a Conservative Club down in Fishergate isn't there
They actually own the one on the side of the Conservative building I thought.
Or they thought they did until it always says Conservative propaganda  on the sides so I think that's a gonna .
It's it's on a little table at the end which says rate card analysis and it had T V areas Yorkshire T V North East T V and then principle main secondary local corner shop other and totals   numbers in the middle .
Anybody got any suggestions on that ?
Will we pay the cost of the poster site?
Is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster?
I think so.
Well I think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site.
Whether or not the Green Party then supplies the posters I wouldn't like to say.
Right so it's not just that the National Party want the people on the ground to choose the nice addresses.
Well that's the
I think it's clear that the money's coming from from the local parties.
What they're ac what they're trying to do is coordinate enough local parties with the same poster that they can make a block booking I would have thought.
This might be a good way of raising funds by asking people particularly for the Euros I think.
"Why don't you sponsor you know, members who don't normally come to meetings, to sponsor erm a site for"
Yeah.
I think a lot of people would be willing to do that.
"Erm make a big splash in the newsletter, Please sponsor your your Green Party poster for the elections."
Doing this this is one erm campaign that  as a small proportion of the poster sites is it?
It looks that way yeah.
There must be lots of other .
I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the  they were working
Right.
Okay are you willing to go away and
Yeah I think I need to talk to Miriam again don't I.
Unfortunately I don't have a phone number I only have an address.
"And, did continue to get professional help after that, but I think she was actually one of the  factors that  sent me further down, by telling me I looked well!"
What age were you then?
Twenty.
Yeah.
"And can you identify why yo wa was, are yo are you now over it?"
Are you
"Yeah I would class myself as a recovered  anorexic, but as recovered as I'll ever be!"
I don't think I'll ever totally get over it.
I've still got a very distorted body image that I have to live with.
I think I'm fat!
"The reality of anorexia for you was what, just not eating at all?"
"Cutting down on food, I was University missing whole meals, telling people I was training, I'm a P E teacher so sport and the perfect body was very much up front, so the more weight I lost the better I was told I looked until it became totally out of control and I was eating an apple and black coffee a day and then vomiting so that I had nothing in me."
Erm  my metabolism was  out the window.
"Now, as a P E teacher you're working what, boys and girls?"
Yes.
"Do you see ah,th the pe , the boys and girls or the, the young people that you're working with  erm, having the same  veering towards the same kind of thing, I mean, do you see pressures on  on girls, towards achieving that perfect body in the way that you felt it yourself at one time."
I see boys calling the girls fat and it makes my hair stand on end!
Erm  it goes on continually and these poor girls are  oh you're fat!
You've got a great big bottom!
"And they're not, they don't have, they're normal."
I wonder what you think of what you're hearing?
Yes?
I just wondered how much actual help professionals are?
"I mean, is is there really  enough help given?"
"I mean, we talk about eating disorders"
Yeah.
but do they really actually dig into the  the real reasons for the eating disorders or they just try and get you back onto a stable diet?
Yes?
I think what put me off in th and certainly em embedded was some of the comments as around control of our lives.
Mhm.
"And maybe hope that we as, as people as women need to do is regain control of our lives so they, they belong to us, so it doesn't matter if if  boys say we've got fat bottoms or not,yo you say my bottom's alright an and you live with that."
"I'd be interested to know the lady who mentioned that, er she got help from friends, what sort of help did she get from her friends?"
It's just a case of it's just a case of a few individuals or people with rank who think they've go so much power they're gonna press people
Yes I'm sorry to hear that people in rank in your particular case were involved
"Yeah well we've got a job to do if you're a soldier you've got a job to do okay, you've got a bit of training, you've got a job to do"
Right absolutely
"yeah you don't need no distractions, and bullying and bullying"
"I quite agree, I quite agree"
"and racism and all that,distractions"
I quite agree
and if you're gonna send people to Northern Ireland and places like that you want 'em to defend the next soldier?
Well c could I just come in?
But they do.
David Lightbown yes David Lightbown .
Andrew I'll let you back in.
"in a minute,in a minute."
"I I certainly didn't go in in in in with a rank on my shoulder, I went in as a recruit."
But you said
But when I when I when I trained as recruit I trained with a lot of other er lot of other people .
"But that was in different days, this is nineteen ni"
There was no easy way out in my day you w yo y
"One second Andrew, I'll come to you in a sec"
you were fetched in and you did your National Service.
Now when you did
this National Service you served your country for a set period of time.
I actually did three years of that that period of time in in in the Army.
"The majority of people that went through that service all had some recollection of things they didn't enjoy very much but they by and large thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the Army, it livened them up, it made them better men and we have got after all one of the best armies if not the best army in the world, it's got to come from"
I don't think that's
somewhere and it has to come from the training.
Alright Andrew briefly briefly.
Go on.
"Basically I don't disagree with you, aye we have got the best army and I loved my I loved my time in the Army but I'm totally against the way I was treated in the Army."
That doesn't there's  when you're off duty it's great but when you're on duty it's different.
the Army's made me a lot better person.
And it might also be that
"the landlords in Saigon are if you like more commercial, more capitalist, it might be they were better organized than landlords in the north."
"I mean th th th the clan links in the south were much stronger than they were in the north, and therefore there might be even greater commercial landlord opposition to land reform than there had been in the north."
Was the south not more erm densely populated as well?
Yes.
Yeah.
So you'd end up putting  much smaller sort of bits of land
Yes.
for each peasant which is going to harm production too.
So there's gonna be less
"There's, there's less"
inequality or
"there's a greater pressure of population  therefore  are you saying that, that  land reform might  at least on the model tried in the north, might not yield any economic benefits"
Mm.
"in terms that, that th th the erm land to  released would be relatively small?"
Yes.
Right.
So the economic gains from  land reform in the south  might not be that great.
"I mean you, the, the more you argue the south is a viable economic system, the less there is to gain from land reform."
erm
and stuff like that
"I mean the amount of land each family will get   if you redistribute land, then the land for the family is not gonna be able to support the family."
Right.
But
Yeah.
Yes
Mm.
Yes.
"Erm  I, I think I might have missed Adam's point and I was going back to  whether the south was more efficient than the north because just tying it in with the seminar we had on managerial farms, weren't there more in the north than in the south?"
"And so then that would just prove that how, managerial farms weren't that much more efficient?"
Er I think those are separate issues.
"You, you, you're right to say that on the whole  there, the managerial farms were in, in the north, although there w there was clearly some in the south"
whereas animals don't!
They have no
Mhm.
"choice, they have no say."
Mhm.
"There, yes?"
How do you know that erm  animals don't reason?
"Like, how do you know what goes on, like with, dolphins, with whales, with all sorts of species of animals, like we don't know, well we're so dense we can only see things like this!"
"We don't know what goes on there, we've got no right to interfere with their lives!"
Yes?
"I think, I think we're overlooking one erm"
Mhm.
"great power that the individual has, instead of being ing , indignant  about erm, our views on animals in research, we could quite simply exercise our power, not to buy the products, to ask questions of our"
Mm mm.
of our doctors what kind of drug it is?
What research goes behind it?
"Do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no , on the basis of our own conscience, individually to make a decision, and we can all do that!"
We can buy a different type of product.
And there are many
Mhm.
"companies now  erm which quite obviously assert that fact, on the doorways of chemists for instance, they do not test on animals."
So you're saying the consumer pressure could could change things?
Mhm.
It it it's every effective measure
Mm.
"of stopping erm, a certain product  it simply will go out of production."
"I would disagree that er, humans aren't used in experiments because I think that we're all being used at various"
"points in our lives, for experiments, medical or otherwise."
Mhm.
"And erm  a , a lot of the medicines that are passed  er have been passed to a certain degree and then th th the  we become the the animal."
"Are you speaking as a, as an experienced guinea pig yourself?"
Well I'm a diabetic  erm
Then we'll probably put this case back till later in the day.
Do you see that Mr ?
Because you're not represented
Well I don't know what the situation is!
"Well I'm te , that's what I'm trying to tell you!"
You'll have to .
But because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out!
Which will er  take quite some time and er will
and certainly will if you're reading to the court which was something you were concerned about.
I'm not   .
I don't know whether you can help that man with that.
"Because Mr  has represented him, Mr  said before that he he thought it was as duty solicitor  that he, he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor  but, he is represented under legal aid though this defendant  by a firm of solicitors in Birmingham  and he's anxious to be committed for trial  today."
"If he was represented we could do it er, on the section six two."
Otherwise
Are there any solicitors present today?
"Not at present, but he doesn't know ."
Oh I see.
He's given certain information to the court which  isn't correct anyway!
Have a word with him.
It might help everybody concerned if you could have a word with .
Yes.
We'll have a word with .
Could you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worship?
"Shaun David , Mr  represents him."
Are you Shaun David ?
Yes.
What's your date of birth Mr ?
Twenty fourth of the seventh sixty seven.
What is your address  Mr ?
.
"Well you're charged with two offenses, the first of which is that at Clitheroe  on the twenty sixth of August nineteen eighty eight without lawful excuse  you damaged two stained glass windows  a picture frame glass and twelve  glasses of varying descriptions  belonging to Whitbread Breweries  intending to damage that property and the being reckless as to whether that property would be damaged  contrary to section one of the criminal damage act in nineteen seventy one."
"I understand this value, value has been mentioned on a previous occasion, I think three hundred and ninety five pounds?"
"What I also want you to do on this is if you can refer to Adrian Bull's book, the Economics of Travel and Tourism, and just go through the relevant chapter on demand."
"It's the Wensley Gate,Group."
"The tape recorder is now running, I hope that it's going to be recording, but let us not erm, be inhibited as a result of that."
"Erm, programmes, erm, haven't got a programme."
No.
"Erm, I haven't got a programme."
Thank you.
"You haven't got a programme, the very last one."
"Wh what, how how very carefully calculated that was."
"Erm, we are today, going to do the Black Sheep of the Family, erm, because erm, erm, doesn't feel that he he's up to doing the one that he thought he would do this week."
That will be postponed probably for a fortnight.
"Can I remind you, erm, looking at that programme, that, erm, healthy eating now appears on, I think it's the, sixteenth of March, and sadly I shall be here on the sixteenth of March."
"I shall be in Leicester at any rate, and I may very well come and join you, to talk with you about healthy eating."
"I was hoping to miss that one, because you might be trying to persuade me that I should erm, partake rather more of healthier food, than of the unhealthy food that I do eat."
"Er, it is."
"Yes, it is it is a project study, and therefore it would be as well, if we were all thinking about it in advance."
It it is in tha the hand-book.
"Er, it's on page a hundred and thirteen."
"And the idea is that as we've done with previous erm, discussions, if each one could come along armed with some information to do with healthy eating, erm, there's a list on page a hundred and seventeen, that might start you off thinking."
"Erm, celery, low fat dairy products, incidents of heart disease for those who have an olive oil rich diet."
"I don't olive oil, that's the trouble."
No.
Formic acid can be helpful to pregnant women.
Well that certainly doesn't apply to me.
No.
No.
Twenty two heaped teaspoons full of sugar every day.
"Well, considering I have none, somebody's having an awful lot."
"Er, and eating will be always one of, and so on, there's a few items there, that you might like to concentrate on, and perhaps, as much as anything, if you have your minds open in the intervening number of weeks."
"If you see an article, a snippet, er, a comment, from a newspaper, from a magazine."
"Cut it out and bring it along, and I think it will all add to our discussion of healthy eating."
"from you than the statement you've just made er and I think you'll be you used the word abhorrent, I think you'll be abhorred by some of the er stories you're about to hear."
"If I can come to you Andrew , you were in the Royal Highland Fl Fusiliers, what"
That's correct.
happened to you?
"Basically  the full time I was in basic training and when I went to the Regimental the Royal Highl Fusiliers Regiment the first battalion, I was physically beaten and mentally tortured er into the same bargain."
Well what do you mean by mentally tortured?
"Well they can physically do it to you with use of fists, use of hands and whatever else they've got and they can mentally do it to you like put you in jail that  or all sorts of things like when I was on sick leave, they came and lifted me."
"Right well t t tell me about the physical abuse, what sort of things were they doing to you Andrew."
Beat ya up.
"N C Os, noncommissioned officers beat ya up, and a above them as well."
You get
So
"in a battle camp, you're supposed to be  learning how to fight in a war and basically they beat ya up, and in camp as well, it happens in camp too."
"And did did you see th w was it widespread, did you see it happening to other people?"
It's very widespread.
Actually I  witnessed a guy being raped in the Army.
"That was by that was by normal recruits but it still happens it, actually the the bullying goes down the line."
"The N C Os bully, the officers bully the N C Os, the N C Os bully the privates and the privates bully the privates."
"It goes down the line, all the way down the line."
It's a nons it's a non
"If you're bullied, you bully somebody else"
Aye.
and so on and so on?
"let me just get back that was abhorrent as a word w has already been used and er should be used again by what you said, you saw s somebody being raped by two soldiers."
Did you try and help that particular soldier?
"I did, I did, I s actually put a stop to it."
That's
So that was a brave thing to do?
"I wouldn't say it was brave it was a normal thing to do, wasn't brave, there was nothing brave about that."
Was just a normal thing to do
You'd expect yeah y you'd expect somebody to do that for you of course.
Of course I would.
I mean it depends on each organization doesn't it?
Sort of two way two way thing you agree or don't agree between yourselves.
I'm in some ways surprised the non-political groups want to affiliate with with the party.
War on Want are er for a long time have been the only probably the only erm  that put their neck on the block as far as social and environmental aspects of the party go.
But you know I agree with you cos that  as a charity.
Yeah they seem to have a lot more to loose than we do.
Yeah.
There's been a lot of trouble lately a lot of problems haven't they.
War on Want didn't they go bankrupt or something.
They did yeah.
There is a possibility that War on Want should  be considered as being relatively high on our list of people we would be willing to affiliate with.
That's something that  not bad at all they do  as well so.
So is this was the national War on Want who contact us or the local contact?
Erm it was a lady who came from Leek.
Oh.
Do we have any feedback from any other local parties or the National Party are they recommending it or they only putting out feelers to local parties and ask what what we feel about it?
No.
associated with for example you're  party.
Oh that's just a mailshot deal.
They quite likely the Green Party got a free mailshot and their communication returned or or even might have got some money from them you never know.
I thought this sort of thing would be something the Green Party nationally should decide that whether in principle we ought to affiliate with.
Yeah but the advice might not have gone amiss and
Yes  surprising that War on Want aren't asking the national party
Yeah.
and instead are mailshotting all the local parties.
I think it may be it may be that  they could perhaps get more money if the local parties affiliated separately but
What about our links formal or informal with other York  branches of other
Yeah I mean this is this is erm more the sort of thing that I I had in mind.
Yeah.
Erm I think I mean we ought to be doing more with the local Friends of the Earth and local Greenpeace I feel.
In the past Greenpeace have always rejected us and er on the grounds that in fact we're a political party.
And Friends of the Earth it's only relatively new it's only been going properly for what two years.
In this dictionary of phrase and fable.
"Brewer equates black sheep with bet noir, the eyesore in the flock, a disgrace, something unpleasing."
Sheep used to be of great importance to the British economy.
"Black sheep was often despised by shepherds, and their wool was less valuable."
"Nevertheless, even black sheep were used for export."
"Okay, that's that's the bit of erm, sheep background."
"The nursery rhyme then, comes from Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book from around seventeen forty-four, and the division of bags, one for the master, one for the dame, one for the little boy who where wherever he is, lives down the lane, is said to refer to the export tax on wool, which was imposed as far back as twelve seventy-five, making even the outsider sheep of value."
So black sheep are different.
"The term is used negatively, but the black sheep of the family maybe an attractive person, someone with a sparkle, with a courage to be different, with a courage to defy the norm."
"Everyone, is says, can think of black sheep of their acquaintance."
"Every can you think of a black sheep of your acquaintance, do you do you."
"No, I don't whether I can."
Not  acquaintance.
"Perhaps I've, perhaps I've, perhaps I've mixed in a very sheltered society."
"Perhaps family history, perhaps, but not the very"
"Yes, yes."
No.
"I don't think er, and of course, er, again perhaps the idea of a black sheep, has changed over the years."
"Erm, circumstances which made someone, perhaps fifty years ago, considered to be the black sheep of the family, wouldn't necessarily be the same now."
No.
Mm.
"Erm, spivs."
I I don't think I had anybody in my family who was a spiv.
"But there was somebody in in the street where I lived, who was a spiv, and he was considered to be the black sheep of the family, didn't quite fit in when everybody else did."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Nowadays, you know, erm, don't know whether that sort of thing"
"Enterprise, culture."
"En enterprise, culture, yes indeed."
"Yes, yes."
"Er, I mean in the olden days, they used, they they usually the  sent to the colonies or, sent into the army or or into religion, weren't they."
Mm.
I think very often you do need professional help and it isn't possible to do it with family and friends because of the interaction that actually makes it worse.
"So there's a practical suggestion and I, I like, I like Carole's philosophical suggestion that we could start celebrating the diversity of human kind."
"I mean, that's the kind of thing one often hears on this programme, is it wishful thinking or d'you think we could actually achieve it?"
Oh!
Wahey!
Yes?
I think the media have an awful lot to answer for!
Yeah.
"I run one of the self-help groups that one of the ladies mentioned and we looked at an outsize catalogue recently and it went up to size twenty six and in some cases up to a size thirty  and the ladies who modelled the clothes were no bigger than a twelve, possibly a fourteen, but a very shapely fourteen!"
Mm.
Mm.
"So the media, even when anything you do depends on your size,yo your image is all for a woman, your brain or your ability really comes way down the line!"
You have to look good first  before anyone listens to your other abilities!
But looking big and good are not incompatible are they?
"I was just gonna say, I I think we should possibly stop blaming the media or whatever actually happens and perhaps echo what the  the lady earlier said, I think that it's in our hands, we're the women   that could make this happen !"
Yes?
Well I
I was just si Oh sorry!
I'm sorry!
One at a time!!
I was just sitting here wondering why men don't have this image problem?
Because there are an awful lot of overweight men and I don't see any problem with them at all!
They don't seem to have any problems between each other either!
I'm quite concerned that my four year old daughter is after a Sindy doll  and wondering whether perhaps Sindy dolls shouldn't be produced  in erm  such diverse figures as real life?
Well there's an
"Are we, are we providing"
an interesting idea!
our future generation with women with an ideological  figure such as Sindy.
A lot of ideas and certainly worth talking about it.
It's something I hope we'll talk about again.
I hope you've learnt something and I know that I have!
Thanks very much for joining us.
Yeah.
That's the difference.
"And between them both, you can, you could  I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand  back."
Yeah.
"Well, finance company."
"You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed."
No.
You don't pay no more.
"Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures."
"You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out"
Benji
very high
He's alright.
"It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know,"
Yeah.
"five thousand pound, not."
Not paying it for years and years all the time.
"But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back."
"Forty grand, you kn that's the only difference, and"
"I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way."
"But I just got one thing that I want, that they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a bit nervous, you know."
"No, they won't send a loan shark."
"You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent ."
"Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em."
"But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so many,yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gonna pay it back."
You know.
"If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years."
"Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ain't ya."
"So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off."
"We're still having trouble getting insurance, and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who he's with."
"'Cos he had a right job,got plastic, 'cos he even  plastics, I mean that's"
Yeah.
You're a graduate.
I am yes.
Yeah I thought so anyway.
Er I
would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to impart knowledge to people than anybody else.
No I'd I'd I don't I don't believe that that's the case erm
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen co sorry I just want to do something go on.
Yeah so okay I'm I'm I'm
I don't think that's the case.
I'm I'm winding you up a little bit but no I mean there's a little method in this .
When are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the Government?
Oh we're
Cos anybody can score points off them I mean it's simple.
We we well we'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years.
Well he's not going to be there for ever.
Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them.
If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them.
You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped  out of my mind .
"Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him?"
S Sir Keith Joseph?
Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph.
Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education  and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable.
And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right?
Yes.
We well I've no objections to that to that at all.
"No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now  and out he walked."
Is there a chocolate machine in the building?
And off he went.
He was addicted to chocolate.
I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and  tried to do something constructive is John McGregor.
And then they kept their language  kept the language.
Right.
Okay did anybody get a chance to read the paper which was about  conversation?
I just wondered  what what that came up with as it's conclusion.
W well it might be worth having a read of that.
Er okay what else?
Has anybody got any that I haven't haven't really covered yet?
Mhm.
and how erm  but it probably got a little to do with the way groups actually organize.
Whereas the boys are more  but the tend to give more .
Right.
But the girls tend  more equal responsibility and not .
What differences do you f I mean have you got any specific examples there or?
"No   Er the girls sort of say things like  perhaps ask her, Do you have any  We could get on a bit more so they don't include themselves in what they're going to do."
Whereas the boys  Give me the pie  Get off my steps or something
Mm.
Right.
Is there something  about where one girl was using what would be boys language when
Yeah.
someone else came round to her house she was like you know get off my yard
"Yeah,Yeah, so girls are perfectly capable of using those  when need be"
"Yeah, I mean I The important thing is I think the children do recognize the differences, not that they don't notice the differences, because they're Like you say they're capable of using the other if it if it suits them."
"Er I mean that goes back again to the articles which you might have about the way that parents talk to their children, and you quite often find that then very very quickly the children grow up speaking in a same way as the parent of that sex talked to the them."
"So if a child gets spoken to in a fairly direct way by imagine a female child by her father and the same female child gets spoken to in a not so direct way be her mother, then even of this The child is likely to  both version, she'll grow up using female variety because she's she can affiliate herself with her mother and I mean she knows that is  the variety she's expected to use."
I think  can't really remember I don't know  how father would use different language he's talking to his son or daughter.
Yeah that's true as well.
Er it sort of goes in four ways I mean the fathers talk more directly than the mothers whether or not it's a boy or a girl they're talking to.
"But they do talk more directly to boys than girls, so it's sort of graded in that way."
Okay who wanted to talk briefly about what people are going to write about?
Cos we haven't really sort of said anything.
Has anyone got any I mean I you don't all need to write about the same thing or anything.
Er does everyone want to do a general essay or do people want to do a s a specific thing?
You  I was in a warehouse at  served thirteen year there.
"And I was working in a large warehouse, a three floor warehouse, a grocers,grocers."
"I served there for thirteen year, became a chargehand eventually and eventually the f the firm folded up."
What were they
"Very old established firm, it was established in er eighteen fifty six."
"So it was a, a, a firm of about a hundred years standing at that time."
But the both brothers who owned it er Charles er John and Tom  were becoming very very aged and were not capable of carrying on the job.
And they approached the son who wasn't interested so they just folded up.
What were the conditions like where you worked in the warehouse?
"Ah well we, we actually made our own condition and this is one time, I'm telling you again, where my union membership came in very handy."
I actually made it a  union firm .
So you unionized the whole firm then?
Organ organized it.
Organized the people inside it.
And I explained to them  what benefits they were getting.
Mm.
Although the employer was pretty reasonable to us he p always payed us sixpence above the rate.
Above the normal rate.
What was the erm the employer's attitude to you unionizing and organizing and
"Oh oh he didn't say, he says oh just a, it'll not worry me he says, whether you er start one or not he says."
"I pay my men sixpence over the, the rate."
"So I says well thank you very much, but still for mu l people benefit themselves."
Mm.
"They're better being in a union, he says I agree with you, quite agree with you."
"The union fights for  he says, and the union's a  but I'm one of these employers who paying them, my men a plus rate, so I'm paying men sixpence plus over the normal rate so there was no difficulty there."
Mhm.
So he obviously wouldn't have thought the union would have been much of a threat to him seeing as he
"No, no it didn't  because he was prepared to pay over er above the rate ."
The union already fought for that rate and they got it.
But he was paying them sixpence above the rate so there was no problem to him.
Did you notice much differences in the work once you got promoted to a chargehand?
"Well er there was  I didn't do so much of the normal grafting naturally, but I was always, if there was a new man came on the job they would always  learns."
"Er this has been altered quite a lot since then, but you can still see the er gate that was er to the yard of the station."
"Moving on, to ."
"Again, er early nineteen hundreds, and you can see single track coming in from  here, and interesting bit of track work here, erm station up here."
Double track through the station.
"Erm goods shed, er and er siding along here."
So interesting type of track work there.
"Now when the  was opened, er it was decided to er to put in a line, erm just near  to connect with , and pick up some of the trade for the for  Railway, cos the  or the  had already decided to get some from that end as well."
Er going up to erm  and so on.
"So a line was put in, up to Colliery."
"And there you have, not a very good picture, but you can see this was th with the goods shed as per the last  ordnance survey map."
"Slightly altered configuration, but er tracks put in there, erm and er to house quite a lot of wagons and to er allow trains to er to just be held there until they could move up to erm cos that's single track beyond there."
"That was the quite enlarged quite enlarged er sidings, erm these haven't been changed here, but additional sidings on this side er and I say that curve up here."
"Erm just look at that one that er goods shed, that's er that's interesting cos er there's still remains of that there."
There you can see  Station.
Station master's house there.
Erm and the I can never remember the name of that road over there.
Er   o this is  Road down here isn't it?
"Anyhow, erm that's in a cutting there."
And you can see the track layout.
"I say in interesting, if you built that in a model, people wouldn't believe you."
"There's a picture in early B R days, of a I think erm special probably from ."
"And showing that even if the er station isn't actually used for passenger traffic, er it's well kept."
Now let's look down from the bridge.
"And there you see  again in early B R days, er the er the station master's house, and er er and the station itself, over here, the goods shed over there , the various track works coming across, the er line up to round here, and as I say the various sidings that were put in to accommodate the additional er colliery and other traffic."
"But er considering it isn't er used for passengers, it looks in quite good nick, doesn't it really that."
"But I say that er just er look at that, and look at the particular roof line."
"And er the the vent there, the circular vent."
Now that's what it looks like more or less now.
Er looking just er well that picture of that  going through th station on a special.
That's roughly  the same place.
Well just a few yards along.
"Picture from the from the er bridge, and there you can see the goods sheds still there."
And again.
Very steeply pitched roof.
"Now if you want to go and have a look at the other oth the oth other building, at er railway er the  Railway, erm going down  Road, er again a pointer to that one time this er town did have er a railway, er is of course the  Arms."
"I think that's they've altered that, they've put a porch over there haven't they, since er I took that one."
"Er but er that was very much the local, er in Victorian times."
Er for the er the station.
"There again erm I think there's still on the windows here, there's still reference to one of the coal merchants I think isn't there?"
Have a look anyhow.
"Erm looking across from the  Arms, one can see that, what I can only describe as a delightful bit of architecture, erm perhaps I'm a little bit er of a philistine, but er I think it's one of the nicest, most attractive buildings in the town."
Erm you know I like Georgian and I like a lot of other architecture but that I think has got tremendous character.
Er and of course was the old station master's er house.
"The erm well let's see, again the steeply pitched roof, the er the chimney's, er the barge-boards, the finials, er and the er angled fencing, which was characteristic of the  Railway er post about nineteen O seven."
"And also the  Railway used it and er it was used elsewhere, and it's interesting this, I noticed that erm B R have recently erected er er this type of fencing er which is adds insult to injury possibly, on the  at er ."
Er but i you know it's rather nice actually.
"Erm anyhow, that was the sort of site er a few years ago."
"See it's very very attractive, the erm stonework and so on and the slate roofs."
"And er er it didn't used to be erm white barge-boarding, er nor white erm fencing."
But nevertheless I think it looks very attractive in that way.
"Just note the er the entrance round there in the in the hedge, er from the new building nearby."
"There's another picture of it where  er  this was er  about five or six years ago this was taken, and you can see there, going along to the end of the er of this fencing, the post there which was one of the er of the posts er to which the gates, the crossing gates were attached."
There you have a brick wall.
"Now once upon a time, there was a railway."
"Looking back you can see the  riverside erm and basically just er here was the railway, and the entrance to the goods yard, er coal offices etcetera, or at least one of the entrances, was on that side."
"Coming back to look at this erm er, as I say, very attractive building, again, and you can see there's still a bit of  work there."
And er to go back and you can see it here.
"nice lamp and as I say, these er  the barge-boarding."
"Excellent erm brickwork as well, just just proud there."
"Now you can see here, again, we've still got er some gateposts."
"That actually is a a railway gate post unless they've changed it, which I don't think they have."
"On that one was taken a little bit earlier, you can see they certainly had one of the old er  gates there."
"And looking  up that er driveway er now they've got that house there,you can see er what the view is, say up that entrance."
"And there again, much the same."
Is it just been recently that you've started to get involved ?
"Within the last ten years, I've been ten years activ actively concerned with the old aged pensioners' association and er the Labour movement."
Mhm.
D do y do you think there's a great difference between the Labour Party now and the Labour Party when you were working ?
"Ah well, more or less the same."
"They're more or less as a, I don't think there's a great lot of difference onl I d I, they're not pushing, they haven't the same, the, I would like to say, I would say they haven't the same interest in their union, they've not the same interests in the union as they had in the earlier days when there was a union."
Mm.
"Did your involvement in the trade unions when you were young got  lead to your, any involvement in the Labour Party or anything like that?"
"Oh no, not necessarily through the union, no no."
I've just had so solely an interest to defend myself.
Ah but I believed if I'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that I had to be interested in it.
And to be interested you've got to attend your branch meetings and know what's going on.
Whether it be a union branch meeting or any other branch meeting you had to be there and you had to know what you're talking about.
Don't just go into these meetings and sat there  like a dumbbell.
"You liked it, if you've been active at all you'd want to know what's going on."
And the only way you can do that is b attending your branch meetings.
"I mean there's no, no use a man being employed and he's got a shop steward  if he don't  and depend on the shop steward coming down to tell him what happens in the meeting."
"My reply to these people, if they asked me what happened at the branch meeting I say, do you want to know what happened in the branch meeting?"
"Yes, I said well attend them."
So that was er that was my answer
"When you were er in the unions and you were a shop steward, did you find that you got a lot of people working in branch meetings?"
"Well it wasn't too bad, it were not too bad from the, the firm that I oper I worked from."
The firm that I worked from weren't too bad.
"But as I say as paying the er r I, I've seen them when I'm going round the site er I got an option from the firm, I'd be allowed time off my work, my actual work on the, on the, on the site, to go round and collect their unions dues."
I'd got an option from the firm and they were very good that way.
"And I've seen them, whenever they see me come along, going away and trying to hide."
But I say there's been a
You mentioned the erm the National Association of
Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Associations
Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
"What do they erm, that, what does that association do?"
Oh well wait a  I'm just going to read  first to you.
No.
No.
"So if somewhere later on in the book she says, Michael Heseltine was a rotten old so and so."
erm
"I'm sure we know that she thinks that, so that won't actually sort of provoke great reaction in me."
What would it need to provoke you then?
We'll just see.
"What about, what she has had to say about John Major?"
"Well look, let's stand back."
My interest is in the unity and success of the Conservative party.
I don't want to see I I deeply deplore the divisions between left and right and the accentuation of often very phoney distinctions and mislabelling that goes on.
It's a development that has grown in my political lifetime over erm I suppose twenty years now.
"And I  don't like  that aspect of politics, the divisiveness of it all, the personal sort of er attentions of it all."
"I know it's there, but I thought that John struck with me a very powerful note, when he said in his conference speech, I should share these things first in private."
"And I don't think it would do any good for me on this programme, or any of my colleagues, and of course the media will be now all over the place trying to achieve this."
"To get instant reactions, instant comments which will blow the thing up."
But you're clearly unhappy about it.
I you you you've made that quite clear .
"I I cannot I I cannot believe that it is w within the the standards of the conservative party that I joined, that this sort of diary writing, gossipy, pseudo history er is part of the convention."
I think er one of the papers made this erm I think Alec Douglas Hulme er has set a sort of standard which I would admire.
"Er there were always memoirs, but I think that the nature of them has changed."
And I and not sure it's Well I am sure that it's for the worse.
It's causing damage?
I don't think that the people come out of it well.
Any of them?
Including the authors?
Er I think particularly the authors.
Should there be er a change in the rules?
What rules?
"That says, Well there aren't any rules at the moment obviously but but should there there are rules for for for civil servants, should there be rules for politicians?"
Well there are rules but cur
That say
"I've bought, I've, I've, as I say, when I pay my  have you got a mother and father?"
". And they ne er never  never answers it direct, never answers it direct."
What's that got to do with it?
"Never comes out with anything like that just,got another one ,answer you."
Can you tell me about the er incident that happened when you went to meet erm Brian  at the council offices?
"Oh yes, at that particular time, I will tell you that once again er, that was er I was supposed to go for an interview and this was er for the er declaration of intent of,wh which was er supposed to er supposed to be given every year to both the Lothian Regional Council and the District ."
"And this is happened all over the country, each area are doing the same thing and all of this  this er produce this declaration of intent and ask the, the head of the  er council to put it to their members and get the support of their members."
"Now the r the reason for us doing that is that if they do accept it, they are duty bound as a council to write to Prime Minister, Prime Minister, direct, saying they support the declaration of intent."
"Cos every, cos really the  should go direct to her, and it as  she's  taken notice of you yet."
"All, all it does it comes round and er er Regional Council, say no we support  she's got to think,."
"Well that's the idea of, anyway we're going back to Brian  and er accepted that he would accept the d the deputation,showing there was three of us, there was the m the president of the area council, myself and the secretary."
Well we er  duly arrived down at quarter to ten as  twenty six of September this year.
"And we went up there and we had just  we'd, we took the labour rooms and er of course we had got a cup of tea with them you know?"
"And in comes Councillor  the leader of the Labour group, you see?"
"Well lads, he says, I'm sorry you'll have to wait another hour."
"Course naturally we, we asked why?"
What was the matter?
"He says er I've just had a phone call from Brian , he can't meet you until eleven o'clock."
"An an of course and naturally I says well why, why is he getting ?"
Is he in the building?
"No, he says, his car's broken down."
"I says what a bloody excuse, I says and his car broke down, shh bloody corporation buses here, why doesn't he use a corporation bus to get in?"
Why doesn't he ph ring for his bloody chauffeur?
Or his k .
Why doesn't he get that?
No.
"No he says er that, that's er that's all I can tell you er that's, he wouldn't  until eleven o'clock,come."
"And er immediately he went there was, somewhere around about eleven o'clock he ."
"Right,that deputation of er old age pensioners."
"So we immediately walk through and  he's all, all ."
"Very pleased to meet you, no no ."
"Now he says er, what is this now, and of course immediately the president says, well you know happens er Mr , can we  says you've read it before, you see?"
Really?
"Lovely shops and everything, and er, it's all like round corners and everything, really, and some of these, dad's sort of, he marked the most that's open on Sundays."
"There, there's one street, it just like Gaps and everything, like, you know, it's a really lovely road, you know, and erm, it's just a really lovely area altogether."
"He showed me some really nice places, and then we went to this park, I can't remember what the park's called."
"We stopped off there, had hot chocolate and a piece of spinach quiche, but I was, and erm, and he treated me, which was quite amazing, and then erm,"
That was nice.
"and then erm, we drove, er then we walked through this park, which was lovely, it had squirrels running all round the place and pigeons and everything, it was gorgeous, and, and because it, it'd been such a gorgeous day, it's just that my fucking nose is cold."
It's really bright.
"So in fact, the sun is really hot, when you're in the car."
Yeah.
"So I, I erm, I had a lovely walk through there, and then we went out the other side of it, and it's Highgate Cemetery."
Oh.
"And, this cemetery is like, this, erm, George Eliot's buried there, Karl Marx is buried there,"
Mm.
there's all these famous people that are buried there.
"And er we didn't actually go in, but I'd love to go back one day and have a look,"
Yeah.
"because like, there there's a picture of the gravestone of Karl Marx outside and it looks really amazing, and some of the places, some of these graves that have, some of the, like tributes, are just enormous."
Really?
"They're just so big, it's incredible."
"You just can't envisage, you know, why and how they managed to afford such extravagant graves, and it's like on two sides of a road, on one side you can only go in, and if you're on a guided tour, erm, otherwise you've got to, be like, somebody to do with the grave."
Really?
"You know er personally attached to the grave, or go on a guided tour, and er, like you've got to wear certain bits of clothing, you gotta be like, you gotta be properly dressed, er, you're not allowed to eat or drink in there, there's all these things, like, you know, really"
into that.
Yeah?
But it looks fantastic.
"It looks, you know, I mean, it's  to say that, it sounds really weird, but it"
Yeah.
"so mysterious and strange in there, that it would be really interesting"
been in there.
to have a look.
"He's looked round some parts of it, yeah."
"We wouldn't have, we"
levels the then
wouldn't have no M S threes.
then none of our M S threes
would have come back at M S three.
"What concerns me is the project engineers are in close liaison with the client, and have a lot of procedures to go through that er S T Os and M S ones at design engineering level do not have to go through."
They do have a much greater responsibility.
"And particularly I mean just signing the V Os, because if it's cocked up, the question's been asked of me."
You know.
"If you have an S T O, in a sense if you don't define what the project engineer is, what grade he is, he can sign off unlimited amounts of money."
.
It doesn't seem right does it?
"I it seems, well"
No.
"But the point t that Hughie makes is that y you allocate er y you, you make the project engineer someone who have trained, and, and that you know is capable of doing that job."
Yeah.
Well I can think of one M S one in our er office who I'd be quite erm quite happy with him doing all the project eng engineering duties except finance.
"Because he, he just has  you know   a very slap happy er attitude towards finance, but from an engineering point of view you can trust him"
Mm.
so this means you daren't give him anything now.
Well in that case I wouldn't put him on er on a job that was made out on site but I would keep him in the
"T as far as the allocation of, of erm the project engineering responsibilities, that forms part of the quality plan."
"That, that, that he is given a note as part of the quality plan saying, here you are son, you are now project engineer."
These are your duties.
You are responsible for that job and you are identified on the project quality plan check list as to what you will be doing and what other members of the team will be doing.
"He couldn't live, live by it."
You know it d the first thought  bloody hell.
If you don't want to use it don't use it.
S T O with unlimited signing power.
There's an anom anomaly here.
But if you don't want to use it don't
"And anyway he can't, he can't actually spend, spend this money unless he's got"
"And the miner can only pick up a, a pick and knock the rook and he can tell exactly where er where it's weakest in the rook."
"So, so these thi these things did do, show up when you're d when you're down the mines."
"A ma a magic phase, you can't give it away."
And they didn't ne we didn't need the  if we were a miner.
A mine w a miner could tell another miner by his accent.
Not just by him telling he's a miner he can say er that's a miner.
"What, what did you do erm after the war?"
When you came back to Britain.
"Well I, well er I came back to Britain er I, I was er liberated by General Patton in a, a small place called Erfurt I was flown from Erfurt into Cherbourg, and from Cherbourg into a small place called Amersham which was a reception station for prisoners of war, where we were treated er on entering the camp we were handed a telegram."
All we had to do was sign our name to it.
"And these telegrams were for, to our nearest and next of kin, telling us we were now safely home."
Did erm did you notice any great differences when you came back from the war?
Oh vast vast differences
"To the, to the"
er yes.
Oh vast differences.
"My first experience in going into tramcars er in, in Edinburgh anyway and I suppose that the same thing would have happened er in any country,just gone through the ravages of war, with blackouts and so forth."
The people from the highest paid to the lowest paid were all just one unit.
"And I wish to God that would just come back again, now there people would just treat one of our  as they did it one of  during the war's years."
And I can't see any reason why they can't.
"Why they should, people with a higher  look down their nose at the people who are lower than themselves, I can not figure out."
I think we need another war to get  rid of the er get rid of some of the thing  that's happening at the present day.
So you think the war erm unified the people?
Behind the
Er it definitely it had proved it itself.
"It proved it, the war years proved it to the people."
"Er that they were, they were all just one."
"But nowadays we're not, nowadays we, there's a higher, a middle class and a lower class and a lower lower class."
What erm what kind of employment did you find when you came back from the war?
"Well I, I erm my first employment was in the, was in the building trade with er an old firm in Edinburgh called  and believe me I was not a very fit person then after seven, five years and I was like a rake, I was like a skeleton."
"And I got there and by good luck I got a very good er site agent and after asking me what I'd done, he says it's alright son we'll build you up."
"And he actually treated me like a, more or less a son, the site agent, and he made sure er I gradually  developed my muscles."
I think it's possible to make a bit of money but at at at the rate  you know I feel we're all the time putting the cart before the horse.
"Erm  you know if if we are going to try to keep going as a viable group then yes one of the things we should consider I mean I I don't I've come here sort of thinking  oh is this it, is this the crisis meeting or"
is it  you know erm  I mean I feel so so passionately that that we should keep going but
Mm.
I also feel just that I am  able to contribute next to nothing in terms of time so and I think w we're almost all in that situation.
Erm  you know we sort of seem to limp from one meeting to another without  really committing ourselves to anything much.
"And you know if we were able to commit ourselves to two public, two meetings, three meetings of some sort in a year  where we're actually gonna do something and present some sort of front  Par part of presenting some sort of front is to try to sell a few bits of pieces  if we're prepared to accept that we're going to lose money."
Yeah.
"I mean if we, we're preaching you should use recycled products we, if we had a few to sell at least"
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean you you're be selling your Traidcraft stuff I mean
Which
why why does Barbara believe it's okay to sell that but not
"No, well we're, we're in exactly the same problem with Traidcraft."
"You know  we we used to sell thousand of pounds worth a year and now we're down to  couple of thousand a year and we're s , we are losing money on that."
Mhm.
No  we're not actually losing money but I mean  with Traidcraft we are getting to the low point where we put  borrowed stock
Well that's the recession isn't it?
Or
"Well, what I thought was with this one world week thing at least people that, who go might be more receptive  to what we have to say to show and sell ."
Yes we've done really well with with Traidcraft
"because that is, that's the whole reason for the the the concert and they're gonna have this concert in there as well and people will be buying tickets to go to."
Yeah.
And I don't know an awful lot about it and there's going to be all these stalls.
Where they're coming obviously because they believe in that sort of thing so
Two or three years ago one world week was a full week of all sorts of different activities which were all very well attended.
It's sort of dwindled very rapidly
Has it.
"down to, I d I don't even know what happened last year."
Mm
We just had a stall didn't we?
Is there a difference.
"Well, in the definition that we heard, it tends to be associated with, with trying to rid your body of the food that you've consumed during a binge."
Compulsive eating normally doesn't  go to that extent.
"How did you stop  bu bu bulimia, I mean it was"
In the end it was the
thirteen years of binging I mean
Yeah.
wha what effect does that have on you?
"Erm, it it, it makes it very, very difficult to imagine how you'll recover  erm, but in the end it's a personal decision to, to try to achieve self respect, to care for yourself better, to adopt good habits of nutrition and exercise, not dieting, cos diets are the biggest con trick of all  and certainly, to rid your life of people who don't respect and accept you the way you are."
Can you identify why you began doing it?
"I mean, how old were you when you started er  binging?"
Fifteen.
Yes.
Fifteen?
"I was certainly to do with  feeling that I would have to be a little bit slimmer, that I would have to be acceptable to other people, that I would have to change my shape  and at the same time, I could not resist consuming large amounts of food."
"Now, fifteen seems terribly young"
That's right.
"for a girl to start, to start worrying about that kind of thing!"
Is is that a societal pressure?
"I mean is it a  ah,th wi , is there any history of it in the family an and, what did your family, did you family know?"
Families don't generally know.
"And it, it wasn't until many years later that I told anyone at all  that's, that's the thing I was saying about bulimia, it's very secret."
"And in the end, did you, I mean wha , did you get the support of of professionals or or"
Yes.
"Erm, but in the end th o only one had any impact and in general,see seeing a female professional was, I have to say, a lot more helpful than seeing male professionals."
Mm.
Yes?
"Er, my experience is slightly different when erm  when I had been trying to sort of recover, I didn't, I didn't feel as if I've get any help from professionals that I  approached."
"And in fact, I get an awful lot of support from friends  erm, not family because my family aren't, weren't aware of it, erm but I mean, really it came from fre , really close friends that I could sit down and talk to  and that could understand me and accept me, just like what the girl said as well."
Mm mm.
Yes?
"I think my G P actually sent me further down hill into anorexia after I'd lost about, about  when I was seven stone  I went to see her, I'd never seen her before and she said well you look perfectly acc , sociably acceptable to me so I went on to lose two more stone before going back to see her and was admitted to hospital as a medical emergency!"
That are not the standard English shall we say something like that.
So let's think of all first of all then about the voice.
Now there's a word I'm going to use right now which is a technical term in a way and that is is er the technical term for the study of language and how we speak the word what we say and how we say it.
It goes under the lovely title of paralinguistics
Para yeah that's right yeah.
Paralinguistics is is the study of the words we say and how we say them.
So quite obviously the how we say things is all to do with the voice isn't it?
Now I've got four letter Ps to do with the voice er and what I want to do is is think about the comparison of aspects of the voice when we have a normal one to one conversation and compare that with the same aspects when we're making a presentation standing in front of a group.
First of all power.
The power of the voice.
How do we need to adjust the power when we're making a presentation?
To the size of the audience
"To the size absolutely, to the size of the audience so if we say a one to one we've got a certain level of conversational power if you say so with a group like this it has to be"
Just raised slightly doesn't it yes and obviously if you've got fifty people and you don't have a microphone or anything then it becomes even more so.
You get much above about fifty people you perhaps do need a some technical assistance with the power.
So the power needs to be just slightly slightly raised okay.
"Now another P, anybody think of other Ps to do with the voice."
Pitch
"Pitch, that's that's yes."
Now pitch is to do with er technically to do with the frequency isn't it the the high or low pitch like on a piano from high notes to low notes?
What do we need to ensure in terms of pitch when we're speaking to a group of people?
Variety
Sorry
Variety
Variety that's right there has to be variety because because if you talk in a monotone all the time then it all becomes rather boring doesn't it?
So there's got to be variations in the pitch.
"Power, pitch, there's one I want to squeeze in between but I mean it doesn't matter."
Pace
"pace, pace, yeah."
In a way projection is sort of with power.
Pace that's right you've been cheating and looking on looking on the next page
That's right.
Alright.
"I mean, we did reports, we did those, yeah"
"lot of ideas about getting an idea about did you, am I in the class just now?"
"I went to erm, the registration"
Yeah.
it says I haven't been put on the list.
Am I on it ?
"Er, well, they hadn't notified me, but they probably, you told them anyway, did you?"
"Yeah,"
Because that's the important thing.
"Erm, yeah  the important thing is that they know."
"I mean, I know, I've, I've written it down myself."
Erm
"Okay, you say you're still"
"Right, yeah"
You're still doing this
"I didn't think the question that erm, the question  culture was the same as our culture."
Right.
"And erm,read about the book so far, and I'm going through erm,"
Okay.
Why?
"Well, there's no need now, I mean, I only suggested this erm, to help you, er, and I wouldn't want to make you write it out er, just for the sake of writing it out."
It don't think it's a good use of your time.
"And I mean, if you think that just presenting it in the, in the class is er enough"
"send it down to use yourself, but to be able to carry that through and to, to go on to, to be sincere, and I respect that it's important to be sincere."
"If you, you know, talk about people  moral values and to be able to do that, and just  majority of anything you need to  you need to have a  that allows you to do that without"
"Yes, yeah."
"Yes, it's very important to remember that both in, from this direct point of view and from Freud's findings, you shouldn't just assume that it was a watertight compartment between two areas, as it were."
One conscious and un it's not like that.
"I mean, in fact, what, what er, what Freud found, he says is sometimes, you get erm, this is in fact a kind of continuing from conscious and unconscious, and there's a big gradation in between, and very often erm, things are erm, unconscious, not in the sense that they're totally lost, and you are unaware of them, but for example , they're, they're isolated."
"They, they, they exist erm,princ a very common finding in psychoanalysis is that things will, will, will exist as word representations, with no feeling representation, or they won't be connected to, to er   they'd be completely isolated."
"You know, a very good example of this, that always sticks in my mind,telling me erm, that once she was analyzing a woman and er, a lot of the analysis was concerned with erm, conflicts, erm, relating to masturbation in childhood, and  constantly felt that this was what the analysis seemed to have done , because the woman consistently denied this had ever happened."
"Okay well  we're in a really bad situation, I mean we can achieve something at least and perhaps  oh perhaps communism doesn't work after all, they just seem to be doubting their own beliefs and what they've read."
"And that's the only way I can see a way through this, thinking okay they've got this ideology, they've tried it twice and it still hasn't worked."
Let's go back to the drawing board and try something else.
"Cos this, this is definitely not communism in any sense."
Right.
"I mean  does, does this document surprise you?"
I mean is
Yes.
is that what you thought the nineteen forty nine revolution was all about?
"I'm not surprised it's come back erm  to, to a sort of right  is this an expression of mass mind do you think?"
What do you think?
Cos if it is  communist behaviour
"There is, no there's no mass  argument because you've got"
Why not?
this different situation
that's not mass minded.
"Well it's quite, I'm sure that I'm sure, I'm sure that a lot of, I'm sure the rich peasant"
Well there's about eight people
cos really they're the only f you know they'll be going yeah that's my mass line alright
"Well of course it is, yeah  but that's not  thing is it?"
"Well, it is for them you see,"
"there, there's no such thing as an absolute mass line, the mass line in particular  two types of people."
No that's not a mass mind then is it?
Exactly.
well there's no such thing as a mass line then is there?
"but anyway we, we, we'd better stop there."
"But I think it's important we've, we've now got  what  what the policy was."
On the face of it it looks very much as though this is erm   very little social justice
"what, what I hope we'll do next week is to, is to take that idea up and to see maybe why this policy came through  erm and we'll look at the, like the arithmetic of that as to, as to how much money there was, how much land there was in fact."
Mm.
How you could actually achieve a distribution.
"So I think for next week  I'd like to be looking in some detail, there are two sources on this one is, is  and the other is ,tho those two are crucial in terms of understanding or, and   and that those are crucial in terms of understanding erm why this  policy document ."
about it we could you know five minutes.
Well you know I mean you said that they did a couple of lines just to say something about
They both I mean they I think they've released four documents outlining the way in which they're going to meet their  commitments and they one of their the Guardian gave devoted page six the whole of page six to this.
Erm and one of the pieces was sort of comments from various interested parties and the Green Party got a couple of lines in there after the Lib Dems and before .
I was still laughing too much from from some comment that the Government did one one of their four promises was to was to put pri public transport before  private roads.
I nearly cracked up .
John Major saying that people will have to accept restrictions on on car usages and it's an amazing thing to come from a Tory.
Yeah and I I asked the question not too much from the Green Party point of view as from a personal point view as I I would like to know what my Government is saying to do about these things.
I I'd no idea he he'd actually he'd actually said something like like that.
He also said that there's no reason to give up the dream of economic growth but then there you go.
Well nobody thinks that.
They don't seem to be doing too well with the the energy of economic growth.
No.
Dream more I guess.
No after all the party of economic growth and reduced taxation
Yes
I know I've I've read the publicity material and
I thought you were going to say you voted for them.
I would have had something to say about that.
That's not my party
They had Sir Jonathan on the radio the day of the message  saying they're long on rhetoric and short of substance .
That was the the overall comment I think that the documents were very very light on detail as you might
I've was just  I heard erm how Lord Jonathan has just been become become a pier or something.
No it's erm his father died.
It it's not a hereditary title I think but I think he can become a sir if he wants to.
Yeah I just I guess I had hoped to be pleasantly surprised that it wasn't  rhetoric
The only coverage I've seen so far is erm is the news and ten of all things.
That we were watching last night.
And the encouraging thing was that they're all things that a few years ago in the Green Party  sort things out they're all there.
Absolutely.
"For all that the Government is making a bit of er er idiot of itself by not embracing the things that it needs to embrace the things it needs to do, at least it's saying that it won't do them."
Which is the first step from the process isn't it?
No  no point in me  well anyway when she
She'll know.
"Mm  so he said erm, that's the situation he said but you can forget your business he said, as far as I'm concerned he said, you've lost for two years so he said consequently he said you're gonna lose this year are you?"
I said well I wouldn't be surprised.
So he said well all I can say is he said you wanna just forget that  erm
And just do it on the money you owe on the house.
Yeah exactly  don't get involved at all.
So he said well  how do you feel about your business?
"So I said well  you know, I can't just wind it up over the next  six months, I said er  what I wanna do I said is erm  I gotta carry it on for that  transit  for that  Orion till I finished anyway  so it's gotta go another year  so I said well what I'm feeling about doing I said is er  just sort of keeping a finger in the pie  I said, he said, if I'd said tomorrow, if I had finished the whole the tomorrow  I've gotta buy a car  I can buy it finance so I'm gonna get no tax relief on the H P  I get no depreciation  no nothing like that I said so at least if I still self employed  I can  if I have the sort of two or three vehicles or whatever  three, four, five vehicles but I said at least I can have some   erm  and I can then sort of they would be more  utilised, where as I said at the moment  we got more vehicles than we really need to keep full capacity  so he said yeah, yeah fair enough then."
"I said well that's what is, I said if you look at it the depreciation is so heavy  compared with the income, and I said and the insurance as well but I said hopefully cos we haven't had any  of er  any claims at all this year  you know, I said I know but all of the insurances of gone up, but I said  I'm hoping that we can sort of get the insurance down if possible  so he said, yeah fair enough then."
"He said well from my point of view anyway at least he said just disregard that  completely he said and we will do it on what you earnt, so he said all I can is  erm  just put in as many hours as you can to get your wages up on that side  erm  and then by the time we look at that he said, the end of February obviously you'll have December, January and February which will be good months  there, I said yeah  so he said well then you know  erm  a hundred pound here and a hundred pound here he said, it all helps to keep the figure up for you  so he s"
Yeah but that don't help us with Malcolm does it?
"No, but I mean all I can say is basically erm"
"Give him as much as yo , we can, when we can."
Yeah.
And can you do
"And he said he's quite prepared to do it, he said, there wouldn't be no problem  but he said I cannot do it, he said they are"
"What, is he gonna lend, what's he gonna lend you then?"
"About thirty three thousand  but you see what he said is, head office make the rule and he said and  they're not"
No there's no problem  that we can
No.
have it?
"That's right, he said what"
But you can't have it till February.
Yeah because he said as soon as they  see arrears he said they insist that it's paid up  and they insist that you have like  three months  pay them  no problem  he said
Yeah.
and then there's no problem.
"I said no, but he's"
Well we can manage that probably
Yeah.
couldn't we?
"but he's, he give me a a print out, he said well here's your print out look  so he said as soon as"
"One way around that might be then to have enough cadres on the ground in order to, to do it properly."
"I mean even, in a sense you, you, you're worried about the excesses."
Yeah.
But also the administration of  and trying to rectify the
Right.
Right.
"S so the, the more  you've got, the less that is"
"Yeah the, the less but I still think there's a fundamental problem with drawing the distinction"
Right.
Right.
Fine.
"Erm but maybe this, this  issue is, is, could be important in the sense that you, you've got  tt er  if you take China as a whole you've probably got well in excess of a million villages  erm you've probably got a denser population in the south than the north so you've got more than half a million villages in the south"
"okay, and if you're going to conduct land reform  you've got to have an effective land reform team to go into each of those villages."
"Erm so you, you, and you, you're looking of, of land reform teams of four, five members  so you're, you're looking at somewhere between two and three million cadres to go into the villages."
"And you've got two or three million cadres, trained cadres who know what they're doing, are experienced, who knows what the south is"
who know what the south is like.
"So that there, there may be a, an important personnel problem th th that you realize that well okay  the option of going for land reform is, is there but you're saying  er it's likely  trouble  my experience of the past is that, that  radical land reform is, is disruptive  it could affect production, it could get out of hand, it could alienate people  in order to control them we need a lot cadres on the ground and we haven't got them."
Well even if you
"did have them would it, would it"
definitely be for the better?
"I mean they were, they were still so corruptible."
"Or had that changed  were they, were they mo more educated now and less corruptible?"
Who?
The cadres.
The cadres.
Because to some extent erm
Yeah.
"the rightist and leftist deviations were, were because of them."
Yes.
"Er so you would  you would need a very heavy rectification programme to sh to ensure, not just that you had enough cadres, but that the cadres were going in with, with the right attitudes."
"Erm  it, that would take time, I mean it's,th that would be very difficult to control."
Yeah.
was going to see Miss I see
So then I saw Mrs Irwin on Tuesday  when I was in  and she came up with all sorts of things that she would like for the new  development.
"but there's nothing ready, of course."
There's this giant sundial we're going to have in one of the courtyards.
It's a giant one.
It's it's th the building and the blocks of things in in in the in the courtyard that make the time.
So the sun shines  bit of the courtyard when it's eight o'clock and that when it's nine o'clock and so forth.
This is just for the courtyard and these shrubs and things
how?
Where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards that're behind looking down into this courtyard.
There's also erm a play area for the children's ward.
"There's also some murals on the walls, various artists did murals and of course they've got this grant from  for six thousand pound for a  exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for  exhibition
"Well, well, over, over a period it's and other things too but this this set of murals and  are involved in it."
And various other art things.
But also there's the thought of th gar a garden and the children keeping the garden up.
"But that's  a long way and they have transport difficulties to cope from here to the  hospital but then I though perhaps, if"
"I can't see the education committee, with their lack of money, paying for transport for children out here to go to  hospital to do a garden"
The the education committee and the school governors have no money at all to pay for that
"I know, I would have thought it was very low priority"
"well it isn't even a priority, it's nothing, they won't get the money,th they won't pay for  walk to go swimming but I thought that now that the  has acquired that bus and it's gonna be standing around doing nothing for most of the time and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come up so that wheelchairs go in, but in between times it's twenty nine seats"
And then you need a P S V licence
"But that's that's perhaps easily remedied, if you could get a er a driving licence holder to take them, who, a volunteer driving licence holder, among one of the parents or somebody who could take the children at periodic intervals to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss White yet about all these sort of things.
But I did also say to Mrs Earl that a new head will be appointed to take in posts from first of September and it might be better to discuss it with them after I discussed it with Miss White.
"I only know one person, I only know one bus driver with children"
There's ambulance drivers
And he g he I think their children go to the Catholic school.
"Er, this letter from the Multiple Sclerosis"
in its infancy then.
"And, and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you, I  you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off, you had to be given two weeks' notice either way before they pay you off."
And that was the contract of employment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
What did you go on to do after the business folded?
"Ah well I was, I was a y on er thing we had back in the building trade."
Back in the building trade once again which I had experience before so I had no problem .
"And the reason in the first place I did leave the building trade was my hands was breaking out with in industrial disease, see?"
Dermatitis and I felt I couldn't go near cement and all of that.
"But then I, eventually I tried the building trade again and I joined a firm called er  forget, or something like that and I was working up in George Street in, in, in Edinburgh."
"You always go  building, we gutted right from ground floor, left the existing walls in."
"And then inside building we completely demolished inside, just sort of left the retaining walls and built it up from fourteen feet below the ground to five storeys, high,itself."
And we had to go down through fourteen feet of solid rock.
So this was obviously quite a difficult job?
Aye it was a difficult job but as I say to have an experience mines
Mhm.
"and er building trade work, both of these things had left me with the qualifications for be abl be able to do it."
Did you notice much difference in the sort of er erm the techniques or the machinery or whatever that was being used between ?
Ooh vast va er er in the building trade?
"Oh yes, yes."
"For instance you see all these big  they'd actually built up from the ground up, they'd no taking now just the odd ."
They built up from a working
"Was there still the erm the, the thing you talked about with the guaranteed work at that time?"
Yes.
Oh aye aye.
Yes
"but er the essential work contract then that I had spoken about in the first place  the building trade, that was a government order."
"Essential, essential work which was operated during the war years and er what  year a couple, several years after that."
"That was an essential b eventually that was taken away, but the building trade still believed if a building firm wanted men, they had to have at least a thirty two hour guarantee, which is at present still in operation."
"A thirty t they had to guarantee an employee thirty two hour guarantee,"
Was that to get rid of the sort of ee erm the way them building firms used to take people on every day?
What?
What have I done?
Oh you weren't supposed to be able to read it.
"No, we can read it but it's"
It's just happened a lot this week.
"Er so yeah, you want to do some questioney tag things?"
Yeah.
"Okay, I mean just ignore that one, forget I wrote it."
I mean on something like interruptions there's only so much you can say.
Er
"yeah, which is why may be general one might be more useful dependi it depends how much"
"Whereas if you do  interaction of children you can do it here,"
Mhm.
Oh yeah I mean if you wanted to also link that with multicultural situation or or cross cultural or comparing it with other ones I mean that's no problem.
language of the  different to
Okay.
certain dialectic language.
"Yeah well if you want to that then that's fine as well, I mean that  Tell you what, the best thing then is can everyone put a note in my pigeon hole by Monday in other words, you've got the weekend to decide for definite."
"Gives us just like a provisional title of what the essay will be, on what your essay will be."
"Is that alright, cos then you've gone away with any ideas you've got from now which is probably none, er and then it also means that I don't have to spend next week worrying in case we get to Friday and Thursday and you're still not sure what you're doing."
Is that alright?
Okay if you just sort of like think of a vague title which sums up what the things are which you want to cover in the essay and if you get it to me by Monday then that that'll be quite good.
"You know about  questions, is it questions like sort of"
Well tag questions and er and questions in their own rights which i I supposed seeking agreement is the idea.
Or with anything which is vaguely connected with that I mean that just sort of a coverall term for it.
excuse me.
"Okay so does everyone, think they'll gonna be able to think of something over the weekend?"
"Okay and then if next week somet If next week everyone can have Okay w I think what you need to do f for next Thursday is For Monday to give me  what you're going to do and then between Monday and Thursday, try and read anything you can about that topic."
"I mean you could forget this list that I gave th b that gave you, unless there's anything on it that is still relevant, but find the things yourself on that topic so that on Thursday Next Thursday you can each spend ten minutes talking about things which you've read in your topic specifically."
And if anyone chooses the same topic as somebody else then you can do it together or not together or which ever.
but if that can be a general idea for next week.
Okay .
The constituency that chose you was the Conservative party.
That that chose you.
But you represent every individual in that constituency .
The the the  no no no no You were chosen by the Conservative party.
You then stand for election.
The reason why you're elected is because a sufficient number of people wanted a Conservative government.
"Now it's perfectly true, they understand I hope rightly, within the framework and philosophy of the Conservative party, that you have to respect the integrity of the individual."
"But it doesn't mean to say that you are sending somebody who says he's a Conservative, going to support a Conservative government, and the moment he gets there is to be found all over the place."
"Yeah but if you feel strongly about a particular issue, erm Elizabeth Peacock, during the er coal pits erm dispute when she was very very upset at what your You were planning to do, closing down all those coal mines and and she went public about it."
She she it was for her a matter of conscience.
And she was representing the interests of her constituency.
"You're not saying she shouldn't have been allowed to do that, she should have gone to John"
No I'm
"Major quietly or to you quietly in some back room and said, Look I'm a bit bothered about this ."
No.
I've made it clear I I personally like virtually all colleagues at some stage voted against my party.
I and that will always be a right and proper thing for a member of parliament to do.
"But it has to be done with great care, infrequently It is if you like, a nuclear deterrent in that sense."
And I don't quarrel with Elizabeth Peacock who I like and admire and get on very well with.
And actually have been to support on many occasions in her constituency.
Erm but but I I'm not think of of Elizabeth as a matter of fact.
"And there are some colleagues who are today, much more lax with their loyalties."
And
"And I mean you yourself, you know, during the Westland you you you left a cabinet meeting, apparently Mrs Thatcher thought you were going to the loo and you went on television to say, I'm resigning because I think she's got it wrong over Westland."
She didn't think I was going to the loo.
Well so we were told.
I dare say that's what you were told.
It's
not what she thought.
"Did you say to her, I'm going out to re I'm going out  and I may be gone for a long time."
I if I remember correctly those are words that led to the death of a very distinguished explorer.
I had no intention of dying the political death.
The tone of the party has changed.
"On Europe for instance, we've had er Mr Major telling the Europeans to get the your tractors off our lawns."
David Hunt calling Delors a jumped-up socialist bureaucrat.
"That sort off the language, the tone seems to have changed, to have got harder."
On Europe first.
"Well Er I I hear what you say, I my views on Europe are very simple."
It's impossible to overstate the economic relationship we now have with Europe.
Two th nearly two thirds of our trade goes with Europe.
"I don't mind the sort of the use of language that gives this or that impression if that's what contemporary politics demands, I'm as guilty of that as er the next man."
"But if we create a psychology in this country where to the men and women who earn the crust upon which we depend, our business community, are switched off to the significance of Europe, there's only one people who'll suffer and it is us."
And when Peter Lilley says for instance
"I am not prepared to  yeah yes, but you will not get me to to separate myself from my colleagues ."
"Half Well let me let me finish the the quote because Well there are but but but but Well alright but but Peter Lilley is saying, is suggesting in a in a speech at a party conference that half the population of continental Europe are scroungers."
I mean one wonders how that helps this kind of partnership.
That that you obviously think is so important.
Well I'm not prepared to become involved in er er discussing the speeches which I didn't hear or er which may well be out of context or anything of that sort.
I'm not prepared to do that.
"No no but John, frankly"
"Oh come on, you heard that."
You know that wasn't out of context.
It simply it simply doesn't serve a purpose for me to allow that division to open up.
I will only use my words to describe my circumstance.
"And I know that whatever the rhetoric, Mrs Thatcher used all the rhetoric, nobody took us further into Europe than Mrs Thatcher."
"All these regulations that we're now having to I'm having to with expert er help from my colleague er Neil Hamilton, having to look at and redo, do you know where they all came from?"
Most of them came from the single European act.
From the Cofield agenda.
That Mrs Thatcher
Which which Mrs Thatcher rightly committed us to and rightly whipped us through the house  And and it and it
"Right, so we're to ignore all these things that we hear at the conference."
"There is no difference between the the endless bad mouthing between local and central government, as one tries to blame the other."
And central government trying to blame the Europeans.
"The fact of the matter is, every directive that comes out of Europe, comes with the agreement of the British government."
Since
Yeah.
"then he's lost er you've lost another seat so his majority is even smaller, it's down from nineteen to seventeen."
So his er abilities to take decision are even er take decisions are even more limited now than they were then aren't they.
He is in greater trouble now than he was the for all sorts of reasons .
Well no that doesn't follow.
No no.
Er What I said then was true.
But it doesn't follow that he's in greater trouble now because
Smaller majority.
Er no.
It isn't a small majority in any serious sense of majority .
Smaller majority.
It is only small because a very limited number of Conservatives on the back benches are not totally reliable on too many occasions.
"And it tends to be I'm sad to have to say it, it tends to be a limited number of colleagues who are totally I think, removed from the mainstream of what the majority off us want to see, who are to prepared to withhold their voted in the House of Commons."
And I think that there's going to come a point.
"D I think John er put this question fairly to conference, If the Tories want to behave like the Labour party did, then we'll pay an electoral price for it."
I I'm not against I can't be against the right of a c of a member of parliament to withhold their vote from their government.
I have done it on about three occasions in a third of a century.
And I wouldn't change that vote and I respect people who are prepared to do it.
It requires guts and integrity.
I'm not against that.
But for the sort of College Green psychology and the and the
"For people who don't understand, College Green is the bit of greenery outside Westminster where people rush out to be interviewed on camera ."
"The dash The the the sort of headline dash out of the House of Commons, the moment the news breaks, to get on television with some quick quote."
"And then to withhold one's vote as with almost a matter of habit and routine, that cannot be in the best interests of the Conservative party."
"And you have to realize, none of us are there cos we've got happy smiling faces."
"We're there because the Conservative party chose us, and put us there."
Yeah but
And so we have obligations to them.
"But you're not there you're not in parliament to represent the Conservative party, you're in parliament to represent your constituents."
I I think you've got to just look at that constitutional concept.
And erm
insure documents anyway.
"We don't er  offer transit liability on documents because we only  that is a flat piece of paper to us, it isn't a valuable item."
"We don't con , the, you know, what the arrangement is."
Mm.
"If it's your marriage contract and you don't get married because you don't got, that's not our fault."
"We just  cos we don't ins , it's only a piece of paper to us, you see."
So documents do not get transit liability on them at all.
"And tenders and deadlines can be particularly sensitive to that, but you cannot offer transit liability."
"But even if this tape is going to record the last speech of  somebody famous and it didn't get and therefore they couldn't record it, that is co , the consequence of a delay, you know, a fall of snow or  our vehicle breaking down or something not being done, or missed some  in human, some human error, it's not our, we don't lay, we'll give, we'll insure or  offer transit liability on the value of the goods providing you've got additional full transit liability with us, but we won't for the loss of business because you didn't get it."
"Is that, can anybody think of a, a courier  of documents, it's still the same."
I think that's why super mail offers  on large goods.
Mm.
It's better than one.
Mm.
Mhm.
Yes.
"No we don't do ta , erm  the conditions of ca , there's, there's a slight sort of"
"on conditions of carriage for the same day operation but, not in that league at all."
"On super mail, if that item doesn't arrive in a set time"
Mm mm.
"what do you make up for, just their postage?"
It might be more mightn't it?
The consignment or
Yeah.
the nearest nearest service value.
"If they send out a document that weighs a kilo for tapes and they sent that one, they're losing twenty"
It'll lose it's value
rather than say if it doesn't arrive at a set time
That wouldn't make any difference.
then it's covered for them.
It's E
You've still got  your own brother.
Right.
Can everybody see that?
"You see, you could say, surely there shouldn't be a weaning conflict, because an offspring should say to itself, okay, my mother wants to wean me, to have more offspring, but those offspring she's gonna have are my siblings, I'm very closely related to them."
"In fact, I'm as closely related to them as my mother is, if you think about it, because I share half my genes with my four siblings and my mother shares half her genes with my four siblings."
"Therefore, our degree of relatedness is the same."
"Therefore, my self interest in having siblings and my mother's self interest in having children are the same."
But that argument is fallacious why?
"Oh, yes, I've only just said it."
Right.
"This is the important point, you have to know it."
That's the best way.
"But this is the way er  puts it, and I think it is a very good way of, of, of putting it, as both  and  say, the point is, that every individual offspring is twice as closely related to itself, as it is to its, to its siblings."
"So it's quite true of course, that the, the individual offspring wo may be affected by inaltruism."
"In other words, erm,whateve the R is greater than C. Do you remember our, our formula for penaltriate benefit of an altruistic act exceeds the cost discounted by the degree of  that's between a half normally."
The offspring ought to be so put to  that's perfectly true.
"However, the point you have to erm, recall, is that if it's a conflict between parental investment in a sibling and parental investment in myself, I am twice as closely related to myself as I am to my sibling."
"So when my parent is handing out the parental investment, I will be selected to want the parent to give the investment to my sibling if the benefit is twice as great as it would be to myself."
"But if it's less than twice as great, I'll want it for myself."
Does everybody see that?
"Right, now comes the next step."
How does the parent see it?
We've described it from the offspring's point of view.
How does the parent see it?
Because the parent doesn't see it the same way.
"How does the parent see it?you, you're a parent, you've got a unit of reproductive success."
"Erm, what you mean, if, if one  reacts about it"
Mm.
"Bear in mind that  see it but it's more likely to pass on energy units, because it's the stronger, you know."
It's more likely to reproduce it in  itself.
Yes.
"Yes, it might, it might, but, but, but now you're getting a little bit, you're getting a bit too, too sophisticated now, we're going to come on to that later."
It's not dangerous but she loses power.
At least she's got the daggerboard down there.
I see she's sailing more efficiently to windward.
Well it looks as if Suzanne is beginning to relax and enjoy it more now.
"She certainly is, after only a couple of circuits her confidence is growing."
"She's acting more naturally to the gusts, leaning out and then easing out the sheet."
It's all becoming a more natural process.
Well how was that?
It felt absolutely .
You did very very well.
Oh thank you very much.
Capsize.
This is the part of sailing which every beginner dreads.
"The boat's on its side in the water and you're nowhere to be seen but in fact it's all quite straightforward, neither the boat nor you can sink and it's simply a question of pulling the boat back upright again and carrying on sailing."
A deliberate capsize is part of every beginner's course.
Once you've tried it you'll lose all its fear for you.
"This is the easiest way of turning the boat over, to tack without moving."
"Swim clear of all the ropes, swim around to the back of the boat, pull the daggerboard down and then simply flip the boat upright again."
"With the Topper, you'll find that there's very little water in the cockpit and so you can start sailing almost immediately."
With a little more confidence you barely need to get your feet wet.
If the boat capsizes because it's overpowered  simply scramble into the high side until you end up standing on the daggerboard.
"Then lever the hull upright again and clamber back in, it's as simple as that."
The worst thing that can happen is for the boat to become totally inverted and here you need to slide the daggerboard quickly out before it drops through the hull.
Now the accent is on patience.
Just think of the resistance to the sail dragging through the water.
"You have to pull very slowly and carefully, try to jerk it and you'll bend or possibly break something."
"Once the rink breaks through the surface everything happens far more quickly, you scramble in and you're ready to sail again."
If things go drastically wrong and you're a long way from home and need to call for help the most effective way is with an orange smoke flare.
"If you see one of these from the shore, phone the coastguard."
Even if you're upright you might need to call for assistance.
Perhaps you're exhausted where you've had a gear problem.
While you're waiting roll the sail up round the mast.
And this was in training as well.
But is this not something you just have to put up with if you join the Army?
It's it's part of the toughening up process .
"No I do no, that's rubbish."
I don't who said that but that's rubbish.
That i it doesn't toughen you up at all.
"It doesn't toughen you up, it just turns you into a bag of nerves basically."
Aha.
"You've got two choices, you either stay and you take it or you leave."
"If you leave, you get caught, you get put in jail."
If you leave do you feel you've lost?
I mean there is a school of thought that
Yeah.
says if you can't take how would you be able to handle the front line .
"If you leave, if you leave let's say if you get caught and sent back then you're gonna get back you know twice as much as you had for the reason for leaving."
Have you learnt anything from the experience?
"Yeah I've learnt a lot basically, I've learnt erm erm  basically what sort of organization that is and those other ones I could mention as well which run along the same sort of lines erm I've learnt to look after myself"
Has it toughened you up?
Yeah it has.
"So some people might say perhaps perversely that it th it has achieved its desired effect, it's toughened you up ."
I think that depends on the individual.
"Well David Lightbown I mean er the brigadier said that these are very very occasional examples but from these stories that these gentlemen are telling us, and who are we to disbelieve them,the they make their claims, this is a very very serious problem in the Army."
"Perhaps some sensitivity is n needed for our young recruits, perhaps a a type of counselling is needed to help them?"
Would you agree with that?
No I don't.
"Erm I go along with the brigadier on this, I don't approve of any of the things I've heard this evening, and I don't believe that that is the normal course of action in the Army."
"I've been a soldier myself, I was a soldier a long long time ago and er er training was different in my day to what it is today."
"But I also have one of the largest training regiments in my constituency, and I see that unit erm in action a couple of times a year if if no more."
Now by and large it's a tough game being a soldier.
And the difference between being tough and responding rapidly to instruction and discipline and bullying is something that er you have to denote er i in this discussion tonight .
"Right fair enough, that's er that's a very fair point but is being thrown in a bath er full of excreta, bleach and urine part of the toughening process ?"
"No it's not it's qu it's quite disgraceful and nobody would approve of that and the co th th th th the Army if they got hold of anybody on that basis, they would court martial them immediately and they'd be very severely dealt with ."
"It's not a struggle, you're harnessing the elements and having fun."
Sailing upwind works the boat over the waves gently.
"Well it really looks as if you're having a lot of fun out there, John, but you are an expert."
Now I'm sure that screaming along with fifteen knot in a force six is really exciting but for a landlubber like myself it's certainly not on.
As I suspect it's not for many of the people here.
Well sailing is what you want it to be.
"For some of us it's pitting our strength against the elements, for others it's pitting our wits against other people by going racing and yet other people seek adventure by exploring new sailing areas and the beauty of a small sail boat like the Topper is that you can do all of these."
"In tidal waters like the Channel Islands, you must find out what the tides are doing."
That means looking up the tide tables to see the times of high and low water and the tidal stream  list to find the maximum rates.
In tide free waters like the Mediterranean we don't have the same problem but we still need to consult a chart to find out a suitable location for sailing.
That may be affected by the prevailing wind and we'll have to find a suitable launching site.
Well this is a beautiful boat.
"Presumably we can just go and load, rig up and away we go, can we?"
"Well, almost, in this particular bay it's fine, we know it's a public beach, we've checked on the map."
It's a different matter if you're sailing inland because most inland water is owned by somebody.
What about the er winds here?
"Well here we've got an onshore wind, that's perfect, because we know that if we get into trouble just get blown back ashore."
It's different if the wind's offshore because then it can be deceptively  close into the shore and further out bigger waves and if you get into trouble you're lost out to sea.
Right well we're all set.
Fancy a sail round here Suzanne?
"I think it sounds pretty good fun, I think we should go for it."
Right
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fun?
"doesn't actually seem to be a lot up there, are you sure we've brought everything?"
"Yes, that's the beauty of the Topper, we've got the sail in the bowels of the boot and everything else is on the roof."
"In fact when I keep my Topper at home over the winter, they just lift the whole thing up into the roof of the garage, keeps it right out of the way."
So all we've got to do now is to untie everything and go sailing.
"Now that you've learnt to sail on your own, the next step is to sail with other people."
That probably means buy a boat and joining a club.
"If you are of a competitive nature, most clubs provide the opportunity for you to start racing and there's no faster way into a pretty good technique than by sailing against more experienced people."
He promises that which is  I will lead you till the end of the age.
And Jesus was there with them.
And that made all the difference for them.
"And they turn to him, and he speaks a word that brings deliverance."
"And he gets up and sees the situation  and remember, he said, Jesus wasn't out for joy ride, he wasn't just passing an evening relaxing and unwinding and resting away from the crowd, he had gone into the boat for a purpose, he was going to the other side, and no storm was gonna stop him getting there!"
There was a man there who desperately needed deliverance!
He was possessed with a whole legion of demons!
"He was, he was,th they they took him, they chained him up, and they let him loose in the local cemetery, and left him there."
"You can imagine the population of th , of a nearby town, every now and again they would come down and perhaps throw some food over in this man's direction  a loaf of bread, a, a a a a a a, a hunk of meat or, some other food every now and again so he would keep alive."
But he ranted and raged and rampaged through the local cemetery.
So they tied him with chains but the demonic powers were so great in his life that he snapped them like new cords.
Here was a man who desperately needed Jesus!
And Jesus was going across to the other side to look for this man.
And no storm was gonna stop him.
And the disciples didn't know that of course.
They were just concerned for themselves.
We're gonna per perish!
We're gonna die!
"So Jesus when he sees their situation, he's not concerned by the storm by the way, he's not put out by that because he knows he's going to the other side, but for the sake of them  he gets up and he speaks the word, Jesus he said, peace."
Be still.
be muzzled!
Silence !
"He speaks that word of command and the wind ceases, it really is howling."
The seas calm.
And the disciples are happy once again.
"And Jesus asked them a question, he says to them, why are you so timid?"
How is it that you have no faith?
"And J B Phillips in his paraphrase he puts that last question like this, what has happened to your faith?"
"You see, it wasn't that they had no faith, they had faith  we were saying the other week when we were dealing with this, we all have faith  it's what we do with it."
"They had faith, their faith was in themselves and in bailing out, and they couldn't bail quick enough, and so their faith was not realizing anything  it wasn't producing the goods."
"They had had faith, they had seen Jesus perform miracles, they had seen him heal the sick, they had seen him give sight to the blind, they had seen some of the tremendous things that Jesus had done."
"They'd been there at the wedding, when the wine, that water had been turned into wine."
And there is Jesus asleep.
"Well we don't perhaps quite use that sort of language, but we start saying, well where is God in all this?"
If there is a God of love why doesn't he see my situation?
"If there is a God of love, a God who cares then why doesn't he do something about it?"
Why doesn't help me?
Why doesn't make a way of escape for me?
Where is this God of love  when I'm going through this situation?
"Now that's a question that we can all come up with at times, whether we're Christians or non-Christians, we come up and we question, where is God in this situation?"
Why doesn't he do something about it?
"If he is there, if there is a God, can he not do something?"
Why can't he help me?
"As I said, life is not all plain sailing, there are troubles, there are storms  and some of them are very fierce  and some of them would cause us to, to wonder if there is an escape."
"Now that doesn't matter whether we're Christians or not Christians, that is the course of life, that happens to every one of us."
"Becoming a Christian is not the solution and the answer and the  th the grand elixir , it solves all of life's problems, it takes away all the difficulties."
"Jesus Christ never ever made that claim, in fact he said, before you follow me, count the cost."
Weigh up what it will cost you to commit your life to me.
"It's not an escape route from all your troubles and all your problems, it's not an escape route from all the difficulties and all the unpleasant things in life, it's not a pathway of ease and of, of in , of un paralleled bliss and enjoyment day after day."
The sun will not always shine on you.
"Jesus said before you follow me, count the cost."
Weigh it all up.
But don't be a fair weather man.
Don't be a fair weather follower .
"And when the difficulty gets going, gets hard you turn back, he says don't do that."
"But before you start, count the cost."
"He said that a man who's gonna build a, build something, let's put it in a modern setting, the man who's gonna, a man and woman, a couple are gonna put an extension on their house, they don't just go down and buy a few dozen bricks, er, and a bag cement and start, they work out how much it's gonna cost them first of all."
"You see, they might have enough for that first barrel load of bricks, and the first bag of cement and sand  but perhaps the money will run out shortly after that?"
"And they've got is just a, perhaps a a, a few courses of brickwork."
"They might even get half the wall up, but that's as far as their capital goes."
"He says no, he says any man wanting to build an extension on his house, he's gonna sit down and gonna count the cost of it."
He's gonna see how much it's gonna cost him in pounds and pence.
He's then gonna look at his bank account and see if he can afford it or not.
"And he'll only start the job if he can afford it, that's if he's a wise man."
"I mean at one stage we go back a hundred years — back to Dalton  he thought of his atoms as being fundamental entities that could never be broken up, whereas now we know that an atom is a very complicated structure and we can measure things about atoms, we can measure the  distribution, we can where the electrons and so on are."
Nuclei — there's been a tremendous amount of work done on nuclei.
We know the shapes of nuclei.
"We know there are round ones, there are long thin ones, there are cigar shaped ones, there are disc shaped ones."
"They turned out not to be elementary at all, they are complex things."
"Neutrons and protons are now believed not to be elementary, that inside them they have quarks."
"Even now there are theories which say that quarks are made up of other things and so on, so I mean who knows."
I think simply it's unknown.
"Jim, I'd love to keep going here and ask you a whole lot more questions."
Unfortunately that's all the time we have today.
Next week there'll be another programme in our series Ideas in Action.
"Until next week then, goodbye."
Hello.
"In this short series we're looking at the boundaries of science, and we're asking questions such as‘How cold can we get?’ and ‘What is the smallest particle that we can envisage?’."
"Today, by contrast, we're going to the other extreme."
We're going to peer into space and try to imagine the huge distances involved.
"Our guide is Robert Smith, who's an astronomer at the university."
"Robert, let's start by trying to put ourselves into context."
We're on a planet.
"Yes, and this planet is moving round the sun, which is part of the solar system."
"The solar system contains not only our own planet, but also many other planets, at varying distances from the sun."
And the whole size of the solar system is something like forty astronomical units.
"We're going to have to talk about what astronomical units are in a moment, but let's go on in terms of size."
"We're part of this particular system, what comes next?"
"The sun is just a star, one of many thousands of millions of stars in our own galaxy, which is the milky way, which we see as we look up in the sky on a very dark night, and it was called the milky way by the ancients because it looked like a splash of milk across the sky, but we now know that it's a flattened system consisting of these thousands of millions of stars."
"So we're actually part of the milky way system, the galaxy?"
Yes.
Which is the milky way?
Yes.
Are there many other galaxies in the universe?
Oh yes.
There are thousands of galaxies.
That's where it comes from.
"It comes to us, we have to put it through the House of Commons."
And often we are the people who embroider it and overbear it with all the complications ent that that are that are part of it.
And do you know where a lot of the the erm the directives from Brussels come from?
"They come from British pressure groups, who go to Brussels with their particular case and argue in Brussels to start the process of creating these regulations."
"Alright, let's lets look at some something else where people will say, are saying, the party has shifted, clearly clearly shifted towards the right."
And that's social policy.
"Erm and and I know you I'm not expecting you to comment on your colleagues, but let me quote something else that Peter Lilley said, The massive expansion of the welfare state since the war, has not been accompanied by any diminution of social problems."
Any diminution of social problems.
That's sending quite a signal isn't it.
Well I'd go further.
They're worse.
So poverty is worse?
Er not relative not relative poverty because obviously the tide of prosperity has brought up the living standards of er the western world.
"It's better not to have to have pensions than not to have pensions, surely not ."
But but but look at the look.
"Oh no no no oh no that th er I that is not in er what I was talking about was the social values, er not the existence of the welfare state."
That has I mean most of the welfare state has been er it'll either created or extended by Conservative government so
But Beveridge achieved nothing?
"Er no, Beveridge did, but he never intended to achieve what we've got."
"Er  I mean, you will know that I wrote a book  called No time for Ostriches in when I was on the back benches, in favour of work fare."
"Er I I think that with three million people out of work, we have an unemployment problem which creates erm a a disadvantage group particularly in some of the stress urban areas where we have to look at more radical solutions to what is basically the payment of cash for nothing in return."
"Now I have said that, it's not government policy, perhaps I'm stretching over the bounds of saying it, but er those these ideas are around."
"But clearly, what you have said in the past has led us to believe that you think self help does not solve all the problems, the government now seems to be telling us"
You can't how can how can you talk about self help solving all the problems when you've got an aging population who'll never work again.
I'm talking about people who are already retired.
"There's absolutely no point in saying to some sixty five year old or or seventy year old who's living on a state pension in a council house, What you've got to do is help yourself."
What's it mean?
So the government must help?
The state must help ?
Well what c what what a what does the language of self help mean to a seventy year old living on a state pension in a council house?
What does it mean?
Well this boat's fitted with the  race pack which gives it a lot of the extra controls that you'd expect on a larger sail boat.
"First of all we've got the kicking strap  three to one purchase, the down-haul has a three to one purchase, and the out-haul, that's got a four to one purchase."
It all sounds a lot more complicated now aren't you just making extra work for yourself?
"No, in fact it makes life easier."
"Three to one, four to one, that simply means that it's that much easier to pull everything in."
"the scale along the boom there, one to ten, what does that mean?"
Well that's for consistency of sail setting.
"If you know that for your particular weight and the certain wind strength you want the block next to number four, you keep it like that all the time."
"You can always go straight through it, it would be right every time?"
Yes.
"In your enthusiasm to get afloat in a good breeze, it's easy to forget about getting the right sail shape and the effect can be dreadful."
"Just look at this, the sail is far too full for the conditions, the foot is billowing out  and the luff is horribly wrinkled which has got too much power there, it's a bag of wind."
"The general rule is if it looks bad, it probably is bad, so let's get it right."
First we tension the foot and then the luff until we get a properly shaped aerofoil.
Another classic mistake is to forget to tighten the kitten strap for boom bang.
When you're beating it doesn't matter because the boom is held down by the mainsheet.
"If you don't tension the boom bang when you're sailing off wind, the boom will just lift, the sail roll twist and you'll get bags of uncontrollable power."
"The way to tighten it is when you're on a beat, just pull it in as the tension is taken by the mainsheet."
What are so special about these racing birds of a ?
The other thing we've got is a ratchet block on the mainsheets.
What does that mean?
I'll tell you.
Hear that noise?
Aha.
"That's a ratchet locking the sheets, so all the load is taken by the block and I'm just holding it."
That means that you can sail for longer.
"Strong winds without getting tired, so it's a lot more fun."
It's also pretty wet but with the ratchet block taking the strain out of controlling the sail I can concentrate on technique and having fun  and respond to the gusts by sheeting in or sheeting out if I'm overpowered and moving bodyweight in or out to suit the .
"Even with the boat sailing flat a certain amount of spray goes aboard, so get the bailer down to drain the cockpit."
The daggerboard is raised slightly from the same position in lighter winds because the boat's sailing faster.
If the wind drops a bit then you can sit inboard more to keep the boat flat.
This is what sailing is really all about.
"Okay Suzanne, keep on feeding it through."
"Fine, now we're ready to tie the top of the halyard to the top of the sail."
There are a few knots that we need to learn when we're sailing.
This particular one is called a rail turn and two half hitches  it needs to be tight so that it doesn't come undone when we're out there.
"Okay Suzanne, now you had to slacken off the halyard to let me tie that last knot so if you could tighten it up again that will pull the sail up to the top of the mast."
"That's fine, now all we've got to do is to tidy up this end of the halyard and tuck it out of the way."
"You will see that most sailors are tidy around the boat particularly with loose ends of rope, and there is a very good safety reason."
"If you leave them lying around, then you're liable to trip over them."
Fair enough.
"Now before we step the mast, we need to turn the boat more or less into the wind and that's a good chance for us to start thinking about where the wind's coming from."
Where's it coming from today?
At the moment it's coming from over there.
"That's right, so we need to turn the boat round and line it up like this."
Right.
Let's go.
Okay.
"It is nice, isn't it?"
Now your next feature of the Topper is this special mast gate.
"We open it up like that, slide the mast in, slide it shut again, put the toggle in."
A little knot here just so there's no risk of it coming out and off we go
Right.
"so that's how it works, open it up and get the mast."
You will probably find it easiest to slide the mast in at an angle like this until the collar fits neatly underneath the mast gate.
"At the moment the sail is only attached down its needed edge but before we can use it, we've got to control it properly and that means to tuck it in the boot  the jaws clip on here, the down-haul clips on to the sail and is threaded through the jaws before we make it up on the cleat  the position of the boom and hence the sail relative to the wind is controlled by this rope, the mainsheet."
The next thing to attach is the kicking strap or boom bang.
This is used to control the twist in the sail and to stop the boom riding too high.
At this stage you simply clip it on and leave it slack.
"This other cleat is for adjusting the out-haul, we'll come on to that in a moment."
"To attach the sail to the boom we have two clips, one simply holds the sail down to the boom, whilst the other one, the out-haul is used to bury the tension on the foot of the sail."
The rudder and tiller assembly simply slot on to the back of the boat but the important thing to remember is that the tiller must go underneath the rope force before the rudder is clipped on.
Otherwise the mainsheet won't be able to slide over freely.
The kick up design at the top of the rudder means that it's particularly easy to fit on the beach.
That will reduce your rate of drift and avoid the risk of further capsize.
So you tie it up neatly out of the way.
"Then you can signal for help in the approved method, raising and lowering your arms slowly."
It may be tiring but keep signalling until you're absolutely certain that somebody has seen you and is on their way.
"As the rescue boat approaches, prepare to be towed by taking the daggerboard out and get your painter ready to pass to the rescue boat."
"This is more my kind of sailing, rescuing damsels in distress."
Rescue boats are extremely important.
Good sailing centres will have at least one and certainly the R Y A ones do and they're important because if beginners get into difficulties out on the water you need to be able to get to them as quickly as possible and it also gives them a sense of security to have one of these things around.
Are you alright like that?
The  get her into shore.
"So you've shown us all the basic techniques of sailing and more importantly how to get yourself rescued should things get out of hand but apart from the dubious pleasure of capsizing, are there any other ways of getting thoroughly wet?"
"As with any other sport, Howard, the real exhilaration of sailing, comes when you're going faster and that can certainly mean getting wet."
"In our case the wind is the driving force, so let's now look at strong wind technique."
"In strong winds we don't want beginners to be overpowered and so we reduce the sail area, that's known as reefing."
"Okay, so how do you do that on, on this?"
On a Topper it's very simple.
"You simply ease off the out-haul, take the kicker off completely and then we rotate the mast, then just wind the sail up."
When we've finished we tension the out-haul and put the kitty strap back on.
Well that thing's pretty easy if you're doing it on the beach but what if you're out in the water and it suddenly gusts up.
Just how easy is it to do that?
Well it's always better to reef ashore if you can but if you do get caught out you can reef afloat just the same.
"I remember the time I was out there struggling in a strong wind, the boat was definitely overpowered."
I had to use a lot of rudder to keep sailing on a straight course.
"If a boat heeled right over it's not good for the boat and it slows you down, it is far better to reef, the technique is just the same afloat as it was ashore."
Roll the sail around the mast until it's reduced in area.
"In these conditions I wanted to get rid of about a third of the original sail area and so that's it, now I'm sailing much more happily instead of struggling against the boat I'm sailing in harmony again."
The excess sail is rolled up neatly around the mast out of the way and still I've good a good sail shape.
That means I can sail happily upwind or downwind in perfect control the whole time.
That's  to an expert sailor to reef wasn't it because of course the stronger the wind the more exciting the sailing
"Absolutely so if we move over from Suzanne's boat over to mine, we'll see some of the fittings which make the boat go faster."
Okay?
Right so what have we got here?
"It was red and hot , and now and again it was a little darkened -- as it were , the embers of a bonfire smouldering ."
For the life of me I could not think what it might be .
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing .
"The western end was already steeped in moonshine ; the rest , and the block house itself , still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light ."
"On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon ."
There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze .
"I stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also ."
"It had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain 's orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent ."
"I stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade ."
"To make assurance surer , I got upon my hands and knees and crawled , without a sound , towards the corner of the house ."
"As I drew nearer , my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened ."
"It is not a pleasant noise in itself , and I have often complained of it at other times , but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep ."
"The sea-cry of the watch , that beautiful `` All 's well , '' never fell more reassuringly on my ear ."
"In the meantime , there was no doubt of one thing ; they kept an infamous bad watch ."
"If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them , not a soul would have seen daybreak ."
"That was what it was , thought I , to have the captain wounded ; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard ."
"For the next two hours the girls wrote busily , forgetting all about the rainy day , and enjoying their epistolary labours to the full ."
It was dusk when all the letters were finished .
"`` Why , has n't the afternoon gone quickly after all ! ''"
exclaimed Carol .
`` I just let my pen run on and jotted down any good working idea that came into my head .
"Cyrilla Blair , that big fat letter is never for Miss Marshall !"
What on earth did you find to write her ? ''
"`` It was n't so hard when I got fairly started , '' said Cyrilla , smiling ."
"`` Now , let 's hunt up Nora Jane and send the letters around so that everybody can read his or hers before tea-time ."
We should have a choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns and sighs we had at dinner . ''
"Miss Emily Marshall was at that moment sitting in her little back room , all alone in the dusk , with the rain splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside ."
Miss Marshall was feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked -- and as she had often felt in her life of sixty years .
She told herself bitterly that she had n't a friend in the world -- not even one who cared enough for her to come and see her or write her a letter now and then .
"She thought her boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their dislike , without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were responsible for it ."
She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter came faintly down the hall from the front room where The Trio were writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into them .
"`` If they were old and lonesome and friendless they would n't see much in life to laugh at , I guess , '' said Miss Marshall bitterly , drawing her shawl closer about her sharp shoulders ."
`` They never think of anything but themselves and if a day passes that they do n't have ` some fun ' they think it 's a fearful thing to put up with .
I 'm sick and tired of their giggling and whispering . ''
In the midst of these amiable reflections Miss Marshall heard a knock at her door .
"When she opened it there stood Nora Jane , her broad red face beaming with smiles ."
"`` Please , Miss , here 's a letter for you , '' she said ."
`` A letter for me ! ''
Miss Marshall shut her door and stared at the fat envelope in amazement .
Who could have written it ?
The postman came only in the morning .
"Was it some joke , perhaps ?"
Those giggling girls ?
Miss Marshall 's face grew harder as she lighted her lamp and opened the letter suspiciously .
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , '' it ran in Cyrilla 's pretty girlish writing , `` we girls are so lonesome and dull that we have decided to write rainy-day letters to everybody in the house just to cheer ourselves up ."
So I 'm going to write to you just a letter of friendly nonsense . ''
"Pages of `` nonsense '' followed , and very delightful nonsense it was , for Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing ."
"She commented wittily on all the amusing episodes of the boarding-house life for the past month ; she described a cat-fight she had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines ; she described a lovely new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the class party to which she had worn it ; she gave an account of her vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page a number of small snapshots taken during the outing ; she copied a joke she had read in the paper that morning and discussed the serial story in the boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading ; she wrote out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made -- Miss Marshall had a mania for crocheting ; and she finally wound up with `` all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to carry from your friend , Cyrilla Blair . ''"
I 'm all right .
"Do n't squeeze the breath out of me , please , '' expostulated Jack , looking so startled and innocent , as he struggled feebly , that they all laughed , and this plaintive protest caused him to be released ."
"But the next proceeding did not enlighten him much , for Frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it , while Mamma made a charge at Jill , as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody ."
`` Hullo ! ''
"said Jack , when he got the letter into his own hand and read it ."
`` Now who put Bob up to this ?
"Nobody had any business to interfere -- but it 's mighty good of him , anyway , '' he added , as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away , while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word ."
`` I did ! ''
"cried Jill , clapping her hands , and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to ."
`` Who told you he was in the scrape ? ''
"demanded Jack , in a hurry to know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips ."
"`` You did ; '' and Jill 's face twinkled with naughty satisfaction , for this was the best fun of all ."
`` I did n't !
When ?
Where ?
It 's a joke ! ''
"`` You did , '' cried Jill , pointing to the rug ."
"`` You went to sleep there after the long walk , and talked in your sleep about ` Bob ' and ` All right , old boy , ' and ever so much gibberish ."
"I did n't think about it then , but when I heard that Bob was up there I thought may be he knew something about it , and last night I wrote and asked him , and that 's the answer , and now it is all right , and you are the best boy that ever was , and I 'm so glad ! ''"
"Here Jill paused , all out of breath , and Frank said , with an approving pat on the head , -- `` It wo n't do to have such a sharp young person round if we are going to have secrets ."
"You 'd make a good detective , miss . ''"
`` Catch me taking naps before people again ; '' and Jack looked rather crestfallen that his own words had set `` Fine Ear '' on the track .
"`` Never mind , I did n't mean to tell , though I just ached to do it all the time , so I have n't broken my word ."
"I 'm glad you all know , but you need n't let it get out , for Bob is a good fellow , and it might make trouble for him , '' added Jack , anxious lest his gain should be the other 's loss ."
"`` I shall tell Mr. Acton myself , and the Captain , also , for I 'm not going to have my son suspected of wrong-doing when he has only tried to help a friend , and borne enough for his sake , '' said Mamma , much excited by this discovery of generous fidelity in her boy ; though when one came to look at it calmly , one saw that it might have been done in a wiser way ."
"`` Now , please , do n't make a fuss about it ; that would be most as bad as having every one down on me ."
"I can stand your praising me , but I wo n't be patted on the head by anybody else ; '' and Jack assumed a manly air , though his face was full of genuine boyish pleasure at being set right in the eyes of those he loved ."
"`` I 'll be discreet , dear , but you owe it to yourself , as well as Bob , to have the truth known ."
"Both have behaved well , and no harm will come to him , I am sure ."
"I 'll see to that myself , '' said Mrs. Minot , in a tone that set Jack 's mind at rest on that point ."
"`` Now do tell all about it , '' cried Jill , who was pining to know the whole story , and felt as if she had earned the right to hear it ."
"`` Oh , it was n't much ."
"`` Patience is a tired mare but she jogs on , '' said Susan ."
"`` While the steeds of Armageddon thunder , trampling over our hearts , '' retorted Miss Oliver ."
"`` Susan , tell me -- do n't you ever -- did n't you ever -- take spells of feeling that you must scream -- or swear -- or smash something -- just because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable ? ''"
"`` I have never sworn or desired to swear , Miss Oliver dear , but I will admit , '' said Susan , with the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all , `` that I have experienced occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging . ''"
"`` Do n't you think that is a kind of swearing , Susan ?"
"What is the difference between slamming a door viciously and saying d -- '' `` Miss Oliver dear , '' interrupted Susan , desperately determined to save Gertrude from herself , if human power could do it , `` you are all tired out and unstrung -- and no wonder , teaching those obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news ."
But just you go upstairs and lie down and I will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will not want to slam doors or swear . ''
"`` Susan , you 're a good soul -- a very pearl of Susans !"
"But , Susan , it would be such a relief -- to say just one soft , low , little tiny d -- '' `` I will bring you a hot-water bottle for the soles of your feet , also , '' interposed Susan resolutely , `` and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of , Miss Oliver , and that you may tie to . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll try the hot-water bottle first , '' said Miss Oliver , repenting herself on teasing Susan and vanishing upstairs , to Susan 's intense relief ."
Susan shook her head ominously as she filled the hot-water bottle .
The war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour woefully .
Here was Miss Oliver admittedly on the point of profanity .
"`` We must draw the blood from her brain , '' said Susan , `` and if this bottle is not effective I will see what can be done with a mustard plaster . ''"
Gertrude rallied and carried on .
"Lord Kitchener went to Greece , whereat Susan foretold that Constantine would soon experience a change of heart ."
Lloyd George began to heckle the Allies regarding equipment and guns and Susan said you would hear more of Lloyd George yet .
"The gallant Anzacs withdrew from Gallipoli and Susan approved the step , with reservations ."
The siege of Kut-El-Amara began and Susan pored over maps of Mesopotamia and abused the Turks .
Henry Ford started for Europe and Susan flayed him with sarcasm .
"Sir John French was superseded by Sir Douglas Haig and Susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream , `` though , to be sure , Haig was a good name and French had a foreign sound , say what you might . ''"
"Not a move on the great chess-board of king or bishop or pawn escaped Susan , who had once read only Glen St. Mary notes ."
"`` There was a time , '' she said sorrowfully , `` when I did not care what happened outside of P.E. Island , and now a king can not have a toothache in Russia or China but it worries me ."
"It may be broadening to the mind , as the doctor said , but it is very painful to the feelings . ''"
When Christmas came again Susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board .
Two empty chairs were too much even for Susan who had thought in September that there would not be one .
"`` This is the first Christmas that Walter was not home , '' Rilla wrote in her diary that night ."
"`` Jem used to be away for Christmases up in Avonlea , but Walter never was ."
I had letters from Ken and him today .
They are still in England but expect to be in the trenches very soon .
And then -- but I suppose we 'll be able to endure it somehow .
"To me , the strangest of all the strange things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we could -- to go on with life as a matter of course ."
"At all events , though he told her grumpily that she had made a nice fool of herself , and would live to regret it , he said nothing worse , and Mrs. Joe put on her apron and went to work as usual , while Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who had a poor opinion of lighthouses for winter residences , went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox , a thankful dog that he was done with war-weddings ."
"CHAPTER XIX `` THEY SHALL NOT PASS '' One cold grey morning in February Gertrude Oliver wakened with a shiver , slipped into Rilla 's room , and crept in beside her ."
`` Rilla -- I 'm frightened -- frightened as a baby -- I 've had another of my strange dreams .
Something terrible is before us -- I know . ''
`` What was it ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` I was standing again on the veranda steps -- just as I stood in that dream on the night before the lighthouse dance , and in the sky a huge black , menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the east ."
I could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me I shivered with icy cold .
"Then the storm broke -- and it was a dreadful storm -- blinding flash after flash and deafening peal after peal , driving torrents of rain ."
"I turned in panic and tried to run for shelter , and as I did so a man -- a soldier in the uniform of a French army officer -- dashed up the steps and stood beside me on the threshold of the door ."
"His clothes were soaked with blood from a wound in his breast , he seemed spent and exhausted ; but his white face was set and his eyes blazed in his hollow face ."
"` They shall not pass , ' he said , in low , passionate tones which I heard distinctly amid all the turmoil of the storm ."
Then I awakened .
"Rilla , I 'm frightened -- the spring will not bring the Big Push we 've all been hoping for -- instead it is going to bring some dreadful blow to France ."
I am sure of it .
The Germans will try to smash through somewhere . ''
"`` But he told you that they would not pass , '' said Rilla , seriously ."
She never laughed at Gertrude 's dreams as the doctor did .
"`` I do not know if that was prophecy or desperation , Rilla , the horror of that dream holds me yet in an icy grip ."
We shall need all our courage before long . ''
"Dr. Blythe did laugh at the breakfast table -- but he never laughed at Miss Oliver 's dreams again ; for that day brought news of the opening of the Verdun offensive , and thereafter through all the beautiful weeks of spring the Ingleside family , one and all , lived in a trance of dread ."
There were days when they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the Germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate France .
"Susan 's deeds were in her spotless kitchen at Ingleside , but her thoughts were on the hills around Verdun ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she would stick her head in at Mrs. Blythe 's door the last thing at night to remark , `` I do hope the French have hung onto the Crow 's Wood today , '' and she woke at dawn to wonder if Dead Man 's Hill -- surely named by some prophet -- was still held by the `` poyloos . ''"
Susan could have drawn a map of the country around Verdun that would have satisfied a chief of staff .
"`` If the Germans capture Verdun the spirit of France will be broken , '' Miss Oliver said bitterly ."
"`` But they will not capture it , '' staunchly said Susan , who could not eat her dinner that day for fear lest they do that very thing ."
"`` In the first place , you dreamed they would not -- you dreamed the very thing the French are saying before they ever said it -- ` they shall not pass . '"
"I declare to you , Miss Oliver , dear , when I read that in the paper , and remembered your dream , I went cold all over with awe ."
It seemed to me like Biblical times when people dreamed things like that quite frequently .
"`` I know -- I know , '' said Gertrude , walking restlessly about ."
"`` I cling to a persistent faith in my dream , too -- but every time bad news comes it fails me ."
`` B ... b ... but m ... m ... miss ... th ... th ... they 're ... '' gasped Joe in desperation .
"`` Joseph , are you going to obey me or are you NOT ? ''"
said Anne .
A bolder and more self-possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes .
This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before .
"Joe , with an agonized glance at St. Clair , went to the stove , opened the big , square front door , and threw the blue and white parcel in , before St. Clair , who had sprung to his feet , could utter a word ."
Then he dodged back just in time .
For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred .
"The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain Mrs. Hiram 's nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St. Clair Donnell 's father the day before , intending to have a birthday celebration that evening ."
"The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room , hissing and spluttering ."
Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks .
"Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St. Clair , helpless with laughter , rocked to and fro in the aisle ."
Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics .
"It seemed a long time , although it was really only a few minutes , before the last pinwheel subsided ."
"Anne , recovering herself , sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room ."
"Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch , where Barbara Shaw , in an agony of desire to be useful , poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillie 's face and shoulders before anyone could stop her ."
It was a full hour before quiet was restored ... but it was a quiet that might be felt .
Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teacher 's mental atmosphere .
"Nobody , except Anthony Pye , dared whisper a word ."
"Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum , caught Anne 's eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up ."
The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy .
The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives .
"Chester Sloane , spelling `` odoriferous '' with two f 's , was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it , either in this world or that which is to come ."
"Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea-tables , but the knowledge only angered her further ."
In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible ; so she ignored it in icy disdain .
When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pye 's .
"He peered across his book at Anne , his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery ."
"Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer , scampered over the desk , and leaped to the floor ."
"Anne screamed and sprang back , as if it had been a snake , and Anthony Pye laughed aloud ."
"Then a silence fell ... a very creepy , uncomfortable silence ."
"Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not , especially as she did n't know just where the mouse had gone ."
But she decided not to .
"It comes -- we may say -- he was your true companion ; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit , for I dare say you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows ."
"Well , well , these days are fortunately by ; and I think -LRB- speaking humanly -RRB- that you are near the end of your troubles . ''"
"As he thus moralised on my adventures , he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction ."
"I had been so long wandering with lawless people , and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky , that to sit once more in a clean , covered house , and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth , seemed mighty elevations ."
"Even as I thought so , my eye fell on my unseemly tatters , and I was once more plunged in confusion ."
But the lawyer saw and understood me .
"He rose , called over the stair to lay another plate , for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner , and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house ."
"Here he set before me water and soap , and a comb ; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son ; and here , with another apposite tag , he left me to my toilet ."
"CHAPTER XXVIII I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE I made what change I could in my appearance ; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past , and David Balfour come to life again ."
"And yet I was ashamed of the change too , and , above all , of the borrowed clothes ."
"When I had done , Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair , made me his compliments , and had me again into the cabinet ."
"`` Sit ye down , Mr. David , '' said he , `` and now that you are looking a little more like yourself , let me see if I can find you any news ."
"You will be wondering , no doubt , about your father and your uncle ?"
To be sure it is a singular tale ; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you .
"For , '' says he , really with embarrassment , `` the matter hinges on a love affair . ''"
"`` Truly , '' said I , `` I can not very well join that notion with my uncle . ''"
"`` But your uncle , Mr. David , was not always old , '' replied the lawyer , `` and what may perhaps surprise you more , not always ugly ."
"He had a fine , gallant air ; people stood in their doors to look after him , as he went by upon a mettle horse ."
"I have seen it with these eyes , and I ingenuously confess , not altogether without envy ; for I was a plain lad myself and a plain man 's son ; and in those days it was a case of Odi te , qui bellus es , Sabelle . ''"
"`` It sounds like a dream , '' said I. `` Ay , ay , '' said the lawyer , `` that is how it is with youth and age ."
"Nor was that all , but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future ."
"In 1715 , what must he do but run away to join the rebels ?"
"It was your father that pursued him , found him in a ditch , and brought him back multum gementem ; to the mirth of the whole country ."
"However , majora canamus -- the two lads fell in love , and that with the same lady ."
"Mr. Ebenezer , who was the admired and the beloved , and the spoiled one , made , no doubt , mighty certain of the victory ; and when he found he had deceived himself , screamed like a peacock ."
"The whole country heard of it ; now he lay sick at home , with his silly family standing round the bed in tears ; now he rode from public-house to public-house , and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom , Dick , and Harry ."
"Your father , Mr. David , was a kind gentleman ; but he was weak , dolefully weak ; took all this folly with a long countenance ; and one day -- by your leave !"
-- resigned the lady .
"She was no such fool , however ; it 's from her you must inherit your excellent good sense ; and she refused to be bandied from one to another ."
Both got upon their knees to her ; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door .
That was in August ; dear me !
the same year I came from college .
"In the first place , Miranda , in spite of her dress and veil , was such a flat-faced , commonplace , uninteresting little bride ."
"In the second place , Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony , and this vexed Miranda unreasonably ."
"Long afterwards she told Rilla , `` I just felt like saying to him then and there , ` If you feel so bad over having to marry me you do n't have to . '"
But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me . ''
"In the third place , Jims , who was usually so well-behaved in public , took a fit of shyness and contrariness combined and began to cry at the top of his voice for `` Willa . ''"
"Nobody wanted to take him out , because everybody wanted to see the marriage , so Rilla who was a bridesmaid , had to take him and hold him during the ceremony ."
"In the fourth place , Sir Wilfrid Laurier took a fit ."
Sir Wilfrid was entrenched in a corner of the room behind Miranda 's piano .
"During his seizure he made the weirdest , most unearthly noises ."
"He would begin with a series of choking , spasmodic sounds , continuing into a gruesome gurgle , and ending up with a strangled howl ."
"Nobody could hear a word Mr. Meredith was saying , except now and then , when Sir Wilfrid stopped for breath ."
"Nobody looked at the bride except Susan , who never dragged her fascinated eyes from Miranda 's face -- all the others were gazing at the dog ."
Miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as Sir Wilfrid began his performance she forgot it .
All that she could think of was that her dear dog was dying and she could not go to him .
She never remembered a word of the ceremony .
"Rilla , who in spite of Jims , had been trying her best to look rapt and romantic , as beseemed a war bridesmaid , gave up the hopeless attempt , and devoted her energies to choking down untimely merriment ."
"She dared not look at anybody in the room , especially Mrs. Dead Angus , for fear all her suppressed mirth should suddenly explode in a most un-young-ladylike yell of laughter ."
"But married they were , and then they had a wedding-supper in the dining-room which was so lavish and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a month 's labour ."
Everybody had brought something .
"Mrs. Dead Angus had brought a large apple-pie , which she placed on a chair in the dining-room and then absently sat down on it ."
"Neither her temper nor her black silk wedding garment was improved thereby , but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast ."
Mrs. Dead Angus eventually took it home with her again .
"Whiskers-on-the-moon 's pacifist pig should not get it , anyhow ."
"That evening Mr. and Mrs. Joe , accompanied by the recovered Sir Wilfrid , departed for the Four Winds Lighthouse , which was kept by Joe 's uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief honeymoon ."
"Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes , tidied up , left a cold supper and Miranda 's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor , and walked home , while the mystic veil of dreamy , haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen ."
"`` I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself , '' remarked Susan sentimentally ."
But Rilla felt rather flat -- perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirty-six hours .
"She was disappointed somehow -- the whole affair had been so ludicrous , and Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace ."
"`` If Miranda had n't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he would n't have had that fit , '' she said crossly ."
"`` I warned her -- but she said she could n't starve the poor dog -- he would soon be all she had left , etc. ."
I could have shaken her . ''
"`` The best man was more excited than Joe was , '' said Susan ."
"I frolicked in the park with dogs , sailed boats in the Back Bay with strange boys , dined with a little Irish beggar-girl on salt fish and potatoes , and was found at last fast asleep on a door-step with my arms round a great dog ."
"It was late in the evening , and I was a dirty as a little pig , and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled so far . ''"
`` How nice ! ''
"cried Nan , looking all ready to go and do it herself ."
`` It was not nice next day ; '' and Mrs. Jo tried to keep her eyes from betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers .
`` Did your mother whip you ? ''
"asked Nan , curiously ."
"`` She never whipped me but once , and then she begged my pardon , or I do n't think I ever should have forgiven her , it hurt my feelings so much . ''"
`` Why did she beg your pardon ?
my father do n't . ''
"`` Because , when she had done it , I turned round and said , ` Well , you are mad yourself , and ought to be whipped as much as me . '"
"She looked at me a minute , then her anger all died out , and she said , as if ashamed , ` You are right , Jo , I am angry ; and why should I punish you for being in a passion when I set you such a bad example ?"
"Forgive me , dear , and let us try to help one another in a better way . '"
"I never forgot it , and it did me more good than a dozen rods . ''"
"Nan sat thoughtfully turning the little cold-cream jar for a minute , and Mrs. Jo said nothing , but let that idea get well into the busy little mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her ."
"`` I like that , '' said Nan , presently , and her face looked less elfish , with its sharp eyes , inquisitive nose , and mischievous mouth ."
`` What did your mother do to you when you ran away that time ? ''
"`` She tied me to the bed-post with a long string , so that I could not go out of the room , and there I stayed all day with the little worn-out shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault . ''"
"`` I should think that would cure anybody , '' cried Nan , who loved her liberty above all things ."
"`` It did cure me , and I think it will you , so I am going to try it , '' said Mrs. Jo , suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her work-table ."
"Nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument now , and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs. Jo tied one end round her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa , saying , as she finished , `` I do n't like to tie you up like a naughty little dog , but if you do n't remember any better than a dog , I must treat you like one . ''"
"`` I 'd just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog ; '' and Nan put on a do n't - care face , and began to growl and grovel on the floor ."
"Mrs. Jo took no notice , but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to hem , she went away , and left Miss Nan to her own devices ."
"This was not agreeable , and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord ."
"But it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind , so she began on the knot at the other end ."
"It soon came loose , and , gathering it up , Nan was about to get out of the window , when she heard Mrs. Jo say to somebody as she passed through the hall , `` No , I do n't think she will run away now ; she is an honorable little girl , and knows that I do it to help her . ''"
"In a minute , Nan whisked back , tied herself up , and began to sew violently ."
"Rob came in a moment after , and was so charmed with the new punishment , that he got a jump-rope and tethered himself to the other arm of the sofa in the most social manner ."
"`` I got lost too , so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan , '' he explained to his mother when she saw the new captive ."
"`` I 'm not sure that you do n't deserve a little punishment , for you knew it was wrong to go far away from the rest . ''"
"`` Nan took me , '' began Rob , willing to enjoy the novel penalty , but not willing to take the blame ."
`` You need n't have gone .
"Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation ; ten men , it was decided between them , should be reserved , not only to garrison the Moat House , but to escort the priest across the wood ."
"In the meantime , as Bennet was to remain behind , the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton ."
"Indeed , there was no choice ; the men were loutish fellows , dull and unskilled in war , while Dick was not only popular , but resolute and grave beyond his age ."
"Although his youth had been spent in these rough , country places , the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver , and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command ."
"Bennet had always been kind and helpful ; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies , but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends ; and now , while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write , in his swift , exquisite penmanship , a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master , Sir Daniel Brackley , Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise ."
"`` Ye must go the long way about , Master Shelton , '' he said ; `` round by the bridge , for your life !"
"Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you , to draw shots ; and go softly till y ' are past the wood ."
"If the rogues fall upon you , ride for ` t ; ye will do naught by standing ."
"And keep ever forward , Master Shelton ; turn me not back again , an ye love your life ; there is no help in Tunstall , mind ye that ."
"And now , since ye go to the great wars about the king , and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life , and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below , I give you my last counsels now at your riding ."
Keep an eye on Sir Daniel ; he is unsure .
"Put not your trust in the jack-priest ; he intendeth not amiss , but doth the will of others ; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel !"
Get your good lordship where ye go ; make you strong friends ; look to it .
And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch .
There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet .
"So , God-speed ! ''"
"`` And Heaven be with you , Bennet ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Ye were a good friend to me-ward , and so I shall say ever . ''"
"`` And , look ye , master , '' added Hatch , with a certain embarrassment , `` if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me , ye might , mayhap , lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul ; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory . ''"
"`` Ye shall have your will of it , Bennet , '' answered Dick ."
"`` But , what cheer , man !"
"we shall meet again , where ye shall have more need of ale than masses . ''"
"`` The saints so grant it , Master Dick ! ''"
returned the other .
`` But here comes Sir Oliver .
"An he were as quick with the long-bow as with the pen , he would be a brave man-at-arms . ''"
"Sir Oliver gave Dick a sealed packet , with this superscription : `` To my ryght worchypful master , Sir Daniel Brackley , knyght , be thys delyvered in haste . ''"
"And Dick , putting it in the bosom of his jacket , gave the word and set forth westward up the village ."
"BOOK I -- THE TWO LADS CHAPTER I -- AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night , warmly quartered and well patrolled ."
"But the Knight of Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting ; and even now , when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him , he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours ."
"He was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances ; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant , and then , by the favour he curried with great lords about the king , procure unjust decisions in his favour ; or , if that was too roundabout , to seize the disputed manor by force of arms , and rely on his influence and Sir Oliver 's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched ."
"cried Jack , ready to follow where his beloved friend led , and the others nodded , unwilling to be outdone by the youngest member ."
`` Good !
"With all of us to lend a hand , we can do a great deal ; and I tell you , boys , it is time , if we want to keep poor Bob straight ."
"We all turn our backs on him , so he loafs round the tavern , and goes with fellows we do n't care to know ."
"But he is n't bad yet , and we can keep him up , I 'm sure , if we just try ."
"I hope to get him into the Lodge , and that will be half the battle , wo n't it , Frank ? ''"
"added Ed , sure that this suggestion would have weight with the honorable Chairman ."
`` Bring him along ; I 'm with you ! ''
"answered Frank , making up his mind at once , for he had joined the Temperance Lodge four years ago , and already six boys had followed his example ."
"`` He is learning to smoke , but we 'll make him drop it before it leads to worse ."
"You can help him there , Admiral , if you only will , '' added Ed , giving a grateful look at one friend , and turning to the other ."
"`` I 'm your man ; '' and Gus looked as if he knew what he promised , for he had given up smoking to oblige his father , and kept his word like a hero ."
"`` You other fellows can do a good deal by just being kind and not twitting him with old scrapes , and I 'll do anything I can for you all to pay for this ; '' and Ed sat down with a beaming smile , feeling that his cause was won ."
"The vote was taken , and all hands went up , for even surly Joe gave in ; so Bob and Tom were duly elected , and proved their gratitude for the honor done them by becoming worthy members of the club ."
"It was only boys ' play now , but the kind heart and pure instincts of one lad showed the others how to lend a helping hand to a comrade in danger , and win him away from temptation to the safer pastimes of their more guarded lives ."
"Well pleased with themselves -- for every genuine act or word , no matter how trifling it seems , leaves a sweet and strengthening influence behind -- the members settled down to the debate , which was never very long , and often only an excuse for fun of all sorts ."
"`` Ralph , Gus , and Ed are for , and Brickbat , Grif , and Chick against , I suppose ? ''"
"said Frank , surveying his company like a general preparing for battle ."
"`` No , sir !"
I believe in co-everything ! ''
"cried Chick , a mild youth , who loyally escorted a chosen damsel home from school every day ."
"A laugh greeted this bold declaration , and Chick sat down , red but firm ."
"`` I 'll speak for two since the Chairman ca n't , and Jack wo n't go against those who pet him most to death , '' said Joe , who , not being a favorite with the girls , considered them a nuisance and lost no opportunity of telling them so ."
"`` Fire away , then , since you are up ; '' commanded Frank ."
"`` Well , '' began Joe , feeling too late how much he had undertaken , `` I do n't know a great deal about it , and I do n't care , but I do not believe in having girls at college ."
"They do n't belong there , nobody wants 'em , and they 'd better be at home darning their stockings . ''"
"`` Yours , too , '' put in Ralph , who had heard that argument so often he was tired of it ."
`` Of course ; that 's what girls are for .
"I do n't mind 'em at school , but I 'd just as soon they had a room to themselves ."
We should get on better . '' ''
"You would if Mabel was n't in your class and always ahead of you , '' observed Ed , whose friend was a fine scholar , and he very proud of the fact ."
"`` Look here , if you fellows keep interrupting , I wo n't sit down for half an hour , '' said Joe , well knowing that eloquence was not his gift , but bound to have his say out ."
`` We 'd like to have him .
"The little wagon is all ready for the girls ; you wo n't mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill , will you Aunty ? ''"
`` I should like it exceedingly ; but are you quite sure I shall not be in the way ? ''
"`` Oh , no , indeed !"
"we want you very much ; and the party will be spoilt if you do n't come , '' cried Demi , with great earnestness ."
"`` Thank you kindly , sir ; '' and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey , for she liked frolics as well as any of them ."
"`` Now , young ladies , we must not keep them waiting ; on with the hats , and let us be off at once ."
I 'm all impatience to know what the surprise is . ''
"As Mrs. Bhaer spoke every one bustled about , and in five minutes the three little girls and Teddy were packed into the `` clothes-basket , '' as they called the wicker wagon which Toby drew ."
"Demi walked at the head of the procession , and Mrs. Jo brought up the rear , escorted by Kit ."
"It was a most imposing party , I assure you , for Toby had a red feather-duster in his head , two remarkable flags waved over the carriage , Kit had a blue bow on his neck , which nearly drove him wild , Demi wore a nosegay of dandelions in his buttonhole , and Mrs. Jo carried the queer Japanese umbrella in honor of the occasion ."
"The girls had little flutters of excitement all the way ; and Teddy was so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard , and when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself , evidently feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the party ."
"When they came to the hill `` nothing was to be seen but the grass blowing in the wind , '' as the fairy books say , and the children looked disappointed ."
"But Demi said , in his most impressive manner , `` Now , you all get out and stand still , and the surprise party with come in ; '' with which remark he retired behind a rock , over which heads had been bobbing at intervals for the last half-hour ."
"A short pause of intense suspense , and then Nat , Demi , and Tommy marched forth , each bearing a new kite , which they presented to the three young ladies ."
"Shrieks of delight arose , but were silenced by the boys , who said , with faces brimful of merriment , `` That is n't all the surprise ; '' and , running behind the rock , again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size , on which was printed , in bright yellow letters , `` For Mother Bhaer . ''"
"`` We thought you 'd like one , too , because you were angry with us , and took the girls ' part , '' cried all three , shaking with laughter , for this part of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs. Jo ."
"She clapped her hands , and joined in the laugh , looking thoroughly tickled at the joke ."
"`` Now , boys , that is regularly splendid !"
Who did think of it ? ''
"she asked , receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did theirs ."
"`` Uncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others ; he said you 'd like it , so we made a bouncer , '' answered Demi , beaming with satisfaction at the success of the plot ."
`` Uncle Fritz knows what I like .
"Yes , these are magnificent kites , and we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours , were n't we , girls ? ''"
"`` That 's why we made them for you , '' cried Tommy , standing on his head as the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions ."
"`` Let us fly them , '' said energetic Nan ."
"`` I do n't know how , '' began Daisy ."
"`` We 'll show you , we want to ! ''"
"cried all the boys in a burst of devotion , as Demi took Daisy 's , Tommy Nan 's , and Nat , with difficulty , persuaded Bess to let go her little blue one ."
"`` Aunty , if you will wait a minute , we 'll pitch yours for you , '' said Demi , feeling that Mrs. Bhaer 's favor must not be lost again by any neglect of theirs ."
"`` Bless your buttons , dear , I know all about it ; and here is a boy who will toss up for me , '' added Mrs. Jo , as the professor peeped over the rock with a face full of fun ."
"He came out at once , tossed up the big kite , and Mrs. Jo ran off with it in fine style , while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle ."
"we 'll say hunting -- they found a little damsel lying on the snow , half dead with cold , they thought ."
"She was the child of a poor woman who lived in the forest -- a wild little thing , always dancing and singing about ; as hard to catch as a squirrel , and so fearless she would climb the highest trees , leap broad brooks , or jump off the steep rocks to show her courage ."
"The boys carried her home to the palace , and the queen was glad to have her ."
"She had fallen and hurt herself , so she lay in bed week after week , with her mother to take care of her -- '' `` That 's you , '' whispered Jack , throwing the white carnation at Jill , and she threw back the red one , with her finger on her lips , for the tale was very interesting now ."
"`` She did not suffer much after a time , but she scolded and cried , and could not be resigned , because she was a prisoner ."
"The queen tried to help her , but she could not do much ; the princes were kind , but they had their books and plays , and were away a good deal ."
"Some friends she had came often to see her , but still she beat her wings against the bars , like a wild bird in a cage , and soon her spirits were all gone , and it was sad to see her . ''"
`` Where was your Saint Lucy ?
"I thought it was about her , '' asked Jack , who did not like to have Jill 's past troubles dwelt upon , since his were not ."
`` She is coming .
"Saints are not born -- they are made after many trials and tribulations , '' answered his mother , looking at the fire as if it helped her to spin her little story ."
"`` Well , the poor child used to sing sometimes to while away the long hours -- sad songs mostly , and one among them which the queen taught her was ` Sweet Patience , Come . '"
"`` This she used to sing a great deal after a while , never dreaming that Patience was an angel who could hear and obey ."
"But it was so ; and one night , when the girl had lulled herself to sleep with that song , the angel came ."
"Nobody saw the lovely spirit with tender eyes , and a voice that was like balm ."
"No one heard the rustle of wings as she hovered over the little bed and touched the lips , the eyes , the hands of the sleeper , and then flew away , leaving three gifts behind ."
"The girl did not know why , but after that night the songs grew gayer , there seemed to be more sunshine everywhere her eyes looked , and her hands were never tired of helping others in various pretty , useful , or pleasant ways ."
"Slowly the wild bird ceased to beat against the bars , but sat in its cage and made music for all in the palace , till the queen could not do without it , the poor mother cheered up , and the princes called the girl their nightingale . ''"
`` Was that the miracle ? ''
"asked Jack , forgetting all about his slippers , as he watched Jill 's eyes brighten and the color come up in her white cheeks ."
"`` That was the miracle , and Patience can work far greater ones if you will let her . ''"
`` And the girl 's name was Lucy ? ''
"`` Yes ; they did not call her a saint then , but she was trying to be as cheerful as a certain good woman she had heard of , and so the queen had that name for her , though she did not let her know it for a long time . ''"
"`` That 's not bad for a Sunday story , but there might have been more about the princes , seems to me , '' was Frank 's criticism , as Jill lay very still , trying to hide her face behind the carnation , for she had no words to tell how touched and pleased she was to find that her little efforts to be good had been seen , remembered , and now rewarded in this way ."
`` There is more . ''
`` Then the story is n't done ? ''
cried Jack .
"`` Oh dear , no ; the most interesting things are to come , if you can wait for them . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , this is the moral part ."
"Now keep still , and let us have the rest , '' commanded Frank , while the others composed themselves for the sequel , suspecting that it was rather nice , because Mamma 's sober face changed , and her eyes laughed as they looked at the fire ."
"`` The elder prince was very fond of driving dragons , for the people of that country used these fiery monsters as horses . ''"
"`` And got run away with , did n't he ? ''"
"If this reformation goes on as it has begun , I shall soon feel like Dr. Blimber with his model young gentlemen , '' said Professor , laughing , as he saw Tommy not only remove his own hat , but knock off Ned 's also , as they entered the hall where the Princess was taking a ride on the rocking-horse , attended by Rob and Teddy astride of chairs , and playing gallant knights to the best of their ability ."
"`` You will never be a Blimber , Fritz , you could n't do it if you tried ; and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous hot-bed ."
No fear that they will be too elegant : American boys like liberty too well .
"But good manners they can not fail to have , if we give them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor , making it courteous and cordial , like yours , my dear old boy . ''"
`` Tut !
tut !
"we will not compliment ; for if I begin you will run away , and I have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end ; '' yet Mr. Bhaer looked pleased with the compliment , for it was true , and Mrs. Jo felt that she had received the best her husband could give her , by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society ."
"`` To return to the children : I have just had another proof of Goldilocks ' good influence , '' said Mrs. Jo , drawing her chair nearer the sofa , where the Professor lay resting after a long day 's work in his various gardens ."
"`` Nan hates sewing , but for love of Bess has been toiling half the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our love-apples to her idol when she goes ."
"I praised her for it , and she said , in her quick way , ' I like to sew for other people ; it is stupid sewing for myself . '"
"I took the hint , and shall give her some little shirts and aprons for Mrs. Carney 's children ."
"She is so generous , she will sew her fingers sore for them , and I shall not have to make a task of it . ''"
"`` But needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment , my dear . ''"
`` Sorry for it .
"My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it , even if they give up the Latin , Algebra , and half-a-dozen ologies it is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over now-a-days ."
"Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman , but the dear 's mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already , and her mother has several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird without a bill , that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it . ''"
"`` I also have proof of the Princess 's power , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , after he had watched Mrs. Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole system of fashionable education ."
"`` Jack is so unwilling to be classed with Stuffy and Ned , as distasteful to Bess , that he came to me a little while ago , and asked me to touch his warts with caustic ."
"I have often proposed it , and he never would consent ; but now he bore the smart manfully , and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor , when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the story , and just then Stuffy came in to ask if he might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him ."
"`` She is not allowed to eat sweeties ; but if you like to give her the pretty box with the pink sugar-rose in it , she would like it very much , '' said Mrs. Jo , unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of self-denial , for the `` fat boy '' seldom offered to share his sugar-plums ."
`` Wo n't she eat it ?
"I should n't like to make her sick , '' said Stuffy , eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly , yet putting it into the box ."
"`` Oh , no , she wo n't touch it , if I tell her it is to look at , not to eat ."
"She will keep it for weeks , and never think of tasting it ."
Can you do as much ? ''
`` I should hope so !
"I 'm ever so much older than she is , '' cried Stuffy , indignantly ."
"`` Well , suppose we try ."
"Here , put your bonbons in this bag , and see how long you can keep them ."
"Let me count two hearts , four red fishes , three barley-sugar horses , nine almonds , and a dozen chocolate drops ."
Do you agree to that ? ''
"Then they all took ship and sailed home , and when they came to the princess 's country , Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom , and went up to the palace alone ."
"He was given a hearty welcome by the king , who prided himself on his hospitality , and a banquet was commanded in his honour ."
"That evening , whilst they sat drinking their wine , Hans said to the king : ' I have heard the fame of your majesty 's wisdom , and I have travelled from far to ask your counsel ."
A man in my country has buried his daughter alive because she loved a youth who was born a peasant .
"How shall I punish this unnatural father , for it is left to me to give judgment ? '"
"The king , who was still truly grieved for his daughter 's loss , answered quickly : ` Burn him alive , and strew his ashes all over the kingdom . '"
"Hans looked at him steadily for a moment , and then threw off his disguise ."
"` You are the man , ' said he ; ` and I am he who loved your daughter , and became a gold ring on her finger ."
"She is safe , and waiting not far from here ; but you have pronounced judgment on yourself . '"
"Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy ; and as he had in other respects been a good father , they forgave him ."
The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month .
As for the hill-man he intended to be present ; but whilst he was walking along a street which led to the palace a loose stone fell on his head and killed him .

"The Cat 's Elopement -LSB- From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty , with a skin as soft and shining as silk , and wise green eyes , that could see even in the dark ."
"His name was Gon , and he belonged to a music teacher , who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world ."
Now not far from the music master 's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma .
"She was such a little dear altogether , and blinked her eyes so daintily , and ate her supper so tidily , and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue , that her mistress was never tired of saying , ` Koma , Koma , what should I do without you ? '"
"Well , it happened one day that these two , when out for an evening stroll , met under a cherry tree , and in one moment fell madly in love with each other ."
"Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife , for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy ; but he was not easy to please , and did not care about any of them ."
"Now , before he had time to think , Cupid had entangled him in his net , and he was filled with love towards Koma ."
"She fully returned his passion , but , like a woman , she saw the difficulties in the way , and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them ."
"Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma , but her mistress would not part from her ."
"Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady , but he declined to listen to any such suggestion , so everything remained as before ."
"At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves , and to seek their fortunes together ."
"So one moonlight night they stole away , and ventured out into an unknown world ."
"All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine , till they had left their homes far behind them , and towards evening they found themselves in a large park ."
"The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired , and the grass looked very soft and inviting , and the trees cast cool deep shadows , when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise , in the shape of a big , big dog !"
"He came springing towards them showing all his teeth , and Koma shrieked , and rushed up a cherry tree ."
"Gon , however , stood his ground boldly , and prepared to give battle , for he felt that Koma 's eyes were upon him , and that he must not run away ."
"But , alas !"
"his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him , for he was large and powerful , and very fierce ."
"You have got a conscience , though you are a little boy , and you must learn to mind it . ''"
"`` Well , my conscience did n't prick me a bit when she said ` Let 's get over the wall , ' '' answered Rob , quoting one of Demi 's expressions ."
`` Did you stop to see if it did ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Then you can not tell . ''
"`` I guess it 's such a little conscience that it do n't prick hard enough for me to feel it , '' added Rob , after thinking the matter over for a minute ."
`` We must sharpen it up .
"It 's bad to have a dull conscience ; so you may stay here till dinner-time , and talk about it with Nan ."
I trust you both not to untie yourselves till I say the word . ''
"`` No , we wo n't , '' said both , feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping to punish themselves ."
"For an hour they were very good , then they grew tired of one room , and longed to get out ."
"Never had the hall seemed so inviting ; even the little bedroom acquired a sudden interest , and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed ."
"The open windows drove them wild because they could not reach them ; and the outer world seemed so beautiful , they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull ."
"Nan pined for a race round the lawn , and Rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning , and wondered what poor Pollux would do ."
"They watched the clock , and Nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds , while Rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them ."
"It was maddening to smell the dinner , to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding , and to feel that they would not be on the spot to secure good helps of both ."
"When Mary Ann began to set the table , they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there was to be ; and Nan offered to help her make the beds , if she would only see that she had `` lots of sauce on her pudding . ''"
"When the boys came bursting out of school , they found the children tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts , and were much edified , as well as amused , by the sequel to the exciting adventures of the night ."
"`` Untie me now , Marmar ; my conscience will prick like a pin next time , I know it will , '' said Rob , as the bell rang , and Teddy came to look at him with sorrowful surprise ."
"`` We shall see , '' answered his mother , setting him free ."
"He took a good run down the hall , back through the dining-room , and brought up beside Nan , quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction ."
"`` I 'll bring her dinner to her , may I ? ''"
"he asked , pitying his fellow-captive ."
`` That 's my kind little son !
"Yes , pull out the table , and get a chair ; '' and Mrs. Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others , who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon ."
"Nan ate alone , and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa ."
"Mrs. Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window ; and there she stood watching the boys play , and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty ."
"Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn , so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it ."
"Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her ; Demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself , which amused Nan a good deal ; and Dan brought a little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power ."
But nothing atoned for the loss of freedom ; and a few hours of confinement taught Nan how precious it was .
A good many thoughts went through the little head that lay on the window-sill during the last quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emil 's new ship launched .
"She was to have christened it , and had depended on smashing a tiny bottle of currant-wine over the prow as it was named Josephine in honor of Mrs. Bhaer ."
"Shoes , skirts , books , and toys lay about , and her drawers were a perfect chaos of soiled ruffles , odd gloves , old ribbons , boot lacings , and bits of paper ."
"`` Oh , my heart , what a muddle !"
"Mrs. Minot would n't think much of me if she could see that , '' said Molly , recalling how that lady once said she could judge a good deal of a little girl 's character and habits by a peep at her top drawer , and went on , with great success , to guess how each of the school-mates kept her drawer ."
"`` Come , missionary , clear up , and do n't let me find such a glory-hole again , or I 'll report you to the society , '' said Molly , tipping the whole drawer-full out upon the bed , and beguiling the tiresome job by keeping up the new play ."
"Twilight came before it was done , and a great pile of things loomed up on her table , with no visible means of repair , -- for Molly 's work-basket was full of nuts , and her thimble down a hole in the shed-floor , where the cats had dropped it in their play ."
"`` I 'll ask Bat for hooks and tape , and papa for some money to buy scissors and things , for I do n't know where mine are ."
Glad I ca n't do any more now !
Being neat is such hard work ! ''
"and Molly threw herself down on the rug beside the old wooden cradle in which Boo was blissfully rocking , with a cargo of toys aboard ."
"She watched her time , and as soon as her father had done supper , she hastened to say , before he got to his desk , -- `` Please , papa , I want a dollar to get some brass buttons and things to fix Boo 's clothes with ."
He wore a hole in his new trousers coasting down the Kembles ' steps .
And ca n't I wash him ?
"He needs it , and Miss Bat wo n't let me have a tub . ''"
"`` Certainly , child , certainly ; do what you like , only do n't keep me ."
"I must be off , or I shall miss Jackson , and he 's the man I want ; '' and , throwing down two dollars instead of one , Mr. Bemis hurried away , with a vague impression that Boo had swallowed a dozen brass buttons , and Miss Bat had been coasting somewhere in a bath-pan ; but catching Jackson was important , so he did not stop to investigate ."
"Armed with the paternal permission , Molly carried her point , and oh , what a dreadful evening poor Boo spent !"
"First , he was decoyed upstairs an hour too soon , then put in a tub by main force and sternly scrubbed , in spite of shrieks that brought Miss Bat to the locked door to condole with the sufferer , scold the scrubber , and depart , darkly prophesying croup before morning ."
"`` He always howls when he is washed ; but I shall do it , since you wo n't , and he must get used to it ."
"I will not have people tell me he 's neglected , if I can help it , '' cried Molly , working away with tears in her eyes -- for it was as hard for her as for Boo ; but she meant to be thorough for once in her life , no matter what happened ."
"When the worst was over , she coaxed him with candy and stories till the long task of combing out the curls was safely done ; then , in the clean night-gown with a blue button newly sewed on , she laid him in bed , worn out , but sweet as a rose ."
"`` Now , say your prayers , darling , and go to sleep with the nice red blanket all tucked round so you wo n't get cold , '' said Molly , rather doubtful of the effect of the wet head ."
"`` No , I wo n't !"
Going to sleep now !
"'' and Boo shut his eyes wearily , feeling that his late trials had not left him in a prayerful mood ."
"`` Then you 'll be a real little heathen , as Mrs. Pecq called you , and I do n't know what I shall do with you , '' said Molly , longing to cuddle rather than scold the little fellow , whose soul needed looking after as well as his body ."
"`` No , no ; I wo n't be a heevin !"
I do n't want to be frowed to the trockindiles .
I will say my prayers !
"oh , I will ! ''"
"and , rising in his bed , Boo did so , with the devotion of an infant Samuel , for he remembered the talk when the society was formed ."
"Molly thought her labors were over for that night , and soon went to bed , tired with her first attempts ."
"But toward morning she was wakened by the hoarse breathing of the boy , and was forced to patter away to Miss Bat 's room , humbly asking for the squills , and confessing that the prophecy had come to pass ."
I do n't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person 's mind .
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you , and your own map can become intensely interesting , but catch them trying to draw a map of a child 's mind , which is not only confused , but keeps going round all the time ."
"There are zigzag lines on it , just like your temperature on a card , and these are probably roads in the island ; for the Neverland is always more or less an island , with astonishing splashes of colour here and there , and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing , and savages and lonely lairs , and gnomes who are mostly tailors , and caves through which a river runs , and princes with six elder brothers , and a hut fast going to decay , and one very small old lady with a hooked nose ."
"It would be an easy map if that were all ; but there is also first day at school , religion , fathers , the round pond , needlework , murders , hangings , verbs that take the dative , chocolate pudding day , getting into braces , say ninety-nine , three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself , and so on ; and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through , and it is all rather confusing , especially as nothing will stand still ."
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal .
"John 's , for instance , had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting , while Michael , who was very small , had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it ."
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands , Michael in a wigwam , Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together ."
"John had no friends , Michael had friends at night , Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents ; but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance , and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other 's nose , and so forth ."
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles .
"We too have been there ; we can still hear the sound of the surf , though we shall land no more ."
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact ; not large and sprawly , you know , with tedious distances between one adventure and another , but nicely crammed ."
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth , it is not in the least alarming , but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very nearly real ."
That is why there are night-lights .
"Occasionally in her travels through her children 's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand , and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter ."
"She knew of no Peter , and yet he was here and there in John and Michael 's minds , while Wendy 's began to be scrawled all over with him ."
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words , and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance ."
"` Yes , he is rather cocky , ' Wendy admitted with regret ."
Her mother had been questioning her .
"` But who is he , my pet ? '"
"` He is Peter Pan , you know , mother . '"
"At first Mrs. Darling did not know , but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies ."
"There were odd stories about him ; as that when children died he went part of the way with them , so that they should not be frightened ."
"She had believed in him at the time , but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person ."
"` Besides , ' she said to Wendy , ` he would be grown up by this time . '"
"` Oh no , he is n't grown up , ' Wendy assured her confidently , ` and he is just my size . '"
"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body ; she did n't know how she knew it , she just knew it ."
"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling , but he smiled pooh-pooh ."
"` Mark my words , ' he said , ` it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads ; just the sort of idea a dog would have ."
"Leave it alone , and it will blow over . '"
But it would not blow over ; and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock .
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them .
"For instance , they may remember to mention , a week after the event happened , that when they were in the wood they met their dead father and had a game with him ."
"O , our Crookback is a bold blade and a good warrior ; but , whether in cold blood or in hot , he will have all things done exact to his commandment ."
"If any fail or hinder , they shall die the death . ''"
"`` Now , by the saints ! ''"
"cried Richard , `` is this so ?"
And will men follow such a leader ? ''
"`` Nay , they follow him gleefully , '' replied the other ; `` for if he be exact to punish , he is most open-handed to reward ."
"And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others , he is ever liberal of his own , still in the first front of battle , still the last to sleep ."
"He will go far , will Crookback Dick o ' Gloucester ! ''"
"The young knight , if he had before been brave and vigilant , was now all the more inclined to watchfulness and courage ."
"His sudden favour , he began to perceive , had brought perils in its train ."
"And he turned from the archer , and once more scanned anxiously the market-place ."
It lay empty as before .
"`` I like not this quietude , '' he said ."
`` Doubtless they prepare us some surprise . ''
"And , as if in answer to his remark , the archers began once more to advance against the barricade , and the arrows to fall thick ."
But there was something hesitating in the attack .
"They came not on roundly , but seemed rather to await a further signal ."
"Dick looked uneasily about him , spying for a hidden danger ."
"And sure enough , about half way up the little street , a door was suddenly opened from within , and the house continued , for some seconds , and both by door and window , to disgorge a torrent of Lancastrian archers ."
"These , as they leaped down , hurriedly stood to their ranks , bent their bows , and proceeded to pour upon Dick 's rear a flight of arrows ."
"At the same time , the assailants in the market-place redoubled their shot , and began to close in stoutly upon the barricade ."
"Dick called down his whole command out of the houses , and facing them both ways , and encouraging their valour both by word and gesture , returned as best he could the double shower of shafts that fell about his post ."
"Meanwhile house after house was opened in the street , and the Lancastrians continued to pour out of the doors and leap down from the windows , shouting victory , until the number of enemies upon Dick 's rear was almost equal to the number in his face ."
"It was plain that he could hold the post no longer ; what was worse , even if he could have held it , it had now become useless ; and the whole Yorkist army lay in a posture of helplessness upon the brink of a complete disaster ."
"The men behind him formed the vital flaw in the general defence ; and it was upon these that Dick turned , charging at the head of his men ."
"So vigorous was the attack , that the Lancastrian archers gave ground and staggered , and , at last , breaking their ranks , began to crowd back into the houses from which they had so recently and so vaingloriously sallied ."
"Meanwhile the men from the market-place had swarmed across the undefended barricade , and fell on hotly upon the other side ; and Dick must once again face about , and proceed to drive them back ."
"Once again the spirit of his men prevailed ; they cleared the street in a triumphant style , but even as they did so the others issued again out of the houses , and took them , a third time , upon the rear ."
The Yorkists began to be scattered ; several times Dick found himself alone among his foes and plying his bright sword for life ; several times he was conscious of a hurt .
And meanwhile the fight swayed to and fro in the street without determinate result .
Suddenly Dick was aware of a great trumpeting about the outskirts of the town .
"The war-cry of York began to be rolled up to heaven , as by many and triumphant voices ."
"Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol ."
"John Trelawney Postscript -- I did not tell you that Blandly , who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we do n't turn up by the end of August , had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respects a treasure ."
"Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named Arrow ."
"I have a boatswain who pipes , Livesey ; so things shall go man-o ' - war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA ."
"I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker 's account , which has never been overdrawn ."
"He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving ."
J. T. P.P.S. -- Hawkins may stay one night with his mother .
J. T .
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me .
"I was half beside myself with glee ; and if ever I despised a man , it was old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament ."
"Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure was like law among them all ."
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble .
"The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits ."
"The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling ."
"The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar ."
He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone .
"It was on seeing that boy that I understood , for the first time , my situation ."
"I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that I was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , I had my first attack of tears ."
"I am afraid I led that boy a dog 's life , for as he was new to the work , I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and I was not slow to profit by them ."
"The night passed , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road ."
"I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted , no longer quite so dear ."
"One of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope ."
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight .
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath .
"I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time ."
`` Where are we ? ''
I asked .
"`` Bristol , '' said Tom ."
`` Get down . ''
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner .
"Thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations ."
"In one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider 's ."
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' said Dan , meekly , and looked a little scared by the serious tone of the last remarks , for he hated books , yet had evidently made up his mind to study anything she proposed ."
`` Do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it ? ''
was the next very unexpected question .
"Dan did see two tall old-fashioned ones standing on either side of the piano ; he knew them well , and had often seen nice bits of string , nails , brown paper , and such useful matters come out of the various drawers ."
He nodded and smiled .
"Mrs. Jo went on , `` Well , do n't you think those drawers would be good places to put your eggs , and stones , and shells , and lichens ? ''"
"`` Oh , splendid , but you would n't like my things ` clutterin ' round , ' as Mr. Page used to say , would you ? ''"
"cried Dan , sitting up to survey the old piece of furniture with sparkling eyes ."
"`` I like litter of that sort ; and if I did n't , I should give you the drawers , because I have a regard for children 's little treasures , and I think they should be treated respectfully ."
"Now , I am going to make a bargain with you , Dan , and I hope you will keep it honorably ."
"Here are twelve good-sized drawers , one for each month of the year , and they shall be yours as fast as you earn them , by doing the little duties that belong to you ."
"I believe in rewards of a certain kind , especially for young folks ; they help us along , and though we may begin by being good for the sake of the reward , if it is rightly used , we shall soon learn to love goodness for itself . ''"
`` Do you have 'em ? ''
"asked Dan , looking as if this was new talk for him ."
"`` Yes , indeed !"
I have n't learnt to get on without them yet .
"My rewards are not drawers , or presents , or holidays , but they are things which I like as much as you do the others ."
"The good behavior and success of my boys is one of the rewards I love best , and I work for it as I want you to work for your cabinet ."
"Do what you dislike , and do it well , and you get two rewards , one , the prize you see and hold ; the other , the satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed ."
Do you understand that ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am . ''"
"`` We all need these little helps ; so you shall try to do your lessons and your work , play kindly with all the boys , and use your holidays well ; and if you bring me a good report , or if I see and know it without words for I 'm quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall have a compartment in the drawer for your treasures ."
"See , some are already divided into four parts , and I will have the others made in the same way , a place for each week ; and when the drawer is filled with curious and pretty things , I shall be as proud of it as you are ; prouder , I think for in the pebbles , mosses , and gay butterflies , I shall see good resolutions carried out , conquered faults , and a promise well kept ."
"Shall we do this , Dan ? ''"
"The boys answered with one of the looks which said much , for it showed that he felt and understood her wish and words , although he did not know how to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness ."
"She understood the look , and seeing by the color that flushed up to his forehead that he was touched , as she wished him to be , she said no more about that side of the new plan , but pulled out the upper drawer , dusted it , and set it on two chairs before the sofa , saying briskly , `` Now , let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe place ."
"These compartments will hold a good deal , you see ."
"I 'd pin the butterflies and bugs round the sides ; they will be quite safe there , and leave room for the heavy things below ."
"I 'll give you some cotton wool , and clean paper and pins , and you can get ready for the week 's work . ''"
"`` But I ca n't go out to find any new things , '' said Dan , looking piteously at his foot ."
"`` That 's true ; never mind , we 'll let these treasures do for this week , and I dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them . ''"
"`` They do n't know the right sort ; besides , if I lay , no , lie here all the time , I ca n't work and study , and earn my drawers . ''"
"In the very article , comes Captain Hoseason with the story of your drowning ; whereupon all fell through ; with no consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell , injury to my pocket , and another blot upon your uncle 's character , which could very ill afford it ."
"And now , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you understand the whole process of these matters , and can judge for yourself to what extent I may be trusted . ''"
"Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him , and placed more scraps of Latin in his speech ; but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust ."
"Moreover , I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a doubt ; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` if I tell you my story , I must commit a friend 's life to your discretion ."
"Pass me your word it shall be sacred ; and for what touches myself , I will ask no better guarantee than just your face . ''"
He passed me his word very seriously .
"`` But , '' said he , `` these are rather alarming prolocutions ; and if there are in your story any little jostles to the law , I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer , and pass lightly . ''"
"Thereupon I told him my story from the first , he listening with his spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed , so that I sometimes feared he was asleep ."
But no such matter !
he heard every word -LRB- as I found afterward -RRB- with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as often surprised me .
"Even strange outlandish Gaelic names , heard for that time only , he remembered and would remind me of , years after ."
"Yet when I called Alan Breck in full , we had an odd scene ."
"The name of Alan had of course rung through Scotland , with the news of the Appin murder and the offer of the reward ; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer moved in his seat and opened his eyes ."
"`` I would name no unnecessary names , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ; `` above all of Highlanders , many of whom are obnoxious to the law . ''"
"`` Well , it might have been better not , '' said I , `` but since I have let it slip , I may as well continue . ''"
"`` Not at all , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
"`` I am somewhat dull of hearing , as you may have remarked ; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly ."
"We will call your friend , if you please , Mr. Thomson -- that there may be no reflections ."
"And in future , I would take some such way with any Highlander that you may have to mention -- dead or alive . ''"
"By this , I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly , and had already guessed I might be coming to the murder ."
"If he chose to play this part of ignorance , it was no matter of mine ; so I smiled , said it was no very Highland-sounding name , and consented ."
"Through all the rest of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson ; which amused me the more , as it was a piece of policy after his own heart ."
"James Stewart , in like manner , was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ; Colin Campbell passed as a Mr. Glen ; and to Cluny , when I came to that part of my tale , I gave the name of `` Mr. Jameson , a Highland chief . ''"
"It was truly the most open farce , and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it up ; but , after all , it was quite in the taste of that age , when there were two parties in the state , and quiet persons , with no very high opinions of their own , sought out every cranny to avoid offence to either ."
"`` Well , well , '' said the lawyer , when I had quite done , `` this is a great epic , a great Odyssey of yours ."
"You must tell it , sir , in a sound Latinity when your scholarship is riper ; or in English if you please , though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue ."
You have rolled much ; quae regio in terris -- what parish in Scotland -LRB- to make a homely translation -RRB- has not been filled with your wanderings ?
"You have shown , besides , a singular aptitude for getting into false positions ; and , yes , upon the whole , for behaving well in them ."
"This Mr. Thomson seems to me a gentleman of some choice qualities , though perhaps a trifle bloody-minded ."
"It would please me none the worse , if -LRB- with all his merits -RRB- he were soused in the North Sea , for the man , Mr. David , is a sore embarrassment ."
"But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him ; indubitably , he adhered to you ."
"But she often talked lovingly of Peter , and she knitted a kettle-holder for him , and one day when she was wondering what Easter present he would like , her mother made a suggestion ."
"-LSB- Illustration : If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ` Nothing , ' she said thoughtfully , ` would be so useful to him as a goat . '"
"` He could ride on it , ' cried Maimie , ` and play on his pipe at the same time . '"
"` Then , ' her mother asked , ` wo n't you give him your goat , the one you frighten Tony with at night ? '"
"` But it is n't a real goat , ' Maimie said ."
"` It seems very real to Tony , ' replied her mother ."
"` It seems frightfully real to me too , ' Maimie admitted , ` but how could I give it to Peter ? '"
"Her mother knew a way , and next day , accompanied by Tony -LRB- who was really quite a nice boy , though of course he could not compare -RRB- , they went to the Gardens , and Maimie stood alone within a fairy ring , and then her mother , who was a rather gifted lady , said -- ` My daughter , tell me , if you can , What have you got for Peter Pan ? '"
"To which Maimie replied -- ' I have a goat for him to ride , Observe me cast it far and wide . '"
"She then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed , and turned round three times ."
"Next Tony said -- ` If P. doth find it waiting here , Wilt ne'er again make me to fear ? '"
And Maimie answered -- ` By dark or light I fondly swear Never to see goats anywhere . '
"She also left a letter to Peter in a likely place , explaining what she had done , and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one convenient for riding on ."
"Well , it all happened just as she hoped , for Peter found the letter , and of course nothing could be easier for the fairies than to turn the goat into a real one , and so that is how Peter got the goat on which he now rides round the Gardens every night playing sublimely on his pipe ."
"And Maimie kept her promise , and never frightened Tony with a goat again , though I have heard that she created another animal ."
"Until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave presents for Peter in the Gardens -LRB- with letters explaining how humans play with them -RRB- , and she is not the only one who has done this ."
"David does it , for instance , and he and I know the likeliest place for leaving them in , and we shall tell you if you like , but for mercy 's sake do n't ask us before Porthos , for he is so fond of toys that , were he to find out the place , he would take every one of them ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They will certainly mischief you -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- Though Peter still remembers Maimie he is become as gay as ever , and often in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily on the grass ."
"Oh , he has a joyful time !"
"But he has still a vague memory that he was a human once , and it makes him especially kind to the house-swallows when they visit the island , for house-swallows are the spirits of little children who have died ."
"They always build in the eaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans , and sometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window , and perhaps that is why Peter loves them best of all the birds ."
And the little house ?
"Every lawful night -LRB- that is to say , every night except ball nights -RRB- the fairies now build the little house lest there should be a human child lost in the Gardens , and Peter rides the marches looking for lost ones , and if he finds them he carries them on his goat to the little house , and when they wake up they are in it , and when they step out they see it ."
"The fairies build the house merely because it is so pretty , but Peter rides round in memory of Maimie , and because he still loves to do just as he believes real boys would do ."
"But you must not think that , because somewhere among the trees the little house is twinkling , it is a safe thing to remain in the Gardens after Lock-out time ."
"If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out that night they will certainly mischief you , and even though they are not , you may perish of cold and dark before Peter Pan comes round ."
"He has been too late several times , and when he sees he is too late he runs back to the Thrush 's Nest for his paddle , of which Maimie had told him the true use , and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little tombstone , and carves the poor thing 's initials on it ."
"He does this at once because he thinks it is what real boys would do , and you must have noticed the little stones , and that there are always two together ."
He puts them in twos because they seem less lonely .
I think that quite the most touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter Stephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps .
They stand together at the spot where the parish of Westminster St. Mary 's is said to meet the parish of Paddington .
"Here Peter found the two babes , who had fallen unnoticed from their perambulators , Phoebe aged thirteen months and Walter probably still younger , for Peter seems to have felt a delicacy about putting any age on his stone ."
"`` You 're pretty stubborn , I reckon , '' was Mr. Harrison 's way of putting it ."
"`` Well , well , we 'll see ."
Someday when you get riled up ... and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled ... you 'll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling .
You 're too young to be teaching anyhow ... far too young and childish . ''
"Altogether , Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood ."
She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea .
"Anne sipped it patiently , although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do ."
"Had it been some magic brew , potent to confer age and experience , Anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching ."
"`` Marilla , what if I fail ! ''"
"`` You 'll hardly fail completely in one day and there 's plenty more days coming , '' said Marilla ."
"`` The trouble with you , Anne , is that you 'll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off , and if you ca n't you 'll think you 've failed . ''"
V A Full-fledged Schoolma'am When Anne reached the school that morning ... for the first time in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties ... all was quiet and still .
"The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival , and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of `` shining morning faces '' and bright , inquisitive eyes ."
"She hung up her hat and faced her pupils , hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling ."
She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school .
"She had revised and improved it painstakingly , and then she had learned it off by heart ."
"It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it , especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge ."
The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it .
"After what seemed to her a year ... about ten seconds in reality ... she said faintly , `` Take your Testaments , please , '' and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed ."
While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land .
"Most of them were , of course , quite well known to her ."
"Her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her , excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to Avonlea ."
Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her .
"To be sure , they might be just as commonplace as the rest ; but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among them ."
It was a thrilling idea .
Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye .
"He had a dark , sullen little face , and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes ."
Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boy 's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly .
"In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane ... a jolly looking little chap , with a snub nose , freckled face , and big , light blue eyes , fringed with whitish lashes ... probably the DonNELL boy ; and if resemblance went for anything , his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell ."
"Anne wondered what sort of mother the child had , to send her to school dressed as she was ."
"She wore a faded pink silk dress , trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace , soiled white kid slippers , and silk stockings ."
"Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls , surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head ."
On every side the company of the Black Arrow was making for the hill .
"Some , being better runners , or having open ground to run upon , had far outstripped the others , and were already close upon the goal ; some , following valleys , had spread out to right and left , and outflanked the lads on either side ."
Dick plunged into the nearest cover .
"It was a tall grove of oaks , firm under foot and clear of underbrush , and as it lay down hill , they made good speed ."
"There followed next a piece of open , which Dick avoided , holding to his left ."
"Two minutes after , and the same obstacle arising , the lads followed the same course ."
"Thus it followed that , while the lads , bending continually to the left , drew nearer and nearer to the high road and the river which they had crossed an hour or two before , the great bulk of their pursuers were leaning to the other hand , and running towards Tunstall ."
The lads paused to breathe .
There was no sound of pursuit .
"Dick put his ear to the ground , and still there was nothing ; but the wind , to be sure , still made a turmoil in the trees , and it was hard to make certain ."
"`` On again , '' said Dick ; and , tired as they were , and Matcham limping with his injured foot , they pulled themselves together , and once more pelted down the hill ."
"Three minutes later , they were breasting through a low thicket of evergreen ."
"High overhead , the tall trees made a continuous roof of foliage ."
"It was a pillared grove , as high as a cathedral , and except for the hollies among which the lads were struggling , open and smoothly swarded ."
"On the other side , pushing through the last fringe of evergreen , they blundered forth again into the open twilight of the grove ."
`` Stand ! ''
cried a voice .
"And there , between the huge stems , not fifty feet before them , they beheld a stout fellow in green , sore blown with running , who instantly drew an arrow to the head and covered them ."
"Matcham stopped with a cry ; but Dick , without a pause , ran straight upon the forester , drawing his dagger as he went ."
"The other , whether he was startled by the daring of the onslaught , or whether he was hampered by his orders , did not shoot ; he stood wavering ; and before he had time to come to himself , Dick bounded at his throat , and sent him sprawling backward on the turf ."
The arrow went one way and the bow another with a sounding twang .
The disarmed forester grappled his assailant ; but the dagger shone and descended twice .
"Then came a couple of groans , and then Dick rose to his feet again , and the man lay motionless , stabbed to the heart ."
`` On ! ''
"said Dick ; and he once more pelted forward , Matcham trailing in the rear ."
"To say truth , they made but poor speed of it by now , labouring dismally as they ran , and catching for their breath like fish ."
"Matcham had a cruel stitch , and his head swam ; and as for Dick , his knees were like lead ."
But they kept up the form of running with undiminished courage .
Presently they came to the end of the grove .
"It stopped abruptly ; and there , a few yards before them , was the high road from Risingham to Shoreby , lying , at this point , between two even walls of forest ."
"At the sight Dick paused ; and as soon as he stopped running , he became aware of a confused noise , which rapidly grew louder ."
"It was at first like the rush of a very high gust of wind , but soon it became more definite , and resolved itself into the galloping of horses ; and then , in a flash , a whole company of men-at-arms came driving round the corner , swept before the lads , and were gone again upon the instant ."
"From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all , and screamed with all her might , hoping that some one would hear , and come to help ."
"Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by , and he drove off the dog , and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms , carried him to his mistress ."
"So poor little Koma was left alone , while Gon was borne away full of trouble , not in the least knowing what to do ."
"Even the attention paid him by the princess , who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways , did not console him , but there was no use in fighting against fate , and he could only wait and see what would turn up ."
"The princess , Gon 's new mistress , was so good and kind that everybody loved her , and she would have led a happy life , had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her , and was constantly annoying her by his presence ."
"Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared ; but as they were careless , and the serpent very sly , it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them , and to frighten the princess by appearing before her ."
"One day she was seated in her room , playing on her favourite musical instrument , when she felt something gliding up her sash , and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek ."
"She shrieked and threw herself backwards , and Gon , who had been curled up on a stool at her feet , understood her terror , and with one bound seized the snake by his neck ."
"He gave him one bite and one shake , and flung him on the ground , where he lay , never to worry the princess any more ."
"Then she took Gon in her arms , and praised and caressed him , and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat , and the softest mats to lie on ; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again ."
"Time passed on , and one morning Gon lay before the house door , basking in the sun ."
"He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him , and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one ."
"He jumped up , full of rage , and chased away the big cat , and then he turned to comfort the little one , when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma ."
"At first Koma did not know him again , he had grown so large and stately ; but when it dawned upon her who it was , her happiness knew no bounds ."
"And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again , while their purring might have been heard a mile off ."
"Paw in paw they appeared before the princess , and told her the story of their life and its sorrows ."
"The princess wept for sympathy , and promised that they should never more be parted , but should live with her to the end of their days ."
"By-and-bye the princess herself got married , and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park ."
"And she told him all about her two cats , and how brave Gon had been , and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent ."
"And when the prince heard , he swore they should never leave them , but should go with the princess wherever she went ."
"So it all fell out as the princess wished ; and Gon and Koma had many children , and so had the princess , and they all played together , and were friends to the end of their lives ."

"Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together , for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him ."
"When they grew older , things became worse and worse , and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other , tied him to a tree , and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death ."
"However , it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock , and seeing the prisoner , he stopped and said to him , ` Tell me , my son why are you tied to that tree ? '"
"` Because I was so crooked , ' answered the young man ; ` but it has quite cured me , and now my back is as straight as can be . ' '"
"I wish you would bind me to a tree , ' exclaimed the shepherd , ` so that my back would get straight . '"
"` With all the pleasure in life , ' replied the youth ."
` If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can . '
"This was soon done , and then the young man drove off the sheep , leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly ; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen , and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures ."
"`` I couldnae , '' said she , shaking her head ."
"`` Na , I couldnae . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` but if ye could ? ''"
She answered him nothing .
"`` Look here , my lass , '' said Alan , `` there are boats in the Kingdom of Fife , for I saw two -LRB- no less -RRB- upon the beach , as I came in by your town 's end ."
"Now if we could have the use of a boat to pass under cloud of night into Lothian , and some secret , decent kind of a man to bring that boat back again and keep his counsel , there would be two souls saved -- mine to all likelihood -- his to a dead surety ."
"If we lack that boat , we have but three shillings left in this wide world ; and where to go , and how to do , and what other place there is for us except the chains of a gibbet -- I give you my naked word , I kenna !"
"Shall we go wanting , lassie ?"
"Are ye to lie in your warm bed and think upon us , when the wind gowls in the chimney and the rain tirls on the roof ?"
"Are ye to eat your meat by the cheeks of a red fire , and think upon this poor sick lad of mine , biting his finger ends on a blae muir for cauld and hunger ?"
"Sick or sound , he must aye be moving ; with the death grapple at his throat he must aye be trailing in the rain on the lang roads ; and when he gants his last on a rickle of cauld stanes , there will be nae friends near him but only me and God . ''"
"At this appeal , I could see the lass was in great trouble of mind , being tempted to help us , and yet in some fear she might be helping malefactors ; and so now I determined to step in myself and to allay her scruples with a portion of the truth ."
"`` Did ever you hear , '' said I , `` of Mr. Rankeillor of the Ferry ? ''"
`` Rankeillor the writer ? ''
said she .
`` I daur say that ! ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it 's to his door that I am bound , so you may judge by that if I am an ill-doer ; and I will tell you more , that though I am indeed , by a dreadful error , in some peril of my life , King George has no truer friend in all Scotland than myself . ''"
"Her face cleared up mightily at this , although Alan 's darkened ."
"`` That 's more than I would ask , '' said she ."
`` Mr. Rankeillor is a kennt man . ''
"And she bade us finish our meat , get clear of the clachan as soon as might be , and lie close in the bit wood on the sea-beach ."
"`` And ye can trust me , '' says she , `` I 'll find some means to put you over . ''"
"At this we waited for no more , but shook hands with her upon the bargain , made short work of the puddings , and set forth again from Limekilns as far as to the wood ."
"It was a small piece of perhaps a score of elders and hawthorns and a few young ashes , not thick enough to veil us from passersby upon the road or beach ."
"Here we must lie , however , making the best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had of a deliverance , and planing more particularly what remained for us to do ."
"We had but one trouble all day ; when a strolling piper came and sat in the same wood with us ; a red-nosed , bleareyed , drunken dog , with a great bottle of whisky in his pocket , and a long story of wrongs that had been done him by all sorts of persons , from the Lord President of the Court of Session , who had denied him justice , down to the Bailies of Inverkeithing who had given him more of it than he desired ."
It was impossible but he should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all day concealed in a thicket and having no business to allege .
"As long as he stayed there he kept us in hot water with prying questions ; and after he was gone , as he was a man not very likely to hold his tongue , we were in the greater impatience to be gone ourselves ."
"The day came to an end with the same brightness ; the night fell quiet and clear ; lights came out in houses and hamlets and then , one after another , began to be put out ; but it was past eleven , and we were long since strangely tortured with anxieties , before we heard the grinding of oars upon the rowing-pins ."
"At that , we looked out and saw the lass herself coming rowing to us in a boat ."
"She had trusted no one with our affairs , not even her sweetheart , if she had one ; but as soon as her father was asleep , had left the house by a window , stolen a neighbour 's boat , and come to our assistance single-handed ."
"I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks ; but she was no less abashed at the thought of hearing them ; begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace , saying -LRB- very properly -RRB- that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence ; and so , what with one thing and another , she had set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden , had shaken hands with us , and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns , before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude ."
"He was mighty plainly habited , with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears , and smoked a foul cutty pipe ."
"For all that he had the manners of a king , and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us ."
"`` Well , Mr. Stewart , come awa ' , sir ! ''"
"said he , `` and bring in your friend that as yet I dinna ken the name of . ''"
"`` And how is yourself , Cluny ? ''"
said Alan .
"`` I hope ye do brawly , sir ."
"And I am proud to see ye , and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws , Mr. David Balfour . ''"
"Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer , when we were alone ; but with strangers , he rang the words out like a herald ."
"`` Step in by , the both of ye , gentlemen , '' says Cluny ."
"`` I make ye welcome to my house , which is a queer , rude place for certain , but one where I have entertained a royal personage , Mr. Stewart -- ye doubtless ken the personage I have in my eye ."
"We 'll take a dram for luck , and as soon as this handless man of mine has the collops ready , we 'll dine and take a hand at the cartes as gentlemen should ."
"My life is a bit driegh , '' says he , pouring out the brandy ; `` I see little company , and sit and twirl my thumbs , and mind upon a great day that is gone by , and weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon the road ."
And so here 's a toast to ye : The Restoration ! ''
Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank .
"I am sure I wished no ill to King George ; and if he had been there himself in proper person , it 's like he would have done as I did ."
"No sooner had I taken out the drain than I felt hugely better , and could look on and listen , still a little mistily perhaps , but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind ."
"It was certainly a strange place , and we had a strange host ."
"In his long hiding , Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits , like those of an old maid ."
"He had a particular place , where no one else must sit ; the Cage was arranged in a particular way , which none must disturb ; cookery was one of his chief fancies , and even while he was greeting us in , he kept an eye to the collops ."
"It appears , he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends , under the cover of night ; but for the more part lived quite alone , and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage ."
"The first thing in the morning , one of them , who was a barber , came and shaved him , and gave him the news of the country , of which he was immoderately greedy ."
"There was no end to his questions ; he put them as earnestly as a child ; and at some of the answers , laughed out of all bounds of reason , and would break out again laughing at the mere memory , hours after the barber was gone ."
"To be sure , there might have been a purpose in his questions ; for though he was thus sequestered , and like the other landed gentlemen of Scotland , stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers , he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan ."
"Disputes were brought to him in his hiding-hole to be decided ; and the men of his country , who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session , laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw ."
"When he was angered , which was often enough , he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king ; and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father ."
"With each of them , as he entered , he ceremoniously shook hands , both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner ."
"Altogether , I had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a Highland clan ; and this with a proscribed , fugitive chief ; his country conquered ; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him , sometimes within a mile of where he lay ; and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened , could have made a fortune by betraying him ."
"On that first day , as soon as the collops were ready , Cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon -LRB- for he was well supplied with luxuries -RRB- and bade us draw in to our meal ."
"`` They , '' said he , meaning the collops , `` are such as I gave his Royal Highness in this very house ; bating the lemon juice , for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen ."
"* Indeed , there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six . ''"
* Condiment .
"`` Sir Richard , '' replied the man-at-arms , `` I would follow the line until they scatter . ''"
"`` Ye are , doubtless , right , '' returned Dick ; `` but we came right hastily upon the errand , even as the time commanded ."
"Here are no houses , neither for food nor shelter , and by the morrow 's dawn we shall know both cold fingers and an empty belly ."
"How say ye , lads ?"
"Will ye stand a pinch for expedition 's sake , or shall we turn by Holywood and sup with Mother Church ?"
"The case being somewhat doubtful , I will drive no man ; yet if ye would suffer me to lead you , ye would choose the first . ''"
"The men answered , almost with one voice , that they would follow Sir Richard where he would ."
"And Dick , setting spur to his horse , began once more to go forward ."
"The snow in the trail had been trodden very hard , and the pursuers had thus a great advantage over the pursued ."
"They pushed on , indeed , at a round trot , two hundred hoofs beating alternately on the dull pavement of the snow , and the jingle of weapons and the snorting of horses raising a warlike noise along the arches of the silent wood ."
"Presently , the wide slot of the pursued came out upon the high road from Holywood ; it was there , for a moment , indistinguishable ; and , where it once more plunged into the unbeaten snow upon the farther side , Dick was surprised to see it narrower and lighter trod ."
"Plainly , profiting by the road , Sir Daniel had begun already to scatter his command ."
"At all hazards , one chance being equal to another , Dick continued to pursue the straight trail ; and that , after an hour 's riding , in which it led into the very depths of the forest , suddenly split , like a bursting shell , into two dozen others , leading to every point of the compass ."
Dick drew bridle in despair .
"The short winter 's day was near an end ; the sun , a dull red orange , shorn of rays , swam low among the leafless thickets ; the shadows were a mile long upon the snow ; the frost bit cruelly at the finger-nails ; and the breath and steam of the horses mounted in a cloud ."
"`` Well , we are outwitted , '' Dick confessed ."
"`` Strike we for Holywood , after all ."
It is still nearer us than Tunstall -- or should be by the station of the sun . ''
"So they wheeled to their left , turning their backs on the red shield of sun , and made across country for the abbey ."
"But now times were changed with them ; they could no longer spank forth briskly on a path beaten firm by the passage of their foes , and for a goal to which that path itself conducted them ."
"Now they must plough at a dull pace through the encumbering snow , continually pausing to decide their course , continually floundering in drifts ."
"The sun soon left them ; the glow of the west decayed ; and presently they were wandering in a shadow of blackness , under frosty stars ."
"Presently , indeed , the moon would clear the hilltops , and they might resume their march ."
"But till then , every random step might carry them wider of their march ."
There was nothing for it but to camp and wait .
"Sentries were posted ; a spot of ground was cleared of snow , and , after some failures , a good fire blazed in the midst ."
"The men-at-arms sat close about this forest hearth , sharing such provisions as they had , and passing about the flask ; and Dick , having collected the most delicate of the rough and scanty fare , brought it to Lord Risingham 's niece , where she sat apart from the soldiery against a tree ."
"She sat upon one horse-cloth , wrapped in another , and stared straight before her at the firelit scene ."
"At the offer of food she started , like one wakened from a dream , and then silently refused ."
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` let me beseech you , punish me not so cruelly ."
"Wherein I have offended you , I know not ; I have , indeed , carried you away , but with a friendly violence ; I have , indeed , exposed you to the inclemency of night , but the hurry that lies upon me hath for its end the preservation of another , who is no less frail and no less unfriended than yourself ."
"At least , madam , punish not yourself ; and eat , if not for hunger , then for strength . ''"
"He may be brave in battle , but he hath the liar 's eye ; there is fear in his eye , Dick , and fear is as cruel as the wolf !"
"We go down into that house , Saint Mary guide us forth again ! ''"
"And so they continued their descent in silence , and came out at last before Sir Daniel 's forest stronghold , where it stood , low and shady , flanked with round towers and stained with moss and lichen , in the lilied waters of the moat ."
"Even as they appeared , the doors were opened , the bridge lowered , and Sir Daniel himself , with Hatch and the parson at his side , stood ready to receive them ."
BOOK II -- THE MOAT HOUSE CHAPTER I -- DICK ASKS QUESTIONS The Moat House stood not far from the rough forest road .
"Externally , it was a compact rectangle of red stone , flanked at each corner by a round tower , pierced for archery and battlemented at the top ."
"Within , it enclosed a narrow court ."
"The moat was perhaps twelve feet wide , crossed by a single drawbridge ."
"It was supplied with water by a trench , leading to a forest pool and commanded , through its whole length , from the battlements of the two southern towers ."
"Except that one or two tall and thick trees had been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the walls , the house was in a good posture for defence ."
"In the court , Dick found a part of the garrison , busy with preparations for defence , and gloomily discussing the chances of a siege ."
"Some were making arrows , some sharpening swords that had long been disused ; but even as they worked , they shook their heads ."
"Twelve of Sir Daniel 's party had escaped the battle , run the gauntlet through the wood , and come alive to the Moat House ."
"But out of this dozen , three had been gravely wounded : two at Risingham in the disorder of the rout , one by John Amend-All 's marksmen as he crossed the forest ."
"This raised the force of the garrison , counting Hatch , Sir Daniel , and young Shelton , to twenty-two effective men ."
And more might be continually expected to arrive .
The danger lay not therefore in the lack of men .
It was the terror of the Black Arrow that oppressed the spirits of the garrison .
"For their open foes of the party of York , in these most changing times , they felt but a far-away concern ."
"`` The world , '' as people said in those days , `` might change again '' before harm came ."
"But for their neighbours in the wood , they trembled ."
It was not Sir Daniel alone who was a mark for hatred .
"His men , conscious of impunity , had carried themselves cruelly through all the country ."
"Harsh commands had been harshly executed ; and of the little band that now sat talking in the court , there was not one but had been guilty of some act of oppression or barbarity ."
"And now , by the fortune of war , Sir Daniel had become powerless to protect his instruments ; now , by the issue of some hours of battle , at which many of them had not been present , they had all become punishable traitors to the State , outside the buckler of the law , a shrunken company in a poor fortress that was hardly tenable , and exposed upon all sides to the just resentment of their victims ."
Nor had there been lacking grisly advertisements of what they might expect .
"At different periods of the evening and the night , no fewer than seven riderless horses had come neighing in terror to the gate ."
Two were from Selden 's troop ; five belonged to men who had ridden with Sir Daniel to the field .
"Lastly , a little before dawn , a spearman had come staggering to the moat side , pierced by three arrows ; even as they carried him in , his spirit had departed ; but by the words that he uttered in his agony , he must have been the last survivor of a considerable company of men ."
"Hatch himself showed , under his sun-brown , the pallour of anxiety ; and when he had taken Dick aside and learned the fate of Selden , he fell on a stone bench and fairly wept ."
"The others , from where they sat on stools or doorsteps in the sunny angle of the court , looked at him with wonder and alarm , but none ventured to inquire the cause of his emotion ."
"`` Nay , Master Shelton , '' said Hatch , at last -- `` nay , but what said I ?"
"And in a moment a crowd of beautiful creatures , each one with a crown on her head , stood before her ."
"Certainly none could have guessed that they were the snails , water-rats , and grasshoppers from which she had chosen her retinue ."
"At a sign from the frog the fairies danced a ballet , with which everyone was so delighted that they begged to have to repeated ; but now it was not youths and maidens who were dancing , but flowers ."
"Then these again melted into fountains , whose waters interlaced and , rushing down the sides of the hall , poured out in a cascade down the steps , and formed a river found the castle , with the most beautiful little boats upon it , all painted and gilded ."
"` Oh , let us go in them for a sail ! '"
"cried the princess , who had long ago left her game of ball for a sight of these marvels , and , as she was bent upon it , the ambassadors , who had been charged never to lose sight of her , were obliged to go also , though they never entered a boat if they could help it ."
"But the moment they and the princess had seated themselves on the soft cushions , river and boats vanished , and the princess and the ambassadors vanished too ."
Instead the snails and grasshoppers and water-rats stood round the frog in their natural shapes .
"` Perhaps , ' said she , ` your Majesty may now be convinced that I am a fairy and speak the truth ."
Therefore lose no time in setting in order the affairs of your kingdom and go in search of your wife .
"Here is a ring that will admit you into the presence of the queen , and will likewise allow you to address unharmed the Lion Fairy , though she is the most terrible creature that ever existed . '"
"By this time the king had forgotten all about the princess , whom he had only chosen to please his people , and was as eager to depart on his journey as the frog was for him to go ."
"He made one of his ministers regent of the kingdom , and gave the frog everything her heart could desire ; and with her ring on his finger he rode away to the outskirts of the forest ."
"Here he dismounted , and bidding his horse go home , he pushed forward on foot ."
"Having nothing to guide him as to where he was likely to find the entrance of the under-world , the king wandered hither and thither for a long while , till , one day , while he was resting under a tree , a voice spoke to him ."
"` Why do you give yourself so much trouble for nought , when you might know what you want to know for the asking ?"
Alone you will never discover the path that leads to your wife . '
"Much startled , the king looked about him ."
"He could see nothing , and somehow , when he thought about it , the voice seemed as if it were part of himself ."
"Suddenly his eyes fell on the ring , and he understood ."
` Fool that I was ! '
cried he ; ` and how much precious time have I wasted ?
"Dear ring , I beseech you , grant me a vision of my wife and my daughter ! '"
"And even as he spoke there flashed past him a huge lioness , followed by a lady and a beautiful young maid mounted on fairy horses ."
"Almost fainting with joy he gazed after them , and then sank back trembling on the ground ."
"` Oh , lead me to them , lead me to them ! '"
he exclaimed .
"And the ring , bidding him take courage , conducted him safely to the dismal place where his wife had lived for ten years ."
"Now the Lion Fairy knew beforehand of his expected presence in her dominions , and she ordered a palace of crystal to be built in the middle of the lake of quicksilver ; and in order to make it more difficult of approach she let it float whither it would ."
"Immediately after their return from the chase , where the king had seen them , she conveyed the queen and Muffette into the palace , and put them under the guard of the monsters of the lake , who one and all had fallen in love with the princess ."
"They were horribly jealous , and ready to eat each other up for her sake , so they readily accepted the charge ."
"Some stationed themselves round the floating palace , some sat by the door , while the smallest and lightest perched themselves on the roof ."
`` What made you take such a long walk ?
"You look as tired as if you 'd been ten miles , '' said Jill , hoping to discover the length of the trip ."
`` Had to .
"Four or five miles is n't much , only my leg bothered me ; '' and Jack gave the ailing member a slap , as if he had found it much in his way that day ; for , though he had given up the crutches long ago , he rather missed their support sometimes ."
"Then , with a great yawn , he stretched himself out to bask in the blaze , pillowing his head on his arms ."
"`` Dear old thing , he looks all used up ; I wo n't plague him with talking ; '' and Jill began to sing , as she often did in the twilight ."
"By the time the first song ended a gentle snore was heard , and Jack lay fast asleep , worn out with the busy week and the walk , which had been longer and harder than any one guessed ."
"Jill took up her knitting and worked quietly by firelight , still wondering and guessing what the secret could be ; for she had not much to amuse her , and little things were very interesting if connected with her friends ."
"Presently Jack rolled over and began to mutter in his sleep , as he often did when too weary for sound slumber ."
Jill paid no attention till he uttered a name which made her prick up her ears and listen to the broken sentences which followed .
"Only a few words , but she dropped her work , saying to herself , -- `` I do believe he is talking about the secret ."
"Now I shall find out , and he will tell me himself , as I said he would . ''"
"Much pleased , she leaned and listened , but could make no sense of the confused babble about `` heavy boots ; '' `` All right , old fellow ; '' `` Jerry 's off ; '' and `` The ink is too thick . ''"
"The slam of the front door woke Jack , and he pulled himself up , declaring that he believed he had been having a nap ."
"`` I wish you 'd have another , '' said Jill , greatly disappointed at the loss of the intelligence she seemed to be so near getting ."
`` Floor is too hard for tired bones .
Guess I 'll go to bed and get rested up for Monday .
"I 've worked like fury this week , so next I 'm going in for fun ; '' and , little dreaming what hard times were in store for him , Jack went off to enjoy his warm bath and welcome bed , where he was soon sleeping with the serene look of one whose dreams were happy , whose conscience was at rest ."
"* * * * * `` I have a few words to say to you before you go , '' said Mr. Acton , pausing with his hand on the bell , Monday afternoon , when the hour came for dismissing school ."
"The bustle of putting away books and preparing for as rapid a departure as propriety allowed , subsided suddenly , and the boys and girls sat as still as mice , while the hearts of such as had been guilty of any small sins began to beat fast ."
"`` You remember that we had some trouble last winter about keeping the boys away from the saloon , and that a rule was made forbidding any pupil to go to town during recess ? ''"
"began Mr. Acton , who , being a conscientious man as well as an excellent teacher , felt that he was responsible for the children in school hours , and did his best to aid parents in guarding them from the few temptations which beset them in a country town ."
"A certain attractive little shop , where confectionery , baseballs , stationery , and picture papers were sold , was a favorite loafing place for some of the boys till the rule forbidding it was made , because in the rear of the shop was a beer and billiard saloon ."
"A wise rule , for the picture papers were not always of the best sort ; cigars were to be had ; idle fellows hung about there , and some of the lads , who wanted to be thought manly , ventured to pass the green baize door `` just to look on . ''"
"A murmur answered the teacher 's question , and he continued , `` You all know that the rule was broken several times , and I told you the next offender would be publicly reprimanded , as private punishments had no effect ."
"I am sorry to say that the time has come , and the offender is a boy whom I trusted entirely ."
"It grieves me to do this , but I must keep my promise , and hope the example will have a good effect . ''"
"Mr. Acton paused , as if he found it hard to go on , and the boys looked at one another with inquiring eyes , for their teacher seldom punished , and when he did , it was a very solemn thing ."
"Several of these anxious glances fell upon Joe , who was very red and sat whittling a pencil as if he dared not lift his eyes ."
`` He 's the chap .
Wo n't he catch it ? ''
"whispered Gus to Frank , for both owed him a grudge ."
"David wonders whether they know each other , now that they are so different , and if it makes them fight with the wrong ones ."
"They are great fighters , and thus so unlike country sheep that every year they give my St. Bernard dog , Porthos , a shock ."
"He can make a field of country sheep fly by merely announcing his approach , but these town sheep come toward him with no promise of gentle entertainment , and then a light from last year breaks upon Porthos ."
"He can not with dignity retreat , but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery , and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye ."
-LSB- Illustration : Porthos -RSB- The Serpentine begins near here .
"It is a lovely lake , and there is a drowned forest at the bottom of it ."
"If you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down , and they say that at night there are also drowned stars in it ."
"If so , Peter Pan sees them when he is sailing across the lake in the Thrush 's Nest ."
"A small part only of the Serpentine is in the Gardens , for soon it passes beneath a bridge to far away where the island is on which all the birds are born that become baby boys and girls ."
"No one who is human , except Peter Pan -LRB- and he is only half human -RRB- , can land on the island , but you may write what you want -LRB- boy or girl , dark or fair -RRB- on a piece of paper , and then twist it into the shape of a boat and slip it into the water , and it reaches Peter Pan 's island after dark ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One of the Paths that have Made Themselves -RSB- We are on the way home now , though of course , it is all pretence that we can go to so many of the places in one day ."
"I should have had to be carrying David long ago , and resting on every seat like old Mr. Salford ."
"That was what we called him , because he always talked to us of a lovely place called Salford where he had been born ."
"He was a crab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens from seat to seat trying to fall in with somebody who was acquainted with the town of Salford , and when we had known him for a year or more we actually did meet another aged solitary who had once spent Saturday to Monday in Salford ."
"He was meek and timid , and carried his address inside his hat , and whatever part of London he was in search of he always went to Westminster Abbey first as a starting-point ."
"Him we carried in triumph to our other friend , with the story of that Saturday to Monday , and never shall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr. Salford leapt at him ."
"They have been cronies ever since , and I notice that Mr. Salford , who naturally does most of the talking , keeps tight grip of the other old man 's coat ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Old Mr. Salford was a crab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Away he flew , right over the houses to the Gardens -RSB- The two last places before you come to our gate are the Dogs ' Cemetery and the chaffinch 's nest , but we pretend not to know what the Dogs ' Cemetery is , as Porthos is always with us ."
The nest is very sad .
"It is quite white , and the way we found it was wonderful ."
"We were having another look among the bushes for David 's lost worsted ball , and instead of the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted , and containing four eggs , with scratches on them very like David 's handwriting , so we think they must have been the mother 's love-letters to the little ones inside ."
"Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a call at the nest , taking care that no cruel boy should see us , and we dropped crumbs , and soon the bird knew us as friends , and sat in the nest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up ."
"But one day when we went there were only two eggs in the nest , and the next time there were none ."
"The saddest part of it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about the bushes , looking so reproachfully at us that we knew she thought we had done it ; and though David tried to explain to her , it was so long since he had spoken the bird language that I fear she did not understand ."
He and I left the Gardens that day with our knuckles in our eyes .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Grand Tour of the Gardens ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Peter Pan ' -RSB- II PETER PAN If you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl , she will say , ` Why , of course I did , child ' ; and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days , she will say , ` What a foolish question to ask ; certainly he did . '"
"Then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl , she also says , ` Why , of course I did , child , ' but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days , she says she never heard of his having a goat ."
"Perhaps she has forgotten , just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred , which is your mother 's name ."
"Still , she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat ."
Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl .
"This shows that , in telling the story of Peter Pan , to begin with the goat -LRB- as most people do -RRB- is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest ."
"Of course , it also shows that Peter is ever so old , but he is really always the same age , so that does not matter in the least ."
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , ` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , ' they did what they should have done at first -- chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"` We are very busy people , ' they grumbled , ` and this would be a big job . '"
"` Quite so , ' said Solomon , ` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . '
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of the year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
"He sent over to the house-tops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests , and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !"
"It was known afterwards on the island as the Sparrows ' Year ; and so , when you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"-LSB- Illustration : When you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are -RSB- Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labour , the boat was finished ."
O the glory of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
"It is brown inside , of course , but outside it is mostly green , being woven of grass and twigs , and when these wither or snap the walls are thatched afresh ."
"There are also a few feathers here and there , which came off the thrushes while they were building ."
"The other birds were extremely jealous , and said that the boat would not balance on the water , but it lay most beautifully steady ; they said the water would come into it , but no water came into it ."
"Next they said that Peter had no oars , and this caused the thrushes to look at each other in dismay ; but Peter replied that he had no need of oars , for he had a sail , and with such a proud , happy face he produced a sail which he had fashioned out of his nightgown , and though it was still rather like a nightgown it made a lovely sail ."
"And that night , the moon being full , and all the birds asleep , he did enter his coracle -LRB- as Master Francis Pretty would have said -RRB- and depart out of the island ."
"And first , he knew not why , he looked upward , with his hands clasped , and from that moment his eyes were pinned to the west ."
"He had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages , with them as his guides , but far away he saw the Kensington Gardens beckoning to him beneath the bridge , and he could not wait ."
"They usually pretend to be flowers , because the court sits in the Fairies ' Basin , and there are so many flowers there , and all along the Baby Walk , that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention ."
"They dress exactly like flowers , and change with the seasons , putting on white when lilies are in and blue for bluebells , and so on ."
"They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all , as they are partial to a bit of colour , but tulips -LRB- except white ones , which are the fairy cradles -RRB- they consider garish , and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days , so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them ."
"When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively , but if you look , and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still pretending to be flowers ."
"Then , after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies , they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure ."
"The Fairy Basin , you remember , is all covered with ground-ivy -LRB- from which they make their castor-oil -RRB- , with flowers growing in it here and there ."
"Most of them really are flowers , but some of them are fairies ."
"You never can be sure of them , but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way , and then turn round sharply ."
"Another good plan , which David and I sometimes follow , is to stare them down ."
"After a long time they ca n't help winking , and then you know for certain that they are fairies ."
"-LSB- Illustration : But if you look , and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still pretending to be flowers -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- There are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk , which is a famous gentle place , as spots frequented by fairies are called ."
Once twenty-four of them had an extraordinary adventure .
"They were a girls ' school out for a walk with the governess , and all wearing hyacinth gowns , when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth , and then they all stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths ."
Unfortunately what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to plant new flowers in that very bed .
"They were wheeling a hand-cart with the flowers in it , and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied ."
"` Pity to lift them hyacinths , ' said the one man ."
"` Duke 's orders , ' replied the other , and , having emptied the cart , they dug up the boarding-school and put the poor , terrified things in it in five rows ."
"Of course , neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that they were fairies , so they were carted far away to a potting-shed , out of which they escaped in the night without their shoes , but there was a great row about it among the parents , and the school was ruined ."
"As for their houses , it is no use looking for them , because they are the exact opposite of our houses ."
You can see our houses by day but you ca n't see them by dark .
"Well , you can see their houses by dark , but you ca n't see them by day , for they are the colour of night , and I never heard of any one yet who could see night in the daytime ."
"This does not mean that they are black , for night has its colours just as day has , but ever so much brighter ."
Their blues and reds and greens are like ours with a light behind them .
"The palace is entirely built of many-coloured glasses , and it is quite the loveliest of all royal residences , but the queen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see what she is doing ."
"They are very inquisitive folk , and press quite hard against the glass , and that is why their noses are mostly snubby ."
"The streets are miles long and very twisty , and have paths on each side made of bright worsted ."
"The birds used to steal the worsted for their nests , but a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end ."
-LSB- Illustration : The fairies are exquisite dancers -RSB- One of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they never do anything useful .
"When the first baby laughed for the first time , his laugh broke into a million pieces , and they all went skipping about ."
That was the beginning of fairies .
"They look tremendously busy , you know , as if they had not a moment to spare , but if you were to ask them what they are doing , they could not tell you in the least ."
"They are frightfully ignorant , and everything they do is make-believe ."
Win glory for me : one Richard for another .
"I tell you , if I rise , ye shall rise by the same ladder ."
"Go , '' he added , shaking him by the hand ."
"But , as soon as Dick was gone , he turned to a little shabby archer at his elbow ."
"`` Go , Dutton , and that right speedily , '' he added ."
`` Follow that lad .
"If ye find him faithful , ye answer for his safety , a head for a head ."
"Woe unto you , if ye return without him !"
"But if he be faithless -- or , for one instant , ye misdoubt him -- stab him from behind . ''"
In the meanwhile Dick hastened to secure his post .
"The street he had to guard was very narrow , and closely lined with houses , which projected and overhung the roadway ; but narrow and dark as it was , since it opened upon the market-place of the town , the main issue of the battle would probably fall to be decided on that spot ."
"The market-place was full of townspeople fleeing in disorder ; but there was as yet no sign of any foeman ready to attack , and Dick judged he had some time before him to make ready his defence ."
"The two houses at the end stood deserted , with open doors , as the inhabitants had left them in their flight , and from these he had the furniture hastily tossed forth and piled into a barrier in the entry of the lane ."
"A hundred men were placed at his disposal , and of these he threw the more part into the houses , where they might lie in shelter and deliver their arrows from the windows ."
"With the rest , under his own immediate eye , he lined the barricade ."
"Meanwhile the utmost uproar and confusion had continued to prevail throughout the town ; and what with the hurried clashing of bells , the sounding of trumpets , the swift movement of bodies of horse , the cries of the commanders , and the shrieks of women , the noise was almost deafening to the ear ."
"Presently , little by little , the tumult began to subside ; and soon after , files of men in armour and bodies of archers began to assemble and form in line of battle in the market-place ."
"A large portion of this body were in murrey and blue , and in the mounted knight who ordered their array Dick recognised Sir Daniel Brackley ."
"Then there befell a long pause , which was followed by the almost simultaneous sounding of four trumpets from four different quarters of the town ."
"A fifth rang in answer from the market-place , and at the same moment the files began to move , and a shower of arrows rattled about the barricade , and sounded like blows upon the walls of the two flanking houses ."
"The attack had begun , by a common signal , on all the five issues of the quarter ."
"Gloucester was beleaguered upon every side ; and Dick judged , if he would make good his post , he must rely entirely on the hundred men of his command ."
"Seven volleys of arrows followed one upon the other , and in the very thick of the discharges Dick was touched from behind upon the arm , and found a page holding out to him a leathern jack , strengthened with bright plates of mail ."
"`` It is from my Lord of Gloucester , '' said the page ."
"`` He hath observed , Sir Richard , that ye went unarmed . ''"
"Dick , with a glow at his heart at being so addressed , got to his feet and , with the assistance of the page , donned the defensive coat ."
"Even as he did so , two arrows rattled harmlessly upon the plates , and a third struck down the page , mortally wounded , at his feet ."
Meantime the whole body of the enemy had been steadily drawing nearer across the market-place ; and by this time were so close at hand that Dick gave the order to return their shot .
"Immediately , from behind the barrier and from the windows of the houses , a counterblast of arrows sped , carrying death ."
"But the Lancastrians , as if they had but waited for a signal , shouted loudly in answer ; and began to close at a run upon the barrier , the horsemen still hanging back , with visors lowered ."
"Then followed an obstinate and deadly struggle , hand to hand ."
"The assailants , wielding their falchions with one hand , strove with the other to drag down the structure of the barricade ."
"Nae doubt it 's a hard thing to skulk and starve in the Heather , but it 's harder yet to lie shackled in a red-coat prison . ''"
"I asked him whither we should flee ; and as he told me `` to the Lowlands , '' I was a little better inclined to go with him ; for , indeed , I was growing impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle ."
"Besides , Alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the matter , that I began to be afraid he might be right ."
"Of all deaths , I would truly like least to die by the gallows ; and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness -LRB- as I had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar 's ballad -RRB- and took away my appetite for courts of justice ."
"`` I 'll chance it , Alan , '' said I. `` I 'll go with you . ''"
"`` But mind you , '' said Alan , `` it 's no small thing ."
"Ye maun lie bare and hard , and brook many an empty belly ."
"Your bed shall be the moorcock 's , and your life shall be like the hunted deer 's , and ye shall sleep with your hand upon your weapons ."
"Ay , man , ye shall taigle many a weary foot , or we get clear !"
"I tell ye this at the start , for it 's a life that I ken well ."
"But if ye ask what other chance ye have , I answer : Nane ."
"Either take to the heather with me , or else hang . ''"
"`` And that 's a choice very easily made , '' said I ; and we shook hands upon it ."
"`` And now let 's take another keek at the red-coats , '' says Alan , and he led me to the north-eastern fringe of the wood ."
"Looking out between the trees , we could see a great side of mountain , running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch ."
"It was a rough part , all hanging stone , and heather , and big scrogs of birchwood ; and away at the far end towards Balachulish , little wee red soldiers were dipping up and down over hill and howe , and growing smaller every minute ."
"There was no cheering now , for I think they had other uses for what breath was left them ; but they still stuck to the trail , and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them ."
"Alan watched them , smiling to himself ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` they 'll be gey weary before they 've got to the end of that employ !"
"And so you and me , David , can sit down and eat a bite , and breathe a bit longer , and take a dram from my bottle ."
"Then we 'll strike for Aucharn , the house of my kinsman , James of the Glens , where I must get my clothes , and my arms , and money to carry us along ; and then , David , we 'll cry , ` Forth , Fortune ! '"
and take a cast among the heather . ''
"So we sat again and ate and drank , in a place whence we could see the sun going down into a field of great , wild , and houseless mountains , such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion ."
"Partly as we so sat , and partly afterwards , on the way to Aucharn , each of us narrated his adventures ; and I shall here set down so much of Alan 's as seems either curious or needful ."
"It appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed ; saw me , and lost me , and saw me again , as I tumbled in the roost ; and at last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard ."
"It was this that put him in some hope I would maybe get to land after all , and made him leave those clues and messages which had brought me -LRB- for my sins -RRB- to that unlucky country of Appin ."
"In the meanwhile , those still on the brig had got the skiff launched , and one or two were on board of her already , when there came a second wave greater than the first , and heaved the brig out of her place , and would certainly have sent her to the bottom , had she not struck and caught on some projection of the reef ."
"When she had struck first , it had been bows-on , so that the stern had hitherto been lowest ."
"But now her stern was thrown in the air , and the bows plunged under the sea ; and with that , the water began to pour into the fore-scuttle like the pouring of a mill-dam ."
"It took the colour out of Alan 's face , even to tell what followed ."
"For there were still two men lying impotent in their bunks ; and these , seeing the water pour in and thinking the ship had foundered , began to cry out aloud , and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars ."
"They were not two hundred yards away , when there came a third great sea ; and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef ; her canvas filled for a moment , and she seemed to sail in chase of them , but settling all the while ; and presently she drew down and down , as if a hand was drawing her ; and the sea closed over the Covenant of Dysart ."
"`` Robin Oig , '' he said , when it was done , `` ye are a great piper ."
I am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye .
Body of me !
ye have mair music in your sporran than I have in my head !
"And though it still sticks in my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel , I warn ye beforehand -- it 'll no be fair !"
It would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can ! ''
"Thereupon that quarrel was made up ; all night long the brose was going and the pipes changing hands ; and the day had come pretty bright , and the three men were none the better for what they had been taking , before Robin as much as thought upon the road ."
"CHAPTER XXVI END OF THE FLIGHT : WE PASS THE FORTH The month , as I have said , was not yet out , but it was already far through August , and beautiful warm weather , with every sign of an early and great harvest , when I was pronounced able for my journey ."
"Our money was now run to so low an ebb that we must think first of all on speed ; for if we came not soon to Mr. Rankeillor 's , or if when we came there he should fail to help me , we must surely starve ."
"In Alan 's view , besides , the hunt must have now greatly slackened ; and the line of the Forth and even Stirling Bridge , which is the main pass over that river , would be watched with little interest ."
"`` It 's a chief principle in military affairs , '' said he , `` to go where ye are least expected ."
"Forth is our trouble ; ye ken the saying , ` Forth bridles the wild Hielandman . '"
"Well , if we seek to creep round about the head of that river and come down by Kippen or Balfron , it 's just precisely there that they 'll be looking to lay hands on us ."
"But if we stave on straight to the auld Brig of Stirling , I 'll lay my sword they let us pass unchallenged . ''"
"The first night , accordingly , we pushed to the house of a Maclaren in Strathire , a friend of Duncan 's , where we slept the twenty-first of the month , and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make another easy stage ."
"The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the hillside in Uam Var , within view of a herd of deer , the happiest ten hours of sleep in a fine , breathing sunshine and on bone-dry ground , that I have ever tasted ."
"That night we struck Allan Water , and followed it down ; and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole Carse of Stirling underfoot , as flat as a pancake , with the town and castle on a hill in the midst of it , and the moon shining on the Links of Forth ."
"`` Now , '' said Alan , `` I kenna if ye care , but ye 're in your own land again ."
"We passed the Hieland Line in the first hour ; and now if we could but pass yon crooked water , we might cast our bonnets in the air . ''"
"In Allan Water , near by where it falls into the Forth , we found a little sandy islet , overgrown with burdock , butterbur and the like low plants , that would just cover us if we lay flat ."
"Here it was we made our camp , within plain view of Stirling Castle , whence we could hear the drums beat as some part of the garrison paraded ."
"Shearers worked all day in a field on one side of the river , and we could hear the stones going on the hooks and the voices and even the words of the men talking ."
It behoved to lie close and keep silent .
"But the sand of the little isle was sun-warm , the green plants gave us shelter for our heads , we had food and drink in plenty ; and to crown all , we were within sight of safety ."
"As soon as the shearers quit their work and the dusk began to fall , we waded ashore and struck for the Bridge of Stirling , keeping to the fields and under the field fences ."
"The bridge is close under the castle hill , an old , high , narrow bridge with pinnacles along the parapet ; and you may conceive with how much interest I looked upon it , not only as a place famous in history , but as the very doors of salvation to Alan and myself ."
"The moon was not yet up when we came there ; a few lights shone along the front of the fortress , and lower down a few lighted windows in the town ; but it was all mighty still , and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage ."
I was for pushing straight across ; but Alan was more wary .
"`` It looks unco ' quiet , '' said he ; `` but for all that we 'll lie down here cannily behind a dyke , and make sure . ''"
"So we lay for about a quarter of an hour , whiles whispering , whiles lying still and hearing nothing earthly but the washing of the water on the piers ."
"At last there came by an old , hobbling woman with a crutch stick ; who first stopped a little , close to where we lay , and bemoaned herself and the long way she had travelled ; and then set forth again up the steep spring of the bridge ."
"The woman was so little , and the night still so dark , that we soon lost sight of her ; only heard the sound of her steps , and her stick , and a cough that she had by fits , draw slowly farther away ."
"His brig was like wife and child to him ; he had looked on , day by day , at the mishandling of poor Ransome ; but when it came to the brig , he seemed to suffer along with her ."
"All the time of our working at the boat , I remember only one other thing : that I asked Alan , looking across at the shore , what country it was ; and he answered , it was the worst possible for him , for it was a land of the Campbells ."
We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us warning .
"Well , we had the boat about ready to be launched , when this man sang out pretty shrill : `` For God 's sake , hold on ! ''"
"We knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary ; and sure enough , there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her over on her beam ."
"Whether the cry came too late , or my hold was too weak , I know not ; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea ."
"I went down , and drank my fill , and then came up , and got a blink of the moon , and then down again ."
They say a man sinks a third time for good .
"I can not be made like other folk , then ; for I would not like to write how often I went down , or how often I came up again ."
"All the while , I was being hurled along , and beaten upon and choked , and then swallowed whole ; and the thing was so distracting to my wits , that I was neither sorry nor afraid ."
"Presently , I found I was holding to a spar , which helped me somewhat ."
"And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water , and began to come to myself ."
"It was the spare yard I had got hold of , and I was amazed to see how far I had travelled from the brig. I hailed her , indeed ; but it was plain she was already out of cry ."
"She was still holding together ; but whether or not they had yet launched the boat , I was too far off and too low down to see ."
"While I was hailing the brig , I spied a tract of water lying between us where no great waves came , but which yet boiled white all over and bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles ."
"Sometimes the whole tract swung to one side , like the tail of a live serpent ; sometimes , for a glimpse , it would all disappear and then boil up again ."
"What it was I had no guess , which for the time increased my fear of it ; but I now know it must have been the roost or tide race , which had carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly , and at last , as if tired of that play , had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin ."
"I now lay quite becalmed , and began to feel that a man can die of cold as well as of drowning ."
The shores of Earraid were close in ; I could see in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the rocks .
"`` Well , '' thought I to myself , `` if I can not get as far as that , it 's strange ! ''"
"I had no skill of swimming , Essen Water being small in our neighbourhood ; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms , and kicked out with both feet , I soon begun to find that I was moving ."
"Hard work it was , and mortally slow ; but in about an hour of kicking and splashing , I had got well in between the points of a sandy bay surrounded by low hills ."
The sea was here quite quiet ; there was no sound of any surf ; the moon shone clear ; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so desert and desolate .
"But it was dry land ; and when at last it grew so shallow that I could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet , I can not tell if I was more tired or more grateful ."
"Both , at least , I was : tired as I never was before that night ; and grateful to God as I trust I have been often , though never with more cause ."
CHAPTER XIV THE ISLET With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures .
"It was half-past twelve in the morning , and though the wind was broken by the land , it was a cold night ."
"I dared not sit down -LRB- for I thought I should have frozen -RRB- , but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon the sand , bare-foot , and beating my breast with infinite weariness ."
"There was no sound of man or cattle ; not a cock crew , though it was about the hour of their first waking ; only the surf broke outside in the distance , which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend ."
"To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning , and in a place so desert-like and lonesome , struck me with a kind of fear ."
"As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a hill -- the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook -- falling , the whole way , between big blocks of granite , or leaping from one to another ."
When I got to the top the dawn was come .
The main-sail hung drooped like a banner .
She was stock-still but for the current .
"For the last little while I had even lost , but now redoubling my efforts , I began once more to overhaul the chase ."
"I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap ; she filled on the port tack and was off again , stooping and skimming like a swallow ."
"My first impulse was one of despair , but my second was towards joy ."
"Round she came , till she was broadside on to me -- round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us ."
I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot .
Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle .
"And then , of a sudden , I began to comprehend ."
I had scarce time to think -- scarce time to act and save myself .
I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next .
The bowsprit was over my head .
"I sprang to my feet and leaped , stamping the coracle under water ."
"With one hand I caught the jib-boom , while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace ; and as I still clung there panting , a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA ."
"25 I Strike the Jolly Roger I HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack , with a report like a gun ."
"The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse , but next moment , the other sails still drawing , the jib flapped back again and hung idle ."
"This had nearly tossed me off into the sea ; and now I lost no time , crawled back along the bowsprit , and tumbled head foremost on the deck ."
"I was on the lee side of the forecastle , and the mainsail , which was still drawing , concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck ."
Not a soul was to be seen .
"The planks , which had not been swabbed since the mutiny , bore the print of many feet , and an empty bottle , broken by the neck , tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers ."
Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind .
"The jibs behind me cracked aloud , the rudder slammed to , the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder , and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard , the sheet groaning in the blocks , and showed me the lee after-deck ."
"There were the two watchmen , sure enough : red-cap on his back , as stiff as a handspike , with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips ; Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks , his chin on his chest , his hands lying open before him on the deck , his face as white , under its tan , as a tallow candle ."
"For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse , the sails filling , now on one tack , now on another , and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain ."
"Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship 's bows against the swell ; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made , lop-sided coracle , now gone to the bottom of the sea ."
"At every jump of the schooner , red-cap slipped to and fro , but -- what was ghastly to behold -- neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage ."
"At every jump too , Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck , his feet sliding ever the farther out , and the whole body canting towards the stern , so that his face became , little by little , hid from me ; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker ."
"At the same time , I observed , around both of them , splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath ."
"While I was thus looking and wondering , in a calm moment , when the ship was still , Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him first ."
"The moan , which told of pain and deadly weakness , and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart ."
"But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel , all pity left me ."
I walked aft until I reached the main-mast .
"At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find the Princesses, and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still."
THE CAT ON THE DOVREFELL
"Once on a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a great white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. Now, it so fell out, that he came to the Dovrefell just about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked the man if he could get house-room there for his bear and himself."
"""Heaven never help me, if what I say isn't true!"" said the man; ""but we can't give anyone house-room just now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of Trolls come down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven't so much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of lending one to anyone else."""
"""Oh?"" said the man, ""if that's all, you can very well lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room."""
"Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before they went, everything was got ready for the Trolls; the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good, just as for any other grand feast."
"So, when everything was ready, down came the Trolls. Some were great, and some were small; some had long tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long, long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything. Just then one of the little Trolls caught sight of the white bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up against the bear's nose, screaming out:"
"""Pussy, will you have some sausage?"""
"Then the white bear rose up and growled, and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great and small."
"Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays, for he thought the Trolls would come again; and just as he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling out:"
"""Halvor! Halvor!"""
"""Well,"" said Halvor, ""here I am."""
"""Have you got your big cat with you still?"""
"""Yes, that I have,"" said Halvor; ""she's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she has now got seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."""
"""Oh, then, we'll never come to see you again,"" bawled out the Troll away in the wood, and he kept his word; for since that time the Trolls have never eaten their Christmas brose with Halvor on the Dovrefell."
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS PRETTIEST
"A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe."
"""Dear friend,"" said the Snipe, ""don't shoot my children!"""
"""How shall I know your children?"" asked the Sportsman. ""What are they like?"""
"""Oh!"" said the Snipe, ""mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."""
"""Very well,"" said the Sportsman, ""I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."""
"But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot."
"""Oh, oh!"" said the Snipe, ""why did you shoot my children after all?"""
"""What! these your children!"" said the Sportsman; ""why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"""
"""Woe is me!"" said the Snipe; ""don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"""
AMONG THE FOREST PEOPLE
MR. RED SQUIRREL COMES TO LIVE IN THE FOREST
"Life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow, and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. They are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. You could never get acquainted with them until you had learned to be quiet also, and to walk through the underbrush without snapping twigs at every step. Then, if you were to live among them and speak their language, you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. And there is a reason for all this."
"In the meadow, although they have their quarrels and their own troubles, they always make it up again and are friendly, but in the forest there are some people who can never get along well together, and who do not go to the same parties or call upon each other. It is not because they are cross, or selfish, or bad. It is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt, and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color."
"These are things which are all understood in the forest, and the people there are careful what they say and do, so they get on very well indeed, and have many happy times in that quiet, dusky place. When people are born there, they learn these things without thinking about it, but when they come there from some other place it is very hard, for everybody thinks it stupid in strangers to ask about such simple matters."
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"Since the above was written, the account of the death of Governor      Andros is flashed across the wires to us. Verbum sap. Also In      hoc signo vinces."
"The author wishes to express by this means his grateful      acknowledgments to his friends and the public generally for the      great turn-out and general sympathy bestowed upon his relative, the      late Peter B. Stuyvesant, on the sad occasion of his funeral, which      was said to be one of the best attended and most successful      funerals before the war. Should any of his friends be caught in the      same fix, the author will not only cheerfully turn out himself, but      send all hands from his place that can be spared, also a six-seated      wagon and a side-bar buggy."
CHAPTER IX.
SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE STATES.
"The present State of New Jersey was a part of New Netherland, and the Dutch had a trading-post at Bergen as early as 1618. After New Netherland passed into the hands of the Dutch, the Duke of York gave the land lying between the Hudson and the Delaware to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret for Christmas."
"The first permanent English settlement made in the State was at Elizabethtown, named so in honor of Sir George's first wife."
"Berkeley sold his part to some English Quakers. This part was called West Jersey. He claimed that it was too far from town. It was very hard for a lord to clear up land, and Berkeley missed his evenings at the Savage Club, and his nose yearned for a good whiff of real old Rotten Row fog."
"So many disputes arose regarding the title to Jersey that the whole thing finally reverted to the crown in 1702. When there was any trouble over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened in this country."
"Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place."
"Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have clung to it."
"They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police."
"The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware, also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis and Stillwater."
"William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery."
"The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious belief."
"Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of ""No Cross, No Crown,"" ""Innocency with her Open Face,"" and ""The Great Cause of Liberty of Conscience."""
"From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco."
"Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them."
"The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage."
"Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm."
"Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel."
"But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid."
"Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695."
"In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718."
"Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man."
"In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also."
Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.
"Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying."
"It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy."
"The following spring Washington was sent under General Fry to drive out the French, who had started farming at Pittsburg. Fry died, and Washington took command. He liked it very much. After that Washington took command whenever he could, and soon rose to be a great man."
"The first expedition against Fort Duquesne (pronounced du-kane) was commanded by General Braddock, whose portrait we are able to give, showing him at the time he did not take Washington's advice in the Duquesne matter. Later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking Washington's advice."
"""The Indians,"" said Braddock, ""may frighten Colonial troops, but they can make no impression on the king's regulars. We are alike impervious to fun or fear."""
"Braddock thought of fighting the Indians by man[oe]uvring in large bodies, but the first body to be man[oe]uvred was that of General Braddock, who perished in about a minute."
"We give the reader, above, an idea of Braddock's soldierly bearing after he had been man[oe]uvring a few times."
"It was then that Washington took command, as was his custom, and began to fight the Indians and French as one would hunt varmints in Virginia."
"Braddock's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the State line, but when most of the Colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as Philadelphia, where they each took a bath and had some laundry-work done."
General Forbes took command of the second expedition. He spent most of his time building roads.
"Time passed on, and Forbes built viaducts, conduits, culverts, and rustic bridges, till it was November, and they were yet fifty miles from the fort. He then decided to abandon the expedition, on account of the cold, and also fearing that he had not made all of his bridges wide enough so that he could take the captured fort home with him."
"Washington, however, though only an aidy kong of General Forbes, decided to take command. His mother had said to him over and over, ""George, in an emergency always take command."" He done so, as General Rusk would say. As he approached, the French set fire to the fort, and retreated, together with the Indians and Molly Maguires."
"Pittsburg now stands on this historic ground, and is one of the most delightful cities of America."
Many other changes were going on at this time. The English got possession of Acadia and the French forts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.
"In 1757 General Loudon collected an army for an attack on Louisburg. He drilled his troops all summer, and then gave up the attack because he learned that the French had one more skiff than he had."
The Loudons of America at the time of this writing are more quiet and sensible regarding their ancestry than any of the doodle-bug aristocracy of our promoted peasantry and the crested Yahoos of our cowboy republic.
The Loudons or Lowdowns of America had a very large family. Some of them changed their names and moved.
"The next year after the fox pass of General Loudon, Amherst and Wolfe took possession of the entire island."
"About the time of Braddock's justly celebrated expedition another started out for Crown Point. The French, under Dieskau (pronounced dees-kow), met the army composed of Colonial troops in plain clothes, together with the regular troops led by officers with drawn swords and overdrawn salaries. The regular general, seeing that the battle was lost, excused himself and retired to his tent, owing to an ingrowing nail which had annoyed him all day. Lyman, the Colonial officer now took command, and wrung victory from the reluctant jaws of defeat. For this Johnson, the English general, received twenty-five thousand dollars and a baronetcy, while Lyman received a plated butter-dish and a bass-wood what-not. But Lyman was a married man, and had learned to take things as they came."
"Four months prior to the capture of Duquesne, one thousand boats loaded with soldiers, each with a neat little lunch-basket and a little flag to wave when they hurrahed for the good kind man at the head of the picnic, viz., General Abercrombie, sailed down Lake George to get a whiff of fresh air and take Ticonderoga."
"When they arrived, General Abercrombie took out a small book regarding tactics which he had bought on the boat, and, after refreshing his memory, ordered an assault. He then went back to see how his rear was, and, finding it all right, he went back still farther, to see if no one had been left behind."
Abercrombie never forgot or overlooked any one. He wanted all of his pleasure-party to be where they could see the fight.
In that way he missed it himself. I would hate to miss a fight that way.
The Abercrombies of America mostly trace their ancestry back by a cut-off avoiding the general's line.
"Niagara had an expedition sent against it at the time of Braddock's trip. The commander was General Shirley, but he ran out of money while at the Falls and decided to return. This post did not finally surrender till 1759."
"This gave the then West to the English. They had tried for one hundred and forty years to civilize it, but, alas, with only moderate success."
"Prosperous and happy even while sniping in their fox-hunting or canvas-back-duck clothes, these people feel somewhat soothed for their lack of culture because they are well-to-do."
"In 1759 General Wolfe anchored off Quebec with his fleet and sent a boy up town to ask if there were any letters for him at the post-office, also asking at what time it would be convenient to evacuate the place."
"The reply came back from General Montcalm, an able French general, that there was no mail for the general, but if Wolfe was dissatisfied with the report he might run up personally and look over the W's."
"Wolfe did so, taking his troops up by an unknown cow-path on the off side of the mountain during the night, and at daylight stood in battle-array on the Plains of Abraham. An attack was made by Montcalm as soon as he got over his wonder and surprise. At the third fire Wolfe was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard some one exclaim,"
"""They run! They run!"""
"Calfskin shoes up to the Revolution were the exclusive property of the gentry, and the rest wore cowhide and were extremely glad to mend them themselves. These were greased every week with tallow, and could be worn on either foot with impunity. Rights and lefts were never thought of until after the Revolutionary War, but to-day the American shoe is the most symmetrical, comfortable, and satisfactory shoe made in the world."
"The British shoe is said to be more comfortable. Possibly for a British foot it is so, but for a foot containing no breathing-apparatus or viscera it is somewhat roomy and clumsy."
"Farmers and laborers of those days wore green or red baize in the shape of jackets, and their breeches were made of leather or bed-ticking. Our ancestors dressed plainly, and a man who could not make over two hundred pounds per year was prohibited from dressing up or wearing lace worth over two shillings per yard. It was a pretty sad time for literary men, as they were thus compelled to wear clothing like the common laborers."
"Lord Cornwallis once asked his aidy kong why the American poet always had such an air of listening as if for some expected sound. ""I give it up,"" retorted the aidy kong. ""It is,"" said Lord Cornwallis, as he took a large drink from a jug which he had tied to his saddle, ""because he is trying to see if he cannot hear his bed-ticking."" On the following day he surrendered his army, and went home to spring his bon-mot on George III."
"Yet the laws were very stringent in other respects besides apparel. A man was publicly whipped for killing a fowl on the Sabbath in New England. In order to keep a tavern and sell rum, one had to be of good moral character and possess property, which was a good thing. The names of drunkards were posted up in the alehouses, and the keepers forbidden to sell them liquor. No person under twenty years of age could use tobacco in Connecticut without a physician's order, and no one was allowed to use it more than once a day, and then not within ten miles of any house. It was a common thing to see large picnic-parties going out into the backwoods of Connecticut to smoke."
(Will the reader excuse me a moment while I light up a peculiarly black and redolent pipe?)
"Only the gentry were called Mr. and Mrs. This included the preacher and his wife. A friend of mine who is one of the gentry of this century got on the trail of his ancestry last spring, and traced them back to where they were not allowed to be called Mr. and Mrs., and, fearing he would fetch up in Scotland Yard if he kept on, he slowly unrolled the bottoms of his trousers, got a job on the railroad, and since then his friends are gradually returning to him. He is well pleased now, and looks humbly gratified even if you call him a gent."
"The Scriptures were literally interpreted, and the Old Testament was read every morning, even if the ladies fainted."
"The custom yet noticed sometimes in country churches and festive gatherings of placing the males and females on opposite sides of the room was originated not so much as a punishment to both, as to give the men an opportunity to act together when the red brother felt ill at ease."
"I am glad the red brother does not molest us nowadays, and make us sit apart that way. Keep away, red brother; remain on your reservation, please, so that the pale-face may sit by the loved one and hold her little soft hand during the sermon."
"Church services meant business in those days. People brought their dinners and had a general penitential gorge. Instrumental music was proscribed, as per Amos fifth chapter and twenty-third verse, and the length of prayer was measured by the physical endurance of the performer."
"The preacher often boiled his sermon down to four hours, and the sexton up-ended the hourglass each hour. Boys who went to sleep in church were sand-bagged, and grew up to be border murderers."
"New York people were essentially Dutch. New York gets her Santa Claus, her doughnuts, crullers, cookies, and many of her odors, from the Dutch."
"The New York matron ran to fine linen and a polished door-knocker, while the New England housewife spun linsey-woolsey and knit ""yarn mittens"""
for those she loved.
"Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States, and was noted for its cleanliness and generally sterling qualities of mind and heart, its Sabbath trance and clean white door-steps."
"The Southern Colonies were quite different from those of the North. In place of thickly-settled towns there were large plantations with African villages near the house of the owner. The proprietor was a sort of country squire, living in considerable comfort for those days. He fed and clothed everybody, black or white, who lived on the estate, and waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well, so that they would be more valuable. The colored people were blessed with children at a great rate, so that at this writing, though voteless, they send a large number of members to Congress. This cheers the Southern heart and partially recoups him for his chickens. (See Appendix.)"
"The South then, as now, cured immense quantities of tobacco, while the North tried to cure those who used it."
"Washington was a Virginian. He packed his own flour with his own hands, and it was never inspected. People who knew him said that the only man who ever tried to inspect Washington's flour was buried under a hill of choice watermelons at Mount Vernon."
"Along the James and Rappahannock the vast estates often passed from father to son according to the law of entail, and such a thing as a poor man ""prior to the war"" must have been unknown."
"Education, however, flourished more at the North, owing partly to the fact that the people lived more in communities. Governor Berkeley of Virginia was opposed to free schools from the start, and said, ""I thank God there are no free schools nor printing-presses here, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years."" His prayer has been answered."
CHAPTER XIV.
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
William Pitt was partly to blame for the Revolutionary War. He claimed that the Colonists ought not to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail except by permission of Parliament.
"It was already hard enough to be a colonist, without the privilege of expressing one's self even to an Indian without being fined. But when we pause to think that England seemed to demand that the colonist should take the long wet walk to Liverpool during a busy season of the year to get his horse shod, we say at once that P. Henry was right when he exclaimed that the war was inevitable and moved that permission be granted for it to come."
"Then came the Stamp Act, making almost everything illegal that was not written on stamp paper furnished by the maternal country."
"John Adams, Patrick Henry, and John Otis made speeches regarding the situation. Bells were tolled, and fasting and prayer marked the first of November, the day for the law to go into effect."
"These things alarmed England for the time, and the Stamp Act was repealed; but the king, who had been pretty free with his money and had entertained a good deal, began to look out for a chance to tax the Colonists, and ordered his Exchequer Board to attend to it."
"Patrick Henry got excited, and said in an early speech, ""Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third  "" Here he paused and took a long swig of pure water, and added, looking at the newspaper reporters, ""If this be treason, make the most of it."" He also said that George the Third might profit by their example. A good many would like to know what he started out to say, but it is too hard to determine."
"Heretofore among the politicians a platform, like that on the railway cars, ""is made for the purpose of helping the party to get aboard, but not to ride on."""
"The Columbian Exposition and World's Fair at Chicago in the summer of 1893 eclipsed all former Exhibitions, costing more and showing greater artistic taste, especially in its buildings, than anything preceding it."
"Some gentle warfare resulted from a struggle over the question of opening the ""White City"" on Sunday, and a great deal of bitterness was shown by those who opposed the opening and who had for years favored the Sunday closing of Niagara. A doubtful victory was obtained by the Sunday openers, for so many of the exhibitors closed their departments that visitors did not attend on Sunday in paying quantities."
"Against a thousand odds and over a thousand obstacles, especially the apprehension of Asiatic cholera and the actual sudden appearance of a gigantic money panic, Chicago, heroic and victorious, carried out her mighty plans and gave to the world an exhibition that won golden opinions from her friends and stilled in dumb wonder the jealousy of her enemies."
"In the mean time, the author begs leave to thank his readers for the rapt attention shown in perusing these earnest pages, and to apologize for the tears of sympathy thoughtlessly wrung from eyes unused to weep, by the graphic word-painting and fine education shown by the author."
"It was not the intention of the writer to touch the fountain of tears and create wash-outs everywhere, but sometimes tears do one good."
"In closing, would it be out of place to say that the stringency of the money market is most noticeable and most painful, and for that reason would it be too much trouble for the owner of this book to refuse to loan it, thereby encouraging its sale and contributing to the comfort of a deserving young man?"
THE END.
THE Velveteen Rabbit
"Here was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming."
"There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten."
Christmas Morning
"For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse."
The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.
"He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it."
"""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"""
"""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."""
"""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit."
"""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."""
"""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?"""
"""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept."
"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
"""I suppose you are real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled."
The Skin Horse Tells His Story
"""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said. ""That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always."""
"The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him."
"There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards. She called this ""tidying up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft."
"One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop."
"""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!"""
"While watching the immense destruction of these insects we were startled by the outbreak of the thunderstorm high up on the mountains, but far above the peals of thunder rose the terrible sound of rushing water. Animals now came tearing out of the lowlands too terrified to notice whither they went, so that I stood ready, gun in hand, in case any of the dangerous kind should try to seek an asylum on my particular hill; but with the exception of a huge wild boar, who had to be shot as he charged up the slope, all took refuge elsewhere."
"Soon the water burst through the river bank, spreading over the country, sweeping down the tall grass jungle and surging and roaring round our hill. Packing all that was valuable in small parcels, we gathered them in a heap, hoping that the flood would subside ere it reached the building. All round about large trees, uprooted by the terrible force of the deluge, were swept along, several animals vainly trying to keep a footing among their roots and branches. At last the water reached the steps of the house; so, pulling our boat close up, we stepped in with what we could save and hung to the wooden posts of the building, vainly trusting that the worst had come; but it was not so, for we soon had to leave go the post and pass the boat's rope round a tree. The water then rushed in, the house toppled over, and it and its contents were swept away by the flood."
"In a short time the tree began to shake and bend, so we knew that it was being uprooted; therefore, letting go the rope, we launched forth upon the seething waste of waters and were whirled away. Onward we rushed through masses of logs, branches, the remains of houses, and such like wreck, having to be very careful that our frail vessel did not get upset or crushed. Twice we made for the tops of hills that showed themselves above water, but on approaching them we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals."
"Here a tiger crouched on a branch of a tree, seemingly too much alarmed at his perilous position to molest the half-dozen deer that crowded timidly together right underneath his perch. Up above him the smaller branches were stocked with monkeys, who looked very disconsolate at their enforced imprisonment. As we swept past, the tiger raised his head, gave a deep growl and showed his teeth, then crouched down again as if fully aware of his helplessness, and we had too much to think of ourselves to interfere with him."
"Gaining the open country, the scene was one of desolation; but the current was not so strong, so we turned round, seeing the flood was going down, and by nightfall we had got back to where the house had stood. Every vestige of the once pretty homestead had disappeared, with sheep and cattle, though the fowls had managed to find a roost on the topmost branches of some orange trees, which alone remained to mark the spot."
"As the moon rose, the mountaineers came down from the villages, and, embarking on rafts and in canoes, went round the different hills, shooting and spearing the animals that had swum there; and truly the sight of such a hunting scene was an exciting one. Here a stout stag, defending himself with his antlers as best he might against the spearsmen, kept up a gallant fight till death."
"The tiger we had seen in the morning took to swimming, and on being wounded with a spear turned on the nearest canoe, upsetting the hunters into the water, where a desperate encounter took place; but he was eventually dispatched by a blow from an ax not, however, before he had clawed some of his pursuers most severely."
"At daylight the water had entirely gone down, and a thick, muddy deposit covered all the lowland, while an immense number of snakes, scorpions, and other unpleasant creatures lay dead in all directions, upon which and the drowned animals vultures, crows and kites were feeding."
Queen Margaret and the Robbers.
There were once two kings of England at the same time. One was Henry VI.
"He was the rightful king, but a very weak and feeble man, and quite unfit to rule his kingdom."
"The other was young Edward, Duke of York, called Edward IV. He was made king by some of the nobles, who grew weary of Henry and his foolish deeds."
"A number of the English people were faithful to King Henry, but many others went over to King Edward's side, and there were quarrels between the two parties, which ended in a war. This war was called the War of the Roses, because the followers of Henry wore a red rose as their badge, and Edward's friends wore a white one."
"In one battle, fought at Hexham, the White Roses beat the Red ones, and King Henry was taken prisoner and sent to the Tower of London. His wife, Queen Margaret, with her little son, Prince Edward, escaped after the battle, and hid themselves in a wild forest. As they wandered among the trees, seeking some place where they might be safe from their enemies, they met a band of robbers. These rough men took away the queen's money and her jewels, tearing her necklace from her neck, and her rings from her fingers. Then they began to dispute as to who should have most of the stolen goods. And while they quarrelled, Queen Margaret took her little boy by the hand and ran away to a thick part of the wood. There they stayed until the angry voices of the robbers could no longer be heard, and then, in the growing darkness, they came stealthily from their hiding-place. They wandered on, knowing not where to go, hoping much to meet some of their friends, and fearing still more to be found by their enemies, the soldiers of the White Rose. But, alas! they saw no kind face, and night came on. Then, as they crept fearfully from tree to tree, they met another robber."
"The poor queen was much afraid that this robber, who looked very fierce, would kill her and the prince, because she had no riches left to give him. In despair she threw herself upon her knees before him, and said:"
"""My friend, this is the son of your king. I give him into your care."""
"The robber was much surprised to see the queen and the prince alone, with their clothes torn and stained, and their faces white from hunger and fatigue. But he was a kindhearted man, although his looks were rough, and before he became a robber he had been a follower of King Henry, so he was quite willing to do his best for the little prince. He took the boy in his arms, and led the way to a cave in the forest, where he lived with his wife. And in this poor shelter, the queen and her son stayed for two days, listening to every sound, and fearing that their enemies would find them. On the third day, however, the friendly robber met some of the lords of the Red Rose in the forest, and led them to the cave. The queen and prince were overjoyed to see their friends, and soon they escaped with them to a place of safety."
"Their hiding-place has been called ""Queen Margaret's Cave"" ever since that time. If you go to Hexham Forest, you will be able to see it."
William Caxton
"In old days, books were not printed as they are now; they were written by hand. This took a long time to do, so there were not many books, and they were so dear that only the rich could buy them."
"But after a time, some clever men made a machine, called a printing-press, which could print letters."
"About that time, an Englishman, named William Caxton, lived in Holland, and copied books for a great lady. He says his hand grew tired with writing, and his eyes became dim with much looking on white paper. So he learned how to print, and had a printing-press made for himself, which he brought to England. He set it up in a little shop in London, and then he began to print books. He printed books of all sorts tales, and poetry, and history, and prayers, and sermons. In the time which it had formerly taken him to write one book, he could now print thousands."
"All sorts of people crowded to his shop to see Caxton's wonderful press; sometimes the king went with his nobles. Many of them took written books with them, which they wished to have put into print. Some people asked Caxton to use in his books the most curious words he could find; others wished him to print only old and homely words. Caxton liked best the common, simple words which men used daily in their speech."
"Caxton did a very good thing when he brought the printing-press to England, for, after that, books became much cheaper, so that many people could buy them, and learning spread in the land."
Sir Philip Sidney
"When Elizabeth was Queen of England it was a time of great deeds and great men. The queen was brave and clever herself, so she liked to have brave and clever people around her. Great soldiers, and writers, and statesmen went to her court; and when brave seamen came back from their voyages to unknown lands far away, they were invited by the queen to visit her, and tell her of all the strange places and people they had seen. In this Elizabeth was wise, for men did their best to show themselves worthy of her favours."
"Among all the great men at court, none was more beloved than Sir Philip Sidney. He was called ""the darling of the court""."
"At that time, there was much trouble and many wars in some other countries, where people were fighting for the right to worship God in their own way. Philip Sidney heard of these things when he was a boy in his father's house, and his heart was stirred with pity. Later, when he was in France, a great number of people were cruelly killed because they would not pray in the way which the king ordered. Sidney never forgot the dreadful sights and sounds of that sad time, and when Queen Elizabeth sent an army to help the people of Holland, who were fighting for their freedom, he asked for leave to go with it. This was granted to him, and he was made one of the leaders."
"The man listened, laid down his axe for a moment, and began to consider what that could mean. “Hollo,” he said at last, “what can that have been; my ears must have been singing, I won’t alarm myself for nothing.” So he again seized the axe, and began to hew, then again there came a cry from below:"
"“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"He stopped, and felt afraid and alarmed, and pondered over the circumstance. But when a few moments had passed, he took heart again, and a third time he stretched out his hand for the axe, and began to cut. But some one called out a third time, and said loudly,"
"“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"That was enough for him, and all inclination had departed from him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on his way home. The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first. So when he entered the parlour, she put on an innocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, “Well, have you brought a nice piece of wood for reels?” “No,” said he, “I see very well that winding won’t do,” and told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left her in peace about it. Neverthless after some time, the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house. “Wife,” said he, “it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled!” “I’ll tell you what,” said she, “as we still don’t come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I will stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you, and you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a skein after all.” “Yes, that will do,” said the man. So they did that, and when it was done, he said, “The yarn is in skeins, now it must be boiled.” The woman was again distressed; She certainly said, “Yes, we will boil it next morning early.” but she was secretly contriving another trick."
"Early in the morning she got up, lighted a fire, and put the kettle on, only instead of the yarn, she put in a lump of tow, and let it boil."
"After that she went to the man who was still lying in bed, and said to him, “I must just go out, you must get up and look after the yarn which is in the kettle on the fire, but you must be at hand at once; mind that, for if the cock should happen to crow, and you are not attending to the yarn, it will become tow.” The man was willing and took good care not to loiter. He got up as quickly as he could, and went into the kitchen. But when he reached the kettle and peeped in, he saw, to his horror, nothing but a lump of tow. Then the poor man was as still as a mouse, thinking he had neglected it, and was to blame, and in future said no more about yarn and spinning. But you yourself must own she was an odious woman!"
129 The Four Skilful Brothers
"There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown up, he said to them, “My dear children, you must now go out into the world, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, and go to some distance and learn a trade, and see how you can make your way.” So the four brothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went through the town-gate together. When they had travelled about for some time, they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions. Then said the eldest, “Here we must separate, but on this day four years, we will meet each other again at this spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes.”"
"Then each of them went his way, and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going, and what he was intending to do? “I want to learn a trade,” he replied. Then the other said, “Come with me, and be a thief.” “No,” he answered, “that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade, and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows.”"
"“Oh,” said the man, “you need not be afraid of the gallows; I will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever lay hold of, and no one will ever detect you.” So he allowed himself to be talked into it, and while with the man became an accomplished thief, and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him, if he once desired to have it. The second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world. “I don’t know yet,” he replied. “Then come with me, and be an astronomer; there is nothing better than that, for nothing is hid from you.” He liked the idea, and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything, and was about to travel onwards, his master gave him a telescope and said to him, “With that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven, and nothing can remain concealed from thee.” A huntsman took the third brother into training, and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship, that he became an experienced hunter. When he went away, his master gave him a gun and said, “It will never fail you; whatsoever you aim at, you are certain to hit.” The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him, and inquired what his intentions were. “Would you not like to be a tailor?”"
"said he. “Not that I know of,” said the youth; “sitting doubled up from morning till night, driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards, is not to my taste.” “Oh, but you are speaking in ignorance,”"
"answered the man; “with me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring, which is respectable and proper, and for the most part very honorable.” So he let himself be persuaded, and went with the man, and learnt his art from the very beginning. When they parted, the man gave the youth a needle, and said, “With this you can sew together whatever is given you, whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and it will all become one piece of stuff, so that no seam will be visible.”"
"When the appointed four years were over, the four brothers arrived at the same time at the cross-roads, embraced and kissed each other, and returned home to their father. “So now,” said he, quite delighted, “the wind has blown you back again to me.” They told him of all that had happened to them, and that each had learnt his own trade. Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree, and the father said, “I will put you all to the test, and see what you can do.” Then he looked up and said to his second son, “Between two branches up at the top of this tree, there is a chaffinch’s nest, tell me how many eggs there are in it?” The astronomer took his glass, looked up, and said, “There are five.” Then the father said to the eldest, “Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them.”"
"The skillful thief climbed up, and took the five eggs from beneath the bird, which never observed what he was doing, and remained quietly sitting where she was, and brought them down to his father. The father took them, and put one of them on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, “With one shot thou shalt shoot me the five eggs in two, through the middle.” The huntsman aimed, and shot the eggs, all five as the father had desired, and that at one shot. He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners. “Now it’s your turn,” said the father to the fourth son; “you shall sew the eggs together again, and the young birds that are inside them as well, and you must do it so that they are not hurt by the shot.” The tailor brought his needle, and sewed them as his father wished. When he had done this the thief had to climb up the tree again, and carry them to the nest, and put them back again under the bird without her being aware of it. The bird sat her full time, and after a few days the young ones crept out, and they had a red line round their necks where they had been sewn together by the tailor."
"“Well,” said the old man to his sons, “I begin to think you are worth more than breen clover; you have used your time well, and learnt something good. I can’t say which of you deserves the most praise. That will be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your talents.” Not long after this, there was a great uproar in the country, for the King’s daughter was carried off by a dragon. The King was full of trouble about it, both by day and night, and caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever brought her back should have her to wife. The four brothers said to each other, “This would be a fine opportunity for us to show what we can do!” and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King’s daughter. “I will soon know where she is,” said the astronomer, and looked through his telescope and said, “I see her already, she is far away from here on a rock in the sea, and the dragon is beside her watching her.” Then he went to the King, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers, and sailed with them over the sea until they came to the rock. There the King’s daughter was sitting, and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap. The huntsman said, “I dare not fire, I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time.” “Then I will try my art,” said the thief, and he crept thither and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and dexterously, that the monster never remarked it, but went on snoring. Full of joy, they hurried off with her on board ship, and steered out into the open sea; but the dragon, who when he awoke had found no princess there, followed them, and came snorting angrily through the air. Just as he was circling above the ship, and about to descend on it, the huntsman shouldered his gun, and shot him to the heart. The monster fell down dead, but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole ship. Fortunately, however, they laid hold of a couple of planks, and swam about the wide sea. Then again they were in great peril, but the tailor, who was not idle, took his wondrous needle, and with a few stitches sewed the planks together, and they seated themselves upon them, and collected together all the fragments of the vessel. Then he sewed these so skilfully together, that in a very short time the ship was once more seaworthy, and they could go home again in safety."
"When the King once more saw his daughter, there were great rejoicings."
"He said to the four brothers, “One of you shall have her to wife, but which of you it is to be you must settle among yourselves.” Then a warm contest arose among them, for each of them preferred his own claim. The astronomer said, “If I had not seen the princess, all your arts would have been useless, so she is mine.” The thief said, “What would have been the use of your seeing, if I had not got her away from the dragon?"
"so she is mine.” The huntsman said, “You and the princess, and all of you, would have been torn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not hit him, so she is mine.” The tailor said, “And if I, by my art, had not sewn the ship together again, you would all of you have been miserably drowned, so she is mine.” Then the King uttered this saying, “Each of you has an equal right, and as all of you cannot have the maiden, none of you shall have her, but I will give to each of you, as a reward, half a kingdom.” The brothers were pleased with this decision, and said, “It is better thus than that we should be at variance with each other.” Then each of them received half a kingdom, and they lived with their father in the greatest happiness as long as it pleased God."
"130 One-eye, Two-eyes, and Three-eyes"
"There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was called One-eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead, and the second, Two-eyes, because she had two eyes like other folks, and the youngest, Three-eyes, because she had three eyes; and her third eye was also in the centre of her forehead. However, as Two-eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and her mother could not endure her. They said to her, “Thou, with thy two eyes, art no better than the common people; thou dost not belong to us!” They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could to make her unhappy. It came to pass that Two-eyes had to go out into the fields and tend the goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat. So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes. And once when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside her, who said, “Why art thou weeping, little Two-eyes?” Two-Eyes answered, “Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me nothing to eat but the scraps they leave? To-day they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry.” Then the wise woman said, “Wipe away thy tears, Two-eyes, and I will tell thee something to stop thee ever suffering from hunger again; just say to thy goat,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before thee, with the most delicious food upon it of which thou mayst eat as much as thou art inclined for, and when thou hast had enough, and hast no more need of the little table, just say,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and then it will vanish again from thy sight.” Hereupon the wise woman departed. But Two-eyes thought, “I must instantly make a trial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,” and she said,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen. Then Two-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, “Lord God, be with us always, Amen,” and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it. And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.
"“That is a delightful way of keeping house!” thought Two-eyes, and was quite glad and happy."
"In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for her, but she did not touch it. Next day she again went out with her goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her, lying untouched. The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not remark it at all, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said, “There is something wrong about Two-eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up everything that was given her; she must have discovered other ways of getting food.” In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-eye with Two-eyes when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to observe what Two-eyes did when she was there, and whether any one brought her anything to eat and drink. So when Two-eyes set out the next time, One-eye went to her and said, “I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is food.” But Two-eyes knew what was in One-eye’s mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “Come, One-eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to you.” One-eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes sang constantly,"
"“One eye, wakest thou?"
"It had run quite wild, and was full of thorns and bushes. And as he was thus walking round about, a wild boar rushed at him; he, however, gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly. He took it on his shoulders and carried it in, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves. Then they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out hunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them. Fir-twister stayed at home the first, and Hans and Rock-splitter went out hunting. When Fir-twister was busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him in the castle, and asked for some meat. “Be off, sly hypocrite,” he answered, “thou needest no meat.” But how astonished Fir-twister was when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and belaboured him so with his fists that he could not defend himself, but fell on the ground and gasped for breath! The dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him. When the two others came home from hunting, Fir-twister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he himself had received, and thought, “When they stay at home, they may just try their chance with the little scrubbing-brush;” and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already."
"The next day Rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just as Fir-twister had done, he was very ill-treated by the dwarf because he was not willing to give him any meat. When the others came home in the evening, Fir-twister easily saw what he had suffered, but both kept silence, and thought, “Hans also must taste some of that soup.”"
"Hans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in the kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing skimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado demanded a bit of meat. Then Hans thought, “He is a poor wretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may not run short,” and handed him a bit. When the dwarf had devoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured Hans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece, and that he was to be content with it. But the dwarf begged again for the third time. “Thou art shameless!” said Hans, and gave him none. Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated Fir-twister and Rock-splitter, but he had got to the wrong man. Hans, without exerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps. Hans was about to run after him, but fell right over him, for he was so tall. When he rose up again, the dwarf had got the start of him. Hans hurried after him as far as the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock. Hans now went home, but he had marked the spot. When the two others came back, they were surprised that Hans was so well. He told them what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them. Hans laughed and said, “It served you quite right; why were you so greedy with your meat? It is a disgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten by the dwarf.” Thereupon they took a basket and a rope, and all three went to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club down in the basket. When Hans had reached the bottom, he found a door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words can express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at Hans like a sea-cat!"
"She, however, was bound with chains, and looked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her, and thought to himself, “Thou must deliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf,” and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead. Immediately the chains fell from the maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty. She told him she was a King’s daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks, because she would have nothing to say to him. The count had, however, set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough. And now Hans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up; the basket came down again, but Hans did not trust his two companions, and thought, “They have already shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about the dwarf; who knows what design they may have against me?” So he put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did; for when the basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans had really been sitting in it he would have been killed. But now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths, and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel. “It is indeed sad,” said he to himself, “that I have to waste away down here,” and as he was thus walking backwards and forwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden had been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled. Then he drew it off and put it on, and when he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something rustle over his head. He looked up and saw spirits of the air hovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked what his desire might be? Hans was at first struck dumb, but afterwards he said that they were to carry him above again. They obeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself. When, however, he was above again, he found no one in sight. Fir-twister and Rock-splitter had hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them. But Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea. Hans ran and ran without stopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out on the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were sitting; and in fierce anger he leapt, without thinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and began to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight, dragged him deep down until he was all but drowned. Then in the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into the boat. He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the reward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he sailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest alarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her father and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly."
167 The Peasant in Heaven
"Once on a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before the gate of heaven. At the same time a very rich, rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven. Then Saint Peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again. And now the peasant outside, heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within. At length all became quiet again, and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in. The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet; he was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang. Then the peasant asked Saint Peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth. Then said Saint Peter, “By no means, thou art just as dear to us as any one else, and wilt enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like thee come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years!”"
168 Lean Lisa
"Lean Lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy Harry and fat Trina, who never let anything disturb their peace. She scoured everything with ashes, from morning till evening, and burdened her husband, Long Laurence, with so much work that he had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks. It was, however, all to no purpose, they had nothing and came to nothing. One night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for weariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep. She thrust her elbows into her husband’s side, and said, “Listen, Lenz, to what I have been thinking:"
"if I were to find one florin and one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them, and thou too shouldst give me another, and then as soon as I had got the four florins together, I would buy a young cow.” This pleased the husband right well. “It is true,” said he, “that I do not know where I am to get the florin which thou wantest as a gift from me; but, if thou canst get the money together, and canst buy a cow with it, thou wilt do well to carry out thy project. I shall be glad,”"
"he added, “if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me.” “The milk is not for thee,” said the woman, “we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat, and we may be able to sell it well.” “Certainly,” replied the man, “but still we will take a little milk; that will do no harm.” “Who has taught thee to manage cows?” said the woman; “Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it, and even if thou wert to stand on thy head for it, thou shouldst not have a drop of the milk! Dost thou think, because there is no satisfying thee, Long Laurence, that thou art to eat up what I earn with so much difficulty?” “Wife,” said the man, “be quiet, or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth!” “What!” cried she, “thou threatenest me, thou glutton, thou rascal, thou lazy Harry!” She was just laying hold of his hair, but long Laurence got up, seized both Lean Lisa’s withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed down her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until she fell asleep for very weariness. Whether she continued to wrangle when she awoke next morning, or whether she went out to look for the florin which she wanted to find, that I know not."
169 The Hut in the Forest
"A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the edge of a lonely forest. One morning as he was about to go to his work, he said to his wife, “Let my dinner be brought into the forest to me by my eldest daughter, or I shall never get my work done, and in order that she may not miss her way,” he added, “I will take a bag of millet with me and strew the seeds on the path.” When, therefore, the sun was just above the center of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track. Then trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night began to fall. The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be afraid. Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees. “There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the night,” thought she, and went up to the light. It was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up. She knocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, “Come in.” The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the room. “Just come in,” cried the voice, and when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over the table almost as far as the ground. By the stove lay three animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow. The girl told her story to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night. The man said,"
"“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"“Duks,” answered the animals, and that must have meant, “We are willing,” for the old man said, “Here you shall have shelter and food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper.” The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a good supper, but had no thought of the animals. She carried the full dishes to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied her hunger. When she had had enough, she said, “But now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep?” The animals replied,"
"“Thou hast eaten with him, Thou hast drunk with him, Thou hast had no thought for us, So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.”"
"Then said the old man, “Just go upstairs, and thou wilt find a room with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep.” The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the old man. After some time, however, the gray-haired man came, took his candle, looked at the girl and shook his head. When he saw that she had fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the cellar."
"Late at night the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his wife for leaving him to hunger all day. “It is not my fault,” she replied, “the girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but she is sure to come back to-morrow.” The wood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day. “I will take a bag with lentils,”"
"said he; “the seeds are larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and can’t lose her way.” At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils had disappeared. The birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before, and had left none. The girl wandered about in the forest until night, and then she too reached the house of the old man, was told to go in, and begged for food and a bed. The man with the white beard again asked the animals,"
"“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"The animals again replied “Duks,” and everything happened just as it had happened the day before. The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank with the old man, and did not concern herself about the animals, and when she inquired about her bed they answered,"
"“Thou hast eaten with him, Thou hast drunk with him, Thou hast had no thought for us, To find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.”"
"When she was asleep the old man came, looked at her, shook his head, and let her down into the cellar."
"On the third morning the wood-cutter said to his wife, “Send our youngest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good and obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not run about after every wild humble-bee, as her sisters did.” The mother did not want to do it, and said, “Am I to lose my dearest child, as well?”"
"“Have no fear,” he replied, “the girl will not go astray; she is too prudent and sensible; besides I will take some peas with me, and strew them about. They are still larger than lentils, and will show her the way.” But when the girl went out with her basket on her arm, the wood-pigeons had already got all the peas in their crops, and she did not know which way she was to turn. She was full of sorrow and never ceased to think how hungry her father would be, and how her good mother would grieve, if she did not go home. At length when it grew dark, she saw the light and came to the house in the forest. She begged quite prettily to be allowed to spend the night there, and the man with the white beard once more asked his animals,"
"“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And beautiful brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"“Duks,” said they. Then the girl went to the stove where the animals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man’s orders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, “Am I to eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing?"
"Outside is food in plenty, I will look after them first.” So she went and brought some barley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful of sweet-smelling hay for the cow. “I hope you will like it, dear animals,” said she, “and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty.” Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught. When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the old man, and ate what he had left. It was not long before the cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink. Then said the girl, “Ought we not to go to bed?”"
"“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"The animals answered “Duks,”"
"“Thou hast eaten with us, Thou hast drunk with us, Thou hast had kind thought for all of us, We wish thee good-night.”"
"Then the maiden went upstairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid clean sheets on them, and when she had done it the old man came and lay down on one of the beds, and his white beard reached down to his feet. The girl lay down on the other, said her prayers, and fell asleep."
"She slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise in the house that she awoke. There was a sound of cracking and splitting in every corner, and the doors sprang open, and beat against the walls."

"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"

The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light

Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.

The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

"These statistics are taken from the report of the British Parliament,"
"which, for learning and intelligence, as a deliberative body, has not"
"its superior, if it has its equal, in the world, and it is surely a"
"sufficiently Christian body to be accepted as authority in this matter,"
since a large number of its members are clergymen. These statistics
"hardly sustain the allegation that ""Infidelity is coupled with"
"impurity."""
"We are willing to stand upon our record. But, lest it be claimed that"
"this is a British peculiarity, allow me to defer to the patriotic"
"sentiment of my readers by one other little set of tables which, while"
"not complete, is equally as suggestive."

[Sidenote: Further Proof.]
"21. Where, on Production of the Preparatory Examinations and Ship"
"Papers, it appears to the Court doubtful whether the captured Ship is"
"good Prize or not, the Court may direct further Proof to be adduced,"
"either by Affidavit or by Examination of Witnesses, with or without"

"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”

alcohol and glycerine.
DOSE.--Same as for salicylic acid.
PHENYLIS SALICYLAS--PHENYL SALICYLATE (Salol)

"The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,"
With little mincing airs one keeps to pet
A darling and provoking perroquet.
"Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds"
"With fluent fingers girt with heavy rings,"
So vaguely hints of vague erotic things
"That her eye smiles, musing among its folds."
"—Blonde too, a tiny nose, a rosy mouth,"
"Artful as that sly patch that makes more sly,"
"In her divine unconscious pride of youth,"
The slightly simpering sparkle of the eye.
CYTHÈRE.
"BY favourable breezes fanned,"
A trellised arbour is at hand
To shield us from the summer airs;
"The scent of roses, fainting sweet,"
"Afloat upon the summer heat,"
Blends with the perfume that she wears.
"True to the promise her eyes gave,"
"She ventures all, and her mouth rains"
A dainty fever through my veins;
"And Love, fulfilling all things, save"
"Hunger, we ’scape, with sweets and ices,"

THE SAMPLE PAGE
"With these details settled, the sample page is next in order. Knowing"
that the book is to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a 10mo (size
"of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must ""lay out"" the page so as to leave"
margins of proper size and proportion. A 12mo type page may vary from
"3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾ inches. Somewhere within this area, in the"
"given example, the page must contain about 280 words. If the manuscript"
"is long, then the type page must be large, the type itself small (never"
"smaller than long primer[36] nor larger than pica[36]), the leads[36]"
reduced or omitted altogether. This is where the printer's taste and
skill is given an opportunity for expression: he is the architect
"of the book, and must not combine types or decorations which are"
"inharmonious, and his proportions must be kept correct."
"Two centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians, settled"
"on Count Zinzendorf’s estates in Saxony, spreading rapidly from thence"
into other countries in Europe and to the United States. One of
"England’s foremost hymn writers and hymnologists, James Montgomery, was"
an adherent to their faith.

"The movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian"
"Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement."
Luther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church
song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first
been introduced for congregational use but it became more and more
"liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant"
which followed was never intended for use except by the priests and
trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full
fruition.

AVIATION IN DREAMS
Dreams of Flying and Falling--Their Peculiar Vividness--Dreams of
Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences--Best explained
as based on Respiratory Sensations combined with Cutaneous
Anaesthesia--The Explanation of Dreams of Falling--The Sensation
of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From

"to the Orders of the Lords of the Admiralty, or to the Command of a"
"Superior Officer, committed by the Captors in relation to any Ship or"
"Goods taken as Prize, or in relation to any Person on Board any such"
"Ship, may, on Condemnation, reserve the Prize to Her Majesty's Disposal,"
notwithstanding any Grant that may have been made by Her Majesty in
favour of Captors.

"Her Majesty is taken and brought into a Port of the United Kingdom, and"
the Purchase for the Service of Her Majesty of the Stores on board the
Ship appears to the Lords of the Admiralty expedient without the
"Condemnation thereof in a Prize Court, in that Case the Lords of the"
"Admiralty may purchase, on the Account or for the Service of Her"
"Majesty, all or any of the Stores on board the Ship; and the"
Commissioners of Customs may permit the Stores purchased to be entered
and landed within any Port.

contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
"represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent"
"works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,"
"Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical"
"contributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are"
coming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for
"a long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others."
The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English
and German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes
large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a
"considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,"
"the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other"
"churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes"
and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our
time have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions
to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times
and places.
American Hymns in the Hymnary
Early American
"Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817, “I love Thy kingdom, Lord” (275)"
"Thomas Hastings, 1784-1872, “Hail to the brightness” (332)"
"Henry Ware, Jr., 1794-1843, “Happy the home when God” (361)"
"Wm. B. Tappan, 1794-1849, “’Tis midnight; and on Olive’s brow” (103)"
"Francis Scott Key, 1779-1843, “Lord, with glowing heart” (511)"
"George W. Doane, 1799-1859, “Softly now the light of day” (36)"

"carbolic acid, therefore great care must be exercised when washing,"
"especially cats, with any preparation containing carbolic acid."
Disinfecting and deodorizing cat’s quarters with any preparation
containing carbolic acid makes them sick.
ANTIDOTE.--Sulphates of soda or magnesia. Atropine sulphate
hypodermically is a very valuable antidote. Alcohol and vinegar have
"been used with good results, both internally and externally."
ACIDUM SALICYLICUM--SALICYLIC ACID
"An organic acid, existing naturally in combination in various plants,"
but largely prepared synthetically from carbolic acid.
DERIVATION.--Made by passing carbonic dioxide through sodium carbolate
at a temperature of 428° F. (220° C.). 2 NaC₆H₅O (sodium carbolate) +
CO₂ = Na₂C₇H₄O₃ (sodium salicylate) + C₆H₆O (phenol). Sodium salicylate
is treated with hydrochloric acid when salicylic acid is precipitated.
"PROPERTIES.--Light, fine, white, needle-shaped crystals, odorless,"
"having a sweetish, afterwards acrid taste; permanent in air. Soluble in"
"alcohol, ether and hot water; borax increases its solubility."
"DOSE.--Horses, 2 to 6 drs.; cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.; should be given well diluted;"
"large doses are recommended for fevers, but smaller doses more often"
repeated in rheumatism.
"and their fauces, as honey, olive oil, etc."
MEDICAMENT.--Any medicine used in the treatment of diseases or wounds.
MEDICINE.--Any substance for the cure of disease.
"MYDRIATIC.--An agent which dilates or enlarges the pupil of the eye,"
"whether used internally or externally, as atrophine."
"MYOTIC.--Any agent that contracts the pupil of the eye, whether applied"
"to the eye or taken by the mouth, as eserine, arecoline, etc."
"NARCOTIC.--A medicine which produces sleep and relieves pain, but first"
"cause cerebral excitement, as chloroform, ether, belladonna and alcohol,"
etc.
"NEPHRITIC.--A medicine used in diseases of the kidneys, as buchu, uva"
"ursi, etc."
NERVINE.--A medicine that calms nervous excitement or acts favorably in
"nervous diseases, as potassium bromide, chloral hydrate, etc."
"NUTRIENT.--A medicine which builds up the waste tissues of the system,"
"as cod liver oil, general tonics, etc."
"OBTUNDENT.--Any agent which relieves irritation or reduces sensibility,"
"as opium, poultices, etc."
"ODONTALGIC.--Any substance for the relief of toothache, as oil of"
"cloves, morphine, etc."
"ODORANT.--Any substance with a pronounced odor, as naphthaline,"
XVII. EVIL DAYS
"Accompanied by Kennedy, Cæsar called repeatedly on the most auspicious"
"members of the French clerical element living in Rome, and found persons"
"more cultivated than among the rough Spanish monks; but, as was natural,"
nobody gave him any useful information offering the possibility of his
putting his financial talents to the proof.
"“Something must turn up,” he used to say to himself, “and at the least"
opening we will dive into the work.”
Cæsar kept gathering notes about people who had connections in Spain
with the Black party in Rome; he called several times on Father
"Herreros, despite his uncle’s prohibition, and succeeded in getting the"
"monk to write to the Marquesa de Montsagro, asking if there were no"
"means of making Cæsar Moneada, Cardinal Fort’s nephew, Conservative"
Deputy for her district.
The Marquesa wrote back that it was impossible; the Conservative Deputy
for the district was very popular and a man with large properties there.
"When Holy Week was over, Laura and the Countess Brenda and her daughter"
"decided to spend a while at Florence, and invited Cæsar to accompany"
"them; but he was quite out of harmony with the Brenda lady, and said"
that he had to stay on in Rome.
"A few days later Mme. Dawson and her daughters left, and the San"
Martinos and the Marchesa Sciacca; and an avalanche of English people
"and Germans, armed with their red Baedekers, took the hotel by storm."
Susanna Marchmont had gone to spend some days at Corfu.
"temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual.” To those who"
"wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for their"
encouragement the following lines from Whitcomb Riley:
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN.[39]
"Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,"
When the robbers came to rob him;
"And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,"
The robbers who came to rob him--
"They picked the lock of the palace-gate,"
Seized his jewels and gems of State
"His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--"
The robbers that came to rob him.
But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
For of what had the robbers robbed him?
"Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,"
"When the robbers came to rob him,--"
They robbed him not of a golden shred
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
"“And they're welcome to all things else,” he said,"
When the robbers came to rob him.
"There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a"
"delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things"
"for small children, to be found in our old Nursery Rhymes. I quote from"
the following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the _Nation_.
After speaking on the subject of Fairy Stories being eliminated from
"the school curriculum, the writer adds:"
"hundred Pounds, such Forfeiture to be enforced as Forfeitures for"
"Offences against the Laws relating to the Customs are enforced, and"
every such Ship shall be liable to such Searches as other Ships are
"liable to, and the Officers of the Customs may freely go on board such"
"Ship and bring to the Queen's Warehouse any Goods on board the same,"
"subject, nevertheless, to such Regulations in respect of Ships of War"
belonging to Her Majesty as shall from Time to Time be issued by the
Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury.
[Sidenote: Power for Treasury to remit Customs Duties in certain cases.]
49. Goods taken as Prize may be sold either for Home Consumption or for
"Exportation; and if in the former Case the Proceeds thereof, after"
"payment of Duties of Customs, are insufficient to satisfy the just and"
"reasonable claims thereon, the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury"
may remit the whole or such Part of the said Duties as they see fit.
_Perjury._
[Sidenote: Punishment of Persons guilty of Perjury.]
"50. If any Person wilfully and corruptly swears, declares, or affirms"
"falsely in any Prize Cause or Appeal, or in any Proceeding under this"
"Act, or in respect of any Matter required by this Act to be verified on"
"Oath, or suborns any other Person to do so, he shall be deemed guilty of"
"Perjury, or of Subornation of Perjury (as the Case may be), and shall be"
liable to be punished accordingly.

the name of these societies and they are known outside of the
State by its name. Cross-reference when necessary.
Enter churches under the name of the place.
"Single churches have usually been entered under the place, a practice"
"which arose in American indexes from our way of naming churches ""The"
"First Church in----,"" ""The Second Church of----,"" etc., and applies"
"very well to a majority of English churches, whose name generally"
includes the name of the parish. It is more in accordance with indexing
"principles to limit the local entry of churches to _First Church_,"
"etc., and those which have only the name of the town or parish, and to"
"put all others (as _St. Sepulchre's_, _St. Mary Aldermansbury_) under"
"their names, as they read, and to treat convents and monasteries in the"
same way; but the convenience of having a single definite rule has been
held to outweigh in this case the claims of consistency.
"The parishes of London (as _Kensington_, _Marylebone_, _Southwark_),"
"like the parts of Boston (_Dorchester_, _Roxbury_, etc.), or of any"
"other composite city, would be put under their own names, not under the"
name of the city.
A few cathedrals generally known by some other name may be entered
"under it: e.g., _St. Paul's, London; Notre Dame, Paris; St."
"Peter's, Rome; St. Sophia, Constantinople_."
"Put monasteries and convents, like churches, under the place,"
unless better known by the name.
National banks designated merely by number (as _First National Bank
of Boston_) go under the name of the place.

forms of indigestion and flatulence through its stomachic and

ANTIMONII ET POTASSII TARTARS--ANTIMONY AND POTASSIUM TARTRATE--TARTAR
EMETIC
"DERIVATION.--Make a white paste with cream of tartar, antimony trioxide"
"and water. Set aside 24 hours, boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, transparent crystals of the rhombic system,"
"becoming opaque and white on exposure to the air, or a white granular"
"powder without odor and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable,"
"metallic taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5 gr.; pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1"
"gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ gr. As an emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1"
to 2 gr.
"ACTIONS.--Tartar emetic is a systemic and local emetic, a diaphoretic,"
cardiac and arterial sedative and a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a
"powerful waste producer and stimulates the secretions of the stomach,"
"intestines, salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large doses cause"
"nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic doses are followed by"
"vomiting (in animals that can vomit), serious blood purging, great"
"depression of the circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and"
death. Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.
is the one common to all tropical countries on which Benjamin Kidd laid
an unerring finger when he referred to the unwisdom of longer permitting
the riches of the tropics to “remain undeveloped with resources running
to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency”. The
Panamanian authorities are making apparently sincere endeavors to
attract new settlers of greater efficiency. In proportion to the success
that attends the efforts the future of Panama will be bright.

CHAPTER XVI
THE INDIANS OF PANAMA
While that portion of the Panama territory that lies along the border of
Colombia known as the Darien is rather ill-defined as to area and to
"boundaries, it is known to be rich in timber and is believed to possess"
gold mines of great richness. But it is practically impenetrable by the
white man. Through this country Balboa led his force on his expedition
"to the unknown Pacific, and was followed by the bloodthirsty Pedrarias"
who bred up in the Indians a hatred of the white man that has grown as
the ages passed. No expedition can enter this region even today except
"as, until I could reach Robat, I had no knowledge at all as to the"
strength and composition of the force that would be at my disposal.
But upon one thing I made up my mind--even at that early stage--I
"would do my utmost to show these Raiders, who were doing us so much"
"harm, that they could not do this with impunity. The lesson once"
"driven home, an endeavour should be made to become friendly with"
"them, to win them back to our side, and, so to speak, appoint them as"
doorkeepers of the Baluchistan frontier; but doorkeepers with their
rifles pointed at our enemies instead of at ourselves.
In the midst of these meditations I found myself stumbling with
"fatigue, so, with a last look at the beauty of the night, I turned"
"indoors, and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and making up for the"
"""whiteness"" of the night before."
CHAPTER II
THE ROAD TO ROBAT
Mushki-chah--The native contractor--An evening rencontre--Idu
of the Chagai Levies--The native idea of an airship--Idu the
invaluable--Robat.
"On the third day we made good progress, fate being kind in helping us"
"to avoid the sandy pitfalls which had hitherto been our undoing, and,"
"by nightfall, we found ourselves approaching the post of Mushki-chah."
Here we found the road blocked with a number of camel caravans
"Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement to _Psychological Review_, June 1903). The"
"pleasure is especially marked, as MacDougall remarks, when there is 'a"
coincidence of subjective and objective change.' In dreams of flying we
"have this coincidence, the real subjective rhythm being transformed in"
consciousness to an objective rhythm.]
"[Footnote 118: Féré, 'Note sur les Rêves Epileptiques,' _Revue de"
"Médecine_, September 10, 1905.]"
[Footnote 119: Sir W. R. Gowers has on several occasions (_e.g._ 'The
"Borderland of Epilepsy,' _British Medical Journal_, July 21, 1906) argued"
"that dreams of falling have an aural origin, and are caused by contraction"
"of the stapedius muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might"
suggest descent; he has himself suddenly awakened from such a dream and
caught the sound of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an
investigator deserves consideration.]
"[Footnote 120: Such sensations are, indeed, a recognised result of"
"morphia. Morphinomaniacs, Goron remarks (_Les Parias de l'Amour_, p. 125),"
are apt to feel that they are flying or floating over the world.]
"[Footnote 121: Jewell states that 'certain observers, peculiarly liable"
"to dreams of falling or flying, ascribe these distinctly to faulty"
"circulation, and say their physicians, to regulate the heart's action,"
have given them medicines which always relieve them and prevent such
"dreams' (_American Journal of Psychology_, January 1905, p. 8).]"
[Footnote 122: Interesting evidence in favour of the respiratory origin
of such visions is furnished by Silberer's observations on his own
symbolic hypnagogic visions which are certainly allied to dream visions.

CHAPTER XXVI
DEEP ROMANY
The news which Sergeant Cardono had to communicate was indeed fitted to
"shake the strongest nerves. If true, it took away from Rollo at once all"
hope of the success of his mission. He saw himself returning disgraced
"and impotent to the camp of Cabrera, either to be shot out of hand, or"
"worse still, to be sent over the frontier as something too useless and"
feeble to be further employed.
"Briefly, the boy's news as repeated by La Giralda to the Sergeant,"
informed Rollo that though the court was presently at La Granja and many
"courtiers in the village of San Ildefonso, the royal guards through fear"
"and hunger had mutinied and marched back to Madrid, and that the gipsies"
were gathering among the mountains in order to make a night attack upon
the stranded and forsaken court of Spain.
In the sergeant's opinion not a moment was to be lost. The object of the
"hill Gitanos was pure plunder, but they would think nothing of"
"bloodshed, and would doubtless give the whole palace and town over to"
"rapine and pillage. Themselves desperate with hunger and isolation, they"
had resolved to strike a blow which would ring from one end of Spain to
the other.
It was their intention (so the imp said) to kill the Queen-Regent and
"her daughter, to slaughter the ministers and courtiers in attendance, to"
train shall follow the miners.
[Illustration: A RIVER LANDING PLACE]
"The authorities of Panama estimate that there are about 36,000 tribal"
"Indians, that is to say aborigines, still holding their tribal"
organizations and acknowledging fealty to no other government now in the
"Isthmus. The estimate is of course largely guesswork, for few of the"
wild Indians leave the jungle and fewer still of the census enumerators
enter it. Most of these Indians live in the mountains of the provinces
"of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veragua, or in the Darien. Their tribes"
are many and the sources of information concerning them but few. The
most accessible and complete record of the various tribes is in a
"pamphlet issued by the Smithsonian Institution, and now obtainable only"
"through public libraries, as the edition for distribution has been"
"exhausted. The author, Miss Eleanor Yorke Bell, beside studies made at"
first hand has diligently examined the authorities on the subject and
has presented the only considerable treatise on the subject of which I
have knowledge.

Of life among the more civilized natives she says:
"“The natives of the Isthmus in general, even in the larger towns, live"
"together without any marriage ceremony, separating at will and dividing"
"the children. As there is little or no personal property, this is"
"accomplished amicably as a rule, though should disputes arise the"
it has notable antiseptic and antipyretic effects. Useful in carbolic
"acid poisoning, alcohol, or alcoholic liquors, act as a chemical"
antidote besides overcoming the shock produced by the acid. It may also
be used locally for carbolic acid burns.
The effects of alcohol are noticed in ten or fifteen minutes after
"administration and will be shown by a better condition of the pulse, the"
"weak pulse becoming stronger and firmer; the quick pulse slower, the"
"breathing becomes more natural, eyes brighten up and in fact a general"
improvement is shown.
Externally alcohol is used alone as a strengthening application to weak
"tendons and muscles; or after a race, is used to rub on the legs,"
"combined with other drugs as a liniment, as alcohol, soap-liniment and"
witch hazel; can be used in surgery as an antiseptic.
To toughen the skin of tender or thin skinned horses who gall or chafe
"easily under the collar and saddle, alcohol will be found a most"
satisfactory application.
ALOE BARBADENSIS--BARBADOES ALOES

by the various members of the family would be an interesting study.

GUAYMI INDIAN MAN
Note the tattoed marking of face and the negroid lips]
The Choco Indians are one of the smaller and least known tribes of the
Darien. Prof. Pittier--who may without disrespect be described as the
most seasoned “tropical tramp” of all Central America--described them so
vividly that extracts from his article in the National Geographic
Magazine will be of interest:
"“Never, in our twenty-five years of tropical experience, have we met"
"with such a sun-loving, bright and trusting people, living nearest to"
nature and ignoring the most elementary wiles of so-called civilization.
They are several hundred in number and their dwellings are scattered
"along the meandrous Sambu and its main reaches, always at short"
"distance, but never near enough to each other to form real villages."
"Like their houses, their small plantations are close to the river, but"
mostly far enough to escape the eye of the casual passer-by.
“Dugouts drawn up on the beach and a narrow trail breaking the reed wall
"at the edge of the bank are the only visible signs of human presence,"
"except at the morning hours and near sunset, when a crowd of women and"
"children will be seen playing in the water, and the men, armed with"
"their bows and long harpooned arrows, scrutinizing the deeper places for"
"and groan, while they are, for the most part, forgetful of anything"
"else life may have to offer."""
"""But what IS life without plenty of money?"" inquired the Duchess"
"carelessly--""Surely, not worth the trouble of living!"""
"Alwyn looked at her steadily, and a swift flush colored her smooth"
"cheek. She toyed with the magnificent diamond spray at her breast, and"
wondered what strange spell was in this man's brilliant gray-black
eyes!--did he guess that she--even she--had sold herself to the Duc de
la Santoisie for the sake of his money and title as easily and
unresistingly as though she were a mere purchasable animal?
"""That is an argument I would rather not enter into,"" he said"
"gently--""It would lead us too far. But I am convinced, that whether"
"dire poverty or great riches be our portion, life, considered apart"
"from its worldly appendages, is always worth living, if lived WELL."""
"""Pray, how can you separate life from its worldly"
"appendages?""--inquired a satirical-looking gentleman opposite--""Life IS"
"the world, and the things of the world; when we lose sight of the"
"world, we lose ourselves,--in short, we die,--and the world is at an"
"end, and we with it. That's plain practical philosophy."""
"""Possibly it may be called philosophy""--returned Alwyn--""It is not"
"Christianity."""
"""Oh, Christianity!""--and the gentleman gave a portentous sniff of"
"contempt--""That is a system of faith that is rapidly dying out; fast"
"falling into contempt!--In fact, with the scientific and cultured"
"classes, it is already an exploded doctrine."""
"first flowers seen after winter snows!--welcome, more welcome than"
"swift rescue to one in dire peril!--welcome, my Angel, into the"
"darkness of mortal things, which haply so sweet a Presence shall make"
bright! O sacred innocence that I am not worthy to shield! ... O
sinless beauty that I am all unfitted to claim or possess! Welcome to
"my life, my heart, my soul! Welcome, sweet Trust, sweet Hope, sweet"
"Love, that as Christ lives, I will never wrong, betray, or resign again"
"through all the glory spaces of far Eternity!"""
"As he spoke, his arms closed more surely about her,--his lips met"
"hers,--and in the mingled human and divine rapture of that moment,"
"there came a rushing noise, as of thousands of wings beating the air,"
followed by a mighty wave of music that rolled approachingly and then
"departingly through and through the Cathedral arches--and a Voice,"
"clear and resonant as a silver clarion, proclaimed aloud:"
"""Those whom GOD hath joined together, let no MAN put asunder!"""
"Then, with a surging, jubilant sound, like the sea in a storm, the"
"music seemed to tread past in a measured march of stately harmony,--and"
"presently there was silence once more,--the silence and sunshine of the"
morning pouring through the rose windows of the church and sparkling on
"the Cross above the Altar,--the silence of a love made perfect,--of"
twin souls made ONE!
And then Edris drew herself gently from her lover's embrace and raised
"her head,--putting her hand confidingly in his, a lovely smile played"
on her sweetly parted lips:
"""Take me, Theos,"" she said softly, ""Lead me,--into the World!"""
*     *     *     *     *     *
to be blamed as her sins?
"To me the Yellow Peril cry, which is so often revived in some quarters"
"of the Continent, is either a sort of what we call 'guchi,' that is to"
"say, useless repetition of complaint of some unreasonable"
"disappointment, or a perpetuation of wicked instigation and selfish"
"intention. In either case, it is not at all a laudable action; indeed, I"
may say it is wasteful calumny for no material good will come of it
inasmuch as its object can never be achieved from the very condition of
the world. The people who entertain that idea would be doing far better
"service to their country, to the progress of civilisation, to the"
"general cause of humanity, if only they put aside such a silly notion,"
and busy themselves in teaching their fellow country-folks to accustom
themselves to the changed circumstances of the time. It would be a far
"more manly and noble act if they revised their old notions, which in a"
measure may be called prejudice.
"As to ourselves, the Japanese, we shall only be glad if we can enjoy a"
"peaceful and harmonious life in the happy family of the world, as we are"
"determined to do, in spite of all the obstacles which may be laid before"
us.

THE INDO-CHINA QUESTION[1]
INTERVIEW WITH THE BARON SUYEMATSU
USES.--Tartar emetic is too mild as an emetic in poison cases. In asthma
of dogs it may be used in from ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ grain doses to relax spasm
and promote secretion. For horses its most valuable use is to expel the
"common round worms from the intestines, for which it is very"
efficacious; given in two drachm doses once or twice daily in the feed
"for four to six days, or one-half ounce dissolved in water is given on"
an empty stomach followed by a full dose of linseed oil.
ANTIPYRINA--ANTIPYRIN
"Phenyl-hydrazine is acted upon by aceto-acetic ether, when"
"phenyl-monomethyl-pyrazolon, ethyl alcohol and water results."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, odorless, scaly crystals, of a bitterish taste."
"Soluble in water, ether and chloroform."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.;"
"dogs, 5 to 20 grs."
"ACTIONS.--Powerful antipyretic, anodyne and local anesthetic,"
"antiseptic, cardiac depressant; it reduces temperature very quickly,"
usually within half an hour and the effects continue two or more hours.
"It can be administered by the mouth, hypodermically or intertracheally;"
"as an antiseptic it diminishes oxidation, and promotes heat loss by"
"dilating the cutaneous vessels, but more probably by depressing the"
activity of the calorifacient centers.
"Morgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved"
"irksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in"
"1674 that Morgan ""frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and"
"gambling in unseemly fashion,"" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had"
voted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676
Vaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the
"Council, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates."
"Morgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his"
"popularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain"
of a company of 100 men.
"The Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked"
"Morgan, in spite of his jovial ""goings on"" with his old buccaneer friends"
"in the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of"
"Morgan's ""generous manner,"" and hints that whatever allowances are made to"
"him ""he will be a beggar."""
"In 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once"
began between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought
"against Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, ""God damn the"
"Assembly!"" for which he was suspended from that body."
"In April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,"
"ordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live"
"long to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688."
"An extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of"
"H.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at"
"Port Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a"
man he was thought to be. It runs:
"no Dryasdust. He was a living human being, troubled as we are troubled,"
"and interested in the things which interest us. He spoke to us, not"
"from the skies, but from among a crowd of his fellow human beings, and"
we feel that he was one of ourselves. As such it is good that a
memorial of him should be placed where it may easily be seen.

CHAPTER I
EARLY LIFE
"It may be a truism, but it is none the less a fact, that it is not"
always he of whom the world hears most who influences most deeply the
thought of the age in which he lives. The name of James Frederick
Ferrier is little heard of beyond the comparatively small circle of
philosophic thinkers who reverence his memory and do their best to keep
it green: to others it is a name of little import--one among a
multitude at a time when Scotland had many sons rising up to call her
"blessed, and not perhaps one of the most notable of these. And yet,"
could we but estimate the value of work accomplished in the higher
sphere of thought as we estimate it in the other regions of practical
"work--an impossibility, of course--we might be disposed to modify our"
"views, and accord our praises in very different quarters from those in"
which they are usually bestowed.
James Ferrier wrote no popular books; he came before the public
comparatively little; he made no effort to reconcile religion with
little resemblance to the fields of Aalu.

SYRIA.
The religions of Syria never had the same solidarity in the Occident as
those from Egypt or Asia Minor. From the coasts of Phoenicia and the
"valleys of Lebanon, from the borders of the Euphrates and the oases of the"
"desert, they came at various periods, like the successive waves of the"
"incoming tide, and existed side by side in the Roman world without uniting,"
in spite of their similarities. The isolation in which they remained and
the persistent adherence of their believers to their particular rites were
"a consequence and reflection of the disunited condition of Syria herself,"
where the different tribes and districts remained more distinct than
"anywhere else, even after they had been brought together under the"
domination of Rome. They doggedly preserved their local gods and Semitic
dialects.
It would be impossible to outline each one of these religions in detail at
"this time and to reconstruct their history, because our meager information"
"would not permit it, but we can indicate, in a general way, how they"
"penetrated into the Occidental countries at various periods, and we can try"
to define their common characteristics by showing what new elements the
Syrian paganism brought to the Romans.
"The first Semitic divinity to enter Italy was {104} _Atargatis_, frequently"
"mistaken for the Phoenician Astarte, who had a famous temple at Bambyce or"
"Hierapolis, not far from the Euphrates, and was worshiped with her husband,"
"to form a much better ""idea of the greatness of the religion of their"
"fathers""? Does it not seem strange that so many hundreds of these"
relics should be kept in those enlightened and happy countries like
"Italy, where ""the achievements of Catholic life"" are so well known,"
"and where Mother Church has for centuries had full sway, and that none"
"of them should be brought to these benighted Protestant regions, where"
they could effect such a salutary change in the faith of the people?
"But, seriously, as I added to my friend in the conversation referred"
"to, I have a better opinion of the intelligence of our good Roman"
Catholic people in America than to believe that they put the slightest
credence in these childish superstitions. Whatever the bishop above
"quoted may believe, I am confident that the intelligent Roman Catholic"
people of our country have no more faith in many of these alleged
relics than we have.

"[8] In July of this year, 1903, while the Roman Catholic world was"
"greatly exercised over the grave illness of the late Pope, Leo XIII.,"
the Associated Press dispatches from Naples reported that the blood of
St. Januarius had miraculously liquefied at that unusual time in token
that the prayers offered for the Pope's recovery had been answered.
The Archbishop of Naples has up to the present time vouchsafed
"no explanation of the fact that the Pope died a few days later,"
notwithstanding this miraculous assurance that he would recover.

It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness that women
"are never allowed to enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church"
"of S. Croce, except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th,"
"notwithstanding the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman, and that"
the church owes its existence to her and is also indebted to her for
"the piece of the true cross which it boasts, and which has given it its"
"name. So while men are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena,"
women are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer through the
railing. The same degrading discrimination is made in the Church of S.
"Prassede (who also was a woman) as to entering the splendid chapel,"
"Orto del Paradiso, which contains the column of blood jasper to which"
"Christ was bound, and which was ""given by the Saracens to Giovanni"
"Colonna, cardinal of this church, and legate of the Crusade, because"
"when he had fallen into their hands and was about to be put to death,"
"he was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial light."""
Females are never allowed to enter this chapel except upon Sundays in
"Lent, but are permitted to look at the relic through a grating.[12]"
[Sidenote: Four Other Stones of Great Interest.]
The mention of this column reminds me of the two columns in the Church
"of S. Maria Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber, near St."
"Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating that they were the pillars to"
"which St. Peter and St. Paul were fastened, respectively, when they"
suffered flagellation by order of Nero. A little farther on towards
"St. Peter's is the Piazza Scossa Cavalli, with a pretty fountain."
"""Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which tells how when S."
"Mr. Justin Carthew, on the other hand, is related to the family in a"
"very different and distant degree, and there are, as y'r ludship has"
"been good enough to agree, no other survivors."
"""I beg leave now to request that y'r ludship will rescind the authority"
"granted to Mr. Justin Carthew, and admit my client's petition _ad"
"referendum_."""
"""Produce your proofs,"" ordered his lordship, and Mr. Spettigrew"
extracted from a capacious black bag a pile of papers at which Mr.
Justice Gaunt looked with no little disgust.
"""What are they, in chief?"" asked Mr. Justice Gaunt, turning over page"
"after page of closely written law-script, as gingerly as if he believed"
that one might perhaps explode and blow him to pieces. And Mr.
"Spettigrew launched forth again into a long list of certificates,"
"records, researches, findings, orders of court, sworn statements and"
"affidavits, by Captain Dove--""Then trading in his own ship, m'lud, now"
"retired and devoting his time to mission-work among deep-sea sailors;"""
"by Mr. Jasper Slyne, gentleman; by Mr. Jobling, whom he did not pause"
"to describe; by a couple of dozen other people, living or dead, at home"
or abroad; all in due legal form and not to be controverted.
"""I think you'll find them in perfect order, and absolutely conclusive,"
"m'lud,"" counsel came to a finish triumphantly, and sat down, greatly to"
the relief of all present.
"""H'm!"" said his lordship, still gravely regarding Sallie: whose eyes had"
"nothing to conceal from him. ""And so this is the long-lost Lady"
"Josceline!"""
"His searching glance travelled slowly to Captain Dove's face, and then"
"Frances and Bettina to the payment of the extraordinary admission fee,"
"and when we left the next morning, curiosity prompted them to pass near"
"the garter rack in the tap-room, where garters were hanging which had"
been taken from maids whose great granddaughters had become great
"grandmothers. The garters that had belonged to Frances and Bettina, being"
"the latest contributions, hung at the bottom of the rack, neatly dated"
"and labelled, and, as I left the room, I overheard Bettina whisper to"
Frances:--
"""I'm glad mine was of silk."""
"We made a short drive to Maidstone, where we stopped over night. The next"
"day a longer journey brought us to Canterbury, where we spent two nights"
"and a day, visiting the cathedral both by sunlight and moonlight; the"
combination of moonlight and Bettina being very trying to me.
"From Canterbury we drove in the rain to Dover, where we lodged at that"
"good inn, the Three Anchors, to await a fair wind for Calais."
"During the next three days the wind was fair, but it was blowing half a"
"gale, and therefore the passage was not to be attempted. Though I was"
"enjoying myself, I was anxious to post our letters, as mine gave a full"
account of several matters at court concerning which I knew George ought
to be informed.
"Among other news, I told him that King Charles had sent a messenger"
"into France carrying a personal letter to King Louis, asking his help"
"in finding the man Hamilton, who had threatened Charles's life. I also"
suggested in my letter that the king of France was trying to buy the
"city of Dunkirk from King Charles, and that because of the friendly"
"negotiations then pending, Louis might give heed to our king's request."
"In that case, it might be well, I thought, for Hamilton to leave France"
"follow, and then occurs the sentence--unhappily a stereotyped one in"
our day--“_This is the lowest rate recorded in any quarter since civil
registration began._”
Now and again a blue-book upon the subject of the birth-rate is
dissected by a journalist and the result appears in his newspaper as a
series of startling figures. The story of England’s decadence is set
out in the plainest language for every one to read.
"At rarer intervals still, some prominent clergyman or sociologist"
"writes or lectures in order to call attention to what is going on, and"
thus to bring home the spiritual and economic dangers of our racial
suicide.
A few people read or listen and are convinced. A good many other
people are too utterly ignorant of either the Philosophy of
Christianity or the Science of Sociology to understand in the least
what the point of view of the protesters is. According to their
"temperament, they smile quietly and dismiss the subject, or bellow"
their disgust at such a subject being mentioned at all.
"“He who far off beholds another dancing,"
And all the time
"Hears not the music that he dances to,"
Thinks him a madman.”
"A party which has the fools at its back is always in the majority, and"
"discussion is stifled, alarm is lulled by the anodyne of indifference"
and the great number of honest folk who call themselves both Patriots
and Christians have no time to spare from fighting and squabbling for
money--in order that the dishonest men may not get it all.
"earlier. As a founder of a dynasty that overthrew a previous one, Azag-Bau"
"must have engaged in hostilities with other centres, so that the second"
interpretation that 'the king's country will be seized' may well refer to
"some historical event of the same general period. Be that as it may, the"
important point for us is that we have here another proof of the practical
purpose served by the observation of birth-omens.
IV
Passing now to some illustrations of birth-omens from the collections of
"the =bârû=-priests, let us first take up some texts dealing with omens"
"from the young of animals. Naturally, the animals to which attention was"
"directed were the domesticated ones--sheep, goats, cows, dogs, horses and"
"pigs. Among these the most prominent is the sheep, corresponding to the"
"significance attached to the sheep in liver divination where it is, in"
"fact, the only animal whose liver is read as a means of forecasting the"
future[33]. As a result of this particularly prominent position taken by
"the sheep in birth-omens, the word =isbu=, designating the normal or"
abnormal foetus--human or animal--when introduced without further
qualification generally indicates the foetus of a sheep[34].
"A text[35] dealing with a double foetus, i. e., of a sheep[36], reads in"
part as follows:
"'If it is a double foetus with slits (?) on the head and tail, the"
land will be secure.
"If it is a double foetus and enclosed[37], confusion in the country,"
An apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a
new Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have
sought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of
facts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable
materials that have recently been published by continental historians.
To explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an
"elaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space"
"absolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the"
most important topics.
"To deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief"
"importance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and"
"Vandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrück, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,"
and Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.
I have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or
"collections of documents due to the labours of the ""Société d'Histoire"
"Contemporaine,"" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,"
"Caudrillier, Capitaine ""J.G.,"" Lévy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,"
"and others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,"
"Klinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the"
recently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not
"devoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with"
caution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Léon Lecestre and
M. Léonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life
of the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely
revise our judgments on many of its episodes.
"But I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not"
been able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During
"a study of this period for an earlier work published in the ""Cambridge"
"Historical Series,"" I ascertained the great value of the British"
records for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our
true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances but bravely accept
them; and we belong to that race and dynasty who had accomplished great
things with simple means.
FAILURE AND SUCCESS
"This day twenty-three years ago, I resolved that as far as the"
"whole-hearted devotion and faith of one man counted, that would not be"
wanting and within six months it came about that some of the most
difficult problems connected with Electric Waves found their solution in
"my Laboratory and received high appreciation from Lord Kelvin, Lord"
Rayleigh and other leading physicists. The Royal Society honoured me by
"publishing my discoveries and offering, of their own accord, an"
appropriation from the special Parliamentary Grant for the advancement
of knowledge. That day the closed gates suddenly opened and I hoped that
"the torch that was then lighted would continue to burn brighter, and"
brighter. But man's faith and hope require repeated testing. For five
"years after this, the progress was interrupted; yet when the most"
generous and wide appreciation of my work had reached almost the highest
point there came a sudden and unexpected change.
LIVING AND NON-LIVING
In the pursuit of my investigations I was unconsciously led into the
border region of physics and physiology and was amazed to find boundary
lines vanishing and points of contact emerge between the realms of the
Living and Non-living. Inorganic matter was found anything but inert; it
also was a thrill under the action of multitudinous forces that played
"on it. A universal reaction seemed to bring together metal, plant and"
animal under a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same
"sold or ordered, are blessed and enriched with the indulgences of the"
Rosary Confraternity and the papal blessing. When blessed they may be
"distributed; _but if resold they lose all the indulgences_."" (Italics"
ours.)
Still another relic of great interest in this convent of St. Sabina
"is the crucifix of Michele Ghislieri (afterwards Pope Pius V.). ""One"
"day, as Ghislieri was about to kiss his crucifix, in the eagerness"
"of prayer, the image of Christ, says the legend, retired of its own"
"accord from his touch, for it had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss"
"would have been death."""
"[Sidenote: Sundry Miracles by Other Saints, and Images.]"
"In the Church of St. Gregory, on the C[oe]lian Hill, the thing that"
"interested us most was the picture by Badalocchi, ""commemorating a"
"miracle on this spot, when, at the moment of elevation, the Host"
"is said to have bled in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince an"
"unbeliever of the truth of transubstantiation."" This is the same"
Gregory who presented certain foreign ambassadors with a handful of
"earth from the arena of the Coliseum as a relic for their sovereigns,"
"so many martyrs having suffered death there, and ""upon their receiving"
"the gift with disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed from the"
"soil."""
Not far from the Church of St. Gregory we were shown the hermitage
"where St. Giovanni de Matha lived. ""Before he came to reside here he"
had been miraculously brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a
"mission) to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he knelt"
"without ceasing before the crucifix throughout the whole of his voyage!"""
Time would fail me to tell of the miraculous surgical operation
PREFACE
The aim of this book is to serve as a companion to the _Mennonite
"Hymnary_. It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the"
words and music of every hymn in the _Hymnary_.
"The great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days"
"of the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration"
and power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love
"for our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and"
blessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.
The _Handbook_ may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private study of
hymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable hymns
for the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing
special music services or hymn sings where such occasions are planned to
improve the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in hymnology in
churches and schools. The historical development of hymnology may be
followed in the brief “Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes.”
The author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as possible
without overburdening the reader with too many details. Many hymns have
"interesting stories connected with their origin and use while others,"
"equally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident, the poet"
"scarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice spoke. The"
apocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning some hymns have
been studiously avoided. The aim has been to include only such material
as seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity. The bibliography of
not to be shaken. It may be well imagined that the feeding of my
chauffeur during the months to come loomed up as one of my minor
anxieties.
"From Pindi I went to Quetta by train, my car, with the native"
"chauffeur having gone direct to the then rail-head at Nushki, in the"
North of Indo-Baluchistan.
"At Quetta I laid in a store of petrol, spare tyres, a few personal"
"necessities, reported to General Grover for orders and information,"
"and then proceeded to Nushki; which place was reached, and the car"
"picked up, on, if I remember rightly, the 25th of February."
This day in Nushki was to prove the last in a civilised town for
many months to come. The look of the country lying before us so
"intimidated my native chauffeur that he came to me, a short time"
"before we were due to start, with a countenance torn with grief and,"
"with lamentations and protestations of sorrow, told me that both his"
"father and mother were ill, and that it was vital for him to return"
and succour them. As I had been in two minds as to the advisability
"of taking the rascal with me, this sign of the white feather at the"
"very outset at once decided the point, and I gave him to understand"
that he could go and bury as many of his relations as he pleased.
With a countenance swiftly transformed to cheerfulness he left me.
Just before starting a wire was handed in from a high political
official at Quetta informing me that the Baluch Raiders had already
"cut our lines of communication, were right across my path, and he"
"advised, if not ordered, me not to proceed."
"However, as explicit military instructions were to endeavour to reach"
"Robat (near the Koh-i-Maliksia), a hill at which the Baluch, Afghan"
"""Yes, and I own everything in the village,"" asserted the imp. ""If you"
"want anything here you must pay me for it!"""
The Sergeant found it even as the cripple had said. There was not a
single living inhabitant in the village. Here and there a shut door and
a sickening smell betrayed the fact that some unfortunates had been left
to die untended. Etienne and John Mortimer were for different reasons
"unwilling to taste of the ham and bread he had brought back, thinking"
"that these might convey the contagion, but La Giralda and the Sergeant"
"laughed their fears to scorn, and together retired to prepare the"
evening meal.
"As the others made their preparations for the night, watering their"
"beasts and grooming them with the utmost care, the little crook-backed"
"imp from the village appeared on the brink of the _barranco_, his"
"sallow, weazened face peeping suspiciously out of the underbrush, and"
his crutch performing the most curious evolutions in the air.
There was something unspeakably eerie in the aspect of the solitary
"survivor of so many living people, left behind to prey like a ghoul on"
the abandoned possessions of the fear-stricken living and the
untestamented property of the dead.
"Concha shrank instinctively from his approach, and the boy, perceiving"
"his power over her, came scuttling like a weasel through the brushwood,"
till little more than a couple of paces interposed between him and the
"girl. Frozen stiff with loathing and terror, it was not for some time"
"that Concha could cry out and look round hastily for Rollo, who"
(doubtless in his capacity of leader of the expedition) was not slow in
hastening to her assistance.
"But the finest growth of the new literature, it turns out, is due to"
"culture-contacts--an unexpected confirmation, in a most unlikely"
"quarter, of a general principle arrived at on other data. The vigilant"
"study of our own day has detected, standing out from the early"
"Icelandic literature, ""a group of poems which possess the very qualities"
"of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature, passionate"
"dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language, which [other] Icelandic"
poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at
"all. They are the poetry of the 'Western Islands'""[688]--that is, the"
"poetry of the meeting and mixing of the ""Celtic"" and Scandinavian stocks"
"in Ireland and the Hebrides--the former already much mixed, and"
proportionally rich in intellectual variations. It was in this area that
"""a magnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for"
power and beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries
"after their date.... This school, which is totally distinct from the"
"Icelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the thirteenth"
"century.""[689]"
"Compare Messrs. Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_,"
"1883, vol. i, Introd. pp. lxii, lxiii; and, as regards the old"
"Irish civilisation, the author's _Saxon and Celt_, pp. 127, 128,"
131-33.
"The theory of Celtic influence, though established in its"
"essentials, is not perfectly consistent as set forth in the"
"_Britannica_ article. Thus, while the Celticised literature is"
"remarked for ""noble simplicity of language,"" the true Icelandic,"
"primarily like the Old English, is said to develop a ""complexity of"
"structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical"
"phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,"
"quantity, and syllabification which it caught up from the Latin and"
"_Celtic_ poets."" Further, while the Celticised school is described"
"the appreciation of the best qualities of the hero: his modesty, his"
"dignity, his reticence, his courage and his constancy: he seems to"
combine all the qualities of the best soldier with those of the best
"civilian, without the more obvious qualities which generally attract"
"first. As for the love-story, we must not _expect_ any child to see"
"its tenderness and beauty, though the individual child may intuitively"
"appreciate these qualities, but it is not what we wish for or work for"
at this period of child-life.
This method could be applied to various stories. I have chosen the _Tin
Soldier_ because of its dramatic qualities and because it is marked off
(probably quite unconsciously on the part of Andersen) into periods
which correspond to the child's development.
In Eugene Field's exquisite little poem of “The Dinkey Bird” we find
"the objects familiar to the child in _unusual_ places, so that some"
imagination is needed to realise that “big red sugar-plums are clinging
to the cliffs beside that sea”; but the introduction of the fantastic
bird and the soothing sound of the Amfalula Tree are new and delightful
"sensations, quite out of the child's personal experience."
Another such instance is to be found in Mrs. W. K. Clifford's story of
"Master Willie. The abnormal behaviour of familiar objects, such as a"
"doll, leads from the ordinary routine to the paths of adventure. This"
"story is to be found in a little book called “Very Short Stories,” a"
most interesting collection for teachers and children.
"We now come to the second element we should seek in material--namely,"
"the element of the unusual, which we have already anticipated in the"
story of the Tin Soldier.
This element is necessary in response to the demand of the child who
"Herrick, who studied his own dreams for many months, found that the"
"essential element is the emotional, and not the ideational, and that,"
"indeed, when recalled _at once_, with closed eyes and before moving,"
they were nearly devoid of intellectual content (_Journal of Comparative
"Neurology_, vol. iii. p. 17, 1893). R. MacDougall considers that dreaming"
is 'a succession of intense states of feeling supported by a minimum of
"ideational content,' or, as he says again, more accurately, 'the feeling"
is primary; the idea-content is the inferred thing' (_Psychological
"Review_, vol. v. p. 2). Grace Andrews, who kept a record of her dreams"
"(_American Journal of Psychology_, October 1900), found that dream"
emotions are often stronger and more vivid than those of waking life; 'the
dream emotion seems to me the most real element of the dream life.' P.
"Meunier, again ('Des Rêves Stéreotypés,' _Journal de Psychologie Normale"
"et Pathologique_, September-October 1905), states that 'the substratum of"
a dream consists of a cœnæsthesia or an emotional state. The intellectual
"operation which translates to the sleeper's consciousness, while he is"
"asleep, this cœnæsthesia or emotional state is what we call a dream.']"
[Footnote 88: The night-terrors of children have frequently been found
to have their origin in gastric or intestinal disturbance. Graham Little
"brings together the opinions of various authorities on this point,"
though he is himself inclined to give chief importance to heart disease
"producing slight disturbances of breathing, since he has found that"
in nearly two-thirds of his cases (17 out of 30) night-terrors were
"associated with early heart disease (Graham Little, 'The Causation of"
"Night-Terrors,' _British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899). It should"
be added that night-terrors are more usually divided into two classes:
"(1) idiopathic (purely cerebral in origin), and (2) symptomatic (due to"
"reflex disturbance caused by various local disorders); see _e.g._ Guthrie,"
"'On Night-Terrors,' _Clinical Journal_, 7th January 1899. J. A. Symonds"
"has well described his own night-terrors as a child (Horatio Brown, _J."
"A. Symonds_, vol. i.). Lafcadio Hearn (in a paper on 'Nightmare-Touch'"
of Press Censor and officer in charge of Publicity. After the
"occupation of Brussels and the fall of Antwerp, the ""patriotic"""
Belgian Press had withdrawn itself to France and England or had
stopped publication. Its newspapers had been invited to continue
"their functions as organs of news-distribution and public opinion,"
but of course under the German Censorate and martial law. As one
"editor said to a polite German official: ""If I were to continue the"
"publication of my paper under such conditions, my staff and I would"
"all be shot in a week."""
But the large towns of Belgium could not be left without a Press.
"Public Opinion must be guided, and might very well be guided in a"
direction favourable to German policy. The German Government had
"already introduced the German hour into Belgian time, the German"
"coinage, the German police system, and German music; but it had no"
"intention, seemingly, of forcing the German speech on the old"
"dominions of the House of Burgundy. On the contrary, in their tenure"
"of Belgium or of North-east France, the Germans seemed desirous of"
"showing how well they wrote the French language, how ready they were"
under a German regime to give it a new literature. Whether or not
"they enlisted a few recreants, or made use of Alsatians or"
"Lorrainers to help them, it is never-the-less remarkable how free as"
a rule their written and printed French was from mistakes or German
idioms; though their spoken French always remained Alsatian. It
suffered from that extraordinary misplacement and exchange in the
upper and lower consonants which has distinguished the German
people--that nation of great philologists--since the death of the
"Roman Empire. German officers still said ""Barton, die fous brie,"""
"instead of ""Pardon, je vous prie"" (if they were polite), but they"
were quite able to contribute _articles de fond_ to a pretended
national Belgian press. Besides there was a sufficiency of Belgian
"""Sans-Patries"" ready to come to their assistance: Belgian nationals"
THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS. It is to the igneous rocks that
we may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas
"contain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no"
doubt this was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed
the original earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the
"metals have been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even"
the sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and
"other metals, but in this widely diffused condition they are"
wholly useless to man. The concentration which has made them
available is due to the interaction of many agencies. Earth
"movements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust, the intrusion"
"of heated masses, the circulation of underground waters, have all"
cooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins.
"While fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the"
latter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled
"by similar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as"
"limestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes"
"filled with metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and"
zinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous
"aquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case"
of some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New
Mexico.
PART III
HISTORICAL GEOLOGY
"her husband's execution, the woman said, she had had to become the"
mistress of the sergeant-major who resided with her as the only
"means, seemingly, of saving her one remaining young son from exile"
in Germany and her daughters from unbearably brutal treatment;
"though she added, ""As to their virtue, _that_ has long since"
vanished; all I ask is that they be not half-killed whenever the
soldiers get drunk. Oh Madame! If you could only say a word to that
"Colonel with whom you are living?"""
"Mrs. Warren dared not translate this last sentence to Vivie, for"
fear her daughter forced her at all costs to leave the Hotel
"Impérial. Where, if she did, were they to go?"
The winter of 1914 had witnessed an appalling degree of
"frightfulness in eastern Belgium, the Wallon or French-speaking part"
of the country more especially. The Germans seemed to bear a special
"grudge against this region, regarding it as doggedly opposed to"
absorption into a Greater Germany; whereas they hoped the Flemish
half of the country would receive them as fellow Teutons and even as
deliverers from their former French oppressors. Thousands of old men
"and youths, of women and children in the provinces south of the"
Meuse had been shot in cold blood; village after village had been
burnt. Scenes of nearly equal horror had taken place between
"Brussels and Antwerp, especially around Malines. Von Bissing's"
arrival as Governor General was soon signalized by those dreaded Red
"Placards on the walls of Brussels, announcing the verdicts of"
"courts-martial, the condemnation to death of men and women who had"
contravened some military regulation.
"Yet in spite of this, life went on in Brussels once more--by von"
Bissing's stern command--as though the country were not under the
heel of the invader. The theatres opened their doors; the cinemas
"cliffs. Each was followed at regular intervals, until a double row of"
swift air-craft flying with methodical precision headed towards the
Flanders shore.
"Already the ""Sunderland"" and three other light cruisers, accompanied"
"by a torpedo-boat destroyer flotilla, were shaping a course for the"
Belgian coast.
Off the East Goodwins they were joined by two monitors and three
"pre-Dreadnought battleships, and the battle line was formed. Away"
"steamed the destroyers to act as screens to the heavier vessels, and"
to guard them from submarine attack. The monitors led the main
"division, the cruisers acting as links between them and the"
"battleships, which, owing to their greater draught, could not"
approach the coast nearer than a distance of from four to seven
miles.
From Aubyn's point of view the forthcoming operations were entirely
new. For the first time in his experience he was to take part in an
"action between ships and shore batteries, the latter being both fixed"
and mobile. It was a comparatively easy matter to plant shells into
"forts the position of which were known, but the Germans had brought"
"up heavy guns mounted on travelling platforms, which could be moved"
"with considerable celerity behind the long, low-lying sand dunes"
between Nieuport and Zeebrugge.
It was partly to locate the latter that the airmen had preceded the
"bombarding ships, and also to harass the enemy's lines of"
"communication. Moreover, hostile submarines were reported to have"
"been brought in sections to Zeebrugge, where they were being bolted"
together ready to take the offensive against the British vessels
operating off the Belgian coast.
probability of bloodshed is reported to the king. To restore the courage
"of the despairing Gorboduc is now the labour of his counsellors, but the"
later announcement of the death of Ferrex casts him lower than before.
"At this point the Chorus, recalling the murder of a cousin in an earlier"
"generation of the royal race, points, in true Aeschylean fashion, to the"
hatred of an unsated revenge behind this latest blow:
"Thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race,"
"Whose murderous hand, imbru'd with guiltless blood,"
"Asks vengeance still before the heaven's face,"
With endless mischiefs on the cursed brood.
"_Act IV, Scene 1._--Videna alone, in words of passionate vehemence,"
"laments that she has lived so long to see the death of Ferrex, renounces"
"his brother as no child of hers, and concludes with a threat of"
"vengeance. _Scene 2._--Bowed down with remorse, Porrex makes his defence"
"before the king, pleading the latter's own act, in dividing the kingdom,"
as the initial cause of the ensuing disaster. Before he has been long
"gone from his father's presence, Marcella, a lady-in-waiting, rushes"
"into the room, in wild disorder and grief, to report his murder at his"
"mother's hand. In anguished words she tells how, stabbed by Videna in"
"his sleep, he started up and, spying the queen by his side, called to"
"her for help, not crediting that she, his mother, could be his"
"murderess. Again, in tones of solemn warning, the Chorus reminds the"
audience that
"Blood asketh blood, and death must death requite:"
"Jove, by his just and everlasting doom,"
Justly hath ever so requited it.
"_Act V, Scene 1._--This warning is proved true by a report of the death"
of the king and queen at the hands of their subjects in revolt against
It was interesting to follow up the way it had come. The earlier news
"about the Dobuans had been brought by the canoes, which had fetched"
"the sago to Gumasila from the main island. A few days later, a canoe"
"from one of the main island villages had arrived here, and on its"
way had passed the Dobuans in Tewara. The news from the Trobriands
in the North had been brought by the Kuyawa canoe which had arrived a
couple of days before in Nabwageta (and whose visit to Nu'agasi I have
"described in Chapter XI). All these movements were not accidental,"
"but connected with the uvalaku expedition. To show the complexity,"
"as well as the precise timing of the various movements and events,"
"so perfectly synchronised over a vast area, in connection with the"
"uvalaku, I have tabulated them in the Chart, facing this page, in"
"which almost all the dates are quite exact, being based on my own"
"observations. This Chart also gives a clear, synoptic picture of an"
"uvalaku, and it will be useful to refer to it, in reading this Chapter."
"In olden days, not less than now, there must have been an ebullition"
"in the inter-tribal relations, and a great stirring from one place"
"to another, whenever an uvalaku Kula was afoot. Thus, news would"
"be carried rapidly over great distances, the movements of the vast"
"numbers of natives would be co-ordinated, and dates fixed. As has been"
"said already, a culminating event of an expedition, in this case the"
"arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa, would be always so timed"
"as to happen on, or just before, a full moon, and this would serve"
"as a general orientation for the preliminary movements, such as in"
"this case, the visits of the single canoes."

love and was dominated by a passion for this man.
"So that, with no reason whatever in her mind to question the sincerity"
"of Johnson's love for her, it would seem as if nothing were wanting to"
make the Girl perfectly happy; that there could be no room in her heart
"for any feeling other than elation. And yet, curiously enough, the Girl"
could not doze off to sleep. Some mysterious force--a vague foreboding
of something about to happen--impelled her to open her eyes again and
again.
"It was an odd and wholly new sensation, this conjuring up of distressing"
"spectres, for no girl was given less to that sort of thing; all the"
"same, it was with difficulty that she checked an impulse to cry out to"
"her lover--whom she believed to be asleep--and make him dissipate, by"
"renewed assurances, the mysterious barrier which she felt was hemming"
her in.
"As for Johnson, the moment that his head had touched the pillows, he"
"fell to thinking of the awkward situation in which he was placed, the"
"many complications in which his heart had involved him and, finally, he"
found himself wondering whether the woman whom he loved so dearly was
also lying sleepless in her rug on the floor.
And so it was not surprising that he should spring up the moment that he
heard cries from outside.
"""Who's that knockin', I wonder?"""
"Although her voice showed no signs of distress or annoyance, the"
"question coming from her in a calm tone, the Girl was upon her feet"
almost before she knew it. In a trice she removed all evidences that she
"had been lying upon the floor, flinging the pillows and silk coverlet to"
of intrusion by the beasts of the field.

In the typical Indian hut there is no furniture on the ground floor
"other than a rough hewn bench, a few pieces of pottery and gourds, iron"
"cooking vessels and what they call a kitchen, which is in fact a large"
"flat box with raised edges, about eight square feet in surface and about"
as high from the floor as a table. This is filled with sand and slabs of
"stone. In it a little fire is built of wood or charcoal, the stones laid"
about the fire support the pots and pans and cooking goes on as gaily as
"in any modern electric kitchen. The contrivance sounds primitive, but I"
have eaten a number of excellent meals cooked on just such an apparatus.

"Now it will be noticed that in all this habitation, sufficient for the"
"needs of an Indian, there is nothing except the iron pots and possibly"
"some pottery for which money was needed, and there are thousands of"
"families living in just this fashion in Panama today. True, luxury"
approaches in its insidious fashion and here and there you will see a
"$1.25 white iron bed on the main floor, real chairs, canned goods on the"
shelves and--final evidence of Indian prosperity!--a crayon portrait of
"the head of the family and a phonograph, of a make usually discarded at"
home. But when Miguel and Maria start out on the journey of life a
"machete, a gun and the good will of their neighbors who will lend them"
yams until their own planting begins to yield forms a quite sufficient
"capital on which to establish their family. Therefore, why work?"

"ALONE,--another besides himself was in the church,--another, whom it"
was necessary for him to see!
"He could not tell how he first grew to be certain of this,--but he was"
"soon so completely possessed by the idea, that for a moment he dared"
"not raise his eyes, or move! Some invincible force held him there"
"spell-bound, yet trembling in every limb,--and while he thus waited"

"utterance,--wave after wave of richest harmony rolled through the"

"loud, full, and golden-toned chorus!"
"Lifting his head, he stared wonderingly around him; not a living"
creature was visible in all the spacious width and length of the
"cathedral! His lips parted,--he felt as though he could scarcely"
"breathe,--strong shudders ran through him, and he was penetrated by a"
"pleasing terror that was almost a physical pang,--an agonized"
"entrancement, like death or the desire of love! Presently, mastering"
"himself by a determined effort, he advanced steadily with the absorbed"
air of one who is drawn along by magnetic power ... steadily and slowly
"up the nave, ... and as he went, the music surged more tumultuously"
"among the vaulted arches,--there was a faint echo afar off, as of"
tinkling crystal bells; and at each onward step he gained a new access
"of courage, strength, firmness, and untrammelled ease, till every"
"timorous doubt and fear had fled away, and he stood directly in front"
"of the altar railing, gazing at the enshrined Cross, and seeing for the"
moment nothing save that Divine Symbol alone. And still the organ

"earth, and he also knew that they were intended to convey a meaning to"
"him,--but WHAT meaning?"

"So far we have dealt only with the negative results of stories, but"
"there are more important effects, and I am persuaded that if we are"
"careful in our choice of stories, and artistic in our presentation"
"(so that the truth is framed, so to speak, in the memory), we can"
unconsciously correct evil tendencies in children which they only
recognise in themselves when they have already criticised them in
the characters of the story. I have sometimes been misunderstood on
"this point, therefore I should like to make it quite clear. I do"
_not_ mean that stories should take the place entirely of moral or
"direct teaching, but that on many occasions they could supplement"
"and strengthen moral teaching, because the dramatic appeal to the"
imagination is quicker than the moral appeal to the conscience. A child
will often resist the latter lest it should make him uncomfortable
or appeal to his personal sense of responsibility: it is often not in
"his power to resist the former, because it has taken possession of him"
before he is aware of it.
"As a concrete example, I offer three verses from a poem entitled “A"
"Ballad for a Boy,” written some twelve years ago by W. Cory, an Eton"
master. The whole poem is to be found in a book of poems known as
“Ionica” (published by George Allen and Co.).
"The poem describes a fight between two ships, the French ship"
_Téméraire_ and the English ship _Quebec_. The English ship was
"destroyed by fire. Farmer, the captain, was killed, and the officers"
taken prisoners:
"“They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;"
"And as the wounded captives passed, each Breton bowed the head."
"Then spoke the French lieutenant, 'Twas the fire that won, not we:"
elevation of the main figures and intensifying of the catastrophe which
"tragic emotion demands. Unfortunately, from the start the author seems"
to have been obsessed with the notion that the familiar rant of Herod
"was peculiarly suited to his subject. In such a notion there lay, of"
"course, the half-truth that lofty thoughts and impassioned speech are"
"more befitting the sombre muse than the foolish chatter of clowns. But,"
"except where his own deliberately introduced mirth-makers are speaking,"
he will have nothing but pompous rhetoric from the lips of his
characters. His prologue begins his speech with the sounding line:
Who doth desire the trump of fame to sound unto the skies--
Virginius's wife makes her début upon the stage with this encouraging
remark to her companion:
"The pert and prickly prime of youth ought chastisement to have,"
"But thou, dear daughter, needest not, thyself doth show thee grave."
To which Virginia most becomingly answers:
"Refell your mind of mournful plaints, dear mother, rest your mind."
"After this every one feels that the wicked judge, Appius, has done no"
"more than his duty when he exclaims, at his entrance:"
The furrowed face of fortune's force my pinching pain doth move.
Virginius slays his daughter on the stage and serves her head up in a
"charger before Appius, who promptly bursts into a cataclysm of C's ('O"
"curst and cruel cankered churl, O carl unnatural'); but there is not a"
suggestion of the pathos noticed in _Cambyses_. Instead there is in one
"place a sort of frantic agitation, which the author doubtless thought"
varying in strength. Aconitine often contains a considerable proportion
"of aconite and benzaconine, and so varies in activity, which is a great"
objection to the use of one of the most powerful drugs known.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₃₀ to ¹⁄₅ gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₂₀₀ to ¹⁄₁₀₀ gr."
subcutaneously.
"Actions of aconite, its preparations and derivative are anodynes and"
"sedatives, acting specially on the peripheral endings of the sensory"
"nerves, on the heart and on respiration. Aconite kills by respiratory"
arrest.
Its physiological actions as a cardiac and respiratory sedative renders
it a febrifuge; it is also diaphoretic and diuretic. It is prescribed in
"acute febrile conditions, and in the earlier stages of acute local"
inflammation. It is used topically to relieve pain.
"GENERAL ACTIONS.--Locally applied, in virtue of its action on sensory"
"nerves, aconite produces first irritation, tingling and twitching and"
subsequently numbness and anesthesia. The tincture of aconite is
"rapidly absorbed and quickly passed into the tissues, as is shown by"
the blood of a poisoned dog five minutes after the drug has been
"administered, being transferred into the veins of another dog without"
producing the physiological action of the poison.
TOXIC EFFECTS.--One and one-half drachm of the tincture (equal to about
one drachm of aconite root) is given as the minimum fatal dose for the
"horse, one-half drachm will occasionally cause very serious symptoms and"
where an idiosyncrasy exists as little as fifteen minims will cause
toxic symptoms.
"It causes great muscular weakness, dimness of sight; pupil at first may"
and helpful experiment.
To take a concrete example: let us suppose the story of Andersen's Tin
"Soldier told to a child of five or six years. At the first recital, the"
point which will interest the child most will be the setting up of the
"tin soldiers on the table, because he can understand this by means of"
"his own experience, in his own nursery: it is an appeal to conditions"
to which he is accustomed and for which no exercise of the imagination
"is needed, unless we take the effect of memory to be, according to"
"Queyrat, retrospective imagination."
"The next incident that appeals is the unfamiliar behaviour of the toys,"
"but still in familiar surroundings; that is to say, the _unusual_"
activities are carried on in the safe precincts of the nursery--in the
_usual_ atmosphere of the child.
I quote from the text:
"“Late in the evening the other soldiers were put in their box, and the"
people of the house went to bed. Now was the time for the toys to play;
"they amused themselves with paying visits, fighting battles and giving"
"balls. The tin soldiers rustled about in their box, for they wanted to"
"join the games, but they could not get the lid off. The nut-crackers"
"turned somersaults, and the pencil scribbled nonsense on the slate.”"
"Now, from this point onwards in the story, the events will be quite"
"outside the personal experience of the child, and there will have"
to be a real stretch of imagination to appreciate the thrilling and
"blood-curdling adventures of the little tin soldier, namely, the"
"terrible sailing down the gutter under the bridge, the meeting with"
"the fierce rat who demands the soldier's passport, the horrible"
"sensation in the fish's body, etc. Last of all, perhaps, will come"
fewer than twelve Mrs. Teach still alive at different ports up and down
the West India Islands.
"In June, 1718, the bridegroom felt that the call of duty must be obeyed,"
"so kissing good-bye to the new Mrs. Teach, he sailed away to the Bermudas,"
"meeting on his way half a dozen ships, which he plundered, and then"
hurried back to share the spoils with the Governor of North Carolina and
"his secretary, Mr. Knight."
"For several months, Blackbeard remained in the river, exacting a toll from"
"all the shipping, often going ashore to make merry at the expense of the"
"planters. At length, things became so unbearable that the citizens and"
planters sent a request to the Governor of the neighbouring colony of
"Virginia for help to rid them of the presence of Teach. The Governor,"
"Spotswood, an energetic man, at once made plans for taking the pirate, and"
"commissioned a gallant young naval officer, Lieutenant Robert Maynard, of"
"H.M.S. _Pearl_, to go in a sloop, the _Ranger_, in search of him. On"
"November 17, 1718, the lieutenant sailed for Kicquetan in the James River,"
"and on the 21st arrived at the mouth of Okerecock Inlet, where he"
discovered the pirate he was in search of. Blackbeard would have been
"caught unprepared had not his friend, Mr. Secretary Knight, hearing what"
"was on foot, sent a letter warning him to be on his guard, and also any of"
Teach's crew whom he could find in the taverns of Bath Town. Maynard lost
"no time in attacking the pirate's ship, which had run aground. The fight"
"was furious, Teach boarding the sloop and a terrific hand-to-hand struggle"
"taking place, the lieutenant and Teach fighting with swords and pistols."
"Teach was wounded in twenty-five places before he fell dead, while the"
lieutenant escaped with nothing worse than a cut over the fingers.
"Maynard now returned in triumph in his sloop to Bath Town, with the head"
"of Blackbeard hung up to the bolt-spit end, and received a tremendous"
ovation from the inhabitants.
In physiognomy the San Blas Indians are heavy of feature and stocky of
"frame. Their color is dark olive, with no trace of the negro apparent,"
for it has been their unceasing study for centuries to retain their
"racial purity. Their features are regular and pleasing and, among the"
"children particularly, a high order of beauty is often found. To get a"
"glimpse of their women is almost impossible, and a photograph of one is"
"practically unknown. If overtaken on the water, to which they often"
"resort in their cayucas, the women will wrap their clothing about their"
"faces, rather heedless of what other portions of their bodies may be"
"exposed, and make all speed for the shore. These women paint their faces"
"in glaring colors, wear nose rings, and always blacken their teeth on"
being married. Among them more pains is taken with clothing than among
"most of the savage Indians, many of their garments being made of a sort"
"of appliqué work in gaudy colors, with figures, often in representation"
"of the human form, cut out and inset in the garment."
So determined are the men of this tribe to maintain its blood
"untarnished by any admixture whatsoever, that they long made it an"
invariable rule to expel every white man from their territory at
nightfall. Of late years there has been a very slight relaxation of this
severity. Dr. Henri Pittier of the United States Department of
"Agriculture, one of the best-equipped scientific explorers in the"
"tropics, several of whose photographs elucidate this volume, has lived"
much among the San Blas and the Cuna-Cuna Indians and won their
friendship.

Hæmothorax. Case No. 151]
"(151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from"
"100 to 200 yards. _Entry_, 1 inch from the left axillary margin"
"in the first intercostal space; _exit_, at the back of the"
right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleuræ were
"therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,"
"then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into"
"the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs"
"of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right"
"side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The"
temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the
"right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the"
emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve
"symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,"
and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood
"was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last"
pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the
"third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition"
"also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,"
"reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an"
"inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was"
eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The
"amount of hæmoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case"
"was possibly one of pulmonary hæmothorax, as after death no"
source of hæmorrhage could be localised in the intercostal
"space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a"
part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an
"inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the"
"organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original"
Presently the seaplanes ceased firing and circled triumphantly over
"their vanquished foe. They knew that the Zeppelin was doomed, and"
instincts of humanity forbade them to take undue advantage of the
plight of her crew.
"""Away, boats!"" ordered the ""Sunderland's"" captain."
Instantly there was a rush to man the boats and to stand by the
"falls. With an alacrity that was part of his nature, Jack Tar"
"prepared to rescue his enemy, in spite of the fact that that enemy"
had sallied forth with the deliberate intention of hurling bombs with
"the utmost indiscrimination upon combatants and non-combatants alike,"
not excepting helpless women and children.
"Before the boats could be lowered a lurid blaze of light rolled out,"
rivalling the rays of the rising sun. Where the Zeppelin had been
"only a cloud of flame-tinged smoke remained, while from the"
mushroomed pall of vapour that marked a funereal pyre of yet another
"unit of the Kaiser's air-fleet, scorched and twisted girders and"
other débris streamed seawards.
Whether by accident or design the only remaining petrol tank had
"exploded, and the flames instantly igniting the huge volume of"
hydrogen had in the twinkling of an eye completed the work of
destruction.
For ten minutes the destroyers cruised over the spot where the
"débris had disappeared, but there were no signs of survivors, not"
even of wreckage. The remains of the Zeppelin had been swallowed up
"by the insatiable sea, and no visible trophy remained in the hands of"
the men who had baulked an attempted raid on the largest city of the
"BRACHIOPODS. These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and"
"two interior armlike processes which served for breathing,"
"appeared in the Algonkian, and had now become very abundant. The"
"two valves of the brachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in"
each valve a line drawn from the beak to the base divides the
valve into two equal parts. It may thus be told from the pelecypod
"mollusk, such as the clam, whose two valves are not far from equal"
"in size, each being divided into unequal parts by a line dropped"
from the beak.
Brachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that
of the INARTICULATE brachiopods--the two valves are held together
"only by muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is"
"composed of phosphate of lime. The DISCINA, which began in the"
"Algonkian, is of this type, as is also the LINGULELLA of the"
Cambrian. Both of these genera have lived on during the millions
"of years of geological time since their introduction, handing down"
from generation to generation with hardly any change to their
descendants now living off our shores the characters impressed
upon them at the beginning.
The more highly organized ARTICULATE brachiopods have valves of
carbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and
"sockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,"
though the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.
MOLLUSKS. The three chief classes of mollusks--the PELECYPODS
"(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the GASTROPODS"
"(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the"
"CEPHALOPODS (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were"
"all represented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly."
"Recognizing in the officers' quarry the supposed figure of Emerson, the"
"hated cause of all this strife, the strikers gave vent to a great shout"
"of rage and triumph, and surged forward across the wide street,"
carrying the police before them with irresistible force.
In a moment it became not a question of keeping the entrance to the
"wharf, but of protecting the life of the prisoner, and the policemen"
"rallied with their backs to the wall, their clubs working havoc with"
the heads that came within striking distance.
"Scarcely had Boyd reached Big George, when a wing of the besieging army"
swept in through the unguarded entrance and down the dock like an
"avalanche, leaving behind them the battling officers and the hungry"
pack clamoring for the prisoner.
"""Drop that freight, and get aboard the best way you can!"" Boyd yelled"
"at the fishermen, and with a bound was out into the open crying to"
Captain Peasley on the bridge:
"""Here they come! Cast off, for God's sake!"""
Instantly a wild cry of rage and defiance rose from the clotted rigging
"and upper works of _The Bedford Castle_. Down the fishermen swarmed,"
"ready to over-flow the sides of the ship, but, with a sharp order to"
"George, Boyd ran up the gang-plank and rushed along the rail to a"
"commanding position in the path of his men, where, drawing his"
"revolver, he roared at them to keep back, threatening the first to go"
"ashore. His lungs were bursting from his sprint, and it was with"
difficulty that his voice rose above the turmoil; but he presented such
"a figure of determination that the men paused, and then the steamship"
"whistle interrupted opportunely, with a deafening blast."
primitive symbolic tendency to objectify the subjective. Men have taken
"out of their own hearts their best feelings and their worst feelings,"
"and have personalised and dramatised them, bowed down to them or stamped"
"on them, unable to hear the voice with which each of their images spoke:"
"'I am thyself.' Our conceptions of religion, of morals, of many of the"
"mightiest phenomena of life, especially the more exceptional phenomena,"
"have grown up under this influence, which still serves to support many"
movements of to-day by some people imagined to be modern.
"Dreaming, as we have seen, is not the sole source of such conceptions."
"But they could scarcely have been found convincing, and possibly could"
"not even have arisen, among races which were wholly devoid of dream"
"experiences. A large part of all progress in psychological knowledge,"
"and, indeed, a large part of civilisation itself, lies in realising that"
"the apparently objective is really subjective, that the angels and demons"
and geniuses of all sorts that once seemed to be external forces taking
possession of feeble and vacant individualities are themselves but modes
of action of marvellously rich and varied personalities. In our dreams we
"are brought back into the magic circle of early culture, and we shrink and"
shudder in the presence of imaginative phantoms that are built up of our
"own thoughts and emotions, and are really our own flesh."

with a letter to the Governor demanding that he should instantly send off

threatening to send their heads to Government House; many of these
prisoners being the chief persons of the colony.

"saying, ""God has given it to me, let him touch it who dares!"""

"That men who, like Charlemagne and Napoleon, had reached the highest"
"pinnacle of human power, should seek to enhance their influence by"
"crowning their heads with one of the nails which, as their followers"
"believed, had pierced the Galilean's foot, is a richly suggestive fact."
But we must keep our tempted thoughts to another and less edifying line
at present.
When we had examined all the parts of the famous crown to our
"satisfaction, we stepped to the desk in the ante-room and paid our five"
"francs (one dollar), the regular price for the exhibition of the Iron"
"Crown, then left the cathedral, bought one or two post-card pictures of"
"the crown, and took the tram through the dreary weather back to Milan,"
well pleased with the results of our first pilgrimage to the shrine of
a real Roman Catholic relic in Italy.
[Sidenote: Rome Caps the Climax.]
"But on our arrival at Rome, a month later, we found that, interesting"
"as were the relics which we had seen or read of elsewhere, they were"
"nothing to those in the Eternal City itself. In this, as in everything"
else except such little matters as cleanliness and morality and
"truthfulness and honesty, Rome outvies all her rivals. It is only fair"
"to add, however, that, since the overthrow of the papal sovereignty and"
"the establishment of a capable government, Rome has improved immensely"
"in the matter of cleanliness, and even her immorality is not so"
"flaunting as it was. This is attested by the Hon. Guiseppe Zanardelli,"
"between 'our apprehension' and 'the perception-of-matter,' the latter"
"being one fact and indivisible, and on no account to be taken as two"
"separate facts or thoughts. The whole point is, that by no possible"
means can the perception-of-matter be divided into two facts or
"existences, as was done by psychology. And Ferrier goes on to point out"
"that this is not a subjective idealism, it is not a condition of the"
"human soul alone, but it 'dwells apart, a mighty and independent"
"system, a city fitted up and upheld by the living God.' And in"
"authenticating this last belief Ferrier calls in internal convictions,"
"'common-sense,' to assist the evidence of speculative reason, where,"
"had he followed more upon the lines of the great German Idealists, he"
might have done without it.
"Now, Ferrier continues, we are safe against the cavils of scepticism;"
the metaphysical theory of perception steers clear of all the
perplexities of representationalism; for it gives us in perception one
"only object, the perception of matter; the objectivity of this _datum_"
keeps us clear from subjective idealism.
"From the perception of matter, a fact in which man merely participates,"
"Ferrier infers a Divine mind, of which perceptions are the property:"
they are states of the everlasting intellect. The exercise of the
senses is the condition upon which we are permitted to apprehend or
"participate in the objective perception of material things. This,"
"shortly, is the position from which he starts."
CHAPTER IV
'FIERCE WARRES AND FAITHFUL LOVES'
"Rupert Greppel, strutting with hidalgic air, was concerned in bringing"
about several affairs. No one was hurt. There was much braying of asses.
"The Lord Montagu Askew, dainty, foppish, in the mode, and the"
"Honourable Rupert Greppel, hidalgic, head in air, stood before a shop"
window in the Rue de la Paix and gazed at their splendid reflections;
whilst past them moved on the pavement or whirled by in barouches
"the great world of Paris--_hig-lif_ sunning its butterfly wings,"
"honey-questing, sipping at any dew that the gods left lying abroad."
"Montagu Askew held his jade-handled cane mincingly, and he glowed with"
"a gentleman-like glow, for his dove-coloured little book of poems"
tinted all the bookstalls.
More than one woman of high rank this morning had stopped her carriage
to congratulate him on the exquisite lyric wherein the vast firmament
"at break of dawn was likened to the grey of a woman’s glove--indeed, it"
became the vogue of the drawing-rooms--people sang it.
"As a fact, Montagu Askew was acknowledged lord of chamber music."
"Indeed, in his slender careful verse was no rude hint of the"
full-blooded Rabelaisian love of life; it was innocent of the
suggestion of a large emotion; he played upon the accepted measures and
the well-authenticated rhyme; he startled with no surprises; he sounded
no new note--Montagu never forgot he was a gentleman. Not for him the
uncouthness to fling open loud-clanging gates to a new world. He was
"pretty and serenely mannered before everything, disdainful of them that"
"skipped a foot to the hot jigging blood, or such as showed a strong"
disdain; nor was he wanting in contempt for the natural emotions.
"When he condescended to so low an act as to seek nature, he walked"
"through the well-groomed spaces of the world, well-trimmed parks at the"
"Scott writes of him: 'Honest old Mr. Ferrier is dead, at extreme old"
age. I confess I should not like to live so long. He was a man with
"strong passions and strong prejudices, but with generous and manly"
"sentiments at the same time.' James Ferrier's wife, Miss Coutts, was"
"remarkable for her beauty: a large family was born to her, the eldest"
"son of whom was James Frederick Ferrier's father. Young Ferrier, the"
"subject of this sketch, used frequently to dine with his grandfather at"
"his house in Morningside, where Susan Ferrier acted in the capacity of"
hostess; and it is easy to imagine the bright talk which would take
"place on these occasions, and the impression which must have been made"
"upon the lad, both then and after he attained to manhood; for Miss"
"Ferrier survived until 1854. In later life, indeed, her wit was said to"
"be somewhat caustic, and she was possibly dreaded by her younger"
"friends and relatives as much as she was respected; but this, to do her"
"justice, was partly owing to infirmities. She was at anyrate keenly"
"interested in the fortunes of her nephew, to whom she was in the habit"
"of alluding as 'the last of the metaphysicians'--scarcely, perhaps, a"
"very happy title for one who was somewhat of an iconoclast, and began a"
new era rather than concluded an old.
"[1] In a _Life of Susan Ferrier_, lately published, an"
account of the family is given which was written by Miss
"Ferrier, for her nephew, the subject of our memoir."
"James Frederick Ferrier's mother, Margaret Wilson, was a sister of"
"Professor John Wilson--the 'Christopher North' of immortal memory,"
whose daughter he was afterwards to marry. Margaret Ferrier was a woman
of striking personal beauty. Her features were perfect in their
"symmetry, as is shown in a lovely miniature, painted by Saunders, a"
"well-known miniature painter of the day, now in the possession of"
"Professor Ferrier's son, her grandson. Many of these personal charms"
"descended to James Ferrier, whose well-cut features bore considerable"
of the lighthouses which serve its own great fleet and the ships of all
the world. It has dredged new channels and marked them with buoys. It
has installed along the Central and South American coasts a wireless
telegraph service of the highest power and efficiency. It has
"constructed hundreds of miles of public roads, maintains public schools,"
and in other ways renders at its own expense the services which are
presumed to fall on governments. The American financiers associated with
it are now pushing to completion the Pan-American railroad which soon
"will connect New York with Panama by an all-rail route, and thus realize"
what once was esteemed an impractical dream.
But it is the United Fruit Company’s activities in Panama only that are
pertinent to this book. They demonstrate strikingly how readily one
natural opportunity afforded by this land responded to the call of
"systematic effort, and there are a dozen products beside the banana"
which might thus be exploited.
[Illustration: A PILE OF REJECTED BANANAS
The fruit is thrown out by the company’s inspectors for scarcely visible
flaws]
"On the Atlantic coast, only a night’s sail from Colon, is the port of"
"Bocas del Toro (The Mouths of the Bull), a town of about 9000"
"inhabitants, built and largely maintained by the banana trade. Here is"
"the largest and most beautiful natural harbor in the American tropics,"
and here some day will be established a winter resort to which will
flock people from all parts of the world. Almirante Bay and the Chiriqui

"scholarly, the ultra-refined, may live well and uprightly by their"
"'moral sense,'--if they so choose, provided they have some great ideal"
"to measure themselves by,--but even these, without faith in God, may"
"sometimes slip, and fall into deeper depths of ruin than they dreamed"
"of, when self-centred on those heights of virtue where they fancied"
"themselves exempt from danger."""
"He paused,--there was a curious stillness in the room,--many eyes were"
"lowered, and M. le Duc's composure was evidently not quite so absolute"
as usual.
"""Taken at its best""--he continued--""the world alone is certainly not"
worth fighting for;--we see the fact exemplified every day in the cases
"of those who, surrounded by all that a fair fortune can bestow upon"
"them, deliberately hurl themselves out of existence by their own free"
"will and act,--indeed, suicide is a very general accompaniment of"
"Agnosticism. And self-slaughter, though it may be called madness, is"
"far more often the result of intellectual misery."""
"""Of course, too much learning breeds brain disease""--remarked Dr."
"Mudley sententiously--""but only in weak subjects,--and in my opinion"
"the weak are better out of the world. We've no room for them nowadays."""
"""You say truly, sir,""--replied Alwyn--""we have no room for them, and no"
"patience! They show themselves feeble, and forthwith the strong oppress"
"them;--they can hope for little comfort here, and less help. It is"
"well, therefore, that some of these 'weak' should still believe in God,"
since they can certainly pin no faith on the justice of their
fellow-man! But I cannot agree with you that much learning breeds brain
disease. Provided the learning be accompanied by a belief in the
"Supreme Wisdom,--provided every step of study be taken upward toward"
populating the hospitals. It became necessary to guard all property in
"the warehouse districts, and men ceased to venture there alone after"
dark.
One circumstance caused Boyd no little surprise and uneasiness--the
fact that no vigorous effort had been made to fix the blame for the
"striker's death on that riotous afternoon. Surely, he reasoned, Marsh's"
"detective must have witnessed the killing, and must recognize the ease"
with which the act could now be saddled upon him. If delay were their
"object, Emerson could not understand why they did not seek to have him"
arrested. The consequences might well be serious if Marsh's money were
"used; but, as the days slipped past and nothing occurred, he decided"
"that he had been overfearful on this score, or else that the manager of"
the Packers' Trust had limits beyond which he would not push his
persecution.
"A half-mile from Captain Peasley's ship, the rival Company tenders were"
"loading rapidly with union labor, and it seemed that in spite of Boyd's"
"plan to be first at Kalvik, Marsh's force would beat him to the ground"
unless greater efforts were made. When he communicated these fears to
"Big George, the fisherman suddenly became a slave-driver. He passed"
"among his men, cajoling, threatening, bribing, and they began to work"
"like demons, with the result that when the twentieth arrived he was"
able to announce to his partner that the work would be finished some
time during the following morning.
The next day Emerson and Clyde drove down to the dock with Cherry in a
"closed carriage, experiencing no annoyance beyond some jeers and"
insults as they passed through the picket line. Boyd had barely seen
"them comfortably established on board, when up the ship's gangway came"
"""Fingerless"" Fraser radiantly attired, three heavily laden hotel"
"porters groaning at his back, the customary thick-waisted cigar between"
"Occasionally, their dancing is really remarkably interesting, when a"
large amount of pantomime enters into it and they develop the story of
"some primitive action, as, for instance, the drawing of the water,"
"cutting the wood, making the fire, cooking the food, etc., ending in a"
burst of song symbolizing the joys of the new prepared feast. In an
extremely crude form it reminds one of the old opera ballets and seems
"to be a composite of the original African and the ancient Spanish, which"
is very probably the case.
[Illustration: THE CHURCH AT ANCON]
“The Orientals of the Isthmus deserve a word in passing. They are
chiefly Chinese coolies and form a large part of the small merchant
"class. Others, in the hill districts, cultivate large truck gardens,"
bringing their produce swinging over the shoulders on poles to the city
"markets. Their houses and grounds are very attractive, built of reed or"
"bamboo in the eastern fashion and marked everywhere by extreme neatness,"
contrasting so strikingly with the homes and surroundings of their negro
"neighbors. Many cultivate fields of cane or rice as well, and amidst the"
"silvery greens, stretching for some distance, the quaint blue figures of"
the workmen in their huge hats make a charming picture. Through the
rubber sections Chinese ‘middlemen’ are of late frequently found buying
"that valuable commodity for their fellow countrymen in Panama City, who"
are now doing quite a large business in rubber. These people live much
"as in their native land, seldom learning more than a few words of"
"Spanish (except those living in the towns), and they form a very"
substantial and good element of the population”.
[Illustration: THE PEARL ISLAND VILLAGE OF SABOGA]
To enumerate even by names the aboriginal tribes would be tedious and
"unavailing. Among the more notable are the Doracho-Changuina, of"
"My arrival was a very untoward event to the natives, and complicated"
"matters, causing great annoyance to Tovasana, the main headman. I had"
"landed in his own little village, Nu'agasi, on the island of Gumasila,"
"for it was impossible to anchor near the big village, nor would there"
"have been room for pitching a tent. Now, in the Amphletts, a white"
"man is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and to my knowledge, only once"
"before, a white trader remained there for a few weeks. To leave me"
"alone with the women and one or two old men was impossible, according"
"to their ideas and fears, and none of the younger men wanted to forgo"
"the privilege and pleasure of taking part in the expedition. At last,"
"I promised them to move to the neighbouring island of Nabwageta,"
"as soon as the men were gone, and with this they were satisfied."
"As the date fixed for the arrival of the Dobuans approached, the"
"excitement grew. Little by little the news arrived, and was eagerly"
"received and conveyed to me: ""Some sixty canoes of the Dobuans are"
"coming,"" ""the fleet is anchored off Tewara,"" ""each canoe is heavily"
"laden with food and gifts,"" ""Kauyaporu sails in his canoe, he is"
"toli'uvalaku, and has a big pandanus streamer attached to the prow."" A"
"string of other names followed which had very little meaning for me,"
since I was not acquainted with the Dobuan natives. From another part
"of the world, from the Trobriands, the goal of the whole expedition,"
"news reached us again: ""To'uluwa, the chief of Kiriwina has gone"
"to Kitava--he will soon come back, bringing plenty of mwali."" ""The"
"Sinaketans are going there to fetch some of the mwali."" ""The Vakutans"
"have been in Kitava and brought back great numbers of mwali."" It"
"was astonishing to hear all this news, arriving at a small island,"
"apparently completely isolated with its tiny population, within"
"these savage and little navigated seas; news only a few days old,"
yet reporting events which had occurred at a travelling distance of
some hundred miles.
"fashionable world was well aware, because the young duchess is a great"
"lady in London as well as elsewhere, and all her doings are chronicled"
in advance. The fashionable world had promptly decided to dine there
"too, and telephoned in breathless haste for tables. It filled the"
"restaurant at an unusually early hour, and a disappointed overflow"
displayed itself in the _foyer_.
The Duchess of Dawn is one of the most beautiful women in England. The
"eyes of the fashionable world were focussed on her and her guests, among"
whom were a minor European prince and a famous field-marshal who had not
"been on show in London for long, until there appeared from the crowded"
"_foyer_, upon the arm of an old-young man of distinguished appearance"
"and faultless _tenue_, a tall, slender girl, at whom, as she passed,"
"every one turned to gaze, with undisguised admiration or envy, according"
to sex and temperament.
"She was gowned to distraction, and by an artist in women's wear. Her"
beautiful bare arms and shoulders and bosom were free of superfluous
"ornament. Her pure, proud, sensitive features were faintly flushed,--as"
"though, if that were conceivable, she was wearing evening dress for the"
"first time, and found it trying,--but her curved crimson lips were"
"slightly parted in a most bewitching smile, and, from under their"
"drooping lashes, her radiant eyes looked a demure, amused, impersonal"
defiance at the frankly curious faces upturned toward her. The shaded
"lights made most enchanting lights and shadows among her hair, red-gold"
"and heaped about her head in heavy coils, as she moved modestly through"
"the thronged room toward a corner where, about a beautifully decorated"
"table, four motionless waiters were standing guard over four empty"
chairs.
"She sat down there, her back to the bulk of the company, and her escort"
"took the seat opposite. A portly, prosperous-looking, elderly man, with"
"western door. That stood open,--the bell had long ago ceased,--Mass was"
"over,--and all was profoundly still."
"Out of the warm sunlit air he stepped into the vast, cool,"
"clear-obscure, white glory of the stately shrine,--with bared head and"
"noiseless, reverent feet, he advanced a little way up the nave, and"
"then stood motionless, every artistic perception in him satisfied,"
"soothed, and entranced anew, as in his student-days, by the tranquil"
grandeur of the scene. What majestic silence! What hallowed peace! How
jewel-like the radiance of the sun pouring through the rich stained
"glass on those superb carved pillars, that, like petrified stems of"
"forest-trees, bear lightly up the lofty, vaulted roof to that vast"
height suggestive of a white sky rather than stone!
"Moving on slowly further toward the altar, he was suddenly seized by an"
"overpowering impression,--a memory that rushed upon him with a sort of"
"shock, albeit it was only the memory of a tune!--a wild melody,"
"haunting and passionate, rang in his eras,--the melody that Sarasate,"
"the Orpheus of Spain, had evoked from the heart of his speaking"
"violin,--the sobbing love-lament of the ""Zigeunerweisen""--the weird"
minor-music that had so forcibly suggested--What? THIS VERY
"PLACE!--these snowy columns,--this sculptured sanctity--this flashing"
"light of rose and blue and amber,--this wondrous hush of consecrated"
calm! What next? Dear God! Sweet Christ! what next? The face of
Edris?--Would that heavenly countenance shine suddenly though those
rainbow-colored beams that struck slantwise down toward him?--and
should he presently hear her dulcet voice charming the silence into
deeper ecstasy?
"Overcome by a sensation that was something like fear, he stopped"
"abruptly, and leaning against one of the quaint old oaken benches,"
"strove to control the quick, excited throbbing of his heart,--then"
policy which opposed the rival house of Saxony. The Pope granted the
"dispensation in return for a great sum of money, but to facilitate its"
payment he accorded to the archbishop a liberal indulgence for the whole
"archbishopric of Mayence, Magdeburg and the Brandenburg territories."
"Albert, to whom half the proceeds were tacitly left, raised a loan with"
"the house of Fugger, and this charged itself with the indulgence"
traffic.
"When in December 1517, Erasmus answered the archbishop, Luther's"
"propositions against indulgences, provoked by the Archbishop of"
"Mayence's instructions regarding their colportage, had already been"
"posted up (31 October 1517), and were circulated throughout Germany,"
rousing the whole Church. They were levelled at the same abuses which
"Erasmus combated, the mechanical, atomistical, and juridical conception"
"of religion. But how different was their practical effect, as compared"
with Erasmus's pacific endeavour to purify the Church by lenient means!
'Lives of saints?' Erasmus asked replying to the archbishop. 'I have
tried in my poor way to add a little light to the prince of saints
"himself. For the rest, your endeavour, in addition to so many difficult"
"matters of government, and at such an early age, to get the lives of the"
"saints purged of old women's tales and disgusting style, is extremely"
laudable. For nothing should be suffered in the Church that is not
"perfectly pure or refined,' And he concludes with a magnificent eulogy"
of the excellent prelate.
"During the greater part of 1518, Erasmus was too much occupied by his"
"own affairs--the journey to Basle and his red-hot labours there, and"
afterwards his serious illness--to concern himself much with Luther's
"business. In March he sends Luther's theses to More, without comment,"
"and, in passing, complains to Colet about the impudence with which Rome"
"disseminates indulgences. Luther, now declared a heretic and summoned to"
"witty and sparkling dramas, and disputed as to whether the ""Old"
"Bachelor"" or the ""Way of the World"" were his happiest effort; whilst"
"some declared that the ""Double Dealer"" was the best of all.  They talked"
"excitedly of the revival at Drury Lane of Farquhar’s ""Love and a"
"Bottle,"" which had scored such a success some fourteen or fifteen years"
previously.  And there were some who lauded and some who depreciated
"Colley Cibber and his ""Careless Husband"" and ""Love’s Last Shift,"" which"
were favourites throughout the town.
"It was a new world to Grey; but he listened with a certain fascination,"
"for the drama had always attracted him, and he watched the gestures of"
the actors and listened to their mouthing periods with something between
wonder and amusement.  He could understand that these men had been
"failures. Only Lionel Field appeared to have any true histrionic gift,"
and the cause of his downfall was plain to be read after the speech of
"the ""Old Lion.""  From time to time, as the light flickered upon the"
"striking face in the ingle, Grey caught a fine-lipped smile upon it, and"
once or twice he thought the old actor’s eyes met his in a gleam of
humour.  But of that he could not be sure—it might be but the trick of
"the firelight; and presently wearied nature asserted itself, and the"
"young man passed from drowsiness to actual sleep, and knew nothing more"
till a sharp grip upon his arm roused him to a sense of his
surroundings.
"It was the tapster who thus shook him; and when he opened his eyes, Grey"
"saw—or thought, at least—that the room was empty.  What the time was he"
"had no idea; but it must be late, and he rose hastily to his feet with a"
muttered apology at having overstayed the closing time.
At that moment there emerged out of the shadows of the ingle-nook a bent
"figure, dignified even in its infirmity, and the voice which Grey had"
heard before spoke in quietly authoritative accents.

semi-fraudulent war charities which had alluring titles.
"But if, from paying handsomely to all these praise-worthy endeavours"
"to mitigate the horrors of war, she proceeded to render personal"
"service, she became the despair of the paid organizers and"
business-like workers. She couldn't add and she couldn't subtract or
divide with any certainty of a correct result; she couldn't spell
the more difficult words or remember the right letters to put after
distinguished persons' names when she addressed envelopes in her
"large, childish handwriting; she couldn't be trusted to make"
enquiries or to detect fraudulent appeals. She lost receipts and
never grasped the importance of vouchers; she forgot to fill up
"counterfoils, or if reminded filled them up ""from memory"" so that"
"they didn't tally; she signed her name, if there was any choice of"
"blank spaces, in quite the wrong place."
"So, invariably, tactful secretaries or assistant secretaries were"
"told off to explain to her--ever so nicely--that ""she was no"
"business woman"" (this, to the daughter of wholesale manufacturers,"
"sounded rather flattering), and that though she was invaluable as a"
"""name,"" as a patroness, or one of eighteen Vice Presidents, she was"
of no use whatever as a worker.
She had no country house to place at the disposal of the Government
as a convalescent home. Michael after a few experiments forbade her
offering any hospitality at No. 1 Park Crescent to invalid officers.
Such as were entrusted to her in the spring of 1915 soon found that
"she was--as they phrased it--""a pompous little, middle-class fool,"""
wielding no authority. They larked in the laboratory with Red Cross
"nurses, broke specimens, and did very unkind and noisy things ..."
"besides smoking in both the large _and_ the small dining-rooms. So,"
LAST CHANCES.
At an early hour on Sunday all Kirton seemed astir. The streets were
"alive with thronging people, with banners, with inchoate and still"
"amorphous processions, with vendors of meat, drink, and newspapers."
"According to the official arrangements, the proceedings were not to"
"begin till one o'clock, and, in theory, the forenoon hours were left"
"undisturbed; but, what with the people who were taking part in the"
"demonstration, and those who were going to look on, and those who hoped"
"to suck some profit to themselves out of the day's work, the ordinary"
"duties and observances of a Sunday were largely neglected, and Mr."
"Puttock, passing on his way to chapel at the head of his family, did not"
lack material for reprobation in the temporary superseding of religious
obligations.
"The Governor and his family drove to the Cathedral, according to their"
"custom, Eleanor Scaife having pleaded in vain for leave to walk about"
"the streets instead. Lady Eynesford declined to recognise the occasion,"
and Eleanor had to content herself with stealthy glances to right and
left till the church doors engulfed her. The only absentee was Alicia
"Derosne, and she was not walking about the streets, but sitting under"
"the verandah, with a book unopened on her knees, and her eyes set in"
empty fixedness on the horizon. The luxuriant growth of a southern
"summer filled her nostrils with sweet scents, and the wind, blowing off"
"the sea, tempered the heat to a fresh and balmy warmth; the waves"
"sparkled in the sun, and the world was loud in boast of its own beauty;"
"but poor Alicia, like many a maid before, was wondering how long this"
"wretched life was to last, and how any one was ever happy. Faith bruised"
and trust misplaced blotted out for her the joy of living and the
"exultation of youth. If these things were true, why did the sun shine,"
"and how could the world be merry? If these things were true, for her the"
Osiris were either immediately identified or else were identical from the
beginning. The divinity whose worship was started at Alexandria by Ptolemy
was the god that ruled the dead and shared his immortality with them. He
"was fundamentally an Egyptian god, and the most popular of the deities of"
the Nile. Herodotus says that Isis and Osiris were revered by every
"inhabitant of the country, and their traditional holidays involved secret"
ceremonies whose sacred meaning the Greek writer dared not reveal.[2]
"Recognizing their Osiris in Serapis, the Egyptians readily accepted the new"
cult. There was a tradition that a new dynasty should introduce a new god
or give a sort of preeminence to the god of its own district. From time
immemorial politics had changed the {75} government of heaven when changing
that of earth. Under the Ptolemies the Serapis of Alexandria naturally
"became one of the principal divinities of the country, just as the Ammon of"
Thebes had been the chief of the celestial hierarchy under the Pharaohs of
"that city, or as, under the sovereigns from Sais, the local Neith had the"
primacy. At the time of the Antonines there were forty-two Serapeums in
Egypt.[3]
But the purpose of the Ptolemies was not to add one more Egyptian god to
the countless number already worshiped by their subjects. They wanted this
"god to unite in one common worship the two races inhabiting the kingdom,"
and thus to further a complete fusion. The Greeks were obliged to worship
him side by side with the natives. It was a clever political idea to
institute a Hellenized Egyptian religion at Alexandria. A tradition
"mentioned by Plutarch[4] has it that Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, a"
"man of advanced ideas, together with Timotheus, a Eumolpid from Eleusis,"
thought out the character that would best suit the newcomer. The result was
that the composite religion founded by the Lagides became a combination of
the old creed of the Pharaohs and the Greek mysteries.
"First of all, the liturgic language was no longer the native idiom but"
"stern islanders. In his charming romance, ""Colomba,"" M. Prosper"
"Mérimée has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as"
"preoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his"
"dwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for"
"attack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in"
"the streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the"
"household, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and"
"watched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in"
"silence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first"
warning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded
the word.
"In such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where"
"woman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the"
"typical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,"
"brave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for"
the glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon
was to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena
a chaotic France and a distracted Europe.
Amidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates
and lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical
"importance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the"
"oft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa."
"As became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the"
Buonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a
"document of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jérome, ""Egregius"
"Hieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium."" These distinctions"
they seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the
"Corsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as"
"in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,"
"less our own, sometimes rest upon a merest chance--dropped in for supper"
at a fashionable place patronized by those who wish to see the brightest
"of Havana life. There were other places, of course, that might have"
"offered quite as much, but this one happened to be on the route we had"
taken.
"Midnight passed, but still we lingered, seated on the latticed balcony"
that encircles an inner court where cabaret features are
"held--suggestive of a bull ring. One rather piquant Spanish girl,"
"playing her accompaniment on a guitar, gazed softly up at Tommy while"
"singing about some wonderful Nirvana, an enchanted island that floated"
"in a sea of love. It was a pretty song, even if more intense than"
"temperate, and pleased with it he tossed her a coin; whereupon she"
"tilted her chin and raised a shoulder, asking in the universal language"
of cabarets if she should not come up and drink a health with the
"_imperioso Señor_. But he, whose heart was beating against a twenty-page"
"letter from a nymph in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, laughed a"
"negative, this time throwing her a flower that she kissed lightly and"
put in her hair.
"We had supped well, the mandolins were now tinkling, incessantly, and"
"this, mingled with the silvery tones of glasses touched in eager"
"pledges, created an ensemble of sounds dear to the heart of every true"
Bohemian. Effects were good here. The ceilings and walls of our balcony
were lighted by vari-colored electric bulbs artfully placed amidst
"growing vines that drooped in festoons above the tables, producing a"
"fairy-like enchantment. And, indeed, the café proved to be a mart not"
"only of enchantments but entertainments, including a popular gambling"
salon.
"At last, in desperation seeing that Monsieur refused to be cheered,"
"Tommy sprang up, saying:"
of their original structure and mineral composition remains to
tell whether the rocks from which they were derived were
"sedimentary or igneous, or to what variety of either of these"
classes they belonged.
"In many cases, however, the early history of a metamorphic rock"
can be deciphered. Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it
"originally water-laid. Schists may contain rolled-out pebbles,"
showing their derivation from a conglomerate. Dikes of igneous
rocks may be followed into a region where they have been foliated
by pressure. The most thoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes
"be traced out into unaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks, or"
among them may be found patches of little change where their
history maybe read.
Metamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological
"ages, and most rare among rocks of recent formation. No doubt it"
is now in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded
by heat either from intrusive igneous masses or from the earth's
"interior, or are suffering slow deformation under the thrust of"
mountain-making forces.
Suggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be
exposed to view. Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface
to-day?
MINERAL VEINS
In regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently
found to be filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited
"from solution by underground water, and fissures thus filled are"
known as mineral veins. Much of the importance of mineral veins is
"the very primitive age of the individual, just as they belong to the"
"primitive age of the race, but experience in telling stories has taught"
me to compromise.
"Some people maintain that little children, who take things with brutal"
"logic, ought not to be allowed the Fairy Tale in its more limited"
"form of the Supernatural; whereas, if presented to older children,"
"this material can be criticised, catalogued and (alas!) rejected as"
"worthless, or retained with flippant toleration."
"Now, whilst recognising a certain value in this point of view, I am"
"bound to admit that if we regulate our stories entirely on this basis,"
we lose the real value of the Fairy Tale element--it is the one element
"which causes little children to _wonder_, simply because no scientific"
analysis of the story can be presented to them. It is somewhat
heartrending to feel that Jack and the Bean-Stalk and stories of that
ilk are to be handed over to the critical youth who will condemn the
"quick growth of the tree as being contrary to the order of nature, and"
wonder why Jack was not playing football in the school team instead of
climbing trees in search of imaginary adventures.
A wonderful plea for the telling of early superstitions to children is
to be found in an old Indian Allegory called “The Blazing Mansion.”
"“An old man owned a large, rambling mansion--the pillars"
"were rotten, the galleries tumbling down, the thatch dry and"
"combustible, and there was only one door. Suddenly, one day, there"
was a smell of fire: the old man rushed out. To his horror he
"saw that the thatch was aflame, the rotten pillars were catching"
"fire one by one, and the rafters were burning like tinder. But"
"inside, the children went on amusing themselves quite happily. The"
distracted father said: ‘I will run in and save my children. I will
"probably falls into the fallacy, common even among those who follow"
"the sea, that a partial or entire clearance of her ""crowd"" will quite"
"alter her nature; whereas sailors being sailors--that is, people of"
certain fairly definite attributes--any given environment makes them
much the same as those who preceded them.
But entire changes in the _personnel_ of a vessel rarely take place.
"The officers change, but the crew remains: the crew goes, but"
officers stay.  Or more frequently some few men are favourites of one
"or two of the officers, and they mingle with the new crew like yeast,"
till the ancient fermentation is visible once more.
Ships (to speak thus of their companies) talk of the same subjects
over a million miles of changing seas: they have a permanent stock of
subjects.  These include all which are perennially of interest to
"seafaring men, such as homes _versus_ boarding-houses, but they"
"include also something more individual, something more intimately"
connected with the essence of that particular vessel.  And the one
unending topic of interest on board the _Potluck_ was foreign
politics.
"How this came about no one knew, though many theories were set afloat"
and sunk again every Sunday afternoon.  Some said that the first
"captain of the _Potluck_ was called Palmerstone, and that he"
introduced the subject of England _versus_ the world as soon as he
came on board.  Others swore that they had been told by a clerk in
the employ of the firm that there had been a discussion over her very
keel concerning the introduction into her frame of foreign oaks.
"""This was the way of it,"" said Jack Hart, who was the chief upholder"
"of this particular theory, and the son of a little shipbuilder--""the"
lot that built her at Liverpool was the mixedest crowd of forsaken
right nor to the left. The constancy of his demeanour had its effect
upon the unseen enemy. The Sergeant was not further molested; and though
it was obvious that he advanced each step in about as great danger of
"death as a man who is marched manacled to the garrote, he might simply"
"have been going to his evening billet in some quiet Castilian village,"
for all the difference it made in his appearance.
"Up to this point Cardono had walked directly up the torrent bed, the"
rounded and water-worn stones rattling and slipping under his iron-shod
"half-boots, but at a certain point where was another rough cairn of"
"stones, he suddenly diverged to the right, and mounted straight up the"
fell over the scented thyme and dwarf juniper of the mountain slopes.
Whatever of uncertainty as to his fate the Sergeant felt was rigidly
"concealed, and even when a dozen men dropped suddenly upon him from"
"various rocky hiding-places, he only shook them off with a quick gesture"
"of contempt, and said something in a loud voice which brought them all"
to a halt as if turned to stone by an enchanter's spell.
"The men paused and looked at each other. They were all well armed, and"
every man had an open knife in his hand. They had been momentarily
"checked by the words of the Sergeant, but now they came on again as"
threateningly as before. Their dark long hair was encircled by red
"handkerchiefs knotted about their brows, and in general they possessed"
teeth extraordinarily white gleaming from the duskiest of skins. The
beady sloe-black eyes of the Sergeant were repeated in almost every
"face, as well as that indefinable something which in all lands marks the"
gipsy race.
The Sergeant spoke again in a language apparently more intelligible than
the deep Romany password with which he had first checked their deadly
intentions.
So after the small and imperious royal maid had been carried screaming
"and battling upstairs by Doña Susana and the globular major-domo, La"
"Giralda, richly rewarded in golden coin of the realm, and with all the"
"requisite information as to the palace, betook herself back to the gate"
"by which she had left the ass. This she loaded again, and driving it"
"before her she retraced her steps past the corner of the palace, and so"
to the porter's lodge by the great gate.
Here she was presently ushered out by a mumbling old woman who informed
"her that her husband and son had both gone to Madrid with the troops,"
"but would undoubtedly return in an hour or two, a statement which with"
her superior information the old gipsy took leave to doubt.
"The town of San Ildefonso lay beneath the chateâu, and to her right as"
La Giralda issued from the gates. The houses were of an aspect at once
"grave and cheerful. They had been built mostly, not for permanent"
"residence, but in order to accommodate the hordes of courtiers and their"
"suites who, in the summer months, followed the royal personages over the"
mountains from Madrid.
"As most of these had fled at the first invasion of the cholera, the"
"windows, at this period of the year generally bright with flowers and"
"shaded with emerald barred _jalousies_, were closely shut up, and upon"
several of the closed doors appeared the fatal black and white notices
"of the municipality, which indicated that there either was or had been a"
case of the plague within the infected walls.
La Giralda went down the streets uttering the long wailing cry which
indicated that she had firewood to sell. But though she could have
"disposed of the milk from the goats over and over again, there appeared"
"but little demand for her other commodity, even though she called,"
"""_Leña-a-a-a! Ah, leña-a-a-a!_"" from one end of San Ildefonso to the"
"inevitable negative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers,"
"agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres"
from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find
what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find
"her. He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great,"
"water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous"
"quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its"
upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.
The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of
"pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the"
specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected
"gleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of a"
"couch and two chairs, a foot-wide cheap pier glass between the two"
"windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a"
corner.
"The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in"
"speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to"
him of its divers tenantry.
"A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical"
islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the
gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from
"house to house—The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding"
"Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel’s chastely severe outline"
was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew
like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate
flotsam cast aside by the room’s marooned when a lucky sail had borne
"them to a fresh port—a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a"
"medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck."
intestine area without inflicting any injury.
"The sum of my experience, in fact, was to encourage the belief that,"
unless the intestine was struck in such a direction as to render lateral
"displacement an impossibility, the gut often escaped perforation."
"As a rule, the wounds of the abdomen which from their position proved"
the most dangerous to the intestine were--
"1. Wounds passing from one flank to the other were very dangerous, as"
"crossing complicated coils of the small intestine, and two fixed"
portions of the colon. This danger was most marked when the wounds were
situated between the eighth rib in the mid axillary line and the crest
"of the ilium; above this level the liver, or possibly liver and stomach,"
"were sometimes alone implicated, and the cases did well. Again, when the"
wounds crossed the false pelvis the patients sometimes escaped all
injury to viscera.
2. Antero-posterior wounds in the small intestine area were very fatal
if the course was direct; in such the small intestine seldom escaped
injury.
3. Wounds with a certain degree of obliquity from anterior wall to
"flank, or from flank to loin, were on the other hand comparatively"
"favourable, as the small intestine often escaped, and if any gut was"
"wounded, it was often the colon."
"4. Vertical wounds implicating the chest and abdomen, or the abdomen and"
"pelvis, were on the whole not very unfavourable. For instance, when the"
"bullet entered by the buttock and emerged below the umbilicus, a number"
of patients escaped fatal injury; this depended on the comparatively
good prognosis in wounds of the rectum and bladder. A good many
NO thanksgiving?--Awake! Awake! the Voice you have yourselves set in
your high Cathedral towers reproaches your lack of love with its iron
"tongue, and summons you all to worship Him the Ever-Glorious, through"
whose mercy alone you live!
"To and fro,--to and fro,--gravely persistent, sublimely eloquent, the"
"huge, sustained, and heavy monotone went thudding through the"
"stillness,--till, startled from his profound sleep by such loud, lofty,"
"and incessant clangor, Alwyn turned on his pillow and listened,"
"half-aroused, half-bewildered,--then, remembering where he was, he"
understood; it was the great Bell of the Dom pealing forth its first
"summons to the earliest Mass. He lay quiet for a little while, dreamily"
counting the number of reverberations each separate stroke sent
"quivering on the air,--but presently, finding it impossible to sleep"
"again, he got up, and drawing aside the curtain looked out of the"
"window of his room, which fronted on the Platz. Though it was not yet"
"six o'clock, the city was all astir,--the Rhinelanders are an early"
"working people, and to see the sun rise is not with them a mere fiction"
"of poesy, but a daily fact. It was one of the loveliest of lovely"
"spring mornings--the sky was clear as a pale, polished sapphire, and"
every little bib of delicate carving and sculpture on the Dom stood out
from its groundwork with microscopically beautiful distinctness. And as
"his gaze rested on the perfect fairness of the day, a strange and"
"sudden sense of rapturous anticipation possessed his mind,--he felt as"
"one prepared for some high and exquisite happiness,--some great and"
"wondrous celebration or feast of joy! The thoughts of death, on which"
"he had brooded so persistently during the past yester-eve, had fled,"
"leaving no trace behind,--only a keen and vigorous delight in life"
"absorbed him now. It was good to be alive, even on this present earth!"
"it was good to see, to feel, to know! and there was much to be thankful"
for in the mere capability of easy and healthful breathing!
"on the Isthmus, though one hunter and trapper is said to have secured as"
"many as 60,000 in a year. But as the demand for the skins, and to a"
"lesser degree for the teeth, of the animals is a constant one, it is"
probable that with the aid of the tourists they will be exterminated
there as thoroughly as they have been in the settled parts of Florida.
While on the subject of slaughter and the extermination of game it may
be noted that the Canal Commission has already established very
"stringent game laws on the Zone, particularly for the protection of"
"plumed birds like the egret, and it is seriously proposed to make of"
that part of Gatun Lake within the Zone a refuge for birds in which no
shooting shall be permitted. Such action would stop mere wanton
"slaughter from the decks of passing steamers, and in the end would"
greatly enhance the beauty and interest of the trip through the lake
which would be fairly alive with birds and other animal life.

[Illustration: THE CACAO TREE]
[Illustration: STREET IN DAVID]
The Bayano River region beside being the center of such lumbering
activities as the Zone knows at present is the section in which are
"found the curious vegetable ivory nuts which, though growing wild, have"
become one of the principal products of Panama. Only a few years ago
they were looked upon merely as curiosities but are now a useful new
material. They are gathered by the natives and sold to dealers in
Panama who ship them north to be made into buttons and other articles
of general use. Nobody has yet experimented with the cultivation of the
"tree, and there is reason to believe that with cultivation larger nuts"
"could be obtained, and, by planting, considerable groves established."
"The trees grow well in every part of the Darien, and the demand, with"
"nature worship, and could never be completely disguised by means of mystic"
interpretations. Never was the lack of harmony greater between the
moralizing tendencies of theologians and the cruel shamelessness of
tradition. A god held up as the august lord of the universe was the pitiful
"and abject hero of an obscene love affair; the taurobolium, performed to"
satisfy man's most exalted aspirations for spiritual purification and
"immortality, looked like a {72} shower bath of blood and recalled"
cannibalistic orgies. The men of letters and senators attending those
"mysteries saw them performed by painted eunuchs, ill reputed for their"
"infamous morals, who went through dizzy dances similar to those of the"
dancing dervishes and the Aissaouas. We can imagine the repugnance these
ceremonies caused in everybody whose judgment had not been destroyed by a
fanatical devotion. Of no other pagan superstition do the Christian
"polemicists speak with such profound contempt, and there is undoubtedly a"
reason for their attitude. But they were in a more fortunate position than
their pagan antagonists; their doctrine was not burdened with barbarous
traditions dating back to times of savagery; and all the ignominies that
stained the old Phrygian religion must not prejudice us against it nor
cause us to slight the long continued efforts that were made to refine it
gradually and to mould it into a form that would fulfil the new demands of
morality and enable it to follow the laborious march of Roman society on
the road of religious progress.

EGYPT.
We know more about the religion of the early Egyptians than about any other
ancient religion. Its development can be traced back three or four thousand
to say: it is a question of the stage of development.
"Experience has taught me that for the group of normal children, almost"
"irrespective of age, the first kind of story suitable will contain an"
appeal to conditions to which they are accustomed. The reason of this
"is obvious: the child, having limited experience, can only be reached"
"by this experience, until his imagination is awakened and he is enabled"
to grasp through this faculty what he has not actually passed through.
Before this awakening has taken place he enters the realm of fiction
(represented in the story) by comparison with his personal experience.
Every story and every point in the story mean more as that experience
"widens, and the interest varies, of course, with temperament, quickness"
"of perception, power of visualising and of concentration."
"In “The Marsh King's Daughter,” H. C. Andersen says:"
“The Storks have a great many stories which they tell their little
"ones, all about the bogs and marshes. They suit them to their age and"
"capacity. The young ones are quite satisfied with Kribble, Krabble,"
"or some such nonsense, and find it charming; but the elder ones want"
something with more meaning.”
One of the most interesting experiments to be made in connection with
this subject is to tell the same story at intervals of a year or six
months to some individual child.[25] The different incidents in the
"story which appeal to it (and you must watch it closely, to be sure the"
"interest is real, and not artificially stimulated by any suggestion on"
your part) will mark its mental development and the gradual awakening
"of its imagination. This experiment is a very delicate one, and will"
"not be infallible, because children are secretive and the appreciation"
"is often (unconsciously) simulated, or concealed through shyness or"
"want of articulation. But it is, in spite of this, a deeply interesting"
lady and the baby and the cart emerged from the hotel door they were
"attended by an ever-increasing throng of unwashed Venetians, whose"
interest could not have been keener had Santos Dumont's air-ship or a
"Japanese jinriksha suddenly appeared in their gondola-ridden town, and"
who commented in shrill Italian on this wheeled apparition. The lady is
"not easily beaten when she decides to do anything, but, after standing"
"that for half a block or so, she made a hasty retreat to the hotel, and"
"wheels disappeared, probably forever, from the streets of Venice."
[Sidenote: Gondolas and Gondoliers.]
"Although Venice, with its population of one hundred and sixty-three"
"thousand, is seven miles in circumference, and is divided by one"
"hundred and forty-six canals into one hundred and seventeen islands,"
yet these are so joined together by means of four hundred bridges that
it is possible to walk all over the city. But the bridges are built in
"steps, and cannot be used by wheeled vehicles. There are no horses or"
"carriages of any kind. The funereal-looking gondola, always painted"
"black, is the only conveyance upon these streets of water, and does"
"duty for cab, omnibus, wagon, cart, wheelbarrow and hearse. It is used"
"for pleasure riding, shopping, church-going, theatre-going, visiting,"
"carrying prisoners to jail, carrying the dead to the cemetery--in"
"short, for everything."
"In propelling this black but graceful and easy-going boat, the"
"gondolier does not sit. He stands, on a sort of deck platform towards"
"the stern, and to balance his weight there is affixed to the prow a"
"heavy piece of shining steel, which rears itself at the front almost"
"like a figure-head, only this is always of the same pattern, simply"
"a broad, upright blade of steel, notched deeply on the front edge."
"The gondolier does not pull the oar, he pushes it--there is only one"
"oar--and he does not change it from side to side, as in paddling a"
3. THE LARGER ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GROUPINGS SURVIVE LONGER
THAN THE SMALLER. Species are so short-lived that a single
geological epoch may be marked by several more or less complete
extinctions of the species of its fauna-flora and their
replacement by other species. A genus continues with new species
after all the species with which it began have become extinct.
"Families survive genera, and orders families. Classes are so long-"
lived that most of those which are known from the earliest
"formations are represented by living forms, and no sub-kingdom has"
ever become extinct.
"Thus, to take an example from the stony corals,--the ZOANTHARIA,--"
the particular characters--which constituted a certain SPECIES--
Facosites niagarensis--of the order are confined to the Niagara
series. Its GENERIC characters appeared in other species earlier
in the Silurian and continued through the Devonian. Its FAMILY
"characters, represented in different genera and species, range"
from the Ordovician to the close of the Paleozoic; while the
"characters which it shares with all its order, the Zoantharia,"
began in the Cambrian and are found in living species.
4. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS HAS BEEN GRADUAL. The fossils of each
life zone and of each formation of a conformable series closely
"resemble, with some explainable exceptions, those of the beds"
immediately above and below. The animals and plants which tenanted
the earth during any geological epoch are so closely related to
those of the preceding and the succeeding epochs that we may
consider them to be the descendants of the one and the ancestors
"of the other, thus accounting for the resemblance by heredity. It"
is therefore believed that the species of animals and plants now
living on the earth are the descendants of the species whose
"remains we find entombed in the rocks, and that the chain of life"
"Now, whenever any one of these gentlemen who wish to convert me will"
show that the Colonel is wrong in this brief paragraph; whenever they
"will, in print or in public, refute the arguments to which he refers,"
"and to which they object, I shall not be slow to respond."
"2. It must be argument, not personal abuse, and it must be conducted in"
a courteous manner and tone.
"3. It must proceed upon the basis that I am as honest, as earnest, and"
as virtuous in my motives and intentions as they are in theirs.
"Now, surely these gentlemen cannot object to these simple requirements;"
and since some of them are men whose names are preceded by a title
and followed by several capital letters (ranging from D.D. to
"O.S.F.----which last I, in my ignorance, guess at as meaning Order of"
"St. Francis, but shall like to be corrected if I am wrong) they must"
believe that to answer the arguments themselves is both simple and easy.
If they do not so believe they surely have no right to occupy the
positions which they do occupy. If they do so believe it will do much
"more good to answer them publicly, since they have been made publicly,"
"and are already in the hands of several thousand people, who could not"
be reached by any amount of eloquence poured out on ray devoted head in
the privacy of my own parlor (or writing-desk).
"Therefore, gentlemen, permit me to say to you all that which I have"
already written to several of you personally--that Col. Ingersoll's
"paragraph, quoted above, expresses my own views and those of a great"
"many other people, and will continue so to do so long as your efforts to"
"show that he is wrong are only whispered to me behind a fan, or in the"
"strict seclusion of a letter marked ""private and personal."""
"their pores. As the heat of the interior increased, these gases"
transpired to the surface and formed the primitive atmosphere and
hydrosphere. The atmosphere has therefore grown slowly from the
smallest beginnings. Gases emitted from the interior in volcanic
"eruptions and in other ways have ever added to it, and are adding"
"to it now. On the other hand, the atmosphere has constantly"
"suffered loss, as it has been robbed of oxygen by the oxidation of"
"rocks in weathering, and of carbon dioxide in the making of"
limestones and carbonaceous deposits.
While all hypotheses of the earth's beginnings are as yet unproved
"speculations, they serve to bring to mind one of the chief lessons"
"which geology has to teach,--that the duration of the earth in"
"time, like the extension of the universe in space, is vastly"
beyond the power of the human mind to realize. Behind the history
"recorded in the rocks, which stretches back for many million"
"years, lies the long unrecorded history of the beginnings of the"
planet; and still farther in the abysses of the past are dimly
seen the cycles of the evolution of the solar system and of the
nebula which gave it birth.
We pass now from the dim realm of speculation to the earliest era
"of the recorded history of the earth, where some certain facts may"
be observed and some sure inferences from them may be drawn.
THE ARCHEAN.
"The oldest known sedimentary strata, wherever they are exposed by"
"uplift and erosion, are found to be involved with a mass of"
crystalline rocks which possesses the same characteristics in all
"parts of the world. It consists of foliated rocks, gneisses, and"
"schists of various kinds, which have been cut with dikes and other"
uproar.
Emerson and his companions found themselves carried away before the
"onslaught like chips in the surf, then sucked into a maelstrom where"
the first duty was self-preservation. Behind locked doors and shivering
"glass a terrified office-clerk, receiver to ear, was calling madly for"
"Police Headquarters, while in the main building itself the crowd"
bellowed and roared and the hollow floor reverberated to the thunder of
trampling feet and the crash of tumbling freight-piles.
Boyd succeeded in keeping his footing and eventually fought his way to
"a backing of crated machinery, where he stooped and ripped a cleat"
"loose; then, laying about him with this weapon, he cleared a space. It"
"was already difficult to distinguish friend from foe, but he saw Alton"
Clyde go down a short distance away and made a rush to rescue him. His
"pine slat splintered against a head, he dodged a missile, then struck"
"with the fragment in his hand, and, snatching Clyde by the arm, dragged"
"him out from under foot. Battered and bruised, the two won back to"
"Emerson's first position, and watched the tide surge past."
At the first alarm the fishermen had armed themselves with bale-hooks
"and bludgeons, and for a time worked havoc among their assailants; but"
as the fight became more general they were forced apart and drawn into
"the crowd, whereupon the combatants split up into groups, milling about"
like frightened cattle. Men broke out from these struggling clusters to
"nurse their injuries or beat a retreat, only to be overrun and"
swallowed up again in a new commotion.
"Emerson saw the big, barefooted fisherman in the red underclothes,"
"armed with a sledge-hammer, go through the ranks of his enemies like a"
"tornado, only to be struck by some missile hurled from a distance. With"
a shout of rage the fellow turned and flung his own weapon at his
"being cut open, there is not the slightest need to accentuate the"
physical side. Children accept the deed as they accept the cutting
"off of a giant's head, because they do not associate it with pain,"
especially if the deed is presented half-humorously. The moment in the
"story where their sympathy is aroused is the swallowing of the kids,"
because the children do realise the possibility of being disposed of
"in the mother's absence. (Needless to say, I never point out the moral"
of the kids' disobedience to the mother in opening the door.) I have
always noticed a moment of breathlessness even in a grown-up audience
"when the wolf swallows the kids, and that the recovery of them “all"
"safe and sound, all huddled together” is quite as much appreciated by"
"the adult audience as by the children, and is worth the tremor caused"
by the wolf's summary action.
I have not always been able to impress upon the teachers that this
story _must_ be taken lightly. A very earnest young student came to
"me once after I had told it, and said in an awestruck voice: “Do you"
"Correlate?” Having recovered from the effect of this word, which she"
"carefully explained, I said that as a rule I preferred to keep the"
"story apart from the other lessons, just an undivided whole, because"
it had effects of its own which were best brought about by not being
connected with other lessons.[31] She frowned her disapproval and said:
"“I am sorry, because I thought I would take The Goat for my Nature"
"Study lesson, and then tell your story at the end.” I thought of the"
terrible struggle in the child's mind between his conscientious wish to
be accurate and his dramatic enjoyment of the abnormal habits of a goat
"who went out with scissors, needle and thread; but I have been most"
careful since to repudiate any connection with Nature Study in this and
a few other stories in my répertoire.
One might occasionally introduce one of Edward Lear's “Book of
Nonsense.” For instance:
"Mr. P. A. Barnett, in his book on the “Commonsense of Education,” says,"
alluding to Fairy Tales:
"“Children will _act_ them but not act _upon_ them, and they will"
not accept the incidents as part of their effectual belief. They
"will imagine, to be sure, grotesque worlds, full of admirable and"
interesting personages to whom strange things might have happened.
So much the better; this largeness of imagination is one of the
possessions that distinguish the better nurtured child from others less
fortunate.”
The following passage from Stevenson's essay on _Child Play_[41] will
furnish an instance of children's aptitude for creating their own
dramatic atmosphere:
"“When my cousin and I took our porridge of a morning, we had a device"
"to enliven the course of a meal. He ate his with sugar, and explained"
it to be a country continually buried under snow. I took mine with
"milk, and explained it to be a country suffering gradual inundation."
You can imagine us exchanging bulletins; how here was an island still
"unsubmerged, here a valley not yet covered with snow; what inventions"
were made; how his population lived in cabins on perches and travelled
"on stilts, and how mine was always in boats; how the interest grew"
furious as the last corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and
"grew smaller every moment; and how, in fine, the food was of altogether"
"secondary importance, and might even have been nauseous, so long as we"
seasoned it with these dreams. But perhaps the most exciting moments I
"ever had over a meal, were in the case of calves' feet jelly. It was"
"hardly possible not to believe, and you may be quite sure, so far from"
"trying it, I did all I could to favour the illusion--that some part of"
"it was hollow, and that sooner or later my spoon would lay open the"
"secret tabernacle of that golden rock. There, might some Red-Beard"
written and spoken.
I speak from personal experience; and when I look back upon the
"reviews I wrote ten years ago, it is with invariable consternation,"
and sometimes a real sense of shame.
"Nevertheless, there is some criticism of the religious novel which"
must be taken seriously. I have maintained that men generally in
"England are in a state of theological confusion, but that they are"
interested in religion if they can be induced to consider it. There
"is, as the great African Presbyter wrote seventeen hundred years ago,"
a natural response in the hearts of men to the chief articles of the
Christian Faith. There is a _Testimonium animæ naturaliter
christianæ_. But there are some who can only be described by a
quotation: “They are the enemies of the cross of Christ.” They are
determined that the Catholic creed shall have no place in the counsels
and considerations of social legislation. Of Jesus Christ they have
"said, “We will not have this man to reign over us;” and if there be"
any chance that a man’s books may catch the eye of the public and
"rouse people to think whether opportunism is really statesmanship, and"
"empiricism in politics really prudent, if, in a word, the principles"
"of Christianity are offered as a solution of social problems, then"
the author is attacked on every side. It is suggested that his
"intention is insincere, that his knowledge is inadequate. The things"
which have been part of his painful discipline and development are
described as his accepted environment. If a Bishop happens to find an
"illustration for a sermon in his pages, or a prominent Nonconformist"
"divine recognizes that the laity like to read them, and says so; if"
any of those true hearts who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
"have been ready to see that men who have been rescued _de profundis_,"
men who have had experience of [Greek: ta bathea tou satana] are not
"thereby disqualified for duty in the field of Faith; if, in a word,"
find depicted on a modern tombstone the worm that dieth not and the
"fire that is not quenched. No; the water-pitcher was not a symbol, it"
was an instrument; for my part I have little faith in the existence
of any symbols in popular religion which are not in origin at least
instruments; and the purpose to which this instrument was put was to
supply the dead person with that wedding-bath which he had not taken
"in life, and without which he would vainly strive in the under-world"
to prepare himself for divine wedlock. The water-pitcher was not
"commemorative, but preventive, of future punishment. Its erection was"
"not a warning to the living, but a service to the dead."
"Thus then the evidence for the intimate association of the mysteries,"
"or of the main idea which runs through them, with human weddings is"
"complete and, I hope, convincing; and the custom of the water-pitcher,"
"which concludes it, fitly introduces at the same time the evidence"
for the association of the same idea with funerals. This is equally
"plentiful. The vague conception of death as a wedding, which as I have"
"shown was elaborated in the mysteries, has of course already been"
exemplified in all those passages of ancient literature and modern
"folk-songs which I have adduced, and I have found in it also the motive"
for the assimilation of funeral-customs to the customs of marriage.
"But the evidence that the actual doctrines of the mysteries, in which"
"more definite expression was given to that vague idea, were closely"
associated with death and funeral-custom is to be found rather in
epitaphs and sepulchral monuments.
The tone of the epitaphs may be sufficiently illustrated by a single
couplet:
Οὐκ ἐπιδὼν νύμφεια λέχη κατέβην τὸν ἄφυκτον
Γόργιππος ξανθῆς Φερσεφόνης θάλαμον[1501].
"‘I, Gorgippus, lived not to look upon a bridal bed ere I went down"
which fronts the Champ de Mars had less effect than might have
been expected in a youth of fifteen years. Not yet did he become
French in sympathy. His love of Corsica and hatred of the French
monarchy steeled him against the luxuries of his new surroundings.
Perhaps it was an added sting that he was educated at the expense of
the monarchy which had conquered his kith and kin. He nevertheless
"applied himself with energy to his favourite studies, especially"
"mathematics. Defective in languages he still was, and ever remained;"
for his critical acumen in literature ever fastened on the matter
rather than on style. To the end of his days he could never write
"Italian, much less French, with accuracy; and his tutor at Paris not"
inaptly described his boyish composition as resembling molten granite.
The same qualities of directness and impetuosity were also fatal to
his efforts at mastering the movements of the dance. In spite of
lessons at Paris and private lessons which he afterwards took at
"Valence, he was never a dancer: his bent was obviously for the exact"
"sciences rather than the arts, for the geometrical rather than the"
"rhythmical: he thought, as he moved, in straight lines, never in"
curves.
The death of his father during the year which the youth spent at Paris
sharpened his sense of responsibility towards his seven younger
brothers and sisters. His own poverty must have inspired him with
disgust at the luxury which he saw around him; but there are good
reasons for doubting the genuineness of the memorial which he is
alleged to have sent from Paris to the second master at Brienne on
this subject. The letters of the scholars at Paris were subject to
"strict surveillance; and, if he had taken the trouble to draw up a"
"list of criticisms on his present training, most assuredly it would"
"have been destroyed. Undoubtedly, however, he would have sympathized"
with the unknown critic in his complaint of the unsuitableness of
sumptuous meals to youths who were destined for the hardships of the
connected with that event. The _Chaldaei_ were Oriental fortune-tellers who
asserted that their predictions were based on the Chaldean astrology. They
"found credulous clients among the farm laborers, and Cato gravely exhorts"
the good landlord to oust them from his estate.[3]
"Beginning with the second century before Christ, merchants began to import"
Syrian slaves. At that time Delos was the great trade center in this human
"commodity, and in that island especially Atargatis was worshiped by"
citizens of Athens and Rome.[4] Trade spread her worship in the
Occident.[5] We know that the great slave revolution that devastated Sicily
"in 134 B. C. was started by a slave from Apamea, a votary of the Syrian"
"goddess. Simulating divine madness, he called his companions to arms,"
"pretending to act in accordance with orders from heaven.[6] This detail,"
"which we know by chance, shows how considerable a proportion of Semites"
"there was in the gangs working the fields, and how much authority Atargatis"
enjoyed in the rural centers. Being too poor to build temples for their
"national goddess, those agricultural laborers {106} waited with their"
devotions until a band of itinerant _galli_ passed through the distant
hamlet where the lot of the auction had sent them. The existence of those
"wandering priests depended, therefore, on the number of fellow-countrymen"
"they met in the rural districts, who supported them by sacrificing a part"
of their poor savings.
Towards the end of the republic those diviners appear to have enjoyed
rather serious consideration at Rome. It was a pythoness from Syria that
advised Marius on the sacrifices he was to perform.[7]
Under the empire the importation of slaves increased. Depopulated Italy
"needed more and more foreign hands, and Syria furnished a large quota of"
"the forced immigration of cultivators. But those Syrians, quick and"
"intelligent as they were strong and industrious, performed many other"
functions. They filled the countless domestic positions in the palaces of
"At last out of khaki, and dressed in conventional evening clothes, I"
felt as if I were indeed writing the first words of another story on the
"unmarred page of the incoming year. As I entered the library my mother,"
"forgetting that it was I who owed her deference, came forward with"
outstretched arms and a sound in her voice like that of doves at nesting
"time. Dad's welcome was heartier, even though his eyes were dimmed with"
"happy tears. And old Bilkins, our solemn, irreproachable butler, grinned"
benignly as he stood waiting to announce dinner. What a wealth of
affection I had to be grateful for!
"I did not lack gratitude, but with the old year touching the heels of"
"the new, and Time commanding me to get in step, my return to civil life"
"held few inducements. Instead of a superabundance of cheer, I had"
brought from France jumpy nerves and a body lean with over
training--natural results of physical exhaustion coupled with the mental
reaction that must inevitably follow a year and a half of highly
imaginative living.
"But there was another aspect less tangible, perhaps more permanent--and"
all members of combat divisions will understand exactly what I mean.
"When America picked up the gauntlet, an active conscience jerked me from"
a tuneful life and drove me out to war--for whether men are driven by
"conscience, or a government draft board, makes no difference in the"
"effect upon those who come through. Time after time, for eighteen"
"months, I made my regular trips into hell--into a hell more revolting"
"than mid-Victorian evangelists ever pictured to spellbound, quaking"
sinners. Never in this world had there been a parallel to the naked
dangers and nauseous discomforts of that western front; never so
"prolonged an agony of head-splitting noises, lacerations of human flesh,"
"smells that turned the body sick, blasphemies that made the soul grow"
"historical research that, apart from the fruitful labours of the Navy"
"Records Society, of Messrs. Oscar Browning and Hereford George, and of"
"Mr. Bowman of Toronto, scarcely any English work has appeared that is"
based on the official records of this period. Yet they are of great
interest and value. Our diplomatic agents then had the knack of
"getting at State secrets in most foreign capitals, even when we were"
at war with their Governments; and our War Office and Admiralty
"Records have also yielded me some interesting ""finds."" M. Lévy, in the"
"preface to his ""Napoléon intime"" (1893), has well remarked that ""the"
documentary history of the wars of the Empire has not yet been
"written. To write it accurately, it will be more important thoroughly"
"to know foreign archives than those of France."" Those of Russia,"
"Austria, and Prussia have now for the most part been examined; and I"
think that I may claim to have searched all the important parts of our
"Foreign Office Archives for the years in question, as well as for part"
of the St. Helena period. I have striven to embody the results of this
search in the present volumes as far as was compatible with limits of
"space and with the narrative form at which, in my judgment, history"
ought always to aim.
"On the whole, British policy comes out the better the more fully it is"
"known. Though often feeble and vacillating, it finally attained to"
firmness and dignity; and Ministers closed the cycle of war with acts
of magnanimity towards the French people which are studiously ignored
by those who bid us shed tears over the martyrdom of St. Helena.
"Nevertheless, the splendour of the finale must not blind us to the"
flaccid eccentricities that made British statesmanship the laughing
"stock of Europe in 1801-3, 1806-7, and 1809. Indeed, it is"
questionable whether the renewal of war between England and Napoleon
in 1803 was due more to his innate forcefulness or to the contempt
which he felt for the Addington Cabinet. When one also remembers our
"extraordinary blunders in the war of the Third Coalition, it seems a"
virginity[1494].’ Finally the first night on which the wedded pair came
"together was known as the ‘mystic night’ (νὺξ μυστική)[1495], a term"
not a little suggestive of the great night of Demeter’s mysteries when
to the eyes of the initiated was displayed the secret proof and promise
of wedlock between men and gods hereafter. In short the ceremonies
of a wedding by one means or another proclaimed it to be a form of
"initiation, and the estate of marriage was to the Greeks, as our"
"prayer-book calls it, ‘an excellent mystery.’"
Hence naturally followed the belief that the unmarried and the
uninitiated shared the same fate in the future life. One conception
"of the punishment of the uninitiated was, according to Plato[1496],"
"that they should carry water in a sieve to a broken jar; and this, as"
"is well known, was also the lot of the Danaids in the nether world."
"Commenting on these facts Dr Frazer says, ‘It is possible that the"
original reason why the Danaids were believed to be condemned to this
"punishment in hell was not so much that they murdered, as that they did"
"not marry, the sons of Aegyptus. According to one tradition indeed they"
afterwards married other husbands (Paus. III. 12. 2); but according
"to another legend they were murdered by Lynceus, apparently before"
"marriage (Schol. on Euripides, _Hecuba_, 886). They may therefore have"
"been chosen as types of unmarried women, and their punishment need"
not have been peculiar to them but may have been the one supposed to
await all unmarried persons in the nether world[1497].’ A passage of
"Lucian, which appears to have been overlooked in this connexion[1498],"
converts the view of the Danaids which Dr Frazer considers possible
into a practical certainty. The passage in point forms the conclusion
of that dialogue in which Poseidon with the aid of Triton plots and
"carries out the rape of Amymone, the Danaid. She has just been seized"
and is protesting against her abduction and threatening to call her
"father, when Triton intervenes: ‘Keep quiet, Amymone,’ he says, ‘it"
"is Poseidon.’ And the girl rejoins, ‘Oh, Poseidon you call him, do"
"planet are very numerous, although much of the record has been"
destroyed in various ways. A succession of different formations is
"usually seen in any considerable section of the crust, such as a"
deep canyon or where the edges of upturned strata are exposed to
"view on the flanks of mountain ranges; and in any extensive area,"
"such as a state of the Union or a province of Canada, the number"
of formations outcropping on the surface is large.
It is thus learned that our present continent is made up for. the
"most part of old continental deltas. Some, recently emerged as the"
"strata of young coastal plains, are the records of recent cycles"
of erosion; while others were deposited in the early history of
"the earth, and in many instances have been crumpled into"
"mountains, which afterwards were leveled to their bases and"
lowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of later sediments
before they were again uplifted to form land.
The cycle of erosion now in progress and recorded in the layers of
stratified rock being spread beneath the sea in continental deltas
has therefore been preceded by many similar cycles. Again and
again movements of the crust have brought to an end one cycle--
"sometimes when only well under way, and sometimes when drawing"
toward its close--and have begun another. Again and again they
"have added to the land areas which before were sea, with all their"
"deposition records of earlier cycles, or have lowered areas of"
land beneath the sea to receive new sediments.
THE AGE OF THE EARTH. The thickness of the stratified rocks now
exposed upon the eroded surface of the continents is very great.
In the Appalachian region the strata are seven or eight miles
"thick, and still greater thicknesses have been measured in several"
other mountain ranges. The aggregate thickness of all the
"order by the LAW OF INCLUDED ORGANISMS; i.e. formations, however"
"widely separated, which contain a similar assemblage of fossils"
are equivalent and belong to the same division of geological time.
The correlation of formations by means of fossils may be explained
by the formations now being deposited about the north Atlantic.
Lithologically they are extremely various. On the continental
shelf of North America limestones of different kinds are forming
"off Florida, and sandstones and shales from Georgia northward."
Separated from them by the deep Atlantic oozes are other
sedimentary deposits now accumulating along the west coast of
Europe. If now all these offshore formations were raised to open
"air, how could they be correlated? Surely not by lithological"
"likeness, for in this respect they would be quite diverse. All"
"would be similar, however, in the fossils which they contain. Some"
fossil species would be identical in all these formations and
others would be closely allied. Making all due allowance for
differences in species due to local differences in climate and
"other physical causes, it would still be plain that plants and"
"animals so similar lived at the same period of time, and that the"
formations in which their remains were imbedded were
contemporaneous in a broad way. The presence of the bones of
whales and other marine mammals would prove that the strata were
"laid after the appearance of mammals upon earth, and imbedded"
relics of man would give a still closer approximation to their
age. In the same way we correlate the earlier geological
formations.
"For example, in 1902 there were collected the first fossils ever"
found on the antarctic continent. Among the dozen specimens
obtained were some fossil ammonites (a family of chambered shells)
of genera which are found on other continents in certain
"the small intestine, and may be summed up as follows."
The small intestine may present evidence of lateral contusion in the
"shape of elongated ecchymoses, either parallel, oblique, or transverse"
to its long axis. These ecchymoses resemble in extent and outline those
which ordinarily surround a wound of the intestinal wall produced by a
"bullet (see fig. 87, p. 418)."
The wall of the small intestine may be wounded to an extent short of
"perforation, either the peritoneal coat alone being split, or the wound"
implicating the muscular coat and producing an appearance similar to
"that seen when the intestine is dragged upon during an operation, but"
"without so much gaping of the edges (see fig. 85, p. 416)."
I met with these conditions in association with co-existing complete
"perforations of the small intestine, and in one case of intra-peritoneal"
"hæmorrhage in which no complete perforation was discoverable (No. 169,"
p. 432).
The implication and perforation of the small intestine are to some
extent influenced by the direction of the wound. A striking case is
"included below, No. 201, in which a bullet passed from the loin to the"
"iliac fossa on each side of the body, approximately parallel to the"
"course of the inner margin of the colon, and I also saw some other"
wounds in this direction in which no evidence of injury to the small
"intestine was detected, and which got well. Again wounds from flank to"
"flank were, as a rule, very fatal; but I saw more than one instance"
where these wounds were situated immediately below the crest of the
"ilium, in which the intestine escaped injury (see case 171). A very"
striking observation was made by Mr. Cheatle in such a wound. The
patient died as a result of a double perforation of both cæcum and
sigmoid flexure; none the less the bullet had crossed the small
"sulky, and said: “I need them better than you do.” She quite agreed"
"this might be, but reminded him that, after all, they belonged to her."
"She promised, however, that if he would tell her for what purpose he"
"wanted the envelopes, she would endeavour to help him in the matter."
Then came the astonishing announcement: “I am building a navy.” After
"a little more gradual questioning, Mrs. Glover drew from the boy the"
information that the Borough Water Carts passed through the side
"street once a week, flushing the gutter; that then the Envelope Ships"
were made to sail on the water and pass under the covered ways which
formed bridges for wayfarers and tunnels for the “navy.” Great was the
excitement when the ships passed out of sight and were recognised as
they arrived safely at the other end. Of course the expenses in raw
material were greatly diminished by the illicit acquisition of Mrs.
"Glover's property, and in this way she had unconsciously provided the"
"neighbourhood with a navy and a Commander. Her first instinct, after"
"becoming acquainted with the whole story, was to present the boy with a"
"real boat, but on second thought she collected and gave him a number of"
"old envelopes with names and addresses upon them, which added greatly"
"to the excitement of the sailing, because they could be more easily"
"identified as they came out of the other side of the tunnel, and had"
their respective reputations as to speed.
"Here is indeed food for romance, and I give both instances to prove"
that the advantages of street life are to be taken into consideration
as well as the disadvantages; though I think we are bound to admit that
the latter outweigh the former.
One of the immediate results of dramatic stories is the escape from
"the commonplace, to which I have already alluded in quoting Mr."
"Goschen's words. The desire for this escape is a healthy one, common to"
adults and children. When we wish to get away from our own surroundings
"and interests, we do for ourselves what I maintain we ought to do for"
"elaborate, but one would think rather painful, since they include the"
breaking of a front tooth in sign that they are ready for marriage. They
marry young and mothers at twelve years are not uncommon.
Once a year the Guaymies have a great tribal feast--“balceria” the
Spaniards call it. Word is sent to all outlying huts and villages by a
"mystic symbol of knotted rags, which is also tied to the branches of the"
trees along the more frequented trails. On the appointed day several
hundred will gather on the banks of some river in which a general bath
"is taken, with much frolicking and horseplay. Then the women employ"
"several hours in painting the men with red and blue colors, following"
"the figures still to be seen on the old pottery, after which the men"
garb themselves uncouthly in bark or in pelts like children “dressing
up” for a frolic. At night is a curious ceremonial dance and game called
"balsa, in which the Indians strike each other with heavy sticks, and are"
knocked down amid the pile of broken boughs. The music--if it could be
"so called--the incantations of the wisemen, the frenzy of the dancers,"
"all combine to produce a sort of self-hypnotism, during which the"
Indians feel no pain from injuries which a day later often prove to be
very serious.
[Illustration: PANAMANIAN FATHER AND CHILD]
"There are a multitude of distinct Indian tribes on the Isthmus, each"
"with its own tribal government, its distinctive customs and its allotted"
"territory, though boundaries are, of course, exceedingly vague and the"
territories overlap. The Smithsonian pamphlet enumerates 21 such tribes
in the Darien region alone. But there seems to be among them no such
condition of continual tribal warfare as existed between our North
American Indians as long as they survived in any considerable numbers
the aggressions of the white settlers. It is true that the historian of
Balboa’s expedition records that the great leader was besought by
"Hadad, in a considerable part of Syria besides. The Greeks considered her"
"as the principal Syrian goddess ([Greek: Suria thea]), and in the Latin"
"countries she was commonly known as _dea Syria_, a name corrupted into"
_Iasura_ by popular use.
We all remember the unedifying descriptions of her itinerant priests that
"Lucian and Apuleius[1] have left. Led by an old eunuch of dubious habits, a"
crowd of painted young men marched along the highways with an ass that bore
an elaborately adorned image of the goddess. Whenever they passed through a
"village or by some rich villa, they went through their sacred exercises. To"
the shrill accompaniment of their Syrian flutes they turned round and
"round, and with their heads thrown back fluttered about and gave vent to"
hoarse clamors until vertigo seized them and insensibility was complete.
"Then they flagellated themselves wildly, struck themselves with swords and"
shed their blood in front of a rustic crowd which pressed closely about
"them, and finally they took up a profitable collection from the wondering"
"spectators. They received jars of milk and wine, cheeses, flour, bronze"
"coins of small denominations and even some silver pieces, all of which"
disappeared in the folds of their capacious robes. If opportunity presented
they knew how to increase their profits by means of clever thefts or by
making commonplace predictions for a moderate consideration.
"This picturesque description, based on a novel by {105} Lucius of Patras,"
is undoubtedly extreme. It is difficult to believe that the sacerdotal
corps of the goddess of Hierapolis should have consisted only of charlatans
and thieves. But how can the presence in the Occident of that begging and
low nomadic clergy be explained?
It is certain that the first worshipers of the Syrian goddess in the Latin
world were slaves. During the wars against Antiochus the Great a number of
"prisoners were sent to Italy to be sold at public auction, as was the"
"custom, and the first appearance in Italy of the _Chaldaei_[2] has been"
"Vaschide and Piéron, _Psychologie du Rêve_, p. 26), tentatively put"
"forward a symbolic theory of dreams, as a possible rival to the theory"
that permanent associations are set up as the result of a first chance
"coincidence. 'Do there exist,' he asked, 'bizarre analogies of internal"
"sensations in virtue of which certain vibrations of the nerves, certain"
"instinctive movements of our viscera, correspond to sensations apparently"
quite different? According to this hypothesis experience would bring
"to light mysterious affinities, the knowledge of which might become a"
genuine science;... and a real key to dreams would not be an unrealisable
achievement if we could bring together and compare a sufficient number of
observations.']
[Footnote 145: It is interesting to note that hallucinations may
also be symbolic. Thus the Psychical Research Society's Committee on
"Hallucinations recognised a symbolic group, and recorded, for instance,"
"the case of a man who, when his child lies dying, sees a blue flame in the"
"air and hears a voice say, 'That's his soul' (_Proceedings Society for"
"Psychical Research_, August 1894, p. 125).]"
[Footnote 146: Maeder states that the tendency to symbolism in dreams and
similar modes of psychic activity is due to 'vague thinking in a condition
"of diminished attention.' This is, however, an inadequate statement and"
misses the central point.]
[Footnote 147: In the other spheres in which symbolism most tends to
"appear, the same or allied conditions exist. In hallucinations, which (as"
Parish and others have shown) tend to occur in hypnagogic or sleep-like
"states, the conditions are clearly the same. The symbolism of an art, and"
"notably music, is due to the very conditions of the art, which exclude"
any appeal to other senses. The primitive mind reaches symbolism through
"a similar condition of things, coming as the result of ignorance and"
undeveloped powers of apperception. In insanity these powers are morbidly
Another series of these pictures in the portico represents the story
"of a sacristan who, coming to pray in this church before day, found it"
"filled with worshippers, and was told by St. Laurence himself that they"
"were the Apostle Peter, the first martyr, Stephen, and other apostles,"
"martyrs and virgins from paradise, and was ordered to go and tell the"
"Pope what he had seen, and bid him come and celebrate a solemn mass."
"The sacristan objected that the Pope would not believe him, and asked"
for some visible sign. Then St. Laurence ungirt his robe and gave him
his girdle. When the Pope was accompanying him back to the basilica
"they met a funeral procession. To test the powers of the girdle, the"
"Pope laid it on the bier, and at once the dead arose and walked."
[Sidenote: The Miracles of St. Dominic.]
That is not the only miracle of resurrection offered to our credulity
by these ecclesiastical legends. The three principal frescoes in the
"chapter house of the church of St. Sisto, recently painted by the"
"Padre Besson, represent three miracles of St. Dominic--in each case of"
raising from the dead--the subjects being a mason who had fallen from
"a scaffold when building this monastery, a child, and the young Lord"
"Napoleone Orsini, who had been thrown from his horse and instantly"
"killed, and who was brought to life by St. Dominic on this spot, as"
is further commemorated by an inscription on the wall. But miracles
were nothing uncommon in the history of the founder of the powerful
"Dominican Order. In the refectory of St. Marco, at Florence, we had"
seen the fine fresco which represents the miraculous provision made
for him and his forty friars at a time of scarcity by two angels. The
refectory in which this miracle took place is at the Church of St.
"Sabina, on the Aventine, in Rome; but there are three other things at"
this church which interested us hardly less than the scene of that
"miracle. One of them is the huge, pumpkin-shaped, black stone, two or"
"three times as big as a man's head, which the devil is said to have"
the island he would carry him to Jamaica to be hanged.
"Soon after Holford's departure another ship put in for water, none of the"
"crew of which knew Vane by sight, and he was too crafty to let them find"
out the notorious pirate he was. They consented to take off the
"shipwrecked mariner, when, just as all seemed to be going well, back came"
"the ship of friend Holford. Holford, who seems to have been a sociable"
"kind of man, was well acquainted with the captain who was befriending"
"Vane, and Holford was invited to dine on board his ship. As the guest was"
passing along the deck of his host's ship on his way to the great cabin he
"chanced to glance down the open hold, and there who should he see but his"
dear old friend Vane hard at work; for he had already won his new master's
"good graces by being a ""brisk hand."" Holford at once informed his host"
"that he was entertaining a notorious pirate, and with his consent clapped"
"Vane in irons, and removed him to his own ship, and when he arrived in"
"Jamaica handed his old friend to the justices, who quickly tried,"
to the relative frequency of occurrence of hæmothorax I should have
placed it at about 30 per cent. The patients in these early battles
"needed little wagon transport, and when sent down to the Base travelled"
in comfortable ambulance trains. After the commencement of the march
"from Modder River to Bloemfontein, however, these conditions were"
"changed, and all the chest as other cases were exposed to the necessity"
of three days and nights' journey to the Stationary hospitals and
"afterwards to the long journey to Cape Town. Of these patients, at"
least 90 per cent. suffered with hæmothorax of varying degrees of
severity.
"In some cases, the least common, signs of considerable intra-pleural"
"hæmorrhage immediately followed the wound; in others, the accumulation"
"of blood was gradual, and only manifest in any degree at the end of"
"three or four days, when it became stationary if the patient was kept at"
rest. In a second series the hæmorrhage was of the recurrent variety;
potentialities of his race for evolving modes of expression demanded by
the period of transition in which he was placed. They found expression
"in great constructive work, in the restoration of quiet amidst disorder,"
"in the earliest effort to spread education both among men and women, in"
"questions of social welfare, in industrial efforts, in the establishment"
of people's Bank and in the foundation of industrial and technical
schools. And behind all these efforts lay a burning love for his country
and its nobler traditions.
MATTERS EDUCATIONAL
In educational matters he had very definite ideas which is now becoming
more fully appreciated. English schools were at that time not only
regarded as the only efficient medium for instruction. While my father's
subordinates sent their children to the English schools intended for
"gentle folks, I was sent to the vernacular school where my comrades were"
"hardy sons of toilers and of others who, it is now the fashion to"
"regard, were belonging to the depressed classes. From these who tilled"
the ground and made the land blossom with green verdure and ripening
"corn, and the sons of the fisher folk, who told stories of the strange"
creatures that frequented the unknown depths of mighty rivers and
"stagnant pools, I first derived the lesson of that which constitutes"
true manhood. From them too I drew my love of nature. When I came home
accompanied by my comrades I found my mother waiting for us. She was an
"orthodox Hindu, yet the ""untouchableness"" of some of my school fellows"
did not produce any misgivings in her. She welcomed and fed all these as
her own children; for it is only true of the mother heart to go out and
enfold in her protecting care all those who needed succour and a
mother's affection. I now realise the object of my being sent at the
"most plastic period of my life to the vernacular school, where I was to"
"learn my own language, to think my own thoughts and to receive the"
jewels worn by an Isis of ancient Cadiz;[68] her ornaments were more
brilliant than those of a Spanish madonna.
"During the entire forenoon, from the moment that a noisy acclamation had"
"greeted the rising of the sun, the images of the gods were exposed to the"
silent adoration of the initiates.[69] Egypt is the country whence
"contemplative devotion penetrated into Europe. Then, in the afternoon, a"
second service was held to close the sanctuary.[70]
The daily liturgy must have been very absorbing. This innovation in the
Roman paganism was full of consequences. No longer were sacrifices offered
"to the god on certain occasions only, but twice a day elaborate services"
"were held. As with the Egyptians, whom Herodotus had termed the most"
"religious of all peoples,[71] devotion assumed a tendency to fill out the"
whole existence and to dominate private and public interests. The constant
"repetition of the same prayers {97} kept up and renewed faith, and, we"
"might say, people lived continually under the eyes of the gods."
Besides the daily rites of the Abydos liturgy the holidays marking the
beginning of the different seasons were celebrated at the same date every
year.[72] It was the same in Italy. The calendars have preserved the names
"of several of them, and of one, the _Navigium Isidis_, the rhetorician"
"Apuleius[73] has left us a brilliant description on which, to speak with"
"the ancients, he emptied all his color tubes. On March 5th, when navigation"
"reopened after the winter months, a gorgeous procession[74] marched to the"
"coast, and a ship consecrated to Isis, the protectress of sailors, was"
"launched. A burlesque group of masked persons opened the procession, then"
"came the women in white gowns strewing flowers, the _stolistes_ waving the"
garments of the goddess and the _dadophori_ with lighted torches. After
"these came the _hymnodes_, whose songs mingled in turn with the sharp sound"
of the cross-flutes and the ringing of the brass timbrels; then the throngs
"of the initiates, and finally the priests, with shaven heads and clad in"
"linen robes of a dazzling white, bearing the images of animal-faced gods"
"and strange symbols, as for instance a golden urn containing the sacred"
water of the Nile. The procession stopped in front of altars[75] erected
"along the road, and on these altars the sacred objects were uncovered for"
the veneration of the faithful. The strange and sumptuous magnificence of
these celebrations made a deep impression on the common people who loved
public entertainments.
But of all the celebrations connected with the worship of Isis the most
"stirring and the most suggestive {98} was the commemoration of the ""Finding"
"of Osiris"" (_Inventio_, [Greek: Heuresis]). Its antecedents date back to"
"remote antiquity. Since the time of the twelfth dynasty, and probably much"
"earlier, there had been held at Abydos and elsewhere a sacred performance"
"similar to the mysteries of our Middle Ages, in which the events of"
Osiris's passion and resurrection were reproduced. We are in possession of
"the ritual of those performances.[76] Issuing from the temple, the god fell"
"under Set's blows; around his body funeral lamentations were simulated, and"
"he was buried according to the rites; then Set was vanquished by Horus, and"
"Osiris, restored to life, reentered his temple triumphant over death."
The same myth was represented in almost the same manner at Rome at the
beginning of each November.[77] While the priests and the believers moaned
"and lamented, Isis in great distress sought the divine body of Osiris,"
"whose limbs had been scattered by Typhon. Then, after the corpse had been"
"found, rehabilitated and revived, there was a long outburst of joy, an"
exuberant jubilation that rang through the temples and the streets so
loudly that it annoyed the passers-by.
This mingled despair and enthusiasm acted as strongly upon the feelings of
"the believers as did the spring-holiday ceremony in the Phrygian religion,"
"and it acted through the same means. Moreover, there was an esoteric"
meaning attached to it that none but the pious elect understood. Besides
"type, the publisher has had a designer at work upon a cover sketch,"
and an artist upon such illustrations as the book requires. All this
has to fall in with the publisher's general scheme for the book as a
whole. The designer must know what limits are placed upon him as to
"the number of inks or foils, or the amount of gold-leaf which he may"
employ. The artist must know whether his pictures are to be drawn for
"full color, two-color or one-color plates. In deciding these questions,"
the publisher is influenced by what he believes the book to require in
"its appeal to the public, and how great an expense is warranted by the"
probability of its success.
ENGRAVING
The illustrations in all except the most pretentious volumes are either
"halftone or lineplate photo-engravings. In making a halftone plate, the"
picture or object to be reproduced is photographed through a screen
"consisting of a glass plate, diagonally ruled at right angles in two"
directions with lines numbering from fifty to four hundred to the
"inch. This screen is placed inside of the camera and in front of, and"
"very near, the chemically sensitized plate. The light reflected from"
"the object to be photographed, varying in intensity according to the"
"lights and shadows of the object, is focused on the sensitized plate"
"through the intervening line screen, and affects the sensitized film"
more or less according to its intensity. This causes a chemical change
"of such nature that the next following operations, the development"
"and the intensification of the picture, result in producing it in the"
"form of dots and stipples varying in size, and consequently in the"
"respective light and shade effects, according to the varying lights"
and shadows of the original. Inasmuch as the lights show dark and the
"darks light, the picture on the glass makes a negative of the subject."
"This negative is placed in a printing frame, in close contact with a"
"Volant_, from a French pirate, and made her his own flagship, christening"
her the _Satisfaction_.
In 1670 the greatest event of Morgan's life took place--the sacking of
Panama. First landing a party which took the Castle of San Lorenzo at the
"mouth of the Chagres River, Morgan left a strong garrison there to cover"
"his retreat and pushed on with 1,400 men in a fleet of canoes up the river"
"on January 9th, 1671. The journey across the isthmus, through the tropical"
"jungle, was very hard on the men, particularly as they had depended on"
"finding provisions to supply their wants on the way, and carried no food"
"with them. They practically starved until the sixth day, when they found a"
"barn full of maize, which the fleeing Spaniards had neglected to destroy."
On the evening of the ninth day a scout reported he had seen the steeple
"of a church in Panama. Morgan, with that touch of genius which so often"
"brought him success, attacked the city from a direction the Spaniards had"
"not thought possible, so that their guns were all placed where they were"
"useless, and they were compelled to do just what the buccaneer leader"
"wanted them to do--namely, to come out of their fortifications and fight"
him in the open. The battle raged fiercely for two hours between the brave
Spanish defenders and the equally brave but almost exhausted buccaneers.
"When at last the Spaniards turned and ran, the buccaneers were too tired"
"to immediately follow up their success, but after resting they advanced,"
and at the end of three hours' street fighting the city was theirs. The
first thing Morgan now did was to assemble all his men and strictly forbid
"them to drink any wine, telling them that he had secret information that"
the wine had been poisoned by the Spaniards before they left the city.
"This was, of course, a scheme of Morgan's to stop his men from becoming"
"drunk, when they would be at the mercy of the enemy, as had happened in"
many a previous buccaneer assault.
"Morgan now set about plundering the city, a large part of which was burnt"
"to the ground, though whether this was done by his orders or by the"
"the third metacarpal was pulverised, although the bullet, which"
"was longitudinally flanged, was retained."
"(162) Wounded outside Heilbron. _Entry_, below the eighth right"
"costal cartilage; _exit_, below the eighth cartilage of the"
left side. The wound of entry was slightly oval; that of exit
continued out as a 'flame'-like groove for 2 inches. A week
later the wound track could be palpated as an evident hard
continuous cord.
_Penetration of the intestinal area without definite evidence of
visceral injury._--This accident occurred with a sufficient degree of
"frequency to obtain the greatest importance, both from the point of view"
"of diagnosis and prognosis, and as affecting the question of operative"
interference. Amongst the cases reported below a number occurred in
which it was impossible to settle the question whether injury to the
"bowel had occurred or not, and I will here shortly give what explanation"
I can for the apparent escape of the intestine from serious injury.
We may first recall the general question of the escape of structures
lying to one or other side of the track of the bullet. I believe that
there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the remarks already made as
"to the escape of such structures as the nerves by means of displacement,"
and that the occurrence of such escapes is manifestly dependent on the
degree of fixity of the nerve or the special segment of it implicated.
The general tendency of the tissues around the tracks to escape
"extensive destruction from actual contusion has also been referred to,"
"and is, I think, indisputable."
"If these observations be accepted, I think there can be no difficulty in"
allowing that the small intestine is exceptionally well arranged to
"escape injury. First of all, it is very moveable; secondly, it is so"
friendship--Aversion to disturbance of any kind--Too much
concerned about other men's opinions--Need of self-
justification--Himself never in the wrong--Correlation
between inclinations and convictions--Ideal image of
himself--Dissatisfaction with himself--Self-centredness--A
solitary at heart--Fastidiousness--Suspiciousness--Morbid
mistrust--Unhappiness--Restlessness--Unsolved contradictions of
his being--Horror of lies--Reserve and insinuation
Erasmus's powerful mind met with a great response in the heart of his
contemporaries and had a lasting influence on the march of civilization.
But one of the heroes of history he cannot be called. Was not his
failure to attain to still loftier heights partly due to the fact that
his character was not on a level with the elevation of his mind?
"And yet that character, a very complicated one, though he took himself"
"to be the simplest man in the world, was determined by the same factors"
which determined the structure of his mind. Again and again we find in
his inclinations the correlates of his convictions.
At the root of his moral being we find--a key to the understanding of
his character--that same profound need of purity which drove him to the
sources of sacred science. Purity in the material and the moral sense is
"what he desires for himself and others, always and in all things. Few"
things revolt him so much as the practices of vintners who doctor wine
and dealers who adulterate food. If he continually chastens his language
"and style, or exculpates himself from mistakes, it is the same impulse"
"which prompts his passionate desire for cleanliness and brightness, of"
the home and of the body. He has a violent dislike of stuffy air and
smelly substances. He regularly takes a roundabout way to avoid a
malodorous lane; he loathes shambles and fishmongers' shops. Fetors
"his voice created divinities,[55] as originally the almighty voice of Thoth"
had created the world.[56]
The ritual that conferred such superhuman power[57] developed in Egypt into
"a state of perfection, completeness and splendor unknown in the Occident."
"It possessed a unity, a precision and a permanency that stood in striking"
"contrast to the variety of the myths, the uncertainty of the dogmas and the"
arbitrariness of the interpretations. The sacred books of the Greco-Roman
period are a faithful reproduction of the texts that were engraved upon the
"walls of the pyramids at the dawn of history, notwithstanding the centuries"
that had passed. Even under the Cæsars the ancient ceremonies dating back
"to the first ages of Egypt, were scrupulously performed because the"
smallest word and the least gesture had their importance.
This ritual and the attitude toward it found their way for the most part
into the Latin temples of Isis and Serapis. This fact has long been
"ignored, but there can be no doubt about it. A first proof is that the"
clergy of those temples were organized just like those of Egypt during the
period of the Ptolemies.[58] There was a hierarchy presided over by a high
"priest, which consisted of _prophetes_ skilled in the sacred science,"
"_stolistes_, or _ornatrices_,[59] whose office it was to dress the statues"
"of the gods, _pastophori_ who carried the sacred temple plates in the"
"processions, and so on, just as in Egypt. As in their native country, the"
"priests were distinguished from common mortals by a tonsure, by a linen"
"tunic, and by their habits as well as by their garb. They devoted"
themselves entirely to their ministry and had no other profession. This
"{95} sacerdotal body always remained Egyptian in character, if not in"
"nationality, because the liturgy it had to perform remained so. In a"
"similar manner the priests of the Baals were Syrians,[60] because they were"
the only ones that knew how to honor the gods of Syria.
In the first place a daily service had to be held just as in the Nile
"an eminent Russian poet, Alexander Block, who has since died as the"
"result of privations. The Bolsheviks allowed him to teach æsthetics, but"
he complained that they insisted on his teaching the subject “from a
Marxian point of view.” He had been at a loss to discover how the theory
"of rhythmics was connected with Marxism, although, to avoid starvation,"
"he had done his best to find out. Of course, it has been impossible in"
Russia ever since the Bolsheviks came into power to print anything
critical of the dogmas upon which their regime is founded.
The examples of America and Russia illustrate the conclusion to which we
"seem to be driven—namely, that so long as men continue to have the"
present fanatical belief in the importance of politics free thought on
"political matters will be impossible, and there is only too much danger"
"that the lack of freedom will spread to all other matters, as it has"
done in Russia. Only some degree of political scepticism can save us
from this misfortune.
It must not be supposed that the officials in charge of education desire
"the young to become educated. On the contrary, their problem is to"
impart information without imparting intelligence. Education should have
"two objects: first, to give definite knowledge—reading and writing,"
"languages and mathematics, and so on; secondly, to create those mental"
habits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and form sound
"judgments for themselves. The first of these we may call information,"
the second intelligence. The utility of information is admitted
practically as well as theoretically; without a literate population a
modern State is impossible. But the utility of intelligence is admitted
"only theoretically, not practically; it is not desired that ordinary"
"people should think for themselves, because it is felt that people who"
think for themselves are awkward to manage and cause administrative
"difficulties. Only the guardians, in Plato’s language, are to think; the"
"rest are to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of sheep. This"
INJURIES TO THE INTESTINAL TRACT
1. _Wounds of the stomach._--A considerable number of wounds in such a
"situation as to have possibly implicated the stomach were observed, and"
of these a certain number recovered spontaneously. The only two
instances that came under my own observation are recorded below. It will
be noted that in each the special symptoms were the classic ones of
vomiting and hæmatemesis. In the first case blood was also passed per
"anum, and in the second the diagnosis was reinforced by the escape of"
stomach contents from the external wound.
The second case was a surgical disappointment. No doubt the fatal issue
was mainly dependent on the fact that the external wound had to be kept
open to allow of the escape of the abundant discharge from the wounded
"liver. In the absence of the hepatic wound, however, I believe it would"
"have been possible for this patient to have got well spontaneously, in"
view of the firm adhesions which had formed around the opening in the
"stomach, and the consequent localisation which had been effected."
Another unfortunate element in this case was the comminuted fracture of
"the seventh costal cartilage, which maintained the patency of the"
"aperture of exit. The latter point, however, was of doubtful importance"
"from this aspect, as the vent provided for the gastric and biliary"
secretions may have been the safety-valve that had allowed localisation
to develop.
I believe that the secondary hæmorrhage was the main element in robbing
"us of a success in this case, and that this depended on the digestion of"
the wound by the gastric secretion. The early troubles which arose in
the treatment of this patient well illustrate the difficulties by which
the military surgeon is at times met; but the patient was admirably
"attended to and nursed by my friend Mr. Pershouse, and an orderly who"
deaths that take place. Everywhere hurried action and unreasoning
instinct give place to deliberation and debate. Between this play and
its predecessors no change can be more sweeping or more abrupt. In an
"instant, as it were, we pass from the unpolished _Cambyses_, savage and"
"reeking with blood, to the equally violent events of _Gorboduc_, cold"
"beneath a formal restraint which, regulating their setting in the"
"general framework, robs them of more than half their force. Had this"
severe discipline of the emotions been accepted as for ever binding upon
the tragic stage Elizabethan drama would have been forgotten. The truth
is that the germ of dissension was sown in _Gorboduc_ itself. Conscious
"that the banishment of action from the stage, while natural enough in"
"Greece, must meet with an overwhelming resistance from the popular"
"custom in England, the authors, Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton,"
invented a compromise. Before each act they provided a symbolical Dumb
"Show which, by its external position, infringed no classical law, yet"
satisfied the demand of an English audience for real deeds and
"melodramatic spectacles. It was an ingenious idea, the effect of which"
was to keep intact the close link between stage and action until the
native genius should be strong enough to cast aside its swaddling
clothes and follow its own bent without hurt. As illustrating this
innovation--the reader will not have forgotten that both Dumb Show and
Chorus are to be found in _Pericles_--we may quote the directions for
the Dumb Show before the second act.
"First, the music of cornets began to play, during which came in"
upon the stage a king accompanied with a number of his nobility and
gentlemen. And after he had placed himself in a chair of estate
"prepared for him, there came and kneeled before him a grave and"
"aged gentleman, and offered up unto him a cup of wine in a glass,"
which the king refused. After him comes a brave and lusty young
"gentleman, and presents the king with a cup of gold filled with"
"poison, which the king accepted, and drinking the same, immediately"
the public ceremonies there was a secret worship to which one was admitted
only after a gradual initiation. The hero of Apuleius had to submit to the
ordeal three times in order to obtain the whole revelation. In Egypt the
{99} clergy communicated certain rites and interpretations only upon a
promise not to reveal them. In fact this was the case in the worship of
Isis at Abydos and elsewhere.[78] When the Ptolemies regulated the Greek
"ritual of their new religion, it assumed the form of the mysteries spread"
over the Hellenic world and became very like those of Eleusis. The hand of
the Eumolpid Timotheus is noticeable in this connection.[79]
But while the ceremonial of the initiations and even the production of the
"liturgic drama were thus adapted to the religious habits of the Greeks, the"
doctrinal contents of the Alexandrian mysteries remained purely Egyptian.
The old belief that immortality could be secured by means of an
identification of the deceased with Osiris or Serapis never died out.
Perhaps in no other people did the epigram of Fustel de Coulanges find so
"complete a verification as in the Egyptians: ""Death was the first mystery;"
"it started man on the road to the other mysteries.""[80] Nowhere else was"
life so completely dominated by preoccupation with life after death;
nowhere else was such minute and complicated care taken to secure and
"perpetuate another existence for the deceased. The funeral literature, of"
"which we have found a very great number of documents, had acquired a"
"development equaled by no other, and the architecture of no other nation"
can exhibit tombs comparable with the pyramids or the rock-built sepulchers
of Thebes.
This constant endeavor to secure an after-existence for one's self and
"relatives manifested itself in various ways, but it finally assumed a"
"concrete form in the worship of Osiris. The fate of Osiris, the god who"
"died and returned to life, became the prototype of the {100} fate of every"
"human being that observed the funeral rites. ""As truly as Osiris lives,"""
"instincts, and a fervent desire to free the soul from the bonds of matter."
The ascetic tendencies went so far as to create a kind of begging
monachism--the _métragyrtes_. They also harmonized with some of the ideas
"of renunciation taught by Greek philosophy, and at an early period Hellenic"
theologians took an interest in this devotion that attracted and repelled
"them at the same time. Timotheus the Eumolpid, who was one of the founders"
"of the Alexandrian religion of Serapis, derived the inspiration for his"
"essays on religious reform, among other sources, from the ancient Phrygian"
myths. Those thinkers undoubtedly succeeded in making the priests of
Pessinus themselves admit many speculations quite foreign to the old
Anatolian nature worship. The votaries of Cybele began at a very remote
"period to practise ""mysteries""[7] in which the initiates were made"
"acquainted, by degrees, with a wisdom that was always considered divine,"
but underwent peculiar variations in the course of time.
*       *       *       *       *
Such is the religion which the rough Romans of the Punic wars accepted and
adopted. Hidden under theological and cosmological doctrines it contained
"an ancient stock of very primitive and coarse religious ideas, such as the"
"worship of trees, stones and animals. Besides this superstitious fetichism"
"it involved ceremonies that were both sensual and ribald, including all the"
wild and mystic rites of the bacchanalia which the public authorities were
to prohibit a few years later.
When the senate became better acquainted with the divinity imposed upon it
"by the Sibyls, it must have been quite embarrassed by the present of King"
Attalus. {52} The enthusiastic transports and the somber fanaticism of the
Phrygian worship contrasted violently with the calm dignity and respectable
"reserve of the official religion, and excited the minds of the people to a"
dangerous degree. The emasculated Galli were the objects of contempt and
disgust and what in their own eyes was a meritorious act was made a crime
disapproved. But at the same time he hardly dared to expect that the
labours of a lifetime could be set aside at the bidding of a man so
"much his junior, and to say the truth it is doubtful whether Hamilton"
"ever fully grasped his opponent's point of view. Still, Ferrier tells"
us that from first to last his whole intercourse with Sir William
Hamilton was marked with more pleasure and less pain than ever attended
"his intercourse with any human being, and after Hamilton was gone he"
cherished that memory with affectionate esteem. A touching account is
given in Sir William's life of how during that terrible illness which
"so sadly impaired his powers and nearly took his life, Ferrier might be"
seen pacing to and fro on the street opposite his bedroom window during
"the whole anxious night, watching for indications of his condition, yet"
"unwilling to intrude on the attendants, and unable to tear himself from"
the spot where his friend was possibly passing through the last agony.
Such friendship is honourable to both men concerned.
"Perhaps, then, it was this intercourse with kindred spirits (for many"
such were in the habit of gathering at the Professor's house) that
caused Ferrier finally to determine to make philosophy the pursuit of
"his life--this combined, it may be, with the interest in letters which"
he could not fail to derive from his own immediate circle. He was in
"constant communication with Susan Ferrier, his aunt, who encouraged his"
"literary bent to the utmost of her power. Then Professor Wilson, his"
"uncle, though of a very different character from his own, attracted him"
by his brightness and wit--a brightness which he says he can hardly
"bring before himself, far less communicate to others who had not known"
"him. Perhaps, as the same friend quoted before suggests, the attraction"
was partly due to another source. He says: 'How Ferrier got on with
Wilson I never could divine; unless it were through the bright eyes of
his daughter. Wilson and Ferrier seemed to me as opposite as the poles;
"the one all poetry, the other all prose. But the youth probably yielded"
to the mature majesty and genius of the man. Had they met on equal
"In the first place, this cult was said to exercise a corrupting influence"
"perversive of piety. Its morals were loose, and the mystery surrounding it"
"excited the worst suspicions. Moreover, it appealed violently to the"
emotions and senses. All these factors offended the grave decency that a
Roman was wont to {82} maintain in the presence of the gods. The innovators
had every defender of the _mos maiorum_ for an adversary.
"In the second place, this religion had been founded, supported and"
propagated by the Ptolemies; it came from a country that was almost hostile
to Italy during the last period of the republic;[26] it issued from
"Alexandria, whose superiority Rome felt and feared. Its secret societies,"
"made up chiefly of people of the lower classes, might easily become clubs"
of agitators and haunts of spies. All these motives for suspicion and
hatred were undoubtedly more potent in exciting persecution than the purely
"theological reasons, and persecution was stopped or renewed according to"
the vicissitudes of general politics.
"As we have stated, the chapels consecrated to Isis were demolished in the"
"year 48 B. C. After Cæsar's death, the triumvirs decided in 43 B. C. to"
"erect a temple in her honor out of the public funds, undoubtedly to gain"
the favor of the masses. This action would have implied official
"recognition, but the project appears never to have been executed. If Antony"
"had succeeded at Actium, Isis and Serapis would have entered Rome in"
"triumph, but they were vanquished with Cleopatra; and when Augustus had"
"become the master of the empire, he professed a deep aversion for the gods"
"of his former enemies. Moreover, he could not have suffered the intrusion"
"of the Egyptian clergy into the Roman sacerdotal class, whose guardian,"
restorer and chief he was. In 28 B. C. an ordinance was issued forbidding
the erecting of altars to the Alexandrian divinities inside the sacred
"enclosure of the _pomerium_, and seven years later Agrippa extended this"
prohibitive regulation to a radius of a thousand paces around the {83}
city. Tiberius acted on the same principle and in 19 A. D. instituted the
frenzy.[17] Then followed a mysterious vigil during which the mystic was
supposed to be united as a new Attis with the great goddess.[18] On March
25th there was a sudden transition from the shouts of despair to a
"delirious jubilation, the _Hilaria_. With springtime Attis awoke from his"
"sleep of death, and the joy created by his resurrection burst out in wild"
"merry-making, wanton masquerades, and luxurious banquets. After twenty-four"
"hours of an indispensable rest (_requietio_), the festivities wound up, on"
"the twenty-seventh, with a long and gorgeous procession through the streets"
of Rome and surrounding country districts. Under a constant rain of flowers
the silver statue of Cybele was taken to the river Almo and bathed and
purified according to an ancient rite (_lavatio_).
The worship of the Mother of the Gods had penetrated into the Hellenic
"countries long before it was received at Rome, but in Greece it assumed a"
peculiar form and lost most of its barbarous character. The Greek mind felt
an unconquerable aversion to the dubious nature of Attis. The _Magna
"Mater_, who is thoroughly different from her Hellenized sister, penetrated"
into all Latin provinces and imposed herself upon them with the Roman
"religion. This was the case in Spain, Brittany, the Danubian countries,"
Africa and especially in Gaul.[19] As late as the fourth century the car of
the goddess drawn by steers was led in great state through the fields and
vineyards of Autun in order to stimulate their fertility.[20] In the
"provinces the _dendrophori_, who carried the sacred pine in the spring"
"festivities, formed associations recognized by the state. These"
"associations had charge of the work of our {58} modern fire departments,"
besides their religious mission. In case of necessity these woodcutters and
"carpenters, who knew how to fell the divine tree of Attis, were also able"
to cut down the timbers of burning buildings. All over the empire religion
and the brotherhoods connected with it were under the high supervision of
"the quindecimvirs of the capital, who gave the priests their insignia. The"
sacerdotal hierarchy and the rights granted to the priesthood and believers
were minutely defined in a series of senate decrees. These Phrygian
"But the cases being so dissimilar, Grey did not see that he need debar"
"himself from this easy highroad to fortunes, as it then seemed.  Nobody"
was dependent upon him.  Nobody was there to grieve over his troubles or
to rejoice over his success.  His honest serving-man was in sooth the
only being in any way deeply attached to him; and Dick was as delighted
"at his master’s brave appearance, and at the golden stream running into"
"his pocket, as though he had achieved some great success or triumph."
There was one way by which Grey had pocketed considerable sums of money
"that was very congenial to him, and had given him some very happy hours."
"This was the speed and strength of his horse, which Lord Sandford had"
"made boast of, vowing in the hearing of some of the smartest dandies of"
the town that Don Carlos would beat any steed against whom he was
"pitted—a challenge eagerly taken up by the young bloods, proud of their"
"own horses and horsemanship, to whom trials of skill and strength, and"
"contests over which wagers might freely be exchanged, were as the very"
salt of life.
"So either out at Hampstead, or at Richmond or Hampton Court, Don Carlos"
"had been set to show the metal of which he was made, and had come off"
"easy victor in every race and every match, whether flat running, or"
"leaping, or a course of the nature of a steeplechase had been elected."
"His strength and speed, sagacity and endurance, had never once failed"
"him, and already he was the talk of the town, and Grey could have sold"
him for a great price had he been willing to part with his favourite.
"Many bright eyes had smiled upon the young centaur, many languishing"
glances had been cast at him.  He had been called up again and again to
"be presented to some high-born dame, or some bevy of laughing maidens,"
"and he had bowed with courtly grace, and received their sugared"
compliments with suitable acknowledgments.  But no face had attracted
"him as that face he had seen once at the water theatre, almost upon his"
newspapers.
If I am asked how the world is to be induced to adopt these two
maxims—namely (1) that jobs should be given to people on account of
their fitness to perform them; (2) that one aim of education should be
to cure people of the habit of believing propositions for which there is
no evidence—I can only say that it must be done by generating an
enlightened public opinion. And an enlightened public opinion can only
be generated by the efforts of those who desire that it should exist. I
"do not believe that the economic changes advocated by Socialists will,"
"of themselves, do anything towards curing the evils we have been"
"considering. I think that, whatever happens in politics, the trend of"
economic development will make the preservation of mental freedom
"increasingly difficult, unless public opinion insists that the employer"
shall control nothing in the life of the employee except his work.
"Freedom in education could easily be secured, if it were desired, by"
"limiting the function of the State to inspection and payment, and"
"confining inspection rigidly to the definite instruction. But that, as"
"things stand, would leave education in the hands of the Churches,"
"because, unfortunately, they are more anxious to teach their beliefs"
"than Freethinkers are to teach their doubts. It would, however, give a"
"free field, and would make it possible for a liberal education to be"
given if it were really desired. More than that ought not to be asked of
the law.
My plea throughout this address has been for the spread of the
"scientific temper, which is an altogether different thing from the"
knowledge of scientific results. The scientific temper is capable of
regenerating mankind and providing an issue for all our troubles. The
"results of science, in the form of mechanism, poison gas, and the yellow"
"press, bid fair to lead to the total downfall of our civilization. It is"
"a curious antithesis, which a Martian might contemplate with amused"
"Forest Chapel and went into the woods. He put his lip to the earth,"
"and lifted a green leaf to his brow, and held a branch to his ear,"
"and because he was no longer heavy with the sweet clay of mortality,"
"though yet of human clan he heard that which we do not hear, and saw"
"that which we do not see, and knew that which we do not know. All the"
"green life was his. In that new world, he saw the lives of trees, now"
"pale green, now of woodsmoke blue, now of amethyst; the gray lives of"
"stone; breaths of the grass and reed, creatures of the air, delicate"
"and wild as fawns, or swift and fierce and terrible, tigers, of that"
"undiscovered wilderness, with birds almost invisible but for their"
"luminous wings, and opalescent crests.”"
The value of this particular passage is the mystery pervading the whole
"picture, which forms so beautiful an antidote to the eternal explaining"
of things. I think it of the highest importance for children to realise
that the best and most beautiful things cannot be expressed in everyday
language and that they must content themselves with a flash here and
there of the beauty which may come later. One does not enhance the
beauty of the mountain by pulling to pieces some of the earthy clogs:
one does not increase the impression of a vast ocean by analysing the
single drops of water. But at a reverent distance one gets a clear
"impression of the whole, and can afford to leave the details in the"
shadow.
In presenting such passages (and it must be done very sparingly)
experience has taught me that we should take the children into our
confidence by telling them frankly that nothing exciting is going
"to happen, so that they will be free to listen to the mere words. A"
very interesting experiment might occasionally be made by asking the
children some weeks afterwards to tell you in their own words what
pictures were made on their minds. This is a very different thing from
"allowing the children to reproduce the passage at once, the danger of"
"Bay, Cuba, devoted his energies to studying, and obtaining diplomas"
"in, mechano-therapy and suggestive therapeutics, as well as becoming"
proficient in Esperanto. The keepers of two other American lights set
"themselves to the mastery of jurisprudence, and in due course resigned"
"their positions and rented offices in the city, where in the course of"
a few years they built up very remunerative legal practices. As a rule
"the lighthouse-keeper is an expert handy-man, as he is compelled to"
complete a whole list of duties in addition to maintaining the lights.
In the summer the metal and wooden lights have to be given a coat of
"paint, while plumbing and other displays of skill in metal have to be"
"carried out, even if only temporarily."
"The calling is exceedingly healthy, which accounts for the immunity"
"from illness which these men enjoy. Also, as a rule, the land-lights"
are set amidst wild romantic surroundings. Some years ago a number of
"American families, in the search for a quiet, health-restoring rest,"
"were in the habit of spending their vacations at lighthouses, to the"
"financial profit of the keepers. Eventually, however, the authorities,"
"fearing that the keeper might be distracted from his duties, issued a"
"summary order forbidding this practice, much to the disgust of the men,"
and “attractive lighthouse apartments” became a thing of the past. In
Great Britain an order was issued that “no ale or other intoxicating
liquor be allowed to be sold in any lighthouse.” The precise reason for
"this strange ordinance is not quite clear, but it is significant to"
note that it came into force immediately after the disastrous fire at
"the Leasowe lighthouse, on the Wirral shore."
The lighthouse invariably is an object of attraction among the general
"public, but this interest seldom goes to the length narrated by a"
keeper of one of the West Indian lights. One night two of the men at
this particular station decided to hunt for red crabs on the beach
"below. They started off with a hurricane lamp, but were astonished,"
"be regarded as abnormal, they occur in persons who are perfectly healthy"
and sane.
"It will be seen that a synaesthesia--which may involve taste, smell,"
and other senses besides hearing and sight--causes an impression of one
sensory order to be automatically and involuntarily linked on to an
"impression of another totally different order. In other words, we may say"
"that the one impression becomes the _symbol_ of the other impression, for"
a symbol--which is literally a throwing together--means that two things
of different orders have become so associated that one of them may be
regarded as the sign and representative of the other.
"There is, however, another still more natural and fundamental form of"
"symbolism which is entirely normal, and almost, indeed, physiological."
This is the tendency by which qualities of one order become symbols of
"qualities of a totally different order, because they instinctively seem"
"to have a similar effect on us. In this way, things in the physical"
order become symbols of things in the spiritual order. This symbolism
penetrates indeed the whole of language; we cannot escape from it. The
"sea is _deep_, and so also may thoughts be; ice is _cold_, and we say"
"the same of some hearts; sugar is _sweet_, as the lover finds also the"
"presence of the beloved; quinine is _bitter_, and so is remorse. Not only"
"our adjectives, but our substantives and our verbs are equally symbolical."
"To the etymological eye every sentence is full of metaphor, of symbol,"
"of images that, strictly and originally, express sensory impressions of"
"one order, but, as we use them to-day, express impressions of a totally"
different order. Language is largely the utilisation of symbols. This is a
well-recognised fact which it is unnecessary to elaborate.[131]
"An interesting example of the natural tendency to symbolism, which may"
"be compared to the allied tendency in dreaming, is furnished by another"
"language, the language of music. Music is a representation of the"
"Greek. This was a radical change. The philosopher Demetrius of Phalerum,"
"who had been cured of blindness by Serapis, composed poems in honor of the"
god that were still sung under the Cæsars several centuries later.[5] We
"can easily imagine that the poets, who lived on the bounty of the"
"Ptolemies, vied with each other in their efforts to celebrate their"
"benefactors' god, and the old rituals that were translated from the"
Egyptian were also enriched with {76} edifying bits of original
"inspiration. A hymn to Isis, found on a marble monument in the island of"
"Andros,[6] gives us some idea of these sacred compositions, although it is"
of more recent date.
"In the second place, the artists replaced the old hieratic idols by more"
attractive images and gave them the beauty of the immortals. It is not
known who created the figure of Isis draped in a linen gown with a fringed
"cloak fastened over the breast, whose sweet meditative, graciously maternal"
face is a combination of the ideals imagined for Hera and Aphrodite. But we
know the sculptor of the first statue of Serapis that stood in the great
"sanctuary of Alexandria until the end of paganism. This statue, the"
"prototype of all the copies that have been preserved, is a colossal work of"
"art made of precious materials by a famous Athenian sculptor named Bryaxis,"
a contemporary of Scopas. It was one of the last divine creations of
"Hellenic genius. The majestic head, with its somber and yet benevolent"
"expression, with its abundance of hair, and with a crown in the shape of a"
"bushel, bespoke the double character of a god ruling at the same time both"
the fertile earth and the dismal realm of the dead.[7]
"As we see, the Ptolemies had given their new religion a literary and"
artistic shape that was capable of attracting the most refined and cultured
minds. But the adaptation to the Hellenic feeling and thinking was not
"exclusively external. Osiris, the god whose worship was thus renewed, was"
more adapted than any other to lend his authority to the formation of a
"syncretic faith. At a very early period, in fact before the time of"
"would have made it illegal, during the War, to teach the doctrine that"
"the Kaiser’s Government should be overthrown by force; and, since then,"
the support of Kolchak or Denikin against the Soviet Government would
"have been illegal. Such consequences, of course, were not intended, and"
result only from bad draughtsmanship. What was intended appears from
"another law passed at the same time, applying to teachers in State"
schools. This law provides that certificates permitting persons to teach
in such schools shall be issued only to those who have “shown
satisfactorily” that they are “loyal and obedient to the Government of
"this State and of the United States,” and shall be refused to those who"
"have advocated, no matter where or when, “a form of government other"
than the Government of this State or of the United States.” The
"committee which framed these laws, as quoted by the _New Republic_, laid"
it down that the teacher who “does not approve of the present social
"system......must surrender his office,” and that “no person who is not"
eager to combat the theories of social change should be entrusted with
the task of fitting the young and old for the responsibilities of
"citizenship.” Thus, according to the law of the State of New York,"
Christ and George Washington were too degraded morally to be fit for the
"education of the young. If Christ were to go to New York and say,"
"“Suffer the little children to come unto me,” the President of the New"
"York School Board would reply: “Sir, I see no evidence that you are"
"eager to combat theories of social change. Indeed, I have heard it said"
"that you advocate what you call the _kingdom_ of heaven, whereas this"
"country, thank God, is a republic. It is clear that the Government of"
your kingdom of heaven would differ materially from that of New York
"State, therefore no children will be allowed access to you.” If he"
"failed to make this reply, he would not be doing his duty as a"
functionary entrusted with the administration of the law.
"The effect of such laws is very serious. Let it be granted, for the sake"
"of argument, that the government and the social system in the State of"
"the Palatine, and Caligula's successor could not but grant to the Phrygian"
"goddess, so long established in the city, the favor accorded the Egyptian"
divinity who had been admitted into Rome but very recently. In this way
Claudius prevented too great an ascendency in Italy of this second stranger
and supplied a distributary to the current of popular superstition. Isis
must have been held under great {56} suspicion by a ruler who clung to old
national institutions.[14]
The Emperor Claudius introduced a new cycle of holidays that were
"celebrated from March 15th to March 27th, the beginning of spring at the"
"time of the revival of vegetation, personified in Attis. The various acts"
of this grand mystic drama are tolerably well known. The prelude was a
procession of _cannophori_ or reed-bearers on the fifteenth; undoubtedly
"they commemorated Cybele's discovery of Attis, who, according to the"
"legends, had been exposed while a child on the banks of the Sangarius, the"
"largest river of Phrygia, or else this ceremony may have been the"
transformation of an ancient phallephory intended to guarantee the
fertility of the fields.[15] The ceremonies proper began with the equinox.
A pine was felled and transferred to the temple of the Palatine by a
"brotherhood that owed to this function its name of ""tree-bearers"""
(_dendrophori_). Wrapped like a corpse in woolen bands and garlands of
"violets, this pine represented Attis dead. This god was originally only the"
"spirit of the plants, and the honors given to the ""March-tree""[16] in front"
of the imperial palace perpetuated a very ancient agrarian rite of the
Phrygian peasants. The next day was a day of sadness and abstinence on
which the believers fasted and mourned the defunct god. The twenty-fourth
bore the significant name of _Sanguis_ in the calendars. We know that it
"was the celebration of the funeral of Attis, whose manes were appeased by"
"means of libations of blood, as was done for any mortal. Mingling their"
"piercing cries with the shrill sound of flutes, the Galli flagellated"
"themselves and cut their flesh, and neophytes performed the supreme {57}"
"sacrifice with the aid of a sharp stone, being insensible to pain in their"
that we recognise as psychologists. Stewart tries to reinstate it by an
"appeal to 'direct observation,' an appeal which, Ferrier truly says, is"
"manifestly absurd; reasoning is useless, and we must, it would appear,"
allow any efforts we might make towards rectifying our position to be
recognised as futile.
"But now, Ferrier says, the metaphysical solution of the problem comes"
"in. We are in an _impasse_, it would appear; the analysis of the given"
fact is found impossible. But the failure of psychology opens up the
way to metaphysic. 'The turning-round of thought from psychology to
metaphysic is the true interpretation of the Platonic conversion of the
"soul from ignorance to knowledge, from mere opinion to certainty and"
"satisfaction; in other words, from a discipline in which the thinking"
"is only _apparent_, to a discipline in which the thinking is _real_.'"
"'The difference is as great between ""the science of the human mind"" and"
"metaphysic, as it is between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican"
"astronomy, and it is very much of the same kind.' It is not that"
metaphysic proposes to do _more_ than psychology; it aims at nothing
"but what it can fully overtake, and does not propose to carry a man"
"farther than his tether extends, or the surroundings in which he finds"
"himself. Metaphysic in the hands of all true astronomers of thought,"
"from Plato to Hegel, if it accomplishes more, attempts less."
"Metaphysic, Ferrier says, demands the whole given fact, and that fact"
"is summed up in this: 'We apprehend the perception of an object,' and"
"nothing short of this suffices--that is, not the perception of matter,"
"but our apprehension of that perception, or what we before called"
"knowledge, ultimate knowledge in its widest sense. And this given fact"
"is unlike the mere perception of matter, for it is capable of analysis"
and is not simply subjective and egoistic. Psychology recognises
"perception on the one hand (subjective), and matter on the other"
"(objective), but metaphysic says the distinction ought to be drawn"
"Here, for once, in connection with these “Silhouettes,” I have not, if"
"my recollection serves me, been accused of actual immorality. I am but"
"a fair way along the “primrose path,” not yet within singeing distance"
"of the “everlasting bonfire.” In other words, I have not yet written"
"“London Nights,” which, it appears (I can scarcely realize it, in my"
"innocent abstraction in aesthetical matters), has no very salutary"
"reputation among the blameless moralists of the press. I need not,"
"therefore, on this occasion, concern myself with more than the curious"
fallacy by which there is supposed to be something inherently wrong in
artistic work which deals frankly and lightly with the very real charm
of the lighter emotions and the more fleeting sensations.
I do not wish to assert that the kind of verse which happened to
"reflect certain moods of mine at a certain period of my life, is the"
"best kind of verse in itself, or is likely to seem to me, in other"
"years, when other moods may have made me their own, the best kind of"
verse for my own expression of myself. Nor do I affect to doubt that
the creation of the supreme emotion is a higher form of art than the
"reflection of the most exquisite sensation, the evocation of the most"
magical impression. I claim only an equal liberty for the rendering of
every mood of that variable and inexplicable and contradictory creature
"which we call ourselves, of every aspect under which we are gifted or"
condemned to apprehend the beauty and strangeness and curiosity of the
visible world.
"Patchouli! Well, why not Patchouli? Is there any “reason in nature” why"
"we should write exclusively about the natural blush, if the delicately"
"acquired blush of rouge has any attraction for us? Both exist; both, I"
"think, are charming in their way; and the latter, as a subject, has, at"
"all events, more novelty. If you prefer your “new-mown hay” in the"
"hayfield, and I, it may be, in a scent-bottle, why may not my"
"printed on top of the other three colors, usually in black or dark gray."
It is of particular importance that the engraver who is to make the
halftone plates should be informed as to the kind of paper they are to
"be printed on. A 50-line halftone plate will print on almost anything,"
"but is too coarse to render the details of the picture, and is usually"
applied only for newspaper use. It would be entirely too coarse for the
"purpose of book illustration. On the other hand, a halftone plate made"
through a screen of 400 lines to the inch can be printed satisfactorily
"only upon paper of the highest surface, and with correspondingly"
"careful presswork. For super-calendered or English-finish paper, plates"
"made through a 133-line screen are most advisable, while the average"
coated or enameled paper will take 150-line halftones to best advantage.
"Lineplates are etchings in relief on plates of zinc or copper,"
"reproduced from pen-and-ink-drawings, or diagrams, by photo-mechanical"
"process. The method in general is the same as that for halftone work,"
"but without the intervention of the screen. In lineplates, the light"
"and shade effects are produced by gradations of thick and thin lines,"
"in distinction from the effects of wash-drawings and photographs, which"
are produced by gradations of tone. The latter require the intervention
of the screen to convert the full tone gradations into the halftone
"of the dots and stipples, while the former may, as already noted, be"
reproduced directly.
"Other classes of engravings, of a more costly kind, and which are"
"therefore used only in books of more expensive character, are the"
"various forms of engraving in intaglio; that is to say, in effects"
produced by cutting or etching the design into and below the surface
"of the plate, instead of cutting or etching away the ground, and"
leaving the design in relief. Examples of this order are the old-time
"copperplate engraving, the more modern steel-engraving,[41] in the"

idealism by which decent people are induced to further the schemes of
scoundrels.
History should be taught in the same way. Napoleon’s campaigns of 1813
"and 1814, for instance, might be studied in the _Moniteur_, leading up"
to the surprise which Parisians felt when they saw the Allies arriving
under the walls of Paris after they had (according to the official
bulletins) been beaten by Napoleon in every battle. In the more advanced
"classes, students should be encouraged to count the number of times that"
"Lenin has been assassinated by Trotsky, in order to learn contempt for"
"death. Finally, they should be given a school history approved by the"
"Government, and asked to infer what a French school history would say"
about our wars with France. All this would be a far better training in
citizenship than the trite moral maxims by which some people believe
that civic duty can be inculcated.
"It must, I think, be admitted that the evils of the world are due to"
moral defects quite as much as to lack of intelligence. But the human
race has not hitherto discovered any method of eradicating moral
defects; preaching and exhortation only add hypocrisy to the previous
"list of vices. Intelligence, on the contrary, is easily improved by"
"methods known to every competent educator. Therefore, until some method"
"of teaching virtue has been discovered, progress will have to be sought"
by improvement of intelligence rather than of morals. One of the chief
"obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be"
enormously diminished by instruction as to the prevalent forms of
mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever
"was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier"
"than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy,"
the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to
the holders of power. Hence the increase in the circulation of
longer “cocksure” of his capability of drawing a line of division
between the organic and the inorganic. He can conceive of the
existence of spirits which can control and modify the ordinary laws
of life. He finds it probable that evolution is not exhausted when Man
"has come into being, and can look forward to a spiritual existence"
"without suspecting himself of superstition. Sacraments, the union of"
"the spiritual with the material, seem to him to be in accordance with"
"the laws of the Universe, and he would never now-a-days stigmatize"
them as “Magic.” However he may explain the methods by which cures
"were wrought upon the afflicted, the scientific man of to-day would"
"not accuse St. Luke of falsehood because he tells us that, “God"
"wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, so that from his body"
"were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases"
departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them.” Indeed the
man of science knows himself to be on the track of discoveries which
will show us secrets of personality and spiritual possession which
will banish for ever the absurd incredulity of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries.
"Who now-a-days would assert that “miracles do not happen,” when men"
like Sir Oliver Lodge are laboriously discovering some few of these
laws of the Universe which give us these portents and signs? Who dares
to sneer at Parthenogenesis or repeat the slander of Celsus about the
Mother of God? Men only who have grown rusty in reposing on their past
reputations and cannot see that materialism as a philosophy is dead.
Day by day fresh evidence of the power of the spirit over matter
bursts upon us. A plea for “philosophic doubt” of Professor Huxley’s
infallibility is no longer necessary. The very distinction between
matter and spirit grows more and more difficult as science develops
analytical power. The minds of men are being prepared again to receive
that Supreme revelation which told of the wedding of the earth and
"heaven, the taking of the Manhood into God."
becomes unconscious of everything except the constant flap-flapping of
"the weary paddles as they go beating on, awakening the dull echoes of"
the sedgy shores. The eye is occasionally relieved by patches of naked
"sand, and now and then a stone about the size of your fist, diversifies"
"the monotony of the scene. Occasionally, in the distance, are to be"
"seen funny, forlorn-looking objects, trying evidently to look like"
"trees, but whether they would really turn out to be trees on a nearer"
inspection is what I very much doubt.' At Cologne he had an amusing
"meeting with an Englishman, 'whom I at once twigged to be an Oxford"
"man, and more, even, an Oxford tutor. There is a stiff twitch in the"
"right shoulder of the tribe, answering to a similar one in the hip-bone"
"on the same side, which there is no mistaking.' The tutor appears to"
have done valiant service in making known the traveller's wants in
"French to waiters, etc., though 'he spent rather too much of his time"
"in scheming how to abridge the sixpence which, ""time out of mind,"" has"
"been the perquisite of Boots, doorkeepers, etc.' 'But,' he adds in"
"excuse, 'his name was Bull, and therefore, as the authentic epitome of"
"his countrymen, he would not fail to possess this along with the other"
"peculiarities of Englishmen.' From Cologne, Ferrier went to Bonn, where"
"he had an introduction to Dr. Welsh, and then proceeded up the Rhine to"
Mayence. He does not form a very high estimate of the beauty of the
"scenery. He feels 'a want of something; in fact, to my mind, there is a"
"want of everything which makes earth, wood, and water something more"
"than mere water, wood, and earth. We have here a constant and endless"
"variety of imposing objects (imposing is just the word for them), but"
"there is no variety in them, nothing but one round-backed hill after"
"another, generally carrying their woods, when they have any, very"
"stiffly, and when they have none presenting to the eye a surface of"
"tawdry and squalid patchwork,' thus suggesting, in his view, a series"
of children's gardens--an impression often left on travellers when
visiting this same country. His next letters find him settled in the
University town of Heidelberg.
"presence, a presence that I do not see but seem to feel, and my greatest"
"terror is that I _shall_ see it. The presence is ill-defined, but very"
"real, and it seems to suggest the potentiality of all possible moral,"
"mental, and physical evil. In these dreams it always occurs to me that"
if this evil presence shall ever become embodied into a something that I
"could _see_, the sight of it would be so ineffably horrible as to drive me"
mad. So vivid has this fear been that on several occasions I have awakened
in a cold sweat or a nameless fear that would persist for some minutes
after I realised that I had only been dreaming.' This seems to be an
abnormal type of the dream of flight.
It is somewhat surprising that while dreams of floating in the air are so
"common and clearly indicate the respiratory source of the dream, dreams"
"of floating on water seem to be rare, for as the actual experience of"
"floating on water is fairly familiar, we might have expected that sleeping"
consciousness would have found here rather than in the never experienced
idea of floating in air the explanation of its sensations. The dream of
"floating on water is, however, by no means unknown; thus Rachilde (Mme."
"Vallette), the French novelist and critic, whose dream life is vivid and"
"remarkable, states that her most agreeable dream is that of floating on"
the surface of warm and transparent lakes or rivers.[124] One of the
correspondents of _L'intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux_[125]
also states that he has often dreamed of walking on the water.
It is not only in sleep that the sensation of flying is experienced. In
"hysteria a sense of peculiar lightness of the body, and the idea of the"
"soul's power to fly, may occur incidentally,[126] and may certainly be"
"connected both with the vigilambulism, as Sollier terms the sleep-like"
"tendencies of such cases, and the anaesthetic conditions found in the"
hysterical. It is noteworthy that Janet found that in an ecstatic person
who experienced the sensation of rising in the air there was anaesthesia
"of the soles of the feet. In such hysterical ecstasy, which has always"
"hard, frenzied efforts to kill, and above all a spirit, fanatical, that"
"urged each man to bear more, kill more, because he was a Crusader for"
the right.
"Into this red crucible I had plunged, and now emerged--remolded. In one"
"brief year and a half I had lived my life, dreamed the undreamable,"
"accomplished the unaccomplishable. Much had gone from me, yet much had"
come--and it was this which had come that distorted my vision of future
"days; making them drab, making my fellows who had not taken the plunge"
"seem purposeless and immature. Either they were out of tune, or I"
"was--and I thought, of course, that they were. What freshness could I"
bring to an existence of peace when my gears would not mesh with its
humdrum machinery!
"My mother, ever quick to detect the workings of my mind as well as the"
"variations of my body, had noticed these changes when I disembarked the"
"previous week, and had become obsessed with the idea that I stood"
"tottering on the brink of abysmal wretchedness. So, while I was marking"
"time the few days at camp until the hour of demobilization, she summoned"
"into hasty conference my father, our family doctor, and the select near"
"relatives whose advice was a matter of habit rather than value, to"
devise means of leading me out of myself.
"This, I afterward learned, had been a weighty conference, resulting in"
the conclusion that I must have complete rest and diversion. But as my
more recent letters home had expressed a determination to rush headlong
"into business--as a sort of fatuous panacea for jumpy nerves, no"
doubt--and since the conferees possessed an intimate knowledge of the
"mulish streak that coursed through my blood, their plans were laid"
"behind my back with the greatest secrecy. Therefore, when entering the"
"library this last night in December and hurrying to my mother's arms, I"
"had no suspicion that I was being drawn into a very agreeable trap,"
Adonis in the mysteries of Aphrodite. He is the beloved of the goddess;
he is lost and mourned for as dead; he is restored again from the
grave to the goddess who loved him. And in all this he appears to be
the representative of all Cybele’s worshippers; for the ritual of
"initiation into her rites, if once again we may avail ourselves of"
"Clement’s statements, is strongly imbued with the idea of marriage"
between the goddess and her worshipper. The several acts or stages of
initiation are summarised in four phrases: ‘I ate out of the drum; I
drank out of the cymbal; I carried the sacred vessel; I entered privily
the bed-chamber--ἐκ τυμπάνου ἔφαγον· ἐκ κυμβάλου ἔπιον· ἐκερνοφόρησα·
ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν[1472]. In the passage from which these phrases
are culled there appears to be a certain confusion between the rites
of Cybele and those of Demeter; but the fact that Clement shortly
afterwards gives another formulary of Demeter’s ritual is sufficient
"proof that he meant this present formulary, as indeed the mention of"
"kettle-drum and cymbal[1473] suggests, to apply to the mysteries of"
Cybele[1474]. It appears then that the final act or stage of initiation
consisted in the secret admission of the worshipper to the bed-chamber
of the goddess. Such ritual can have borne only one interpretation. It
clearly constituted a promise of wedded union between the initiated
and their deity. Viewed in this light even the emasculation of the
priests of Cybele may more readily be understood; it may have been the
"consecration of their virility to the service of the goddess, a final"
"and convincing pledge of celibacy in this life, in return for which"
they aspired to be blest by wedlock with their goddess hereafter.
The mention of the goddess’ bed-chamber in the above passage is of
considerable interest. The παστός (or παστάς) in relation to a temple
meant the same thing as it often meant in relation to an ordinary
"house, an inner room or recess screened off, and in particular a"
bridal chamber. Such provision for the physical comfort of the deity
was probably not rare. Pausanias tells us that on the right of
"the horde issued boldly forth from the depths of the sea, and the"
"battle began in earnest. They came during the hush of the dawn, a mad,"
"crowding throng from No Man's Land, to wake the tide-rips and people"
"the shimmering reaches of the bay, lashing them to sudden life and"
"fury. Outside, the languorous ocean heaved as smiling and serene as"
"ever, but within the harbor a wondrous change occurred."
"As if in answer to some deep-sea signal, the tides were quickened by a"
"coursing multitude, steadfast and unafraid, yet foredoomed to die by"
"the hand of man, or else more surely by the serving of their destiny."
"Clad in their argent mail of blue and green, they worked the bay to"
"madness; they overwhelmed the waters, surging forward in great droves"
"and columns, hesitating only long enough to frolic with the shifting"
"currents, as if rejoicing in their strength and beauty."
At times they swam with cleaving fins exposed: again they churned the
placid waters until swift combers raced across the shallow bars like
tidal waves while the deeper channels were shot through with shadowy
forms or pierced by the lightning glint of silvered bellies. They
"streamed in with the flood tide to retreat again with the ebb, but"
there was neither haste nor caution in their progress; they had come in
"answer to the breeding call of the sea, and its exultation was upon"
"them, driving them relentlessly onward. They had no voice against its"
overmastering spell.
"Mustering in the early light like a swarm of giant white-winged moths,"
"the fishing-boats raced forth with the flowing tide, urged by sweep and"
"sail and lusty sinews. Paying out their hundred-fathom nets, they"
"drifted over the banks like flocks of resting sea-gulls, only to come"
ploughing back again deep laden with their spoils. Grimy tugboats lay
"beside the traps, shrilling the air with creaking winches as they"
"""brailed"" the struggling fish, a half-ton at a time, from the ""pounds,"""
that one can differentiate.
For all that he ought to have given himself another decade before crying
"himself a failure, yet a brilliant young journalist who has not found"
a publisher for one of four novels has reasonable excuse for serious
cogitation. There are scores of brilliant young journalists who have
"published masterpieces of fiction before they are thirty, and at forty"
"have gone on their knees and thanked kind, gentle Time for his effacing"
fingers; yet the novels have had some quality of the novel warranting
"their publication. At any rate, the brilliant young journalists have"
believed in them. They have looked upon their Creation and found that
"it was good. But Risca, looking on his Creation, found that it was"
wood. His people were as wooden as Mr. and Mrs. Ham in a Noah's Ark; his
scenery was as wooden as the trees and mountain in a toy Swiss
village; his dialogue as wooden as the conversation-blocks used by
"the philosophers of Laputa. He had said, in an outburst of wrathful"
"resentment, that he found his one artistic outlet in aiding to create"
Stella's Land of Illusion; and he was right. He was despairingly
aware of the lack of the quick fancy; the power of visualization; the
"sublimated faculty of the child's make-believe, creating out of trumpery"
"bits and pieces a glowing world of romance; the keen, instinctive"
knowledge of the general motives of human action; the uncanny insight
"into the hearts and feelings of beings of a sex, class, or type"
different from his own; the gift of evolving from a tiny broken bone of
"fact a perfect creature indisputably real, colouring it with the hues of"
"actuality and breathing into it the breath of life--the lack, indeed, of"
"all the essential qualities, artistic and therefore usually instinctive,"
that go to the making of a novelist. Yet Risca was doggedly determined
to be a novelist and a poet. It was pathetic. How can a man who cannot
distinguish between “God Save the King” and “Yankee Doodle” hope to
write a world-shaking sonata? Risca knew that he was crying for the
"moon, and it is only because he cried so hard for it that he deserved"
hope and anticipation even although its bearing was not at first
entirely comprehended. Ferrier was one of those who perceived the
"momentous consequences which such a change of front would cause, and he"
set himself to work it out as best he could. In an interesting paper
"which he writes on 'The Philosophy of Common-Sense,' with special"
"reference to Sir William Hamilton's edition of the works of Dr. Reid,"
we see in what way his opinions had developed.
The point which Ferrier made the real crux of the whole question of
philosophy was the distinction which exists between the ordinary
psychological doctrine of perception and the metaphysical. The former
"drew a distinction between the perceiving mind and matter, and based"
its reasonings on the assumed modification of our minds brought about
"by matter regarded as self-existent, _i.e._ existent in itself and"
"without regard to any perceiving mind. Now, Ferrier points out that"
"this system of 'representationalism,' of representative ideas,"
"necessarily leads to scepticism; for who can tell us more, than that we"
"have certain ideas--that is, how can it be known that the real matter"
"supposed to cause them has any part at all in the process? Scepticism,"
"as we saw before, has the way opened up for it, and it doubts the"
"existence of matter, seeing that it has been given no reasonable"
"grounds for belief in it, while Idealism boldly denies its"
"instrumentality and existence. What then, he asks, of Dr. Reid and his"
School of Common-Sense? Reid cannot say that matter is known in
"consciousness, but what he does say is that something innately born"
"within us forces us to believe in its existence. But then, as Ferrier"
"pertinently points out, scepticism and idealism do not merely doubt and"
deny the existence of a self-existent matter as an object of
"consciousness, but also because it is no object of belief. And what has"
"Reid to show for his beliefs? Nothing but his word. We must all,"
"Ferrier says, be sceptics or idealists; we are all forced on to deny"
"that matter in any form exists, for it is only self-existent matter"
"it, that ceases its effort, as life gives place to death in the body"
that no longer functions.
"In a wider sense, truth belongs to every form of spiritual activity."
"Beauty, utility, goodness are the truths of the artistic, the"
"practical, the moral mind. And in the actual life of the spirit, each"
of these values represents all the others in the particular act in
which it realizes itself. This is what Croce means by his circular
conception of the spirit. And this is why what is said of one value
"seems to apply without any change to the others; why, as we said"
"elsewhere, all universals are but one universal. Whether we call this"
"one Progress or Development, Spirit or Reality, Mind or Nature, we"
"know that our thought is grasping Life itself, not in its abstract"
"identity, but in its infinite actuality, that is, each time, this"
"life, this beauty, this action, this truth. What we aim at is not an"
"ecstatic absorption into the undifferentiated unity, but the finding"
"within ourselves of a centre of consciousness, capable of introducing"
order and reason into the variegated spectacle of the natural and human
"world, not from outside and from above, but from its very heart. The"
"truth that we seek is therefore never external to ourselves, but our"
"own activity, our own life, our own history."
"This concept of truth as activity and as history, this activistic and"
"energetic philosophy, truly positive in that the course of history"
appears to it as a succession of only positive acts and positive
"values, is not however a blind and fatuous optimism. If it is true"
that nowhere positive error or positive evil can interrupt the process
"of life, that death itself does not end but fulfil it, yet from the"
relations and implications of the various forms of activity arises
"a real dialectic of good and evil, of truth and error, which is the"
spring and motive of life. What to the purely utilitarian conscience
"is the good of now and of to-day, the same conscience, awakened to a"
us to trace back {67} very closely the various phases of its development.
In accordance with a custom prevalent in the entire Orient at the beginning
"of history, the Anatolian lords were fond of pursuing and lassoing wild"
"buffalos, which they afterwards sacrificed to the gods. Beasts caught"
"during a hunt were immolated, and frequently also prisoners of war."
Gradually the savagery of this primitive rite was modified until finally
nothing but a circus play was left. During the Alexandrian period people
"were satisfied with organizing a _corrida_ in the arena, in the course of"
which the victim intended for immolation was seized. This is the proper
"meaning of the terms taurobolium and criobolium ([Greek: taurobolion,"
"kriobolion.]), which had long been enigmas,[34] and which denoted the act"
"of catching a steer or a ram by means of a hurled weapon, probably the"
thong of a lasso. Without doubt even this act was finally reduced to a mere
"sham under the Roman empire, but the weapon with which the animal was slain"
"always remained a hunting weapon, a sacred boar spear.[35]"
The ideas on which the immolation was based were originally just as
barbarous as the sacrifice itself. It is a matter of general belief among
savage peoples that one acquires the qualities of an enemy slain in battle
"or of a beast killed in the chase by drinking or washing in the blood, or"
by eating some of the viscera of the body. The blood especially has often
been considered as the seat of vital energy. By moistening his body with
"the blood of the slaughtered steer, the neophyte believed that he was"
transfusing the strength of the formidable beast into his own limbs.
This naive and purely material conception was soon {68} modified and
"refined. The Thracians brought into Phrygia, and the Persian magi into"
"Cappadocia, the fast spreading belief in the immortality of mankind. Under"
"their influence, especially under that of Mazdaism, which made the mythical"
"steer the author of creation and of resurrection, the old savage practice"
"assumed a more spiritual and more elevated meaning. By complying with it,"
people no longer thought they were acquiring the buffalo's strength; the
shall enter the ranks of wolves and hawks and kites; that those who
"have practised what is popularly accounted virtue, but without true"
"understanding, shall enter the ranks of harmless and social creatures,"
"bees, wasps, and ants, or even the ranks of men once more. ‘But"
into the ranks of gods none may enter without having followed after
wisdom and so departing hence wholly pure--none save the lover of
knowledge[1524].’ What precise meaning Plato attached to his phrase
"‘to enter the ranks’ (εἰς γένος ἐνδύεσθαι or ἀφικνεῖσθαι), to which"
"he adheres throughout the passage, is a question which agitated the"
Neoplatonists[1525] somewhat needlessly. The phrase is intended either
"literally throughout or allegorically throughout. If it be allegorical,"
the meaning must be that all human souls shall enter again into human
"bodies, but that they shall start this new phase of existence with the"
"qualities of lust, violence, respectability, or real virtue and purity,"
"acquired in the previous life--merely resembling, as nearly as men may,"
"asses, wolves, bees, or gods. Now as regards the first three classes,"
"this allegorical interpretation, if a little forced, is feasible"
enough; but what of the fourth class? Shall the soul which has attained
"purity, the very negation of fleshliness in Plato’s view, suffer"
re-incarnation and struggle once more against the flesh? Surely the
allegorical explanation is at once condemned. The phrase was intended
"literally[1526]. Plato signified the re-incarnation of the lustful,"
"the violent, and the merely respectable, in the forms of animals of"
"like character, and he signified--I must not say the re-incarnation,"
for Plato’s gods were spiritual and not carnal--but the regeneration
of the pure in the form of gods. And in the same spirit Plutarch too
"contemplated the possibility of some men’s souls becoming first heroes,"
"and from heroes rising to the rank of ‘daemons,’ and from ‘daemons’"
"coming to share, albeit but rarely, in real godhead[1527]."
Thus even the highest aspirations of the most spiritually-minded of
pagan thinkers owed much to the purely popular religion. The Orphic
"much also is made of retrospection and relation, whether the topic is"
"ancient history, the events of a recent voyage, or a barely completed"
crime. The sage backward glance of the Chorus is quick to discover in
present ruin a punishment for past crime; so that the plot becomes in a
"manner a picture of the resistless laws of moral justice. Speeches, a"
"moralizing Chorus, actions not performed but reported in detail, a sense"
"of divine retribution for sin, these are perhaps the qualities which,"
"apart from the poetry itself, we recall most readily as typical of a"
Greek tragedy. These Seneca modified by the introduction of acts and
"scenes, a subordination of the Chorus, and an exaggerated predilection"
for long sententious speeches; he also added a new stage character known
"as the Ghost. Seneca's elevation, to the dogmatic position of laws, of"
"the unities of Time, Place and Action, rules by no means invariable"
"among his older and greater masters, has been the subject of much"
"debate, but, on the whole, the verdict has been hostile. According to"
"these unities, the time represented in the play should not greatly"
"exceed the time occupied in acting it, the scene of the action should"
"not vary, and the plot should be concerned only with one event. This"
"last law was generally accepted, by Elizabethans, in Tragedy at least."
"The other two, though much insisted on by English theorists, such as Sir"
"Philip Sidney, met with so much neglect in practice that we need devote"
no space to the discussion of them.
Having thus hastily summarized the larger superficial characteristics of
"classical drama, we may return to _Gorboduc_ and inquire which of these"
were adopted in it and with what modifications. We find it divided into
"five acts and nine scenes. A Chorus, though it takes no other part,"
sings its moralizing lyrics at the end of each act except the last.
Speeches of inordinate length are made--three consecutive speeches in
"Act I, Scene 2, occupy two hundred and sixty lines--the subject-matter"
being commonly argumentative. Only through the reports of messengers and
eye-witnesses do we learn of the cold-blooded murder and many violent
books which claim for Christianity the first place in the thought of
"the time are successful, a very malignant hostility is aroused."
It is most probable that this hatred of Christianity will grow and
increase. The world has never before been as it is to-day. The system
of party politics has placed power in the hands of the democracy. The
“working man” has at last discovered what he can do. He must make his
choice between the secular and the religious principle. Hitherto the
"Christian pastors of the people have appealed to his emotions, and not"
without success. The emotions will always be the chief guides in
"conduct for many; but the leaders of the working men are hard-headed,"
"well read in social science and politics; and, owing to the"
"insufficient training of the clergy in these subjects, the politicians"
of the _proletariat_ have conceived a sort of contempt for the parson
"and the minister and the priest. The small body of Unitarians, wealthy"
"from their constant intermarriage with the great Jewish families, and"
opposed to an aristocracy which has only in the last forty years been
"willing to receive them, has been quick to see that the working man"
"must be alienated from the Catholic creed, and his vote secured at any"
cost. On the railway bookstalls we may note the activity of the
Unitarian propaganda committee. Fifty years ago it was not necessary
to consider the opinions of the man in the street: the Unitarian
minister and his congregation were comfortable in the assurance of
their own intellectual culture and their kindly interest for the
"poorer classes. In politics they were Liberals, for an Established"
"Church interfered with their sense of superiority, and the landed"
proprietors and the hereditary aristocracy socially ignored them. But
they had no notion of calling into existence an electorate which
"should endanger the supremacy of the capitalist, and, like"
"Frankenstein, they are afraid of their own creations, now that the"
working man has become the dispenser of Parliamentary power. It is
vital to their interests that he should be diverted from further
of examining two Mauser bullets of the Jeffreys variety which crossed
"the abdomen and caused death. In the first (figured on page 94, fig. 40)"
very little alteration beyond slight shortening had occurred. In the
"second the deformity was almost the same, except that the side of the"
"bullet was indented, probably from impact with some object prior to its"
entry into the body. In each case the bullet was of course travelling at
a low rate of velocity; hence no very strong inference can be drawn
"from either. In the case of the second specimen, which was removed by"
"Mr. Cheatle, a remarkable observation was made, which tends to throw"
some light on one possible mode of production of large exit apertures.
"This bullet crossed the cæcum, making two small type openings; but"
"later, when it crossed the sigmoid flexure, it tore two large irregular"
openings in the gut. This might be explained on the ground that the
"velocity was so small as only just to allow of perforation, which"
"therefore took the nature of a tear. I am inclined to suggest, as a more"
"likely explanation, that the spent bullet turned head over heels in its"
"course across the abdomen, and made lateral or irregular impact with the"
last piece of bowel it touched. A slightly greater degree of force would
have allowed a similar large and irregular opening to be made in the
abdominal wall also.
In this relation the question will naturally be raised as to how far the
explosive appearances may have been due to high velocity alone on the
part of the bullet. I am disinclined from my general experience to
believe that explosive injuries of the soft parts were to be thus
"explained. On the other hand, I believe that the possession of a low"
degree of velocity very greatly increased the danger in abdominal
"wounds. I believe that the bowel was, under these circumstances, less"
"likely to escape by displacement, and was more widely torn when wounded;"
"again, that inexact impact led to increase of size in the external"
"apertures, and the bullet was of course more often retained."
"woods and thickets, mingling their shouts with the shrill sound of flutes,"
"with the dull beat of tambourines, with the rattling of castanets and the"
dissonance of brass cymbals. Intoxicated with shouting and with uproar of
"the instruments, excited by their impetuous advance, breathless and"
"panting, they surrendered to the raptures of a sacred enthusiasm. Catullus"
has left us a dramatic description of this divine ecstasy.[6] {50}
The religion of Phrygia was perhaps even more violent than that of Thrace.
The climate of the Anatolian uplands is one of extremes. Its winters are
"rough, long and cold, the spring rains suddenly develop a vigorous"
vegetation that is scorched by the hot summer sun. The abrupt contrasts of
"a nature generous and sterile, radiant and bleak in turn, caused excesses"
"of sadness and joy that were unknown in temperate and smiling regions,"
where the ground was never buried under snow nor scorched by the sun. The
"Phrygians mourned the long agony and death of the vegetation, but when the"
verdure reappeared in March they surrendered to the excitement of a
tumultuous joy. In Asia savage rites that had been unknown in Thrace or
practiced in milder form expressed the vehemence of those opposing
"feelings. In the midst of their orgies, and after wild dances, some of the"
"worshipers voluntarily wounded themselves and, becoming intoxicated with"
"the view of the blood, with which they besprinkled their altars, they"
"believed they were uniting themselves with their divinity. Or else,"
"arriving at a paroxysm of frenzy, they sacrificed their virility to the"
gods as certain Russian dissenters still do to-day. These men became
priests of Cybele and were called Galli. Violent ecstasis was always an
"endemic disease in Phrygia. As late as the Antonines, montanist prophets"
that arose in that country attempted to introduce it into Christianity.
All these excessive and degrading demonstrations of an extreme worship must
not cause us to slight the power of the feeling that inspired it. The
"sacred ecstasy, the voluntary mutilations and the eagerly sought sufferings"
manifested an ardent longing for {51} deliverance from subjection to carnal
clung the first suggestion he had made. It was the common-sense
"idea that, given a knowledge of John's relations with the Southcliff"
"household, would have occurred to anybody. John had it in his power to"
befriend the unhappy child without trying the rash experiment of raising
her social status. Wherein lay the advantage of bringing her up as
a lady? A pampered maid in a luxurious home does not drag out the
existence of a downtrodden slave. Such have been known to smile and
"sing, even to bless their stars, and finally to marry a prince in"
"grocer's disguise, and to live happy ever afterwards. With John's"
"description of the girl's dog-like eyes in his memory, Herold pictured"
"her as a devoted handmaiden to Stellamaris, a romantic, mediaeval"
appanage of the sea-chamber. What more amazingly exquisite destiny could
"await not only one bred in the gutter, but any damsel far more highly"
born? Her silence as to the past could be insured under ghastly
penalties which would have no need of imagination for their appeal. That
of course would be an ultimate measure. He felt certain that a couple
"presented in their relations as completing the cycle of living reality,"
in contrast with that reality which the mind postulates outside its
"living self, and which the system reduces to a complex practical"
"product of the mind, a collection of material helps subservient to the"
"essential forms of its activity. Knowledge and action, reciprocally"
"implicated, are the substance of reality; and both knowledge and"
"action, rising, the first, from the intuition to the concept, the"
"second, from the economic to the ethical will, attain the universal,"
"all-including values which we express by the words Beautiful, True,"
"Useful and Good, but only and in so far as they realize themselves"
in the concrete and individual. A universal more universal than that
"which is present in the individual act is inexistent, or exists only"
as an impotent abstraction renouncing the concreteness and reality of
"the individual, and therefore also that true universality which has"
"no being outside this action, this thought, this life. The soul of"
"the system, slowly extricating itself from the traces of naturalism"
most reasonable to believe that in ordinary sleep the flow of imagery
"follows, for the most part, the same easy course. That course may to"
"waking consciousness often seem peculiar, but to waking consciousness the"
"conditions of dreaming life are peculiar. Under these conditions, however,"
we may well believe that the tendency to movement in the direction of
least resistance still prevails. And as attention and will are weakened
"and loosened during sleep, the tense concentration on personal ends must"
also be relaxed. We become more disinterested. Personal desire tends
for the most part rather to fall into the background than to become
more prominent. If it were not a period in which desire were ordinarily
"relaxed, sleep would cease to be a period of rest and recuperation."
"Sleeping consciousness is a vast world, a world scarcely less vast than"
that of waking consciousness. It is futile to imagine that a single
formula can cover all its manifold varieties and all its degrees of depth.
Those who imagine that all dreaming is a symbolism which a single cypher
"will serve to interpret must not be surprised if, however unjustly, they"
are thought to resemble those persons who claim to find on every page of
Shakespeare a cypher revealing the authorship of Bacon. In the case of
"Freud's theory of dream interpretation, I hold the cypher to be real, but"
I believe that it is impossible to regard so narrow and exclusive an
"interpretation as adequate to explain the whole world of dreams. It would,"
"_a priori_, be incomprehensible that sleeping consciousness should exert"
so extraordinary a selective power among the variegated elements of waking
"life, and, experientially, there seems no adequate ground to suppose that"
"it does exert such selective action. On the contrary, it is, for the"
"most part, supremely impartial in bringing forward and combining all the"
"manifestations, the most trivial as well as the most intimate, of our"
"waking life. There is a symptom of mental disorder called _extrospection_,"
in which the patient fastens his attention so minutely on events that
he comes to interpret the most trifling signs and incidents as full of
"hidden significance, and may so build up a systematised delusion.[157] The"
"at Rome. The priest was no longer simply the guardian of sacred traditions,"
"the intermediary between man or the state and the gods, but also a"
spiritual guide. He taught his flock the long series of obligations and
restrictions for shielding their weakness from the attacks of evil spirits.
"He knew how to quiet remorse and scruples, and to restore the sinner to"
"spiritual calm. Being versed in sacred knowledge, he had the power of"
reconciling the gods. Frequent sacred repasts maintained a spirit of
"fellowship among the mystics of Cybele, Mithra or the Baals,[33] and a"
daily service unceasingly revived the faith of the Isis worshipers. In
"consequence, the clergy were entirely absorbed in their holy office and"
lived only for and by their temples. Unlike the sacerdotal colleges of Rome
in which the secular and religious functions were not yet clearly
"differentiated,[34] they were not an {42} administrative commission ruling"
the sacred affairs of the state under the supervision of the senate; they
formed what might almost be called a caste of recluses distinguished from
"ordinary men by their insignia, garb, habits and food, and constituting an"
"independent body with a hierarchy, formulary and even councils of their"
own.[35] They did not return to every-day duties as private citizens or to
the direction of public affairs as magistrates as the ancient pontiffs had
done after the solemn festival service.
We can readily understand that these beliefs and institutions were bound to
establish the Oriental religions and their priests on a strong basis. Their
influence must have been especially powerful at the time of the Cæsars. The
laxity of morals at the beginning of our era has been exaggerated but it
was real. Many unhealthy symptoms told of a profound moral anarchy weighing
on a weakened and irresolute society. The farther we go toward the end of
the empire the more its energy seems to fail and the character of men to
weaken. The number of strong healthy minds incapable of a lasting
aberration and without need of guidance or comfort was growing ever
smaller. We note the spread of that feeling of exhaustion and debility
"which follows the aberrations of passion, and the same weakness that led to"
"greater light, repudiates as evil. The imaginative vision of the poet,"
"in which truth expresses itself, sensuous and finite, and yet pregnant"
"of its infinity, dissolves like mist in the sun in the clearness"
"of the logical concept, and is then restored in its right by the"
historical and critical consciousness to which that truth is poetry.
"The myths and superstitions of the old religions, dead in the letter,"
are revived in the thought itself that seems to destroy them. History
"is but this perpetual cycle of death and resurrection, in which what"
is concrete distinction in the act transforms itself into opposition
"in the process, producing the terms of a new problem and becoming the"
source of the new creation. Thus the whole method of Croce's philosophy
"reveals itself as directed towards a realistic conception of life, and"
"the distinctions within the concept are not abstract forms, but the"
very structure of reality.
The professional philosopher moves always and only in the rarefied
atmosphere of the pure concept. Croce came to philosophy from art and
"from economics, and he never lost contact with the elementary forms"
of knowledge and of action. What might be termed as his fundamental
discoveries are his definitions of the Ã¦sthetic and of the economic
principle. On this basis the whole of his thought rests. Without a
"conception of a truth which is sufficient unto itself, and yet is not"
"logical truth, and of a good which has its own justification, and yet"
"is not moral good, he would have been compelled to maintain by the side"
"of the concepts of truth and of goodness, error and evil as positive"
"realities, or to include the whole of reality within what would have"
"been truth and goodness in a purely verbal sense. In both cases, he"
would have been unable to make his philosophy immediately adherent to
"all grades of active consciousness, from the lowest to the highest,"
and thereby to history. Of these discoveries the one that until now
"has attracted the greatest attention is that of the pure intuition,"

I'D SAY BEING A LAWYER
IS PROBABLY BETTER TRAINING FOR LYING.
BUT YOU DO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD.
NOT FOR LYING.
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A STREET WALKER.
YOU THINK THE JURY WOULD PERCEIVE THAT DISTINCTION?
THE MEN WILL.
- WOW.
- HMM.
YEAH.
I KNOW I SHOULD REALLY PUSH THE PARENT ISSUE.
THE JURY MIGHT GET PAST IT
IF THEY SEE HER AS AN ABANDONED KID UP THERE.
MAYBE.
EVERYONE'S GOT A DARK SIDE YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO SEE.

You...
Are you following me?
Not a bit.
Why would I follow?
I'm not following
My gut tells me that there's a valuable jewellery here

Or are my eyes misguiding me?
Are not those the most beautiful eyes in the world?

He wants to buy somethings

Updates on Ridgeway's shooter.
Go.
Ridgeway was shot three days ago.
Ryan's had eyes on Wickes for the last week.
He wasn't the triggerman.
"Well, he could have ordered it earlier."
"McGee, e-mails?"
Wickes has contacted three people since we suggested the AUTEC connection to the SECNAV's shooting.
ZIVA:
"Bob ""Smitty"" Smith, Ronald Ostrowski, and Vice President Frank Satner."
TONY:
All haunt the Wickes Steel boardroom.
Whole lot of motive going on.
"Working to clear their backgrounds, but so far, all talks have been work-related and clean."
Look for codes.
Yeah.
And cross-reference keywords with recent e-mails.
Whoever shot Ridgeway wanted to keep him quiet for a reason.
Could be this.
Report detailing the project
Ridgeway worked on for AUTEC.
"Well, it's been redacted."
Yeah.
Can we get access?
Mm.
Won't be a cakewalk.
Leads on the AUTEC hacker?
"Whoever he is, he's good."
Hid his IP behind a wall of alternating secure servers.
We need to get in this report.
Okay.
RYAN:
Really.
Yeah.
it's...
Huh?
Tanaka... and his parents had to put in a missing person's report.

an entire Arcam research party was killed on Mt.
Ararat in Turkey?
I did happen to hear that.
Noah's ark was later discovered in that place.
Noah's ark?
as it was written through the 7th and 9th chapters of the book of Genesis in the Old Testament.
The humans that God made had grown to become incredibly evil.
God regretted his creation and decided to destroy man.
a man who's heart was right with God to build an ark for his family and for two of every living animal on Earth.
What does any of that have to do with this?
!
Let me finish the entire story.
a different research party was attacked by someone at another location.

Bus or car?

"Ever since you met me, you've been harassing me"
What are you saying?
- All along the trip... you've been chewing my brains.
"Honey, that""s not nerves."
"That""s intuition."
"And that""s a blessing."
"Do you know when women suspect their husband of cheating... they""re right 85% of the time?"
Men are only right 50%.

"- The wife""s the last to know."
"The co-workers know, the mailman knows, the dog knows."
"But not the wife, because it could be right there... underneath your pretty little nose, but you don""t wanna see it."
Signs of cheating.
Number one:
Changes in personal appearance.
Is hubby working out?
Shopping at The Gap?
Suddenly strutting around like Mr. Sexy?
Changes in phone habits.
Sneaking off to make calls.
Hiding the bills.
Computer obsession.
"Ask yourself, honestly, is hubby spending every waking moment..."
"logged on, so to speak?"
"Hi, honey."
Sexual changes.
From complete lack of interest to the bastard wanting sex now.
New positions.
Role-playing.
Foreplay with condiments.
"It""s really not funny."
"He mix ed them, sir, but he got busy, so I brought them up."

I got it all right.
Something in the drink.
Also my private stock.
That's all.
To the beauties of St. Louis.
- You disapprove of the toast?
- l'm thinking of a better one.
"If I didn't drink, he might fall in on Louis for tipping me off."
And if I did-
"- But I kept remembering, Louis had been Johnny's friend."
Maybe his only friend.
I needed Louis alive.
We await your pleasure.
Geronimo!
"A lovely word, with the added charm f or me of being meaningless."
- A St. Louis expression?
- No.
Just one I picked up.
"Your expressions have the Baretto flavour, almost medieval."
Baroque.
"Mobster, as applied to me, is more colourf ul than accurate."
I've always had a preference f or legitimate enterprises.
With a gambling racket on the side.

- I know.
- We should shootthe son of a bitch.

"I wanna fight justas dirty, Edgar."
His women.
Use his women.
Any information you have.
The son ofa bitch is not going to steal from me again.
Can you back me up on this?
Can I count on your support?
I look at itfrom the pointof viewthat the system can only take so much abuse.
- Itadjusts itself eventually.
- Yeah.
Butthere are times there are savage outbursts.
"The late Dr. King, forexample."
- Amoral hypocrite.
- [Snorting]
"Screwing women like a degenerate tomcat, stirring up the blacks, preaching against oursystem."
Sometimes the system comes very close to cracking.
We've already had one radical in the White House.
I don't believe itwould survive another.
[Whinnying]
"Well, like I said, uh, Edgar..."
You ask... if you can count on my support.
As long as I can count on yours.
"[Nixon] Yeah, the old queen did it on purpose."
"No, he wasn't protecting me."
He was just putting me on notice.
- [Haldeman] That he knew Roselli?
- No.
Hoover knew a lotof gangsters.
Johnny Roselli wasn't justany gangster.
That's all I know.
And you have mules.
And you're not kicking them hard enough.
It's ridiculous.

The first shot involves Toxie.
Toxie's late.
It takes two hours to get his makeup on.
"And even if he's supposed to be there at 5:00,"
"And all of a sudden it's 6:30 or something and there's no Toxie,"
"It's, like, major."
Because then we know the first I can't get off until like 8:30.
INTERVIEWER:
"Lloyd, do you have a word of the morning?"
"Uh, a lot of very, very bad production."

"Because supposedly Dave-- unfortunately,"

"Okay, roger."

We lost all visibility.

Right there.
But when he comes at a different angle...
"Okay, okay, there I see it."
-Yep.
You see it now?
"-Yeah, yeah."
I see it there.

I teach high school in AurioI.
"well, what do you teach?"
What subject?
-You guess.
"-well, I bet you teach art or music."
"well, of course, I couId be wrong."
You might teach arithmetic.
"Never arithmetic, sir."
Never arithmetic.
I don't know my multiplication tables.
Nope.
I have the misfortune of being an english instructor.
I attempt to instill a bunch of bobbysoxers and drugstore Romeos with a reverence for Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.
"well, I bet some of them are more interested in other things."
How very right you are.
Their literary heritage is not what they treasure above all else.
But they're sweet things and in the spring it's touching to notice them making their first discovery of love as if nobody had ever known it before.
-Sorry.
"Oh, excuse me, excuse me."
-Have you finished?
"-Oh, yes."
"Yes, I have."
"-Wait, wait."

Turn on the light above now.
"Oh, look."
We've made enchantment.
"-Three bullets, mustache."
Don't you remember about going to the beach?
"Arrizaga, Alonso, Adbinu, Arza..."
I still know it!
"No, please, don't name the whole list."
-Arostegui...
Arostegui comes before Arza!
You're right.
I'm sure I couldn't recognize any of them.
"Arostegui, Arza, De Blas..."
I remember a lot of soccer team lineups.
The Italian one was beautiful.
"Lupo, Taviani, Becattini,.."
"Estébanez, Estremianas..."
Who were the next to Estremianas?
Alcón!
Maybe I know the class list better!
What time is it?
It's 12:15.
-I haven't called Laura yet.
Be right back.
Julian and I were close friends.
"When you're young, you meet friends everyday and then they vanish."
Don't you get bored with our silliness?
-No.
How long didn't you guys see each other?
We met by coincidence the other day.
Apart from that...
Maybe 10 years or more...
You also named that list back then?
I hope not.
The last thing I remember is we were really drunk.
At dawn we decided to look for an old mutual girlfriend.
(wiart speaking)
Okay.

Morton:
No.
"Oh, I missed that."
(wiart speaking)
Ooh.
Right.
"We've already found a lot of things just by, like, stopping for a few seconds."
Morton:
One of the reasons a lot of these drugs
"Probably haven't been found is 'cause, first of all,"
"It's hard to find the plants, because they're in the fucking jungle,"
And you got to come here and get into the jungle.
"And then, second of all, you'd expect new antibiotics"
To look like the craziest plants in the jungle.
"It'd be like weird, rare orchids that you have to,"
"You know, climb a mountain and snip."
"But they're not, they just look like this."
You have to really know what you're looking for to find stuff
That could be potentially useful.
"So, the thrill of the find is a plant that looks"
"Exactly like this, but slightly different."

Wiart:
Oh!
Uh-huh!

"Oh, wow."

No.
Yours...
Was also delicious.
Congratulations.

Ohh!
Ohh!
"Man, he's still here."
Why?
Why?
Send him home.
(Christine) Christian is staying.
What the hell?
"(Gordon) Those souffles were phenomenal, all four of them."
And that's why no one is leaving MasterChef.
Wow.
"It makes me a little uneasy that the judges kept all four, because I realized who might be going home tomorrow."
"Congratulations for bringing top-level technique, restaurant-quality souffles."
Thank you.
"Get some rest, 'cause tomorrow is one hell of a day."
"Yes, chef thank you."

Money is like manure.
Not good except it be spread.

No.
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, envision the future."

"If someone asked me games or anime, I couldn't answer"
Sorry
It's fine
"But Bon, why do you love BL so much?"
That's where you go...
"Um, yeah..."
Perversion...?
Maybe cause my favorite characters fondle each other?
"There are unrealistically no girls, making it somehow more real..."
What is it?
I know there is something more legit
I'm sure there's something
There's no need to overthink it
Maybe it was a foolish question...
"Lin, you like BL too?"
"Yeah, Big Sis's influence"
So then does that mean you like boys?
"No, that's not it!"
No?
Yes...
If you don't mind homosexuality there are some good love stories
But stuff like mens' bodies or sex acts don't interest me
Oh...
"But, he's been in some pretty gritty situations"
"Oh, really?"
Yeah
Like men touching me in the train
Really?
Yeah
I'm used to it now
Used to it?
Yeah

Piper murdered Riley Marra months ago.
You've been getting emails from a dead girl.
"Okay, no, it's not a crush."
I'm just a little obsessed with his podcast.
(CHUCKLES)
But he was with Riley.
- That was so sad.
"- Now, he's always with Audrey."
"Although, after that video last fall, I guess guys aren't really her thing."
Did you see it?
Who would even post something like that?
Mean people who don't think.
"In other news,"
I definitely think there's something we can do about this whole Noah situation.
"- No, Brooke, please."
I really don't...

What do they have to do with teeth?
- He speaks.
- Excuse me?
What do Chesterfields have to do with teeth?
Dentists recommend them.
"For what, stains?"
This is our first major shot at the cigarette market.
Do you have any idea how big this is gonna be?
"Oh, this big?"
[sighs]
"Mr. Little, people buy cigarettes for their taste, for the quality of the tobacco, not for their teeth."
We've got dentists.
"So, we have to get people to buy Chesterfields because dentists recommend them."

Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
SCOTT:
He'd have to forget everything.
The murder.
allison:
Getting rid ofthe blood.
STlLES:
"But he had help with one thing though, the video."
Maybe someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
allison:
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any ofthis?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
allison:
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
"And ""net"" means they'll be weighed in the nude and after... having gone through their morning routine."
I understand...
- Mr. Eduardo.
- General.
I assume that you understand that this little transaction... will cost the American taxpayers... 50 thousand dollars in exchange for 20 tons of enemy flesh.
You don't want to pay?
He doesn't think this price is democratic.
Isn't democratic?
I hope the newspapers don't learn about this.
How is it not democratic?
Officers and soldiers cost the same thing.
- The same price...
"- Yes, yes, I understand, I understand."
"Ask him, how much would Hitler be?"
- What did he say?
- He's asking how much Hitler would cost.
"Ah, thank you."
Hitler...
Tell him that with the Fifth Battalion marching on Rome... the price is falling ever day.
It's the Fifth Battalion's fault the price is falling.
- That's amusing.
- Very well.

"Lfyou had been elected in '60, Castro would be dead now."
"Gentlemen, I tried."
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.
He heard me and he made his decision.
I appreciate yoursentiments.
I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots.
But it's nothing I can do anything about.
"It's a long drive to Dallas, and Trini and I have a plane to catch tomorrow."
- So...
"- Dick, these boys wantyou to run."
- Absolutely.
- [Man] That's right.
"Now, they're serious."
They can deliver the South and putTexas in your column.
Only if Kennedy dumpsJohnson.
That'll never happen.
I don'tthink you know howmuch people hate Kennedy down here.
"He's comin'to town tomorrow, and they will run his ass outta town on a rail!"
- Damn right.
- [Man] Thatwe will.
We are willing to give you a shit pot full ofmoney to get rid ofhim.
More than you ever dreamed of.

Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
Suppose Kennedy don't run in '64.

Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.

- [Crowd Cheering] - [Chambers] Mr. Hiss is lying.
Yeah.
"Remember, John, back in '48?"
Nobody believed Alger Hiss was a Communistexceptme.
"Well, they loved Hiss like they loved this Ellsberg character."
He was their kind- Ivy League establishment.
"I am not, and never have been..."
- Mr. Hiss is lying.
- Mr. Hiss?
"- I was dirt to them, nothing."
- And Dick kicked the shitoutof'em.
I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.
"The documents were old and outof date, just like these Pentagon papers."
The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.
Then people bought that he was a spy.
It's the lie that gets you.

240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn´t killed by the bomb, I´m sure her buyers took care of her once they found out she didn´t deliver the virus."
"Either way, she´s out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We´ll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
- l know we haven´t talked since I got back.
"- No, we haven´t."
I know what you must be thinking.
Give me a chance to explain.
I don´t know what to think.
"Look, I´m happy that you´re OK, but this thing..."
"You have a baby, Chase."
We´ve been together more than three months and you kept this secret.

"You bought it from the local store, right?"
Country attar packed in a fancy way.
This your Victoria Secret?
What about you?
You use the local ingredients and sell it as international cuisine.
Hey!
Don't make fun of my recipe.
I have won awards.
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.
You are one among the top 25 upcoming stars selected by a weekly magazine.
I wrote the article about you.
Let me read it out.
Chef Arun.
Age: 25
He lost his eyesight at the age of 15.
That didn't stop this self reliant man... from mastering the art of cooking.
Traditional Indian cuisines...
"To Italian, Mexican cuisines..."
"Chef, the food is superb."
- Thank you.
But if anyone abuses my father.
I won't endure that.
The teacher's reputation was maligned.
What happened today?
Why is he so timid today?
On one hand the father los this reputation... and the son his stubbornness.
Look Rajan.
I'm not saying anything because father's asked me to.
What a family?
The son can't speak the father can't walk.
Brother!
Teacher.
Surya and Rajan are fighting again.
Brother!
Surya!
Father.
Father.
It's not brother's fault...
Shut up!
Until you two don't patch up... you will stay locked in the same room.
Surya's returning to Dharampurafter3 years.
Won't you go bring him home Satyakant?
He hasn't achieved any act of bravery... that I should welcome him.
He's a murderer.
He's returning after serving his sentence.
Exactly Satyakant.
He's served his time.
Look Satyakant.
Every saint has a past... and every sinner has a future.
If you don't support him at this delicate moment... then you might lose him forever.
Father.
Please forgive brother.
I came about Isabel.
- Is something the matter?
- Yes.
I fear she's being manipulated.
- Manipulated?
"- And the way they have her dressed, like she's some sort of common peasant..."
- Hmm.
"Roderick, I know what you're going through, with the loss of your parents, and now your sister, her illness."
And I understand that you've taken over your father's business entirely on your own.
Is that correct?
- I did not come here to discuss myself.
"- And I appreciate that, but you mustn't underestimate the toll the past few months have taken on your own psyche."
- I see.
"Thank you, Doctor."
"- Tell me, what is your name?"
- Isabel Porter.
- That's incorrect.
Where are you from?
- Worchester.
- Look at me.
That's incorrect again.
God!
Ah!
- Does that hurt?
Does that hurt?
"No, that does not hurt."
"When one is nothing, one feels nothing."
Okay?
Again.
I do this for your own benefit.
"Through me, you shall understand pain."
Now.
What's wrong with that?
"Master, the stance you taught us a few days ago"
Is it like this?
2nd Brother
"Oh, it hurts!"
You bloody fool
"Dad, 3rd Brother beats Gao Jian!"
What's the first rule of our school?
T roublemaker and treacherous fighters
Will be punished severely!
Someone has got a pig's foot to sell
Someone has got a ghost story to tell
Someone has no voice yet wants to yell
"Someone standing on a bench, shivering like hell"
Who over there could be so ecstatic?
I'll feed you to a dog if I get hold of ya
"Wow, don't be so cruel!"
It must be hard on you
T alking wastes energy!
Be careful!
You're out of breath
Mind you don't get a bad breath!
I'm now holding my breath
Save your breath.
I did that on purpose
So that Master will punish you
And I can release my long held breath!
Oh!
I'm sorry!
I've stepped on your injured foot!
Help!
"Quick, go practice after dinner"
It's fine.
"(SCOFFS) Limited edition dragon's head bookends with faux onyx finish, and the only thing keeping half my library from sliding onto the floor."
That's usually what bookends do.
I'm...
I'm going to go to class.
I'll see you there?

(DOOR CLOSING)
I know you told me not to come back.
But here you are.
- I needed to see her.
"- So, you saw her."
"Hopefully, you could see that she's a strong girl."
She's working hard to get back to her life.
And I don't want to mess any of that up.
- But she had questions.
- Questions... (SCOFFS)
"Questions like, uh..."
"""Why no letters or phone calls?"""
"or ""Where the hell have you been half my life?"""
- I don't want to fight.
- You should have respected my wishes.
I'm trying to protect her.
"When I found out what happened to both of you,"
"I knew I needed to connect with her, because the same thing happened to me, Maggie."
Why are you here?
Emma's friend Riley's been reaching out to me.
"She told me when Emma came home from your mom's house, she thought Emma needed me."
- Not Riley Marra.
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.
Johnny?
Tom won't stay.
He only handles specific areas of the business.
"Sure, Mike."
"-What are you drinking, Johnny?"
-Anisette.
"-If you need anything, I'll be outside."
"-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom."
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?
It's not good.
Can I do anything or send anything?
"He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect."
That casino...
Registered owners.
"Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay."
Beverly Hills attorneys.
The real owners are the old Lakeville Road group and our friend in Miami.
"Klingman runs it and owns a piece of it too, but I've been instructed to tell you that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along."
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.
Hyman Roth always makes money for his partners.
"One by one, our old friends are gone."
"Death, natural or not, prison, deported..."
"Only Hyman Roth is left, because he always made money for his partners."
I can't believe it!
Out of 30 professional musicians there isn't one Italian!

Evil is the nature of mankind.
- Isabel!
- Evil must be thy only happiness.
- Isa...
"- Welcome, children, to the communion of your race!"
No!
Isabel!
"- I, young Goodman Brown..."
"- Isabel, help!"
Help!
-...stand before you with the devil as my witness.
And promise to strike down any who seek to impede my destiny.
"- Isabel, it's me."
"Isabel, please!"
No!
Ah!
"- Oh, Faith."
What would I do without you?
"- Allison, will you please leave us?"
"Faith, will you please leave us?"
Who are you?
- A simple good man named Brown.
"- And at the coven, you spoke the lines of the devil."
- Lines?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
I admit that night in the woods is a bit of a blur.
There was so much darkness.
I'm just glad I was able to save my Faith.
- Very well.
It's a testament to your will that you were able to inhabit your role so fully.
But now I need you to forget him.
You are no longer Goodman Brown.
Who's going to bed?
"Uh, you are, tough guy."
- Come on.
- Ow!
Ow!
Child abuse!
Child abuse!
"Oh, you think that's child abuse?"
You haven't even...
How about that?
What about that?
What about one of these?
"Stand still, you little booger."
Ugh!
"I'm telling you, just give me the big knife and this will all be over."
"Harriet, dear, you have taken a tomato sandwich to school with you..."
With mayonnaise.
...with mayonnaise every day for that past five years.
Don't you want a little variety?
Nope.
Not even cream cheese with olive?
Yum-yum-yum!
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?
"How about the fancy cucumber kind, with the crust cut off?"
"Mom, I can't help it if I know what I like."
And I know that I like tomato.

Hong Fat's Food Emporium
"Holy cats, a veggie thief."
This must be investigated thoroughly.
"Frankie, you took the truck last week."
[Chuckles]
"I'm not an account, honey."
I'm a woman.

That's right.
Louis Samuels.
Rockville Center.
"[Kojak] When you get home, the officers could keep you outside for a little while."
"And I may have to call you again, ask some more questions."
"Other than that, I'm terribly sorry for what happened."
And thank you very much for putting up with me.
Evacuate his house and the business if anybody's there.
Right.
Rockville Center.
Right.
"Lieutenant, everything's in the works."
[Sportscaster] ... a line drive headed for right field.
Mike Lum is back to the wall.
He can't get it.
It's off the wall.
"Staub rounding first, headed for second."
"Lum gets it back in, and Rusty Staub has a double."
It's 10 of 11:00.
And the Mets are still playin'.
I thought they were playing this afternoon?
"No, it was a twi-night doubleheader."
What time did the first game end?
"I don't know for sure, but it couldn't have ended before 7:00."
"Lieutenant, I just remembered something."
You asked about advertising earlier?
"About a month ago, Mrs. Holder specifically mentioned that her husband worked for some sort of agency."
- Did you hear me?
Because blood relations never break.
Good bye!
Sheen!
Sheen!
- Shadab!
- Yes!
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.
"Son, I want to talk something important with you."
"Yes, tell me!"
I was having a talk with your father regarding your marriage.
What have you to tell?
"Mother, this is a matter of the house."
I shall accept whatever you and father decide.
This is your generosity!
Yet we feel we should know your views.
We wish to talk about your proposal with Sheen.
Do you like Sheen?
"Mother, you know that I don't like interference in my work.-Yes."
"So, how can I interfere in matters between you and father?"
I am okay with whatever your decision might be.
- Bye!
- Be happy!
"If we could ask sheen, just once."
Sheen likes India very much!
She tells people in Karachi that we are half Indians.
So let the marriage happen!
She will become a complete Indian.
"Brother, India and Pakistan's relations are so sensitive."
It can go bad anytime.
And...
Let the marriage happen in this country.
- The dogs of Roland!
- What rock did they crawl out of?
!
We can't use big spells in a tangled battle like this!
Out of the way!
Where are they?
Where's the commander?
!
Is it you?
Are you this army's commander?
!
You're...
I just made mincemeat of the Estabul commander.
"If you resist any further, I'll kill you all."
That bloodstained red ring...
It's Crimson Fingered Claugh!
"That's Crimson Fingered Claugh, of Roland!"
Damn it.
All this pointless killing of each other...
Defeated again?
It's like they're reading our army's every move!
I told you!
I told you it was reckless!
- You pick a fine moment to say it!
- Crimson Fingered Claugh?
"You said Roland's commander was Claugh Klom, did you not?"
Ma'am.
"From what I have heard, he has gone to extreme lengths to force our men to surrender without killing them, has he not?"
- Ma'am.
- If that is how Roland battles...
"If that is the will of Sion Astal, the Hero King, then this fight is..."
Don't be ridiculous.
No.
INTERVIEWER:
"So Lloyd, do you think that this body burn will"
"Be better than ""Terror Firmer""?"
You're up.
[Screaming]
--[sigh] Nothing could be that good.
[Laughs]
Nothing could be that unbelievable.
Not since the Vietnam Buddhist priest
Was there such a flame up.
INTERVIEWER:
So how do you guys do this?
How do you light him on fire?
Carefully.
[Interposing voices]
Come over here.
I'll show you where to do that.
"We have Nomex underwear, two pairs,"
In here soaking in fireproof gel.
[Church bells ringing]
This should be the soundtrack!
"Then we have a Nomex jumpsuit over here, which doubles"
For his janitor costume.
"We get that all on him, all gelled up,"
His face and hair gelled up.
Then we put on lighter fluid and rubber cement.
Light him on fire.
He runs around like a maniac.
And we extinguish him down here.
"Maybe you should practice it now, before he"
Gets the stuff on him.
And offer Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
No.
I neverthought Kennedy was ready forthe presidency.
But I...
"I would never, uh, have considered, um..."
His death was awful.
Itwas an awful thing forthis country.
Yeah.
"Do you ever think of death, Dick?"
The flowers are a continual reminder of ourmortality.
Do you appreciate flowers?
No.
"No, they make me sick, and they smell like death."
I had two brothers die young.
Letme tellyou.
There are worstthings than death.
Yes.
There's such a thing as evil.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats:
The Second Coming.
Black Irish.
Very moving.
"""Turning and turning in the widening gyre..."
"""the falcon cannot hear the falconer."
"""Things fall apart."
"""The center cannot hold."
"""Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
"""And everywhere the ceremony ofinnocence is lost."
"""The best lack all conviction."
"And the worst are full of passionate intensity. """
It's all over now anyway.
"In a while, bim-bam-boom, I've got this town in the rearview mirror."
"- Hey, take me with you, boss."
- What?
"- Yeah, a little Colorado road trip."
"- No, no, Larry."
Come on.
Let me go.
I'm practically a fugitive.
I can't take you with me.
"Well, Russ, today, yeah,"
"I'm an authorized Yamaha sales associate, but tomorrow I'm just another guy... boxing peanut butter cups at Hershey."
"Come on, Russ."
"I have faith in you, man."
You would just drop everything to come with me?
"Yeah, let the word go forth -"
The Russ Richards freight train is about to leave the station.
"New horizons, new conquests."
- Ready to kick some new ass.
"- Bob Barker, watch out."
Russ Richards is heading west.
Now let's see what's behind door number three.
Whoo-hoo!
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
- Come on.
- This will be no bed of roses
"All right, I'll take the first eight hours."
- Ever driven one of these things?
- Nope.
I consider it a challenge before the human race and i never lose
All right.
You go too far-l'm not playing games!
I swear to Heaven!
"If I tell lies, I will die."
Okay-l'll kill you then
Raise a cup to woman kind!
Drink to cover many sorrows
A hero cries only for a true reason
But it isn't time for heartbreak yet!
Stop beating!
Stop beating!
"You know him, Beggar?"
Never seen him before
Could he be Chou Lien-Chan?
Who?
You're so old you can't hear
"Was that man looking for you, Ta-pei?"
Don't guess you want to go drinking?
"Wandering around, looking for friends..."
"Seeking the land of wine, all for a woman..."
"I'm from north of the pass, Fan Ta-Pei!"
"Wait for me to come back, Yu-lu!"
Ta-pei!
What do you want to do?
"I'll have a drink with him, and come back"
"Of course, your Nightsweet Premium is the best!"
Don't believe him-he won't be back!
"I am Chou Tien-pa, not Lien-chou."
I have to get instruction of your 18 falls fist.
Beggar'll definitely not escape the challenge
You are not Chien She-chun?
"All the same, let me subject you first"
"Chou Tien-pa, you can't do that"
"Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of the agency I work for and all that, that implies."
"You mean, uh, national security?"
(CHUCKLES) Let's put it this way.
"Every once in a while, things happen that just can't be rationalized in a conventional way."
People wanna know that their government has a response.
I am that response.
"So, were there any witnesses?"
"Well, sir, if you'll just follow me."
- (METAL CLANKING)
- We did find this.
MARV:
"United States Government, huh?"
"Guess that means something big's happening here, eh?"
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
"And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... (CHUCKLES)"
Biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"- Come on, Marv."
Come on.
- MARV:
Okay.
I need a witness.
It's around the corner.
Come on.
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.
I've never seen anything like it.
"It's like a big, big ""chomp"""
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...
Johnnie.
I wouldn't blame you.
Branigan is one in a million.
And I'm not much to write on about.
Am I?
I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.
Everyday!
?
Everyday for the rest of my life.
Good work!
Bloody good show!
Two shots so far!
"If this thing is being treated for color, it's going to look marvelous."
God!
The American's teeth.
Can that be real?
"If the studio shoot goes half as well, this picture is going to be a triumph!"
"There is however, one area of concern."
Uh!
"Memo, please."
From American distributors.
"I'd ask you to absorb what's said without division, Buckley."
American picture goers liked to be knocked off their feet.
"Bangs, crashes, ambulances careeding around corners."
The same goes for romance.
"What you call understatement, translates as a lack of, uhmf..."
Americans feel that the ending is presently written is too subtly too newses.
Restrained.
Restrained?
I mean it's practically a call to arms!
"Their concern is more, what one might crudely call..."
"""A love triangle"""
"And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants."
It goes back tomorrow.
"Skyler, it will crush him."
That car directly contradicts our story.
"And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story."
"What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?"
What about Hank and Marie?
How about the IRS?
"What were you thinking, Walt?"
I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
[scoff]
Look.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
"Oh, he will."
"Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that."
[sigh]
"But you know what, Walt?"
Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.

Only more so.
He's not exactly mellowing with age.

Do you want any more?
Please
"Hello, Camille"
We used to see you at school.
We're Esteban's parents
"Hello, Mr Koretsky"
"Yes, I remember I'm sure a lot of people ask you this, but we wondered..."
Esteban is fine
Have you spoken to him?
Spoken?
"No, I wouldn't put it that way"
But our souls have made contact
Did he mention... well us?
Yes
He said he misses you
He can't wait to see you again
Esteban is at peace
He's waiting for you
He knows you will meet again
What is she saying?
She's giving them hope
Look at her I've never seen her so happy since she came back
She has found what she needed
What?
"A sense of purpose lf anything had a purpose, wouldn't we know?"
You scared me I decided to take you up on your offer
- You kept your keys?
- Yeah
You can take my room ifyou like I'll sleep here with Victor lt's up to you
It wasn't the cannibal who died yesterday
I think I sensed it
But you're safe here
I must see to the sentries.
"Excuse me, ladies."
When will you pay me
Says the bells of Old Bailey
When I grow rich
Says the bells of Shoreditch
When will the...
"Oi, blimey!"
- Sh!
"Is that you in the dress, sir?"
Nice.
"- Give me your picklock, Cooper."
"- Picklock, sir?"
Catch me with a picklock?
They did.
"But when you got out of Newgate prison, you got another set."
- That's the one the officer wants.
- Come on!
"Do I get it back, sir?"
Trust me.
"It's very hard to trust a man who wants to borrow your picklock, sir."
So...
You could not wait until Torrecastro
"Very well, you shall hear the story."
A thousand years ago the Muslims swept across Spain orn their way to Rome
My ancestors made a stand in these mountains at a hard rock we call Torrecastro.
They were many.
We were few.
We died hard.
"At sunset my ancestor dying called on Sant'lago, St James, the saint of Spain."
Sant'lago came.
"He came with a banner of blood and a bright sword, and he slew the invaders in their thousands."
Henry.
(HENRY GROANS)
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
(THUD5)
ESTELLE:
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
AKAN:
I love how protective you are of me.
Mmm...
You owe me an apology.
For?
Doubting me.
I did have certain apprehensions.
Then Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
(GASPS) ls everybody dead?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
(SNIFFING) Ah.

"VVe1lhave a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
... whenI hadthechance to kill that man...
... alltheseyearslater...
... Ihadto do it .
I reckon I'll find out soon enough if God hold me to judgment.
But I'm glad I did it.
"I have to say, this is-- Well, it's a little unusual."
"Um, what shall I call this document?"
A pre-matrimonial stipulation agreement binding to both parties.
All right.
Where do we start?
First and most important...
... shemustbe availableondemand to the marriage bed.
-Except when I'd rather not.
-Agreed.
"And he will, of course, have accounts set up in my name..."
... atallthestoresandsalonsintown .
Of course.
Because she has to do the cooking and shopping for the house.
Only if you want to starve to death.
You'll want a chef and a maid.
-Trust me.
-Fine.
And he must absolutely stop spouting that maudlin poetry at all hours.
Only if she agrees to wear her wedding ring...
-... whenshe'soutinthepubliceye.
-l'll pick out the ring.
-Mm-mm.
-Agreed.
"is that it, then?"
-Can't think of anything else.
-Neither can I.
You both agree the wedding will be tomorrow...
We'd like to call...
"I forget his name, but that guy."
"Prosecution calls to the stand town coroner,"
Dusty Diamond.
This ought to be swift and painfree.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
"Remember, darling, if they ask, tell them everything, everything."
Well... do you swear?
Hm?
"Oh, um..."
"Well, I'd like to know what I'm swearing to."
"Um, perhaps I could read it."
'Cause I can't very well give a good book recommendation if I haven't read it.
"Mr. Diamond, please."
"Yes, I swear."
Hm.
"Mr. Diamond, so nice to have you today."
Mm-hm.
Let's start with:
Were you friends with the Mayor?
Friends.
"Mmm, mmm..."
Thirsty.
"Friends, ah."
"Um, yes."
"Can we get to the meat of the matter, sir?"
Yes.
What was the cause of death?
Cause.
"Well, um, first of all,"
"I, uh, ascertained that his heart would beat no more of that beautiful blood and then I further ascertained that his lungs would breathe in no more of that lucky air."
Lucky because it was allowed to go inside of him.
I rang the doorbell.
"Didn,t you hear?"
I brought your dinner.
Can I help?
No need.
Sit down.
"The gas will be hooked up tomorrow, so you,II be able to cook for yourselves."
Water.
Wine.
"It,s not working."
Excuse me.
There.
"You,re on TV."
- What will we do tomorrow?
"- You,II see."
"Here,s a mattress."
The bedroom will be ready tomorrow.
This afternoon the model couple moved into their happy new home.
"We,II follow this fascinating experiment closely over the next six months."
"Tonight all of France wonders,"
",Who are you, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI?"
","
"We,II try to answer with a few images."
"CIaudine is 25, a keypunch operator at a maiI-order company."
"She,s Parisian."
"Jean-MicheI is 29, from Thonon-Ies-Bains."
"In middle management at a Iarge marketing firm, he earns 3,220 francs a month."
"He,s dynamic, athletic, conscientious, and likable."
"Married two years, they plan to have their first child in the model Apartment, and they,ve received special leaves of absence for the duration."
"We,II let our couple settle in."
"We,II check in again tomorrow, and throughout the experiment."
"Good night, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI, and good luck!"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"Tell Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
"Right away, sir."
Hey.

"Klaus, I'm Duncan Sinclair."
I'm Oliver and Billy's father.
Do you remember me?
Have a seat.
How's Bowmanville suit you?
Little more comfortable than the Russian camp?
Why am I here?
- Did my father arrange this?
"- Now, Klaus,"
"I can't elaborate, for security reasons, but..."
Our families vacationed on Lake Constance when you were a child.
"We couldn't keep you kids out of the water that summer,"
- do you remember?
- No.
This isn't the same breakfast the other prisoners of war receive.
"Well, Klaus, Bowmanville's good, but it's not that good."
I don't want special treatment.
Are you sure...
- I know.
-
- Good.
But you'r e secr etly in love with Casey.
[ Telephone ringing ]
What do you need?
"This will sound ridiculous, but I actually need a staple r emover."
Leave me alone.
Hey.
"Hi, there."
"Listen, you have every right to be mad, but bef or e you say anything, can I just speak?"
Sur e.
Her e's the thing --
"I did tell Natalie that I liked you when I met you in the elevator, and I did tell Natalie that I was gonna call you, but then, like a day later, I went out on a date with this woman named Elaine,"
"and then I went out on another date with her, and it's gotten a little serious, which is why I never called you."
"But I wanted to come up her e and tell you that personally, first of all 'cause I thought it was the menschy thing to do, and second of all because I r eally did like you when I met you in the elevator."
Now you should f eel f r ee to yell at me.
Who the hell ar e you?
It's me.
-
- Is this a joke?
-
- No.
-
- It isn't?
-
- No.
I'm not that good with jokes.
You don't have to be good with jokes.
This isn't a joke.
Jennif er didn't put you up to this?

EZRA:
Josiah.
-Josiah.
You're as handsome as ever.
"If eyes were meant for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for being."
EZRA:
"If you'll excuse us, Josiah."
Heartwarming family reunion and all.
You understand.
"Oh, of course."
[sighs]
"Honestly, Ezra, you've been as sour as a grape since I arrived."
Perhaps that's because I have a distinctly uneasy feeling...
... aboutyouandI both owning businesses...
... onthesamestreet in the same town.
Why ever for?
"Hey, it's not like we're in competition with each other."
"We're not, Ezra."
I provide beds and baths and food for weary travelers.
"True, and I offer music, gambling and liquor."
"Well, there you are."
"Now, you make sure to secure that real well."
MAN:
"Yes, ma'am."
I don't want that toppling over on my patrons.
Stupid.
Stupid.
How could I be so stupid?
I got too wrapped up with this town and these people.
"I should've never quit hunting that bastard, Eli Joe, till I cleared my name."
All those years of looking over your shoulder...
... sleepingwithoneeye open.
- Don't sound upset about it.
- Up to level 12.
"Turn that off, disturbs the patients."
"- Frank, what'd I miss?"
- County HHS needs to talk to you.
"- Ditto, Human Resources."
- Anything from Dr. Romano?
"He called half an hour ago, an hour before that."
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's office called to confirm your appointment-
"Frank, 2 needs a janitor."
What the hell is this?
Why is Stella Willits still on the board?
I called to have her admitted to Psych hours ago.
- I haven't evaluated her yet.
- Save yourself the trouble.
She's nuts.
She's a frequent flyer with a history of bogus medical complaints.
"With all due respect, I'd like to determine that myself."
The ER doesn't have time or manpower to deal with hypochondriacs.
That's what you' re for.
Get her off my board.
- It's part-
"- I said, get rid of her."
Stubborn.
Gotta give you that.
- How are those medical students coming?
- Fine.
I gave them three volumes of Rosen.
ER.
"Carter, Urology on two."
Think you can come up with something a bit more interactive?
Yeah.
I don't like green cars that much
This is an assault nobody moves!
"Get down, c'mon, lay on the floor"
Lay on the floor give me the car's keys
Don't make a move
Put your head down and don't move
"Let's see.... you, open it for us open it!"
Do it or I'll kill you
Let's go
Faster!
"Come on, open it!"
Open it fast or I'll kill you
What's up now?
"The key, I don't have the second key"
Who has it?
Who has it or I'll kill you
The interventor
- Who is he?
Who is he or I'll kill you
Ramirez
- Who is Ramirez?
", who is Ramirez?"
Who is Ramirez?
You are Ramirez?
", come on here You have to open the locked door"
Did you ring the alarm?
"- No If you ring the alarm I'll kill you, eh?"
"Get out of here, c'mon"
Faster
"Come on, faster"
What are you looking at?
"Come on, lay on the floor"
"Are we ready, Baron of Luxor?"
Everything is set.
It's enough to take out the entire mausoleum itself.
We just need to retile it now.
The time has finally come...
"Tonight, we will be freed from her spell!"
Her rule has been disastorous for the empire
Her desire for peace has held us back
Only domination and subordination exists between us and Terrans.
Coexistence is but a fantasy.
We must take back the future of our race.
Even if that means-
Who's there?
!
Run!
Those moves...
Are you one of us?
!
Seth-chan!
I'll be fine!
Just hurry and tell the Duchess of Kiev!
R-right!
Impertinent girl!
Will Seth-chan be all right?
"So long, girl."
Hurry to the port.
Make the final arrangements before pests arrive.
As you wish.
I know this will not remain forever
"However, it's beautiful"
"Your eyes, hands, and your warm smile"
They're my treasure
-She must be a very special woman.
-Yes.
"I'm here, Alyssa."
Where are you?
Why don't you answer me?
"-Welcome, Mr. Casey."
-Check him.
"-And who, may I ask, are you?"
-Marek
Thai is Trea.
-Let me guess:
Draconians?
-We are.
"-Well, then I'm certainly not pleased to meet you."
-It's clean where I found this.
"-Whatever your reason is for coming here, understand we have no intention nor interest in keeping you alive."
"-So I'm dead either way, right?"
-Correct.
No one will be spared.
-Why?
-The Earth's position in the solar system provides us with a strategic and tactile advantage.
"-Robert, the human role in the universe is inconsequential."
"-That may be so, but we have a right to exist."
-Only if we allow it.
-And we don't.
"-Well, before you start waving your victory flag, might I suggest examining the contents of the drive you hold in your hand?"
I think you'll find it very consequential.
-Alright.
Take him.
"And Robert,"
Jaelen had something we very much want.
It's a Grey stone that contains crystals.
I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes.
"We're playing our inaugural round of ""Wild West and Witches,"""
and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.
(spits) Patooie.
"We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon."
It looks ridiculous.
"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
"All right, fine."
Let's just play.
We should go easy on him.
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
"Cluck, cluck, cluck."
"What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?"
Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
Sorry.
Creepy Tepee.
Annie Ogly.
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me."
I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.

- It's you.
- You are.

"Yes, one penis after another."
"General, Guillaume, every month..."
I recieve a limited supply of penicillin from the United States.
And what do you think my priority should be?
To save a sodomite who likes sunflowers... or a wounded American?
- Now please excuse me.
"- General Cork... it's Coronel Eliot, sir."
He says it's urgent.
"Be quick about it, Coronel."
We're at war.
What?
"No, no, that makes no sense."
Let's start over from the beginning.
"Right, first we want a creamy soup."
"But our soup is creamy, like mud."
Tomato soup?
"Yes, I think that's alright."
And don't forget the bleach.
"I don't know, it looks like we'll have to look after her stomach."
Anything else?
"But ""why isn't there any fresh fish in Naples""?"
"Coronel, you don't have to remind me I prohibited fishing."
The Bay of Napoles is mined from here to Sicily.
"But when Mark Cork gives that Renaissance dinner there will be... fish cooked with mayonaise, understand?"
How do you know?
Try the aquarium...
Soldier...
Fish cooked with mayonaise.
My god!
Do you think she'll like that?
- I have no idea.
Look through her.
"I mean, make her think she's the most exquisite thing your eyes have ever beheld."
- Who her?
- Who cares?
Pick somebody.
"Well, how do I pick?"
- You got eyes?
- I thought we established that.
Make eye contact.
Make her eyes believe that your eyes are interested in her.
- So I have to be interested in her.
"- No, you're overachieving."
You only have to make her think you are.
"So we find, in Fielding's novel, the character Tom Jones is absolutely irresistible to women."
"- Isn't that right, Matthews?"
"- Uh, yeah, that's right."
- What's right?
- What you just said.
- What'd I just say?
"- You weren't listening, either?"
"Matthews, keep your head facing this way."
"Shawn, tell your buddy what I was saying."
"Uh, he was saying, ""Matthews, you're not listening."""
Thank you.
Did either one of you guys do the reading assignment?
- Some of it.
- What did you read?
I read the page you handed us with the reading assignment on it.

- Yay!
Yay!

- Gao Jian
"Oh, it's you!"
How come you're here?
Cause I miss you all!
How is Master!
It ain't good to talk here.
Let's go in
"Brother, try these noodles!"
Go on!
"3rd Bro, we haven't seen each other for a year"
Did you change your profession?
It's a long story!
We're now at the mercy of others
We are at the end of our tethers
Y et there's no end to our insults
You're not much better than us!
That's right!
Ever since the three bastards came 3rd Brother has become the chef
"I'm the servant, and Sister is the housekeeper"
"Hey, looks like you've been doing well"
"You here to do your brothers a good turn, is it"
"Shame on me, I'm not much better than you"
What are you doing now?
"Speak up, chap"
I'm waiting on tables
A waiter?
The noodles are for me!
No wonder Master wrote you off as a useless bum
As the saying goes :

"What did you say, kid?"
Nothing!
"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations."
I merely suggest that a regard for sentient life...
There's no time for that.
It's a matter of policy.
"Out here, we're the only policeman around, and a crime has been committed."
Do I make myself clear?
"- Very clear, captain."
"- I'm delighted, Mr. Spock."
"Report, Mr. Sulu."
"Alien ship maintaining interval, captain."
Now at warp 7.
Warp factor 8.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Captain to phaser banks.
All components at battle-ready.
All banks primed.
Aft phaser to bridge.
"Work status, all weapons at operational ready."
- Captain?
"- Yes, Mr. Sulu."
"Closing on target, sir."
Good.
Mr. DePaul?
"- Yes, sir?"
- Our position?
"Two-two-seven-nine PL, sir."
Uncharted solar system at 2466 PM.
This is on the alien's course?
"No, sir."
He's headed away from it.
"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
By the alien ship?
I happen.
"Specifically, i hack in,"
"And you are locked out, maestro."
That's the last time.
Look at you.
You're going to pieces.
Do you remember when i said
Sooner or later you'd pay?
I'm cashing in.
"Sayonara,cyborgorita."
"Son of a... rhade, cockpit."
Targetandromeda.
They might have gone back to regroup.
No.
"Dylan, look."
It's harper.
He reconfigured the generator to do what he wants.
"Rhade, point defense lasers."
Pick those guys off before they come back in.
Dylan... i'm reading a massive buildup
Of zero-Point energy on sensors.
"Shut it down, now!"
I come in peace.
"Harper... right, now,"
"You're probably asking yourselves,"
"""Self, what's to stop these freaks from using us"
"As the little ball in their cosmic shell game yet again?"""
"The answer is me,"
Plus a relative application
"Of the golden rule,"
Mass times the square of the speed of light cubed
Equals a very bad day for them.
-Did you turn a knob?
-Yes.
All.
It doesn't play.
It's only hissing.
Of course it doesn't play.
There aren't any parts there.
"And now we welcome in the studio professor Janatka, to introduce the popular series ""Mystical outer space""."
"Dear audience, recently there have been many groundless reports about the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations on our planet."
From a scientifical point of view this is shear nonsense because...
"Hey, doctor!"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"-That was a great explosion, Doctor."
-You gave us a real treat.
Congratulations!
At night some people are falling into a strange kind of unconsciousness.
-Shall we try it too?
"-Well, since we are here..."
-Are you already unconscious?
-Not yet.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
Let's repeat after him.
"Mum, mummy, Not noodles!"
Please not noodles!
"Mum, mummy, Please not noodles!"
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Not noodles.
Noodles... no.
They don't understand anyway.
"Excuse me, sir."
Are you saying you're going to recognize Red China?
Thatwould cost us our strongestsupport.
"No, I can do this because I spentmywhole career... building anti-Communist credentials."
"If Kennedy orJohnson tried it, they'd have crucified them, and rightfully so."
"Damned risky, Mr. President."
Why don'twe wait until the second term?
"- This will get us a second term, John."
- This will getme a second term.
"Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism, there's no history."
Nixon was born to do this.
Give history a nudge.
- Come on.

"- Hear, hear."
"I mean, if Cambodia doesn'twork we'll bomb Hanoi ifwe have to."
That's right.
"And if necessary, I'll drop the big one."
We have to entertain the possibility.
Goddamn it.
I Who cooked this damn steak?
"Manolo, there's blood all over my plate."
Take it away.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Are you all right?
Yeah.
"My brother, Harold, was the same age as those kids, John."
- Tuberculosis got him.

"Trap Door, have you got any milk in there?"
Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like to mix your own.
-Thank you.
Delicious milk.
"Well, now, my dear, this may come as a surprise to you but I have a little problem."
"You, Black Widow?"
I thought business was good.
Business is boring.
I've completely run out of banks to rob.
I've run through them all.
"Now, that's where you may come in handy."
Me?
How?
"Well, everyone's heard about your Batcave and everyone's heard about your Batcomputer in your Batcave."
Oh.
You want me to get the Batcomputer to give you a bank to rob.
Precisely.
Do you think that you could send for it?
We don't have to send for it.
I have right here in my Utility Belt a remote control Batcomputer oscillator.
"Oh, heh."
- How convenient.
How does it work?
-Simple.
I just press this button and it activates the radio frequency Bat-generator.
- And I just talk to it?
"-No, I talk into it."
It wouldn't recognize your voice.
"Now, question:"
ls there any bank in Gotham City which Black Widow has not robbed?
"My word, wherever he is Batman must be operating his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Come on.
Open the door.
"Open the door, please."
"Come on, Rose."
What are you doing here?
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?
What happened?
Is it Gregory?
"I don't want to say I told you so, but..."
- Mom.
- What?
"When I was a baby, did you think I was pretty?"
All babies are pretty.
"No, I mean me."
You must have thought something about how I looked.
And who will undergo such fantastic plastic surgery?
Only a faceless old folk will do it
"King of no face, you bastard !"

It's the tourist's daughter.
"Well, hello, hello."

I'm sitting here with someone who would like to say hello to you.
"Say hello, sweetie."

"- Optical divagation, I think."
- What?
Kind of like a retinal flare after a photo flash.
"My best guess is the blast from the disco ball, kind of frizzed this mirror's primary reflective capacity and then it probably clipped part of Myka's psyche and fused it in there."
I don't...
"You know, it's kind of like shadows on a wall after Hiroshima."
- It's a pretty lively shadow.
"- Yes, but is it?"
- Is it what?
- Alive.
Help me!
- You wanna?
- Sure.
What's that about?
I'm gonna pull her back if she falls in.
"- Oh, hell."
- Get your mind out of the...
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- So?
- Nothing.
- So what is it?
Just a shadow play?
"- Well, the glass is like a barrier."
"If that's alive, I can't tell."
- Let's just ask her.
"- ""It."""
"""It"" might have something to tell us."
"I mean, why can't we just talk to her?"
"Because we do not converse with reflective entities, okay?"
- Because?
Just a minute.
What's your name?
"McKendrick, Sir."
The British Army appreciates your generosity in donating gratuitous lessons in hand-to-hand combat.
"As it happens, the army's already prepared a manual based on some actual experience in real fighting."
In future you will cooperate with your instructors and refrain from exhibitions of circus gymnastics.
Is that clear?
"Perfectly, sir."
Who's that new geezer over there?
"Don't ask me, I've never seen him before."
He don't seem to like our Canada.
Fall out.
"Carry on, Sergeant."
"Very good, Sir."
If you can.
Next man.
"How long is it now, Flash?"
I was born up here.
That sergeant must be Dracula's big brother.
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
You ain't even queasy.
"How come, Canada?"
I'm a rollercoaster man.
"They've completed, Sir."
"Thank you, that was most instructive."
"Thank you, Sir."
If a little bothered.
"Excuse me, Sir?"
Yeah.
As you've only just arrived and I've er...
You're saying?
"Well, somebody who'd been here some time might be useful to you, Sir."
"- Mom, I'm not going to be alone"
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me
I'm not going to object.

"God, please keep Babuji in a nice mood"

Don't most peopleNhave different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
can you manage a smile?
(classical music playing )
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive.
Hamish is waitingNto dance with you.
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4:00.
Now everything will haveNto be rushed through.
never mind!
Forgive my wife.
She's been planningNthis affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here...
My condolences.
I think of your husband often.NHe was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've takenNadvantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleasedNthat you purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing inNhis mad venture when I had the chance.
too.
(classical MUSlCNCONTlNUES playing )
do you ever tire of quadrille?
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.
(LAUGHS )
Do I amuse you?
No.
I had a sudden visionNof all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses.
I think you'll do bestNto keep your visions to yourself.
remain silent.
"I see, Avdeev."
Do you have problems with the SMERSH?
- lt is them who have problems with me.
- Please specify.
I was drafted with my elder brother.
He was captured and I had no idea about his whereabouts forthree years.
He managed to escape with a group offellow prisoners.
They got to our lines with a lot of arms seized from the enemy.
Theywere lucky.
Theywere arrested.
The arms were confiscated.
They accused my brother oftreason.
I couldn't stand it.
- Can I ask you a question?
- No need forthat.
We are not kamikazes.
The top commanders have set a very difficult battle task to us.
that's why I'm picking up the most experienced soldiers for my company.
"-That's all, you may go."
"-Yes, sir."
"A good guy, isn't he?"
"Listen, private, you'd rather wash yourface.."
And wash your shirt as your senior comrades did.
You are hanging around like...
-Are we preparing for a parade?
"-Well, be it a parade or not a period..."
- but the hygiene is obligatory.
- Fulfil this order!
"Yes, sir."
Nowthe next one.
The next one.
"- Let's have a smoke, folks."
He probably left the car to look at something.
We were told by the police commissioner that the car was brought to this garage.
- I demand its immediate return.
- You have to be patient.
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is an important guest ofthis country.
He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation ofyour government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
"Unless you wish to see this in his film, I suggest you locate the car immediately."
"You're in a no-smoking area, sir."
Would you please extinguish your cigarettes?
"What was the weight ofthe car when you got it, Irv?"
4795 pounds.
You sure?
That's what it was.
4795 pounds when it came into the shop.
Owner's manual says 4675.
That's 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked into Marseilles it was 4795.
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.
"Listen, I ripped everything outta there except the rocker panels."
"Come on, Irv."
What the hell is that?
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
"I got it for you, Randy."
Itjust came in from downtown.
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr Devereaux.
Why?
A drink!
"Whoever gets Nightsweet Premium, drinks it"
I brought you here to ferment wine not to drink it!
Understand!
?
Drinking a bit gives you power!
Nonsense!
Don't make excuses!
Bull!
You just won't believe it!
I don't care-next time I catch you drinking I'll have Dad chase you off!
"Master's ""eagle claw"" kung-fu is powerful"
Take a good lesson for us
Spoken well!
"Please teach us a stance or two, Master!"
Attack me all together!
"Excuse me, Master!"
Want to run?
Speak-why do you want to assassinate me?
You left us no other way out!
"So, we just try it"
Die!
It's not up to you
Turn them over to Lord Chao tomorrow I'll kill whoever resists!
Really?
It's a secret that I learned about
Chang Seventh of th winery knows it too?
Those two guys who smashed us last time...
They must been sent by Chang Seventh!
We've surely created a deep enmity!
I talked to a winery worker...
They said Chang Seventh loves to drink... and then practice Drunken Immortals fighting
He had a licensed revolver for security.
He had just got in a cab and inspector Varma ascended.
He had a pistol in hand.
"Your honour, Inspector Varma was in muRi."
"And you see, one's identification is not inscribed on his face."
My client took him for a crook.
And he tried to escape.
Then Mr Vijay threatened to shoot him.
To defend himself Mr Balwant fired at him.
It's not true.
It is baseless.
Because Mr Balwant vey well knows me as a police officer.
This is not our first encounter.
On the 16th of October I tried to arrest him at Malighat.
But he managed to escape.
- Wrong again.
"On the 16th of October, Mr Balwant was lying in the hospital and not in Malighat."
He was ill and was bed-ridden.
This medical certificate proves it.
"""Me and you in a locked house"""
"""And the keys not to be found"""
Hello!
"Inspector, he..."
- What times!
A decent man like me... ..can't even walk on the streets!
"- Inspector, the fact is..."
What is the problem?
I was on my way to the beach for a swim.
He whistled at me and passed remarks at me.
- Lies!
I am seriously stressed up myself!
"You see it, don't you?"
"Good luck, sweetheart."
"We were just messengered the photos from the shooting... including the Polaroids of you and Paul, they are adorable!"
I'm just dissapointed that Paul missed my cue.
I gotta get the guy out of my head.
- I need some mental floss.
"- Sweetie, take a thought shower."
The important is that Editor Chief knows your triumph...
- and put you on staff.
- I guess...
You're going with me to pick up stationery from the colleaguer.
I've got to get this down to the messenger center by 6.
I'm totally going.
I'll just do a quick e-mail and we're off.
"We'll go to ""II Cantenore"" and... and celebrate the end of your life as an intern slash slave."
"Hold on, I got another call waiting..."
"- Cornelia, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- Who is Jocelyn?
Pink!
The beauty is that he got a bony campaign with Calvin Klein...
- She was swallowing everything...
"- I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- The intern?
Absolutely not!
- Thank you.
"Jocelyn, I hear you got to do the Las Vegas shoot... com Roxanne."
Am I green or what?
"Oh, yeah!"
I'm so excited.
I see Resin found herself a new boyfriend.
Get a room!
- What about Paul?
- He's over Sabrina's heels.
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
-I found him.
-Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, Rene."
Your persistence surprises even me.
"Squishy, I can help you."
I read the topic...
"""Describe a personal hero who's changed the course of your life."""
"- Mom, stop."
- Let's brainstorm.
What makes a hero?
Hmm?
Someone who's great at...
"crafting, matchmaking, parming chicken or shrimp or eggplant or meatballs."
"Listen, I did write about someone in the family, but it's a ""he."""
Yay!
It's me!
"I am he, and he is me."
"Bevy, she clearly picked someone else, perhaps a decorated war vet who had a date with two different Shirleys last night."
That's right.
Pops?
!
"You picked the random old guy who just hangs around our house all day, eating our smoked fish?"
Choo-choo!
"Next stop, Lametown."
"Hey, I liberated an entire country."
I helped saved lives.
Oh!
"Oh, sorry, I drifted off to sleep there."
"Okay, this turned ugly fast."
"Now, if you'll excuse me,"
I have a full day of doing nothing ahead of me.
I honestly don't see a world where it's anyone but me.
But thank you for your service.
My mom would stop at nothing to be Erica's hero.
"Meanwhile, me and Big Tasty started our snow day with an epic cartoon marathon."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
LAUGHTER
"Ellie, what do you get jealous of?"
"I think I get quite jealous, like, if I hear my husband on the phone to another woman and just hear her being like, ""Press 4 for customer service""."
LAUGHTER
Whore!
LAUGHTER
What do you guys get jealous of?
I get career jealous.
Mm.
Career jealousy.
"Yeah, I get jealous of North Korea."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Is that the nice one?
I think so.
You get jealous of people's careers?
Yeah.
I found that one of the highest-paid actresses in England is the Witch of Wookey Hole.
The kids' show?
"No, she's actually in Wookey Hole, which is a cave, and she just pops out at people and she's just a witch."
LAUGHTER
"And that's a proper job that she's on, like, 40 grand a year for that."
"Sorry, you're jealous of a witch that lives in a cave?"
LAUGHTER
"I mean all right, I think we can probably get you that."
"The bar's pretty low, Jimmy."
"David, do you ever do anything..."
Have you ever made anyone very jealous?
Ugh.
"Well, my friend Mike and I, he lives near a cafe where I drink very strong coffee, and I go to his house and do shits sometimes."
And...
LAUGHTER
We would put them in reservations or ship them to...
Madagascar.
"In fact, we encouraged mass emigration."
Eichmann's assignment during the '30s was to find places to move them to.
But... few countries would take more than a handful.
Someone even proposed... a mass sterilization plan.
An ugly necessity.
"In every society, there are pent up hatreds."
"For example, in the United States it's against the blacks;"
"in Russia, the successful."
A politician must mobilize these hatreds.
Reason must be trained to think in historical dimensions.
Get out!
Get out!
You'll get nothing from me!
No mercy!
Tell them Hitler has ice in his veins!
Ice!
I'm the greatest actor in Europe.
I am... the greatest actor in Europe.
Hitler:
"What a thrill to play the Führer-- for 12 years, the supreme Father figure."
On to surpass even Lord Grimm.
"They made me ""Man of the Year."""
They made you what?
"Time Magazine, they made me ""Man of the Year."""
I was on the cover for six issues.
"I conquered Poland, Norway, Denmark, France."
Americans love a winner.
"Of course, it doesn't mean a thing."
They made Roosevelt
"""Man of the Year"" three times!"
Not one of us.
"Lawford, let me see him."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
Don't be stupid.
"Lieutenant Sharpe, sir."
"Where did you get the uniform, Sharpe?"
"Major Hogan, sir."
"What's that, Sharpe?"
"- It's a shilling, sir."
"- The king's shilling, Sharpe."
Our last shilling.
"London's late, the army's broke, and we owe the lads two months' wages."
"Next week, it'll be three."
Bad for the morale.
And more of our Spanish irregular support will melt away without cash.
- What do you do when you're short of cash?
"- Do without, sir."
"You borrow, Richard."
From a bank.
Our banker is Nathan Rothschild of London.
Nathan's brother James runs a banking service from Viennna to Lisbon under Boney's nose
"Ten weeks ago,"
James set out from Vienna with the bank draft.
"He was to travel across France, across the Pyrénées, and into Spain and make a rendezvous at a place called Casa Antigua."
James Rothschild never turned up.
- But...
- Don't!
Don't tell me James is a banker travelling across a country at war.
James is no clerk.
He's done this before.
"We know he got safely to Torrecastro, and from there headed south and is somewhere in these mountains."
So we're going to send out a search party led by...
No!
I can't do this.
You disappear for five years and now you want to move into my flat?
- Yes...
- No.
No.
"(light, melancholic music)"
"You can't work on something, look forward to something,   invest all your energy in something like I did,   then put it on hold because an old lover blames you for never calling."
"On the other hand, this was the perfect test."
"If Mr Mouthwatering could live in my flat for three months   without giving in to Miss Man-eater,   then maybe I could trust him again."
But his odds were low.
(artsy guitar music)
"Ah, Anna!"
Welcome to Paris.
And welcome to my theatre.
Did you have a pleasant flight?
Paris was just what I needed.
"A new beginning, a change of scene."
I made friends with one of the actresses:
Sophie.
"Sophie was strong, self-assured and single by choice."
Exactly the person I needed to be around.
(accordion waltz)
(music becomes melancholic)
Did I miss life back in Copenhagen?
Why would I?
Can you please take off your sweater?
Thanks.
And raise your arm.
(knocking on the door)
You have to do me now.
The director needs me all day.
That's gotta wear on a man.
That's no excuse.
I let my guard down.
"Hey, you know me, Chris."
I ain't afraid of dying.
"I just don't want to go out like that, strung up like some mangy dog."
I ain't gonna let that happen.
"Oh, no."
"You go messing with a federal marshal, they'll string you up right alongside me."
Chris.
Larabee.
Chris.
"Gentlemen, can you not picture this becoming..."
... thefinestentertainmentemporium in the entire territory?
All I can picture right now is them fixing to take Vin away and hang him.
"Now, son, don't fret."
"Besides, when we rescue him we'll need a fitting place to celebrate."
"So, what say you, boys?"
Are you ready for success?
NATHAN:
"I don't know, Ezra."
"My daddy used to say, ""Best horse you ever saw..."
"... wasasgoodasthemanriding ."""
Pure wisdom.
"Good morning, Luce."
"How have you been, Buck?"
I've missed you.
"All due respect, it doesn't look like you've been missing meals, there, Lucy."
[LUCY giggles]
"Well, it happens when you're going to have a baby."
Hoo!
-Sweet Lucy's gonna have a baby.
"Sheila, I did it."
I was selfish.
I was self-involved.
I practically invited that woman into my house.
"You can""t abandon them."
"They don""t have any money."
"I did this and I""m gonna do something about it because I have a list."
"Clara, please."
"If you quit, where were they going to go?"
"L""m gonna win my husband back."
"- Hi, Miss..."
- Not now.
"- Clara, what are you doing?"
"- Old lady""s clothing."
Boring!
You wanna go shopping?
"Isn""t this great?"
"You know, this doesn""t look very comfortable."
They are.
"It""s like you""re wearing nothing."
Only thing worse than being lied to and cheated on... is what you're reduced to.
What makes you sick to your stomach is your own demoralizing behavior.
"The paranoia, the obsessing, the dirtiness of it all... is enough to make you crazy."
It will make you damn crazy.
The liposuction will only remove 4 to 5 pounds... but the difference will seem much more dramatic.
What about my breasts?
Can you make them look fuller?
Sure.
"L""ve been thinking... you know, about you and Daddy."
"You know, you guys love each other so much."
"Amy, not now, okay?"
"Daddy""s going to be home any minute."
She wrote a script.
She wants me to buy a purple tank top.
- She is bananas!
- Hey.
Honey.
Mama's sorry.
"I know all this affects you, and I don't want to drive you crazy like my mom did with me."
- So...
- Were you saying something?
Oh.
Yeah.
Did you not hear me?
"Well, I just thought you were doing all this lining-up business because you heard Mommy getting crazy about Grandma's stuff."
"No, Mama."
Don't worry about it.
I've got my own crap.
You spend all day being the perfect boss.
And the perfect mom.
And the perfect wife.
"But sometimes... sometimes, you just gotta be a little bad."
"Oh, shoot."
"Guys, I gotta go finish some reports for work."
"You need something sweet and salty, just like you."
"Honey, are you eating something?"
"No, I'm doing work reports."
- Mommy?
- Mommy's busy!

New Shhhh-nacks let you hide the shame eating you do to fill the void left by such things as:
"Maybe the wrong one, but..."
-I'll never forgive myself.
-You blame yourself too much.
You did what you morally had to do.
Here.
"-Charlie, can I speak with you?"
-Surely.
The court will come to order.
"Remain seated, please!"
Has the prosecution completed its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?
Yes.
The prosecution rests.
No more questions.
You may step down.
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the stand as a witness for the defense.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Dr.
Matthew Swain.
"Dr. Swain, do you know of any act of force or violence... which Lucas Cross perpetrated against the defendant?"
I certainly do.
We've spent too much time torturing a girl who's emotionally unable... to speak for herself.
"Lucas Cross was a drunken, and a wife beater... and a child abuser!"
"I object! ""Child abuser"" is an exaggerated and inflammatory word."
"When I say ""child abuser"", I mean it in the worst way possible!"
"I object, your Honor."
The deceased is not on trial.
Lucas Cross' character as to force and violence is on trial here.
"You may continue, Dr. Swain."
"I believed your promises, your promises and lies."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
You made me throw it all away.
My morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you :
"""please""."
I'm on my hands and knees.
I want so much to believe.
I want so much to believe.
You fucking promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.
You promised me.

I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Our investigators found an open manhole cover
They assume the thief came up there.
Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment?
Seems unlikely.
You said it rained the night of the break-in.
It was a positive deluge.
Why?

You might know the rest of the story.
He was dead before he died...

Finow.
"Congrats, sousa."
You are the brains of the night shift.
You ladies have a good night.
"If you have the information you want,"
I really don't see the point of this.
I spoke to your Sergeant yesterday about Mrs. Barr's last visit here.
With a different man.
Yes.
Obviously I was as shocked as anyone by news of Mrs. Barr's tragic death.
"Yes, I bet you were."
"I bet she was a good tipper, wasn't she?"
Did Mrs. Barr usually ask for a copy of the bill?
No.
But she did on this occasion.
Now Mrs. Barr's only slightly less disorganized than I am.
Why would she want a copy of the bill when she's already got the original?
"Mrs. Barr always settled the account herself, but on this occasion the gentleman did, cash."
"She asked me to give her a copy of the bill when they left that afternoon, without the gentleman knowing."
Really?
"Thank you, Mr. Ragdale."
May the Lord be with you.
And with Thy Spirit
"May almighty God bless you, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
Amen.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
Thanks be to God.
"Hello,"
I've been looking at this confession you gave me.
"Doesn't say very much, does it?"
"Ever thought of getting advice on your mood swings, Inspector?"
Hmm?
"So, you're back on the case?"
"No, no, I'm still suspended."
"This bit's a bit interesting,"
"'Salva me, fons pietatis'."
"I've only written in the figure ""1""."
Fill in as many zeros as you fancy
Then you'll see how easy forgetting is
Are you joking?
Or are you illiterate?
"I'm lettered, but not for sale"
Is it the wrong time on a wrong day?
"No, you're welcome anytime."
My decision won't change
Nice knowing a man who can't be bought whatever the price
But if you want to sell...
Are you responding to our ad?
Not quite what you assume
I'll see her out
"Om, how did you find her?"
"Forget it, Ma"
Your exams are around the corner and you're keeping up at nights
What are you upto?
Studies?
Or are you at the computer?
"I make my grade, don't I?"
"In studies, in sports, entertainment"
You ask my principal what I mean to the college
I need a loan to buy a software.
Loan...?
Yes.
Loan.
I'll pay it back
You will...?
"First, prove something to me"
Prove...?
What did Jai prove to you?
And then--
"- So wait a minute, wait."
The Homicide gang were chasing them.
"- Thank Christ, at least from our point of view."
"So these ill-fated Jolly Stompers run past us and we're standing there frozen, can't move, and this running mob runs around us like a herd of buffalo and we're just standing there and then ten seconds, just standing around us yelling."
"Homicides, Homicides, and running after these poor souls, who are probably dead by now, by the way."
And--
"And ten seconds later, they're gone."
"Just me and my daughter, standing there, my 13-year-old daughter and me, and we still have nothing to talk about."
(women laughing)
"- Hey, Pete."
Give me another one?
- Cash first.
- What?
"- Horace, come on."
What is this shit?
- Hey.
You ain't paid for the last three I poured you.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Cash first.
- So Iâm broke.
I've got...
I've got a quarter.
You know what?
What if I could make a one dollar bill that you gave me change into a twenty.
"- Ooh, I wanna see it."
- I wanna go dancing.
- Then you'll give me a free drink?
- What are you talking about?
- If I can make your one into a twenty.
Can I-
- Can I borrow this?
That apartment of yours looks like it belongs in a homeless file.
"Then it's off to Crate and Barrel for a knife a fork, a spoon and a glass while you're at it."
Then I'll need a dishwasher.
Just throw them out after you finish eating.
It's on me.
Get a life.
I've got yours.
It's quite enough.
You read this?
Today's Times editorial?
"""Judge or be Judged""?"
"""Notwithstanding Judge Stern's distinguished record one must ask, 'Would he be on the bench if he were not a former law partner of the mayor's?"
"'"""
I didn't appoint him.
"He was nominated, like everybody else."
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours and I always will be.
But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves and Walter Stern.
- Distance is shit.
Distance!
Distance is something you do to your enemies.
It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct.
Distance is the absence of Menschkeit.
Translate that for me.
You don't know what Menschkeit means?
I don't.
Menschkeit.
"You know, something between men."
"It's about honor, character..."
Untranslatable.
You don't have to be on such a death-defying mission.
Not anymore...
What?
I don't want to see it happen anymore.
Don't want to see it anymore?
That's right...
Like your older brother.
"Don't look so worried, Kuya."
But...
Your brother is about to venture out into unknown technological territory.

I mean... for our sake for the sake of our future
Yes Nitu.
But the future for us lies in India
In India...?
Our house is being auctioned
I'm going back to India
Will you come with me?
"Jai, take care of yourself"
"Nitu, you never wanted to marry... someone who was weak, a man without a backbone"
"All along I knew, you were hinting at me"
But what are you doing now?
Jai is a man of substance
You'd like him to become like me?
"Feeble, spineless...?"
"Look, someone who doesn't value relationships remains a loner"
You want to be lonely all your life?
- Lonely...?
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer singing Roberta Flack's beloved Killing Me Softly.
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove on the recorder.
"Marcus, I can't do this."
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said...
I'm sorry.
Here's your £5 back.
Any moment now.
"-Yes, I did some writing."
-Did you get any of it published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't by any chance publish those books with the... the plain wrappers, do you remember?"
"Yes, you do."
Remember?
"You were always afraid, and everything frightened you."
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
"-Really, you look great."
-Thanks.
Though you never said good-bye to me when you left Peyton Place.
-Never even said good-bye.
-I'll never forget that Labor Day.
-I won't either.
-I see you have 2 Purple Hearts.
-What brings you home?
Vacation?
-Haven't you heard about Selena?
"-No, what?"
"-She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
The trial starts in two days for murder.
"Lucas was always a bad Joe, but she always seemed to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with in this world?
"Well, that's true."
"It sure took me a lot enough time... to know a little about myself, understand Peyton Place."
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.
I'm going to go back and try to work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, maybe at least I've made the effort."
You know?
I always wondered why you enlisted.
"No, no, in the crabbing area."
"It's just that you were fishing for bass, so..."
That probably explains why we didn't catch anything.
"You fish in the Apachaway a lot, so I thought that you would know that, but..."
I don't fish a lot.
"- I thought your equipment was pretty sophisticated, but..."
- There's a difference... between wanting to fish and having time to fish.
Tell me about it.
- And he freed the slaves and won the Civil War.
- That's right!
He was probably our greatest president.
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.
- Laine Hanson.
"- Oh, Mr. President."
And you must be one Timothy Hanson.
Timothy Muskie Hanson.
"Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would you like a great big cookie?"
Any kind.
"- No, thank you."
- Any kind at all.
"Oatmeal, white chocolate..."
"Actually, we just had dinner, but thanks."
"In that case, shall we have our picture taken, young man?"
Hmm?
- How do I look?
- Your tie's a little crooked.
"Well, can't take a picture like that."
Will you straighten it for me?
Your mommy tells me you know more about the presidents than most grown-ups.
- I like to study them.
- Mmm!
Are you hurt?
"Oh, no."
"I tripped earlier on the-- on the cobblestones, and I-I must have cut it and--and not noticed."
"Well, I'm glad you're safe."
You must be Annie!
"Uh, I am."
I forgot to tell you we have dinner guests.
"These are my dear friends Blanca Gonzalez and her boyfriend, Hector Serrano."
It's lovely to finally meet you.
We've heard so much about you.
Yes.
So much.
♪
You found a real catch.
We just love Simon.
Really?
How often do you get to see him?
Every few weeks.
He's doing some business deal with Hector.
That must be frustrating-- always losing your boyfriend to a business meeting.
Tell me about it.
Hopefully I'll have him back to myself soon.
He tells me this deal is basically finished.
"Three mojitos-- the personal vice of your countryman and fellow Cubaphile, Ernest Hemingway."
I wonder what
Hemingway would think if he saw our country after 50 years of the embargo?
I bet he'd still be enchanted with its natural beauty and free-spirited people.
I know I am.
Mm.
We hear that sentiment a lot from tourists.
I find it incredibly condescending.
"Hector, please."
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
david:
Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
(REWlNDlNG)
(GUNSHOTS)
DAVID:
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere... I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
-(pounding)
-Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
(REWlNDlNG)
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
katherine:
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
- Are you bullshittin' me?
[Grunts] That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
[Jimmy] Tear it right out.
Tear it out!
"Nothing here, Jimmy."
Look in here.
[Coughing]
This is all solid.
[Loud Hissing]
[Tire Bouncing]
[Whirring]
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
[Indistinct]
[Speaking French]
"Look, the car was lost some time last night."
"First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here."
Then what?
I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront.
You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan... and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge?
"Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television."
He probably left the car to look at some point of interest.
We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.
I demand its immediate return.
"You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux."
"We get 400, 500 cars here a day."
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country.
I am still in Tangak_
He is not late.
Put it down!
What did they do to you?
I had to bring it so I did.
- A man must honor his promises.
- Well done!
"Well done, what?"
A man must honor his promises;
"I said ""well done"" for it!"
- So?
- So what?
- A man must stay to his promises!
"- I did promise nothing, did I?"
"Bashirou, why did you put the cradle here"
"Bashirou, what happened to you?"
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
I like you;
I liked your father too.
"- If I would say something to you, it's because of"
- I understand!
"It's because you don't want me out of money, you want me to take re of my family."
"But Mr. Zaer Kheder, I said something else to you before going to Tangak."
"Yes, you said!"
But I can't burden ketfledrum to you.
To whom I should say not to play and let this little boy play kettledrum?
"Whoever you see, was waiting from last year's Moharram to this year's to play kettledrum, cymbal, and horn and morning Alam Iifling"
Everybody has his own vows.
All of them have their own intentions.
Whom should I ask for'?
"Mr Zaer Kheder, ifs cheating!"
Will he kneel down when he asks her?
They always kneel down.
"What is wrong, dearest?"
Willoughby?
What is the matter?
Forgive me...
I am sent...
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?
What a disappointment.
"Your business won't detain you for long, I hope?"
You are kind.
But I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?
My engagements are of such a nature...
I dare not flatter my...
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.
"Willoughby, come back!"
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.
"- What is wrong, my love?"
- Do not ask me questions.
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- Sure.
And smiles.
Many people need it.
It's the British specialty.
And we must remember the Belgian spectators
That the current conflicts between Flanders and Wallonia
Are counterproductive.
- Unbearable.
The image of our king is the only force that unites us.
That's why it must be perfect.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
Excuse me.
- You are welcome.
Belgium.
Is it a real country or just a geopolitical compromise?
I do not know.
But he has a palace and a king.
"And a queen, who hired me to shoot a documentary about her husband,"
"Nicolas III, the King of the Belgians."
"Mr. Lloyd, I remember the rule number one: no interviews."
And rule number two:
No improvisations.
Sooner or later I would like to discuss this.
His contract speaks clearly.
Just follow the script.
"They did not know I was filming, which gave me hope."
Here's the boring part.
I follow their script and film the king who makes the king.
Have you been here already?
This is the first time.
But the scene serves to appreciate this unlikely story.
His own story.
"- Oh, just until I make one."
- What time is your appointment?
Why?
My teeth are straight.
To justify charging me more money that I don't have.
Robert Dumanjik from the District Attorney's office.
The District...
"Oh, yeah, okay, put him through."
- [telephone rings]
- Hello?
"Hi, Karen, This is Bob Dumanjik, We haven't met, I'm the,"
"- No, I know who you are."
"- Oh, good, good,"
"I understand that you're representing that suit against Atlantor,"
"Yes,"
"I wondered if we could talk about it,"
Talk about what exactly?
"Well, that's what we'd talk about,"
But I don't think that I understand.
"Well, we'd talk about that too, How about tomorrow?"
What is this about?
Should I be expecting a subpoena?
"Oh, no, no, I just think there are some things that are in our mutual interest to talk about,"
Let's say 10:00?
- Downtown?
"- If that's okay,"
- Okay.
"- Great, See you then,"
What was that about?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Does this much slate exist?
They'll have to dig up Rhode lsland to find this much.
- Isabel.
- Isabel.
"- Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter I wish to discuss with you."
"Um, Nurse Oaks?"
"- Yes, Madam?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse Oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
- It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"- Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
- Roderick.
"- They're quite nice, I must admit."
"- Yes, indeed."
- What order shall be taken
- with the prisoners?
- Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"- Lucy, this is not a good time."
- Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers... which will no longer taint my breath in the Garden of Eden.
- Is that Hawthorne?
- What do you mean?
"- You were quoting one of Mr. Hawthorne's Twice-Told T ales, were you not?"
- I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"- There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, Nurse Oaks."
"Fortunately, this yet to be completed formula... was stolen by a Jewish Scientist, who intended to sell it to the Americans."
"Since the Jew's nanny taught him Mandarin, and to evade attention, the deal was carried out in H.K."
"They cold named the formula the ""Beast""."
"On knowing this, Hitler sent 2 Gastapos to H.K."
"To catch the ""Beast""."
Nothing can stop the world from rotating.
But there are always exceptions.
"You're always so fast, only takes you less than a minute."
"That's simple enough, even a dog can do it."
Someone's at the door!

"- Yours, of course!"
Give me a hand!
Hold on!
- O.K?
- O.K.!
"Hello, this is Yoyo Private Eye's, I'm Super..."
No...
I'm the Great Super Yoyo?
What?
Your No.8 concubine has walked out on you?
"Such a simple case, why bother me?"
Wait till all 8 of them walk out on you!
What?
The Mayor inviting me to dinner?
Haven't got time!
I wouldn't be Yoyo if I can be so easily invited.
"Old man, what can I do for you?"
I've come to connect the telephone.
"Oh yes, you haven't paid the bill for 6 mouths."
I spent all my savings yesterday to pay for it.
Smart girl.
I have 10 times more experience than any Ivy League kid.
It's not just about experience.
I would need to depend on you every day.
What do you want me to do?
I'll start at the-
- I'll start at the bottom.
Just give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
"- Yeah, I think I got a shot."
- Really?
You know how it is.
They gotta go talk amongst themselves and...
These-
"- Look, these things, they can be really political."
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.
He has phone calls to the congressional leadership.
First lady is back tonight?
Empress is wheels down at 1845.
"They're supposed to have dinner at the residence, but you know how they are."
"So we should have an advance on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual."
- What if she wants sushi?
"- No, no, she's off sushi."
Remember she had that thing on the Japan trip?
"- Carol, how are you still awake?"
"- Caffeine and patriotism, sir."
- Threat matrix?
- Well threats against POTUS have quadrupled since the G8 speech.
PID is keeping an eye on a guy in Buffalo they're worried about.
- Visitors today?
What I will say is when we finished filming and I drove to the hotel
I always found myself getting into the Subaru.
I prefer the Impreza.
No idea why.
"It's like I prefer dark to milk chocolate,"
I prefer Bedford to Bruce Forsyth.
"Right, let's see if we can find out if there's any real difference between them on our test track."
Please say mushi mushi to Stig-San.
So first up the Impreza STi.
"This is the tweet one, remember."
And...
Oh dear.
"An emotional Stig this week, round Chicago."
This car does understeer so will that slow him down?
It is looking good so far.
Ooh.
He is...
He IS running wide there.
Into the penultimate corner.
"Come on, Stig, keep it tight."
There's loads of understeer and he goes round the finishing line!
Now what about the Evo VIII?
In the interests of fairness
I should say this isn't the car Jeremy drove in Scotland.
It's the 301bhp FQ version.
Very tidy round Chicago.
No trace of understeer as it smoothly powers through that hammer head.
TYRES SCREECH Good Lord!
"Screaming at the follow-through, a second faster than the Subaru."
Will it beat it?
Over the finish line.
I have the times here.
LAUGHTER
This is the same studio we film Pointless.
Where David is sitting there is roughly where I sit.
"Jessica is roughly where the column is, and if you look under your desk, that's Alexander Armstrong's secret coke stash."
LAUGHTER
Does this remind you of anything?
HE MOCKS RICHARD
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
That's a little harsh.
I mean...
"listen, it looked like me."
I don't think it sounded like me.
LAUGHTER
"So, I've knocked the microphone off in trying to do an impersonation."
"Yeah, you know what?"
"It's harder to be me than it looks, my friend."
"Sorry, do you think your impression was so good you dropped the mic?"
LAUGHTER
"Literally, our sound department has just gone, ""Aww."""
LAUGHTER
Should we treat ourselves to a little look at Pointless?
Check this out.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many words ending in 'ZZ.'
"OK, so I have a word, um..."
"But, again, it's sort of slangy, maybe slightly profane."
So what do I do about that?
What's your counsel?
"Hey listen, my counsel is..."
LAUGHTER
"My counsel, if it's going to score you 250 quid, fabulous."
"So, I'm going to go with jizz."
"You don't keep a lot of old, useless paperwork around, do you?"
I have found shredders to be quite useful in eliminating clutter.
"- Miles, what's happening?"
- Did I say something was happening?
"If I knew something was happening and I told you, then I might be seen to be conspiring with you, which, of course, I never would."
Conspiring with me?
About what?
Conspiring with you?
About what?
"Miles, are you trying to scare the bejesus out of me?"
"Hard drives are particularly vexing when it's time for spring cleaning, though I understand there's software available for that purpose."
"- Miles, what is happening?"
- l'm off to a lunch now.
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello and let you know I'm thinking of you.
Karen?
Hi. I'm Bob Dumanjik.
- How are you?
- l'm fine.
Thanks for coming down.
- l know you're really busy.
- You do?
"Well, I assume it."
Should I not assume it?
Are you secretly lazy?
"Um, this way."
Stop it.
Not you.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Of course, it's always a mess around here."
Go ahead and sit.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Oh!

"- What a way to die,"
- mauled to death...
- Henry... you don't know that's what happened.
"You didn't see it, George."
Those terrible scratches on his face alone would let you know if you did.
Sir.
"What have you, George?"
"Sir, the man who discovered him was checking his snares this morning."
"He seemed surprised, almost disappointed to find out he'd snagged a human."
I suppose he was expecting his dinner.
Right.
Have him come down to the Station House for a word.
Do we know the victim's identity yet?
"He has nothing on his person, sir."
"We searched the area for his wallet, no luck."
"Judging by the scratches on his face,"
I'd say he was attacked by an animal of some kind.
"- Higgins has a theory, sir."
"- Uh, George..."
Does it pertain to this case?
"He certainly thinks it does, he hasn't shut up about it."
(Higgins sighs.)
Henry?
"Sir, it's like a..."
I only saw it for a minute.
Saw what?
"You better follow me, sir."

"Oh, you're so like a man, Townsend."

"So you see, dearest Scott,"
"I worry that I'll never do anything of import, for I'm much too lazy to care whether a thing is done or not."
"All I truly want is to be young always, and to feel that my life is my own."
[indistinct chatter]
Tildy says the people of New York all have different kind of accents.
The likes of which she's never heard.
Plenty of different accents around here.
"You mean, like, Mississippi and Georgia?"
They are different.
Are they not?
"I think Tildy's talkin' about non-southern type accents, Daddy."
"Yes, Tootsie, I understand."
- We about done here?
"- Zelda, honey."
Could you post this for me?
I suppose so.
The streets are filled to the brim with people and cars and buses and trolleys.
It's all one big swirl.
Nothin' to love about the big city.
I think it sounds exciting.
Yet you passed on your chance.
"Have a seat, Mrs erm?"
- Er...
Compton!
- We'll see what we can do for you.
Maybe we could set up a trust fund so they're provided for.
- What?
- A trust fund.
So that they are provided for.
Of course they are!

Hi.
"Tell me something, Peter, when did this Mary Goodyear die, exactly?"
- Three weeks ago.
- The same time Barkway invited you to speak at his conference.
"Thank you, and good morning."
And welcome all to our conference on human justice.
Bunking off class?
That isn't like you.
- Going to a rave or something?
"- No, the library."
"- Miss Cramer, please..."
- Let me get this straight.
Barkway has seen that intimidating me personally doesn't work.
So now he's sent his poodle to do the job instead.
"Really, Miss Cramer, I am nobody's poodle."
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.

I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
"Point Pleasant, West Virginia."
You can help me.
Follow me.

"In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul immortally trapped... in the hellish death realms."
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
"Rough translation, of course."
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plantwent down.
"Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane."
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
"Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially."
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
"Oh, they exist."
All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
"Electricity, microwaves, infrared waves."
"You know, these things have been around forever."
She was a blackmailer.
And I killed her.
"And up to now, I'm glad I killed her."
And I believe that in this killing the murderer has the sympathetic part.
Does that satisfy you?
"Yes, sir."
That satisfies me.
"Lieutenant, you would do me an enormous favor if you stopped calling me sir."

Already it is 30 years since I came here from Copenhagen to start my shop.
I do not marry.
I put my heart in my hands and shape the wood.
"People like, and I make the shop bigger and bigger, and I put more and more men to work."

"Vasundhara, who has been charged with financial forgery is being investigated by the police."
We chased Vasundhara for many days regarding this case.
We are collecting the details of the money lost by the victims.
What a man!
Thank you very much.
Your news has taken over every news channel.
You are the pride of our district!
Thank you.
"- Congrats, constable sir."
"Thank you, Sir."
"Super, dude!"
One cop like you in a town is enough to stop fraudsters.
Thank you.
- You are great!
Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?
You have achieved a great thing.
You've got all the accolades that I should have for my service for 37 years of service today!
Sir...
I just did my job.
People giving the praise...
The photos of the victims have been recovered from Vasundhara's phone.
Is that you?
That is definitely you!
Why would you take a picture that close to her!
Dear...
She is already jailed.
Your anger still not subsided?

"Varun, I'm coming for you."

- My mother's recipe...
And here we go.
We loosen our arms And up and down and up and...

You're not going to invite us in?
Of course.
Please.

This is a confidential mission.

"Calm down, please."
Part of our project is to be inconspicuous.
"But if you really arrived from outer space, you would look completely different."
Like what?
For example like green elves or something like that.
We don't like doing this.

Doesn't it?

"Let's go, we saved him!"

UNDER SHEETS WITH THE DOCTOR
-You erase the slate please
-Immediately
Today we will examine the corpse of a man passed away by peritonitis.
"Pair to see better, you lower to the first rows."
"I see many new faces, students of first course,"
"I go especially to them, if you have never seen a corpse you are not impressed, a corpse is only a person who does not move."
We begin our class of anatomy macrocospic...
We can begin by...
"Well, we can begin our class of anatomy macrocospic."
You take notes.
What is that?
"Alvin, please think about what you're doing."
May I remind you that you are addressing the president of the United States?
"Mr. President, I don't wanna write off any Americans yet."
"Trust me, sir, we'll get your house back for you."
"Mission'sa go,colonel."
"Thank you, sir."
You heard the president.
Six minutes.
"So, what's it like being president?"
It's not like anything.
"Once you get into office, it's all about reelection.."
and what the other side can use against you.
Politics.
You don't start out a politician..
but you become one.
"Just once, though, I wanna do something that's presidential."
"Something along the lines of Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson."
You wanna make history.
No.
Not history.
I wanna make a difference.
If your little daughter says that I'm her hero..
then I gotta earn that.
"All right, we go in low and quiet."
Time to target is two minutes.
"Falcon 2, maintain 30 feet."
"Falcon 1, copy, 30 feet."
Dropto10 feet!
Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C. There's total gridlock through..
"Oh, my God!"
U.S. Special Forces are flying over us!
- Petition!
"- Why fear the word ""mutiny""?"
- I'm not afraid of it if it fits but it don't.
"Seize one ship, that's mutiny."
No one ever got away.
"- Seize the fleet, nothing they can do."
- They can't hang every man.
We'll make them listen to us.
Until then spread the gospel.
Same as back at Spithead.
Yeah.
"Wait, and wait, and wait."
"Yes, Evans."
Wait.
Until the time comes.
"And when the time comes, Vizard..."
Scott-Padget!
"Mr. Kilpatrick, you've been before the board three times."
- Each time you've failed.
"- Yes, sir."
"- What age are you, 33, 34?"
- Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
- Your chances are getting slight.
"- Yes, sir."
Unless the board had reason to believe you had special qualities.
"- Special qualities, sir?"
"- Ingenuity during difficulties courage, loyalty to a particular officer an officer with influence, who might use it."
"Yes, sir."
"I think I see, sir."
"You're in charge of disciplining midshipmen, right?"
- Make them kiss a gunner's daughter.
The chairman of Maruti and I are good friends.
If you say so...
I can talk to him about a job forJai
Jai has several job offers
"All he has to do, is select."
I'll talk to him right away
You aren't doing this for yourself.
You're brilliant.
And we're duds
You can use computers to dig out the exam papers for us
"As morals say, one ought to help pals"
All right.
See me at home tonight
Inside the university's mainframe!
What frame...?
We're inside the university bank.
We just got to break into the papers
Just got to figure out the password.
Of course you will
Let's concentrate
"Go on, smoke."
It's okay
Give me some passwords you know.
I'll give it a try
Shakespeare?
Madhya Pradesh...?
Have you met the managing director?
"Yes, but he wants me To sign up... on an 8-year bond."
Then sign up
"You're staying here, aren't you?"
Why eight?
Sign up for 10 years
"Lost thousands in company stock, he was recently laid off, and if Wickes Steel goes under, he will likely lose his pension."
SECNAV's green plan ruined this guy.
Sounds like a motive to me.
McGEE:
"If Ridgeway did it, he had help."
There's no way he's got the skills to break through AUTEC's firewall.
I found a post of his on a PC forum asking what a cookie is.
(laughs) Old people.
Old people entertain me.
"I can tell you Wickes didn't have the know-how to pull off this AUTEC job, either."
I think we're looking at a team.
So you determined from the interview that Wickes is involved?
(clears throat)
My findings were inconclusive.
GIBBS:
Any contact between Wickes and Ridgeway?
Not a peep out of Wickes since we let him go.
Wickes is a chess player.
It doesn't surprise me that he's taking some time before he makes his next move.
"McGee, get me a location on Ridgeway."
On it.
"DiNozzo, Ziva, get going."
"Oh, um, instead of"
"Wink Martindale here,"
I think I'd like to send Elliott.
TONY:
Wink?
"Come on, at least go Chuck Woolery."
"No, let me at him."
I'm the king of non-verbal indicators.
"Yes, he is."
"Unless, of course, somebody blocks his view."
Well...
I get that.
It's an important case.
I gotta go.
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee."
"Hey, tell everyone I said hi, okay?"
"Yeah, you bet."
Bye.
Let's get back to work.

"The victim is Corporal Jared Connors, 28,"
Fourth Marine Division.
"Drove here regularly when he was on leave, he even raced in the amateur circuit a few times."
Experienced driver.
Apparently.
"Him and the girlfriend, Dana Wells, were the only drivers on the track when he crashed."
Lost control of his car?
"Yeah, except his father thinks he was murdered."
Russ Connors is a mechanic on one of the racing teams.
Told the sheriffs he's convinced the car was sabotaged.
Sabotage?
Why does he think that?
"Well, I didn't get to talk to him."
"He got cut pretty bad taking his son out of the wreck, so..."
Paramedics took and the girlfriend to the hospital.
Think that's case-related?
More like trouble in paradise.
I don't think he and Melody are getting along right now.
"Well, it can't be easy..."
"Woman pops into his life, surprises him with a baby."
At least Lasalle's trying to do the right thing.
"Just wish it didn't affect his work so much, undermanned as it is."
They're based on the Dominicans who fought for La Independencia.
- Los Gavilleros?
- Yeah.
They fought the US with a guerilla waftare for four years.
"For me, it's just another way of talking about sugar."
"That's what the Gavilleros were fighting over-- foreign companies buying property from people who don't even own it, then kicking the campesinos off their land."
"Anyway, that's how I got the concept for ""Europa."""
Carlos...
I've got to be honest with you.
I really like what you did.
- Really?
- I love it!
"And it couldn't come in a more peftect time, because I just lost a series."
"The artist was brilliant, but he was terribly depressed and he could never work."
And I had to find something to fill the book in our slate.
- Okay!
- Great!
How soon can you finish?
- You never gonna believe it.
- What?
- You've got to guess.
- I don't know.
You won the lotto?
- I asked Daisy to marry me.
- Get the fuck outta here!
I asked her to marry me and she said yes.
I am high as a motheftucker right now.
"Dude, do you know what you're doing?"
Of course I know.
"I know I say shit sometimes, but that's just me being stupid."
"I'm getting fucking married, bro'."
"Yo-- all right then, well, shit!"
"If they discover the secret of this cursed village, nothing will stop them from taking revenge."
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Let them come and see the captain!
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.
"Come on, then."
"Come on, ghosts."
"Come on, phantoms."
"Come on, demons."
Come back and see the captain.
I challenge you.
You died tonight.
I will kill you again!
We have to shut him up or he'll tell them everything.
He's drunk
I saw your heads smashed against the rocks!
What the hell is going on?
I don't want any trouble here
It's morning.
We're closing now.
Finish your drinks and go.
It happened one windy night
It happened one stormy night
"Crashed on the rocks, a stray ship"
Leaves two beautiful innocent girls
A celebration of beauty
Some accursed men were wandering about
Full of wine and alcohol
They plundered the wrecks at night
Innocence destroyed by rape
A celebration of beauty
"Oh, about that we're not supposed to be brothers?"
"No, don't flatter yourself."
I don't break that easy.
"Oh, good, 'cause I was just being honest."
"Oh, yeah."
"No, I got that loud and clear."
"[ Telephones ringing, police radio chatter ]"
"Thanks for your patience, agents."
Coroner's report finally came in.
"All right, thank you."
"All right, let's see."
Did Wayne McNut really weigh 300 pounds just moments before time of death?
316 to be exact.
And the official cause of death?
Cardiac arrest.
"But between you and me, that's just a guess."
The vic suffered massive organ damage.
"Here you go, Jenny."
"Ruptured spleen, pierced liver, collapsed lung."
Looked like everything was just [slurps]
Sucked right out of him.
Like he'd been hoovered?
Yeah.
"Yeah, you know, I got to be honest, fellas -- hm?"
We're stumped.
This type of thing just doesn't happen in Stillwater.
"Now, did Wayne have any enemies?"
Hmm.
More like an unfriendly rivalry.
"A guy named ""Slim Jim"" Morgan."
"Like Wayne, he was pretty well-known in the competitive-eatin' circuit."
Competitive-eating circuit?
"Yeah, that's right."
And the head of your family is Michael Corleone?
"Yeah, Counselor."
Michael Corleone.
Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone?
"No, I never talked to him."
"Mr. Cicci, could you amplify your answer a bit?"
-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?
"I'm particularly interested in knowing, was there always a buffer involved?"
Someone in between you and your superiors who gave the order.
"Right, a buffer."
The family had a lot of buffers!
"You may find this very amusing, but the members of this committee do not."
"Tell me something, Ma."
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?
He was being strong...
Strong for his family.
But by being strong for his family could he lose it?
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.
But you and your wife can always have another baby.
"No, I meant..."
lose his family
But you can never lose your family.
Times are changing.
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.
Take it as a gift.
"If there's something I can do for you, you come, we talk."
"Signora Colombo, why did you come to see me?"
Suppose you leave your house all open won't it drive the thiefs bad intentions on?
"Ty telling this to people, and they get furious."
Weird talks!
You thinks people ale...
Come on!
Both ofyou have really got deep into it.
Go ahead.
Throw your questions at me.
"Else, how will you gain knowledge on this subject."
"Hey Vijay, you are here?"
You are wanted there.
Me?
-Eveyone is requesting you to sing.
Are you kidding?
A song?
From a police officer?
- You'll be amazed to hear him.
How will he sing in an orchestra?
He might need a police-band.
Come on!
Don't hesitate.
- We are getting late.

Much more!
"Now, these hopefuls are ready to enter"
Chef Ramsay's domain.
They come with confidence.
I'm not nervous at all about any competition.
"Throw a pan at me, and I'm gonna throw a pan back."
And they come with dreams of being the next winner of Hell's Kitchen.
It's done;
it's over with.
They might as well just give me the prize.
"Today, representatives from the media have come for their first glimpse of the group that will contain the next culinary superstar."
"It's not that I'm cocky, but"
Hell's Kitchen's gonna be a piece of cake.
These aspiring chefs think they know what awaits them.
I'm pretty confident that
I'm prepared for anything that Chef Ramsay can throw at me.
But no one is ever really prepared for Hell's Kitchen.
"Right, let's go."
Come over.
"Oh, my God."
I was taken away.
I felt like a celebrity.
"Hello, hi."
This year's chefs come from all over the country.
"I'm from Maui, Hawaii."
"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
"Boston, Massachusetts."
"From many different culinary backgrounds,"
I'm a master cook.
I'm a culinary arts teacher.
"I saw him once from a distance, though."
Handsome boy.
"He's got a long struggle ahead of him, that's for sure."
"Doctors, rehab... physical therapy...."
I think I'm going to have the medallions of veal.
You make me late for a table at Tavern on the fucking Green?
How's the real estate business?
-Excuse me?
"-You know, HUD."
"Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman."
Zellman tell you this?
Carmine doesn't know anything about this yet.
"I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal, make it right."
"Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you in out of friendship, but that's over."
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.
You sure you want to go down this road?
"How much to paint a different suit on him, change his face a little?"
-Pardon me?
-Why throw it away?
"A stronger chin, maybe."
I was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse.
"Something classy, you know, like a Revolutionary War general."
Napoleon and his horse.
That kind of thing.
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.
"Not Napoleon, exactly."
Like Napoleon.
Sit down.
Relax.
"What's going on, Ton'?"
"I think I know what happened to Ralph, and if I'm right... he ain't coming back."
"-Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP."
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Even a tiny bleed can become serious if she can't clot.
"It's possibly a good idea, Dr. Kovac..."
... butyoudo realizethatbloodproducts carry the risk of infection...
"... andtransfusionreaction,don 'tyou ?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, was the CT negative?"
There's no bleed that we could see.
Do you wanna expose your patient to those risks because her platelets are low?
Scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.
I'd worry more if she had mental status changes...
... ora focalneuroexam.
-He's got a point.
-She's drunk so that's hard to assess.
Drunk people get sober.
And careful observation is still better than any lab.
That's right. I'd have to agree.
What just happened?
They've been pulling that on me all morning.
"I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest?"
-l wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
-Did you hear what I said?
-They got you on tape.
-Couldn't have been me.
-You were up there long enough.
-They had to look for that infuser thing.
"Don't give me that crap, K.J."
Okay.
"There's this girl, one of the volunteers..."
-... she'sfineas hell-- -l went out on a limb for you.
- This is natural.
A projection.
Your mind fights against itself as it attempts to expunge the pain and grief you carry inside.
You have internalized society's rules and limits.

I think I understand.
- Good.

"- Uh, yes, my sister Isabel."
She's convalescing.

"Well, good day, Roderick."
Great to see you.
"Come, my love."

How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
I would kick them in the arse!

Very kind of you.
Do you understand the incovenience we have had with the police inquiry?
We are not used to that line of inquiry.
"But I will be delighted to cooperate, with what little I know."
"Hopefully, it will be of use to punish the perpetrator."
"Ms. Bristol, I would like to know about you."
I will spare you from a long line of questioning
Laura?
Give him what I dictaded persuant to the case.
Here you have all I know about the unlucky girl.
"When she was hired, how we met her, etc."
And...
"I will ask for you to bother me no longer, Mr..."
What did you say your name was?
"Forget it, it is not important."
Show him out.
Thanks.
"I need a secretary just like you, when you wish to resign, know that I await you with open arms, eh."
"I would like to have you as a boss, but I am quite pleased with my current job."

Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the northern portal and trapped Jinora in the spirit world.
"Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers."
"Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer."
"And in the Southern water tribe,"
Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war.
But Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.
Dad's back!
Where's Jinora?
No!
"Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world, but she's going to be all right."
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.
I should have never let Jinora enter the spirit world without me.
I couldn't protect her.
"I'm so sorry, Pema."
"I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
"Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."
You've got a visitor.

- Hey.
What's with the fancy duds?

Wait a minute.

"[ Lawyer ] Now, he's been up all night."
How many times are you gonna ask the same question?
"Let me ask you another question, brother."
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"

- Counselor.
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"

Wait.
Do you not wish your officer to give you some high honours?
"Oh, but he did."
He told me to fall in.
"Lieutenant Sharpe,"
I think it better if you now take command.
Get down!
"That fella's the dead spit of you, Major."
Something you want to tell me?
And what are your orders?
Open that chest and tell me what's going on.
"I'm sorry, not until we reach Torrecastro."

But if they are not here...
Your fellow countrymen need your protection to Torrecastro.

Eminem is dope.
I like lyricists.
I like people that actually rap.
"Kendrick, J. Cole, Drake,"
I don't think you'll find anything.
Whoever did this knew you'd look at the GPS.
They must have covered their tracks by spoofing the data.
"If you wanna know where the crime really took place, you have to find the anomaly in the GPS data."

This code repeats itself twice.

"The route here has been artificially extended, so the point where the code repeats is where the hack begins."
This is where the GPS was spoofed.

Where's the doctor in charge.
I'm Dr. Larson.
"You're in possession of illegally acquired tech, a cardiac regulator."
"Serial number, 928-H4W."
It was reactivated against our consent.
That's enough!
Stop this bullshit!

Come here.
Listen to me.
"Until you apologise, you don't set foot here!"
Understood?
"You don't understand, arsehole."
We found the garage thanks to Jésus.
"Now that we all agree the Mexican killed Karine and Célia, we need to find Niko, Tatiana's probable killer."
"We know he is a pimp, probably Albanian, with a scar on the cheek."
He has girls working near the Canal de I'Ourcq.
"Without Jésus, he will be difficult to identify, so keep your eyes open."
The Crime Squad should not have the info on Niko.
We're ahead of them.
We're pretty sure that Ronaldo taught Niko his MO to carve up Tatiana.
Niko could then tell Jésus how to mutilate her.
And Tatiana then becomes a victim of the Butcher of la Villette.
And Ronaldo gets freed.
- Niko and Ronaldo know each other?
Yes.
It's the only explanation.
But we're not 100% sure.
"Ronaldo had no visitors in jail, except his lawyer."
Now what's important is how to catch Ronaldo before he kills a new victim.
"He fooled the cops, the judge..."
He must feel invincible.
It's pretty certain he will do it again.
"Yes, but he's on the run."
And running isn't cheap.
"He needs money, documents."
He has no one else but Niko.
"Fortunately, not."
"You all remember General Zavros, my ex-associate."
You terminate all your partnerships like this?
On the contrary.

ARCHER:
Go ahead.
TRIP:
I think I figured out the problem.
Their power grid can't handle our converters.
It's going to take at least three days to make them compatible.
What about the reactor?
Any way to bring it online?
"It's possible, but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident."
ARCHER:
Stand by.
Work with Trip.
Help him get their reactor up and running.
Sir?
We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship.
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said oranyonelisteningto what he was being told.

All they got from Paulie was protection from the guys trying to rip them off.

That's what the FBI could never understand.

That's it.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.

You look like a gangster.
They shot me.

That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

You'll get nothing from me.

- Luke Skywalker mug.
"- OK, I'll call you back."
And a custard cream.

The college has suffered something of a minor tragedy.
"Three weeks ago, Dr Mary Goodyear, head of our biology department, died while on a marine expedition in the South Pacific."
"Yes, I read about it."
"Dr Goodyear's research was of the very first order, you understand."
"But when I came to examine her papers after her death, it soon became clear that sections of the research were missing."
Goodness!
"What, you mean stolen?"
"No, no, no, no, nothing like that."
"It's this bloody librarian, Janet Cramer."
Yeah?
Ah!
"Thank you, darling."
You're welcome.
Keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped around my little finger.

"Says the guy who taught me to fly his crop duster when I was 13, then told Mom I was lying when I mentioned it."
I was so jealous.
"My mom knew that you let him fly, and she wouldn't let me go anywhere near you."

Jake would come over and tell me all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
"He means the ""Nuts"" story, Grandpa."
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
"Tell me the story, somebody."
What?
It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
"The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines, and surrounded a division of Americans in a little town called Bastogne,"
"freezing and starving and running out of ammunition, but they knew that they had to hold that ground."
"Just before Christmas, the Nazis sent a note to the American commander telling him that he could surrender and save the rest of his men, or they could stay and fight."
"The American commander sent a one-word reply to the Wehrmacht commander,"
Carrasco's back.
- How many people died?
- Have something to drink.
Thank you.
"Welcome, Carrasco."
Enrique!
"They don't know, do they?"
"In Puerto and Timulcha, they called us criminals."
People here should know about that as well.
Padre Julio has kept the truth from them.
"They dropped leaflets from planes, but he said that it was nothing but bad propaganda, that Carrasco was supposed to surrender, that the Leopard was beaten."
Leave them alone for a while.
These men need to rest.
Go back to your work.
I'll go and get him immediately.
"- General, the president is on line 1."
- All right.
Thank you.
- This is General Benítez.
- We need to airlift fuel to the north.
- That's impossible.
- Why?
"During the blockade of Berlin, thousands of planes were employed."
"Of course, Señor Presidente, but we don't have any planes."
Don't argue with me.
Carry out my orders as soon as you can.
- Very well.
I'll do everything possible.
- You better had.
"Excuse me, these are the new defence plans for the refineries."
Thank you.
...plan 3 is to be carried out immediately.
Then one day...
Congratulations on your graduation.
It's beautiful.
"Thank you, Kojima-kun."
I even managed to get a kiss.
"Next is, at last, Valentine's day."
Lately we're not selling well.
"Dad, I'm going to be using the kitchen."
- That's the working place of a pro!
"If you're doing things for your hobby, go do it in the kitchen at home."
"Since we don't have any customers, it should be fine, right?"
"Ah, Souta-kun."
Are you making chocolate again?
Should I help?
"- Thanks, Kaoruko-san."
"But I'm making this for my girlfriend,"
I have to do it on my own.
"- Well, I guess."
An adult man making chocolate for a woman.
"After asking to go to a confectionary school, then making things that won't even be for sale, it's hard to bear as a parent."
Then we should put them up for sale.
- Eh?
Souta-kun's chocolates.
"The prototypes from the other day were high quality, with a delicate impression."
I think it's on a higher level than the chocolatiers around here.
Really?
Thanks.
That's thanks to my DNA.
DNA?
"DNA, he says."
Alright.
"But, well, there really aren't many guys who make chocolates for their girlfriends."
- Next week.
- That's what I thought.
- I thought you were on later.
- I heard what happened.
- I thought we might need help.
"- Actually, we only got the one."
Three went straight to the morgue.
- Sorry I didn't come by last night.
- It's okay.
Maggie and I played Scrabble.
I got a 75-point word.
- Really?
"- ""Cyanotic."" She challenged it."
...found brutally murdered early this morning inside of this establishment.
Doc Magoo's a diner frequented by staff and visitors of County General Hospital.
The crime was committed prior to opening as the staff was preparing for a day of serving the usual sandwiches and sodas.
What got served instead was a cold-blooded robbery-homicide in which four people were murdered execution-style.
- One of them's still alive.
- Police are trying to identify suspects.
- More on the story later.
- Any word on Eric?
I don't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
He won't come out till spring.
"Hey, what do you say we go out tonight?"
Sushi.
Just you and me.
- Maggie can fend for herself.
- Told her I'd drive her to the bus station.
- She's leaving?
- Yep.
- Is that a good thing?
"Well, what I meant was, well, you know how important this is to me."
"I think I told you, Mr. Norstaad, that I've been in South America for a good many years, and I've been out of the construction game."
This is my chance to get going again.
"And if you both like the plan, then maybe the Hospital Committee and the others--"
Of course they like it.
Of course you get job.
Just you watch how Edie pushes this through.
Nowhere in the world is another woman like--
"Please, Axel."
Oh.
Of course.
"It gets late, and we should take ourselves home."
"Oh, Miss Morrow, you might like to point out to the Committee that the design for the hospital conforms perfectly to the topography of the land."
"Oh, land."
"Yeah, Edie, you pay over deposit money already?"
"No, not yet."
"But Maigret, he says--"
Don't worry.
"I just thought it was better if Mr. Somers replaced his $50,000 personal check with a certified one, that's all."
"He said he'd have it for me tomorrow, and I'll see it goes directly into escrow."
Good.
"Fine, fine."
"Good night, Edie."
"Good night, Axel."
"Good night, Miss Morrow."
Much obliged for everything.
"I mean it, darling."
You've handled everything just perfectly.
"Good night, Mr. Reed."
[pounding on door]
"All right, all right."
Coming!
I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- That's not important.
"What is important, however, is that you tell no one."
That was the mistake that Jeremy's predecessor made.
I'II be in touch.
- Nice bunch?
- Mm.
(Man on radio) A suspected gas explosion wrought havoc in Little Stempington.
No one was hurt in The Wicker Barn but fire officers are counting occupants lucky.
"Got a space for you right here, Mrs HazIedine."
How do you know my name?
And isn't that a disabled parking space?
Don't you worry about them.
"Most of them are faking it, especially the ones in shopping scooters."
I make 'em park round the back.
Do that again and I'II piss in your petrol tank!
"Nobody hoots at Mrs HazIedine, you fucking fuck."
Now take your ration book and fuck off home!
It's quite all right.
I am holding up the traffic.
"Under control, Mrs HazIedine."
"When you've finished, give me a shout and I'II have someone load your car."
"Good morning, Mrs HazIedine."
"Peter Astbury, store manager."
"And this is douglas, your personal shopper for today."
"That'II be £8.50, please, Mrs HazIedine."
There must be some mistake.
"Oh, er, I'm sorry, er, that's er, 5... £4.20."
Just £4.
I'm very sorry.
There's about £70 worth of shopping here.
"Well, so much for not forcing our gunman's hand."
Just when I thought things couldn't get any more interesting.
You have no idea.
Tony's dad is on that London flight.
Come on.
Figure it out.
Who's the target on the plane?
Who's the hit man?
Let's talk possible hit people first.
We have a Joseph McBride.
"He's 49, from Springfield, Virginia."
He's a lobbyist for a chemical company.
Next.
"Ruth Potts, 62, Fairfax, retired schoolteacher, who wouldn't hurt a fly, obviously."
Just look at that sweet lady.
Next.
Thanks.
"Boss, I got 'em."
Manifests for 17 different inbound flights arriving to Dulles tonight.
"Okay, divvy 'em up."
Deal me in as well.
We are looking for a target significant enough to warrant killing a federal air marshal.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the extended delay,"
TSA is now required to perform a second routine screening.
"We apologize for any inconvenience, but we'll begin with Calgary flight 3184."
"If those passengers could calmly line up over there, please?"
Thank you.
"TSA isn't saying anything about landing order, Gibbs."
"They're all low on fuel, so... it's first come, first serve."
"Stay alert, Bishop."
We're watching.
Okay.
Angela´s mother and I went out last year. lt´s over.
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"She calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby and that I´m the father, and that she´s in trouble and she can´t handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
- But you told Chloe.
- Chloe and my sister have been helping me.
She´s a good friend.
Excuse me.
"Chase, you wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up."
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I´m just as confused as you are."
"But all I know is that I love you, and I´m falling in love with Angela, too, and I need to make this work."
Go on.
Hey.
- What´s happening with Nina?
- They´re getting something.
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deep.
You better hope she´s not spinning your wheels cos she can manipulate our protocol.
- Tony knows what he´s doing.
- Fine.
I need to get together with Chloe.
I need everything she´s got on Amador.
- Not yet.
"- Ryan, you´re wasting my time."
I humoured you with the physical.
"We both know there´ll be trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general´s office is here to talk to you.
- This is not the time.
"- Actually, it is."
"You´ll talk to her, then we´ll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.
"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-gu!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...
That cocksucker.
What kind of twisted freak is he?
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
Byeong-gyu.
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-gu turns up dead two days ago."
So?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, René."
Your persistence surprises even me.
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your Führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
"- Shut your mouth, Sergeant!"
"- Go find a medic, Jimmy."
"Bring morphine, I'll take the responsibility."
Him?
He's Italian!
"That's an American soldier there, Captain!"
"Now listen, Sergeant!"
That man is a Captain with more experience than either of us.
We're going to do what he says.
and follow his orders.
I'll take full responsibility!
"We have to distract him, to do something... so he doesn't realize he's dying."
There's only one thing we can do.
"Listen idiot, if you're wrong about this... if that doctor doesn't come..."
"I'll rip your guts out just like his, got that?"
Now hurry it up.
"Well now Prewitt, you're lucky."
You're going home...
Just wet his lips.
"You know, I always thought you were lucky..."
"Prewitt, but this was surprising."
The ambulance will be here in a few minutes.
A few days with pretty nurses bending over in front of you... and resting their tits on your shoulder... and then you're on a plane headed to the USA.
"Isn't that right, Kaminsky?"
"Keep talking, Sergeant."
Leave that idiot here.
He's stuck in this stinking country.
"-Não é, amigo?"
"-É, goma de mascar!"
- Guido!
- Yankee!
Fag.
- I don't think we should talk about classes.
"Like, if-if you're taking playwriting with Sam Shepard,"
"It may hurt my heart,"
"But if you take intro to mime, I need to know everything."
I want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret.
Playwriting competitions-
"I think we can go out for the same ones,"
But we can't read each other's submissions.
"And looking forward, I guess it's the same thing"
With internships and jobs.
So the only things we can talk about openly
"Are-are politics,"
"""jersey shore""..."
And where we want to eat...
"Which reminds me, I actually,"
"Um, I need to get ready."
I'm gonna be late for breakfast at my dad's.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
"No, I'm sorry."
"I, uh, I have something."
"Oh, oh, is it something related to our list?"
"Actually, yeah."
"Well, thank you for not sharing."
See?
I can't believe how much easier that is.
Ooh!
Another sext session with your new b.F.?
"Okay, I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend."
Between me spending all my time with my mom
"And him being in every club in school,"
We haven't even been on a first date.
Hey.
"Photographed in Aix-en-Provence, a man I really loved."
And a Corsica landcsape.
"Just like before, the sun through the tree."
"It's not the same tree as before, but it's the same man."
"The same garage in Montfort I'Amaury, close to Ravel's house."
I went on vacation there last year.
"That's done with a light pencil, and that's entirely imagined."
I like to do that...
Didn't you cover the negative?
"No, the negative ends here."
I actually printed this...
Then I prolonged the picture...
"With imaginary lines, on the top and the bottom."
"Then in the middle, all this black part."
All with the light pencil.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
And my two friends?
"No, I don't know them..."
I'm sure you've seen them here before.
"The real version of this picture, is this one."
"""Eric's new boots"""
It's a guy who'd follow me around surprinsingly...
Without any warning...
"Without me wanting him to, in New York."
I didn't like him very much...
He'd come to New York all dressed in white...
With clothes he'd bought for the occasion...
And boots very...
Which he was proud of...
Which must've cost a great deal of money...
He photographed everything in New York.
"Oh, yeah."
Lightning's ready
Ka-chow!
Get your antenna balls here!
"Go, Lightnin'!"
- Whoo!
"- You got that right, slick."
Uh!
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
"I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip."
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.
"Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof."
"If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!"
"Right, Darrell."
"Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season."
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.
"Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?"
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
"And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks."
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Chick thought this was his year.
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!
"You know, I don't think anybody expected this."
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.
But everyone knows him now.
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
"The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!"
"Three cars, one champion!"
No you don't.
"She's got you on the hop already, mate."
Sit down.
"Look, I..."
I know he's young.
(Bangs around in the kitchen)
"But there's something so special, beautiful."
"I-I tried to resist him, believe me."
I-I tried but...
What we have now is extremely honest and good.
You sure I can't tempt you with a burger?
"Uh, no."
"Come on, we've got marty sauce."
No?
I want to find a way to make this work.
I want to protect him emotionally and care for his academic future.
"Sorry, did you say protect him?"
Yes.
You're delusional.
You think I'm delusional?
"From what Finnegan tells me about you, it sounds like you..."
"Oh, listen Fiona, I know I'm a sinner, alright?"
"I know, because despite the enormity of what you're doing with my beautiful boy,"
I would fuck you in a heartbeat if he wasn't coming back in a minute.
Do you really want to turn him into me?
"The best thing you can do for Fuzz right now, believe me, is go downstairs, get in your car, and get driving and keep driving, preferably until you find some sort of elevated landform, and then keep driving a little bit more, OK?"
"Let's go, Fi."
"Fuck, Dad."
Fuzz.
Fuzz.
Mate...

"Lose the judge-face, Zoe."
He took a very heavy course load this semester.
"Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer."
I can work with that.
We hear Blair Waldorf's headed for a comeback.
But if she wants to keep her fans happy...
Send.
She better keep serving up the hits.
Sleep well?
"Don't even, Serena."
"I can't believe you posted on ""Gossip Girl"""
That I'm a drug dealer.
I didn't post anything.
Fine.
"Maybe you didn't send the actual e-mail,"
But everyone knows you have Blair do your dirty work.
I can't help what Blair does.
And you are the one who played Pablo Escobar
To underage preppy pill poppers.
My dad and I were finally in a good place
"After a really, really bad patch."
"And if he finds this out, it'll destroy everything."
"Well, maybe Rufus should know"
That his daughter is dealing drugs.
"After all, you thought my father should know"
All my adventures at boarding school.
Fine.
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything,"
But maybe you shouldn't be lying to your dad.
Are you really lecturing me about lying to a parent?
"My dad knows who I am,"
But you're building a relationship with yours
All you think of is that dress!
What does she need it for?
Just so she can appear in it?
So she looks pretty.
What's wrong with that?
"Pretty, and for whom?"
She definitely wants to impress someone!
They want to impress each other.
Do you think we only dress up to attract some boy...
During that dance I felt she's longing to dance like that with a boy in a pretty dress.
So what?
She's eighteen.
"is she ready for it psychologically, or only biologically?"
Why do you ask me what I think about it?
"Of course, I'm interested, aren't I?"
Why do you analyse it like that?
Buy her material for that dress!
What do you keep worrying about?
You keep changing the subject.
"When you're meant to buy a dress, you begin philosophising."
"- Excuse me, where does the architect live?"
"- Sorry, who?"
I'm looking for the architect.
- Which one?
There are several here.
- Mr Ravinger.
There are as many Ravingers here as there are Anabaptists
"We're five families living here, you know."
"They have a boy in the ninth form, Marcel."
Then that's mine.
What a coincidence.
Do you know something about Marcel?
"Tom, what do I do now?"
Frankie.
You were always interested in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33.
"Yeah, I still read a lot."
I get good stuff in there.
"You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with ""regimes,"" ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."
-And it worked.
"-Yeah, it worked."
"Those were the great old days, you know."
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
"Yeah, it was once."
Frankie.
When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors.
"Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened."
And their families were taken care of.
"That was a good break, a nice deal."
Yeah.
They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party before they did it.
"Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels."
"Thanks, Tom."
Thanks.
"-See you, Tom."
"-Addio, Frankie."
Kay.
You have to go.
That they took what looks like the most boring words in the English language and made them into a sentence?
"Well, I've always been fascinated by this stuff."
It's just the beast took up most of my brain.
Now you're free to really get your nerd on?
Exactly.
I wasted all that time on the beast when I could have been charting the development of metallurgy during the 19th century.
Is Shannon Kelly here?
Kyle Weathers.
I've come a long way to find you.
Thanks.
This is Tom.
Tom.
Good to meet you.
Hi.
"We're short on daylight, so I'll come straight to the point."
The beast is in my sights and you're the girl to help me find it.
- Excuse me?
- I've been monitoring your blog for the last six months.
Your findings are pretty compelling.
Why didn't you leave any comments?
Open up myself to replies from fools with no brains and even less imagination?
I know exactly what you mean.
Right.
I'm searching the woods tonight and I need an expert.
- What do you say?
- She's into metalgy...
"Metal...metallurgy now, you see."
Old news.
Tell me more.
Don't worry.
No-one can get in.
And we're not getting out.
I'll take care of the old woman.
Mom!
Dad!
Time's up.
Mommy!
Isn't it amazing?
"Not only one, but three foxes were found in Seoul's Nam Mountain."
"According to witnesses, these foxes walked around Nam Mountain as if it were their home."
"The Animal Protection Association said those foxes are known to be extinct, and asked special protection and affection from citizens."
The foxes will add another attraction to Nam Mountain's scenery.
I hope they live happily in these parts.
This is Kang Yoo-mi from Nam Mountain.
"Honey, what are you doing?"
Hurry or we'll be late!
Okay!
"I told you not to do somersaults, didn't I?"
Carry your bag first and go.
Isn't it great to run on two legs?
"Oh, look at your pretty cheeks!"
"Honey, hurry up."
Tell your father not to go around.
He went out again.
It's because he feels stuffy at home.
And tell your brother not to piss everywhere.
"Don't worry, I'll clean up."
"Yeah, like you ever did."
"From today on, don't do somersaults or eat anything like you just did at school."
Why not?
Because you're different from others.
You're a 0.5 breed.
What's that?
"Well, something happened between me and daddy long time ago."
"- Me, too!"
- Princess!
Your words alone are enough.
Princess...
"All of you, please live on."
And try to give the people of Estabul at least a little bit of happiness.
"For that, I would..."
You've created a problem for me.
All of your cares for your kingdom are quite moving.
"However, in my view, Lady Noa Ehn's life alone isn't enough to atone for all of your crimes."
"Yes, is a tragedy not the most fitting adornment for the tragedy of the kingdom of Estabul perishing?"
Who are you?
"I am Miran Froaude, Colonel of the Imperial Roland Army."
How did you get here?
Did you kill every soldier outside?
Certainly not.
This castle wouldn't fall so easily.
"Of course, even if it did fall, Roland soldiers still couldn't come inside."
After all this place will now play a part in the finale of the tragedy.
Let there be darkness!
- Protect the princess!
- Got it!
But we can't leave everyone...
Get inside!
Everyone's dead.
The kingdom...
The people...
Everything's been lost.
"No, there's still something left."
What do we have left?
Your life.
The cornered Estabul soldiers riot.
"Yes, it would be a pleasure, mademoiselle."
You are in danger?
"It's against all my instincts, but the man persists."
"And with the hotel being so empty, there's a great danger of my getting stuck for the rest of the holiday."
[ Chuckles ]
"Ah, the galloping Major Barnes."
"Here for the fishing, he tells me."
Ah.
The behavior of the English abroad is something I have always found peculiar.
[ Both chuckle ]
"At least he's not a bottom-pincher, Mr. Poirot."
[ Conversing in Italian ]

"Look at them -- troublemakers, always looking for a fight."
Perhaps.
"But for me, the English is more cold-blooded."
His violence is more calculated.
"We've spent all day at sea, and my wife's exhausted, so let's get to the hotel as fast as possible, with our luggage intact."
Make sure it's secure and stay close behind the other car.
"Excuse me, but aren't these the cars from the Palace Hotel?"
Yes.
Well?
"Well, we're staying there, too, you know."
"Well, you'll have to wait for them to come back."
"The hotel, please, driver."
And try not to hit anything.
"Come on, darling."
Thank you.
LYALL:
"Good heavens,"
I do believe that's Valentine Chantry.
POIROT:
I think on some level he knew what he was doing when he charged those men.
You think he wanted to die?
I think he was suffering.
I think he wanted to be with his wife.
"You know, there's this Buddhist concept called Kalyana-mittata, or spiritual companionship."
And they say that it transcends death or rebirth.
"Well, maybe he got what he wanted."
Clara:
Maybe he did.
"You know, technically, this doesn't disprove the evidence of the yeti."
There could still be undiscovered species out there.
"- Hey, Monty."
"- Yes, sir."
Enough with the yeti.
- Let's go home.
"- Yes, please."

Subtitle transcribed by Uncle Andy
I shall ride ahead and announce His Majesty's arrival.
"No, I shall announce my own arrival."
A little surprise will do them a world of good.
May I ask what this is about?
"Her Majesty did not confide in me, Madame."
You mean you know but you won't tell me.
The Marquise de Montespan.
"Her Majesty has summoned me here for a reason, I imagine."
"Yes, it relates to your debts."
And I was not aware that I had any.
Laura's fingerprints were all over the section on sexual harassment.
She was thinking of suing him?
"Well, he might have tried to trade a promotion for sexual favors."
"She balked, and he withdrew the promotion."
"""Fearsome Phil""."
The guy's already got a reputation.
Lawsuit might have cost him big time.
So he killed her.
Guy's seen too many operas.
Every union in building's got grievances against Fearsome Phil.
He's a rage-a-holic.
Thinks he's the only artist in the building.
Can't imagine working with someone like that.
"Long as he keeps filling the seats, management won't touch him."
But an harassment complaint...
- Who we talking about?
- Laura Booth.
Laura?
You're kidding me.
"Yeah, he promised to make her first violin."
You're her union rep.
We thought she might have talked to you. / No.
Laura was pretty single-minded about getting where she wanted to go.
But I was sure she was off-limits to Reinhardt.
- Because of her age?
- No.
Reinhardt's had an on-and-off thing with Laura's mother.
With Gillian Booth?
Really?
"If she knew he was harassing her daughter, could she hurt him?"
"Well, singers talk to other singers."
She could make it very hard for him to get hired somewhere else.
"Look, you guys need a division title and my man will deliver like Amazon, all right?"
"He's got breakaway speed, durability out the ass."
He will finally put your offense over the top.
I think you might be right.
- Can I see him work out?
- Absolutely.
"I'm gonna coordinate that with you, Charles."
"- Thank you, Larry."
- Larry:
Don't mention it.
"Sorry, babe, we gotta stick a pin in brunch."
Fuck me and not feed me?
Fuck you.
We'll eat quick.
"Come on, I want stone crabs."
I don't get it.
Jason just said the same thing I did.
"He said it better, Charles."
Be grateful.
"You may not have got it the way you wanted it, but you got it nonetheless."
Now go coordinate.
- ( horse neighs )
"- I spent 250,000 on American Pharoah's supersonic splooge."
"You better deliver me the next Secretariat or you'll be shoveling the most colossal mountain of horse shit you've ever seen, okay?"

- Giddy up.
"Hey, I'm seeing you at the stable in 30, right?"
"Yeah, listen, Wayne, I just have to push that back by a few, okay?"
"Hey, Reggie, put Vernon on the phone, please?"
- Wayne:
How few is a few?
- Just a few hours.
"You know, his eyes."
"I swear, I'll never forget his eyes as long as I live."
He wasn't breathing.
I saw him die.
There was blood...
"Oh, God."
"Okay, sir, calm down."
Tell me where he was;
I need an address.
In an alley off of 57th.
You-you got to send someone out there.
"We will, but I need you to stay on the line with me, okay?"
Police say the call came in at 5:47 this morning.
- Tracks with Michael's account.
- Sounded genuinely upset.
Connection to the victim?
None that I can find.
I searched e-mail accounts and phone records for both Michael Thomas and Petty Officer Adams.
No communication between them.
Michael's boss said that Adams was never a customer at the shop.
Background.
"Petty Officer Caleb Adams joined the Navy right out of high school, had two overseas deployments and a spotless record."
C.O. called him a bright and hardworking man.
Assigned to the Hagen destroyer in 2010.
Adams was one of 215 sailors off the ship last night for liberty.
"Tracking down others who may have been with him, but we do have this."
He called someone named Meredith Bilson five times in five hours.
The last call came in at 4:34 a.m..
That's an hour before his death.
Location?
Apartment manager at her last known address says she hasn't lived there in three months.
Keep looking.
"- No questions, Your Honor."
"You may step down, Miss Adams."
[Burger] I call Mr. Cyrus Potkin to the stand.
Oh.
I-
- I'm sorry.
"[Bailiff] Just one moment, please."
Will you raise your right hand?
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
And what was all that about?
Perry wanted me to see if what the girl was wearing was really mink.
- It is.
"- Typist in accounting, huh?"
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll check her out too.
- Right.
"- Goodbye, beautiful."
"Oh, miss, tell Mr. Mason if there's anything my wife needs-  you understand."
"- No, I'm afraid I don't."
"Well, there must be a bill at least."
Tell him whatever is necessary to help-- anything--
I'll be glad to manage somehow.
- All--
- I have a little money saved.
"All right, Mr. Potkin, you've positively identified the Sandover car."
You say it came from the cottage and went past you as you were working on your truck in the dark.
"Nearly ran me down, you mean."
Of course I was parked on the only road out.
Yeah.
You heard the written confession of the defendant's husband introduced earlier by the prosecution in order to clarify their case.
You heard Mr. Sandover's statement that he drove that same car
- out to that same cottage.
"- No, I canceled."
"- So, what do you want to do for dinner?"
- What?
Why don't you make that pasta with the artichokes?
"Then maybe later, we can figure out what to do with your hair for Claire's wedding."
What is this?
Look at this.
I wish I could escape.
"The mating ritual is both speedy and violent for these passionate insects, with the lesser male often covering the larger female."
"If unsuccessful in mounting, the male is often eaten by the female during copulation."

"Brianna, Tina, Marla and me, Felicia."
"Anything you want to talk about, call me."
Call me.
Call me.
I don't really know where to begin.
"Are you lonely tonight, darling?"
Yeah.
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.
"Felicia, can I ask you a question?"
Want to know what I'm wearing?
Just wearing a towel.
I was drying myself off after a hot shower when you called...
- Why do women leave?
- What?
Why do women leave?
Especially beautiful women.
I can't go through this anymore.
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.
Why should that be?
"Thank you for calling, sir."
"Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away."
"Glory be, commissioner."
What's wrong?
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank has just been robbed.
- By Batman and Robin.
-Saints preserve us.
"Yes, indeed, saints preserve us if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked."
Which apparently they have.
Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed that this happened.
"Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units for the arrest of Batman."
"Hopefully alive, but we'll take him the other way if we have to."
Attention all units.
Be on alert for Batman.
First name unknown.
Caucasian.
"Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks, purple cape, purple cowl and a black bat insignia on his chest."
He has a masked accomplice whose alias is Robin.
Approach with caution.
They may be armed.
"I hate to do it, Caped Crusader, but I have to take you in."
You're on the wanted list.
"My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader."
Don't make me use it.
"Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper?"
Go on and shoot.
I dare you.
"What's happened to you, Boy Wonder?"
Even your voice has turned snarly.
"None of your business, Flatfoot."
"Now, go ahead and shoot, because you'll never take us alive."
"Batman, I'm giving you three to get out of the car with your hands up."
That the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately?
It's a start.
"Before the war, I served under a general."
We traveled a great deal.
We were in budapest when I met anna.
She worked in a hotel tailor shop...
Sold me the most beautiful tie.
"And then the war broke out, and things became..."
Difficult.
She was jewish.
"Still is, I'm happy to say."
"The general carried several letters of transit in his safe,"
"Any one of which would have ensured her safety,"
But he refused to sign.
You forged his name.
Hence the dishonorable discharge.
It was filing the papers that sunk me.
I was arrested in the middle of whitehall.
Hmm.
On a Tuesday.
How did anna get out?
The same way I avoided the noose.
Howard?
"Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general,"
And he and I had always got along.
"When he heard of my predicament, he..."
Used his influence.
Sounds like a story.
"Another time, perhaps."
"Anna obviously knows what howard did for you,"
But she doesn't know what you do for him?
"Not recently, no."
You can ask him yourself
But he is blind!
What?
Blind?
He told your fortune in darkness?
I think you should get into your room first
I'll get money from Master to get you medicine
"Hey, Gao!"
What?
Jin Tianyun is dead?
"Y es, I heard he was killed by the Three Devils"
These Three Devils are pure evils
Ever since they killed him their morale is boosted
Don't know why they have stayed here the past few months?
"What's more, a few days ago they have beaten up"
Master Qin's apprentices for no reason at all!
Nonsense!
If they keep on causing trouble
I'll teach them a good lesson!
That's why we are here
We hope you could ensure that justice is done
Y es!
The three of them are very skillful
"Master, what should we do?"
Should we hire some more men to help?
In order to eradicate these kind of dregs
Maybe it's good to have some more men
Do you know where the three of them... used to stay?
"We're not sure about that, but we've heard..."
Zhou Sanzhao spent all the money he'd robbed at Yihong Brothel.
He went there every night
The money was spent fast as flowing water!
Educational.
I left to escape my foes here and to confront another foe on the field of battle.
But I realized that my only true enemy had accompanied me all the way.
Who was that?
"Welcome home, brother."
You've changed.
Though I cannot yet see how.
You soon will.
How is your wife?
"Oh, you know her."
Bouncing through life.
"Well, that was fun!"
"Can't possibly see the King now, unless he likes being vomited upon."
You must see a doctor.
Tell His Highness to come immediately.
That's really not necessary.
I'm certain it was the pastries I had last night.
"Your Highness, you must see a doctor, given all that's happened of late."
"Oh, I see."
"Yes, perhaps, you should call for a doctor."
An invitation from the King.
An invitation from the King.
You must send a message to my dressmaker and the Monseur Cornereau in Paris.
Tell them they must come to the palace immediately.
Monsieur Cornereau?
"He makes fireworks, you idiot!"
"Queen of Versailles, that's what he called me, and I'm going to show him how Queens welcome home their Kings."
"This is most heartening news, Sire!"
I was deaf to your advice.
I shall not be again.
Even the Lord Jesus was lost in the widerness.
"In three weeks, we shalll celebrate Easter, Sire."
- Just the AV guys again.
"DC Sonic, they're replacing the surround system in the theatre."
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...
She's coming back tonight?
"Carol, is she coming back tonight?"
"Yes, sir."
Wheels down at 1845.
"Yes, of course."
"As many of you are well-aware, this is my last week here so I wanna make this clear to everybody:"
If there are any congratulatory cakes or any of that nonsense I will be compelled to use deadly force.
I hate you.
I hate you all.
Thank you.
No incendiaries in the White House.
"All right, baby, I just gotta get my weapon real quick."
"You're gonna have to sign out, sir."
Hello.
You guys here for the tour?
Do you think we can see where you'll be working?
"- Yeah, sure."
- Great.
"Gather around, everyone, gather around."
My name is Donnie and I'll be your guide today as we take a walk through American history.
"I wanna give you all a warm Washington, D.C. welcome to the White House where each year we get millions of guests from every corner of the globe."
Where are you folks from?
"Washington, D.C."
- Bad choice.
"What about you, ma'am?"
- Nebraska.
What brings you to the White House?
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
Just start looking.
Will you guys listen to yourselves?
All right.
"Come on out, Mr."
"I know you're fucking in here in the walls or something, laughing your ass off!"
The jig's up!
"Come on out, asshole!"
WOMAN:
I don't think he's going to answer.
Why?
"""November 27."
Results today:
Positive function.
The machine continues to work perfectly.
"However, I've seen something in the future that is disturbing to my core."
I believe I've seen my death.
I know the cardinal rule of time and causality... is that one should not attempt to change the future.
"But under these circumstances, it seems to be a risk worth taking."
"If I believed in God,"
"I would pray today that no greater harm will come from what I'm about to do."""
Then what?
Nothing.
"That's the last entry, a week ago today."
A week ago.
Seven photos.
That means it was kicking it out after he disappeared.
So it must be on a timer.
8200 PM.
Then why are there so many daytime ones?
Maybe it's only been taking ones at night for the last week.
All right.
Even I have to admit this photo is a little fucking unsettling.
"Not for sale, not even for display."
This guy operates in a vacuum.
Which speaks to the intensely private nature of his obsession.
Mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand.
Also from upstate New York?
"No, it's local."
Most likely from the Platte River.
"What's the matter, Sergeant?"
It's what they found next to him in the sand.
Human bone and tooth enamel.
"Please, don't hurt me."
Please.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
"Uh, I was trying to call Hotch, but it kept going to voicemail."
He's still at the hospital with JJ.
What's going on?
"Ok, I did what man chocolate asked."
I got this list.
"There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list."
Does anything specific jump out at you?
"Aside from the horribleness of it all, no."
"You know, send me all the police, hospital, and child services transcripts associated with the cases."
Everything on all of them?
"Yeah, I'll print out hard copies here."
Ok.
"You're gonna need a forklift, and I hope you're using recyclable paper, but..."
On its way.
All right.
"Thank you so much, Garcia."
Why are you doing this?
I never did anything to you.
A map of what?
"Of Lake Singali, sir."
"Yes, sir."
And the privilege of diving into it to our heart's content.
Diving for what?
"- For emeralds, sir."
"- A barge full, sir."
"According to the information I bought, it was sunk in the year 241."
I can hardly believe it.
"Ballantine, a man of your intelligence..."
"MacChesney, at your age..."
"They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir."
"Thank you, Cutter."
That will be sufficient.
As for you two...
"I ought to take away your stripes, not only for insubordination... but for idiocy."
"Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy."
"But fortunately for you, I need all three of you at Tantrapur."
"We're going out on a job, sir?"
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn!
"Left wheel, quick march!"
Left wheel!
Attention!
Eyes forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sergeants, dismount!"
Cold.
Stale.
I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.
"Creeps or no creeps, we've got to get in touch with the Colonel."
"On a real diamond,it evaporates immediately."
"It's,uh,staying."
Because it's a fake.
"Give it one more try,just to make sure."
I'm not blowing on you again.
Question three.
"""Why buy a shovel?"""
-Oops.
-No.Sorry.
"""Why bury a shovel?"""
I have no answer to that.
"But here,how about this one?"
who is darkman?
that is thquestion.
Liam neeson in the 1990 cult classic directed by sam raimi about a mentally unstable scientist who seeks revenge.
"You left out ""who shot rebecca?"""
That was my next question.
Siri claims she was out walking at the time of the shooting.no witnesses.
Gsr tests came back negative.
"Even if siri shot rebecca, I don't think she killed finn."
I saw her face when she saw his body.
"If siri's innocent,she'd assume that rebca's guilty and she'd seek revenge."
Shting someone in broad daylight is just dumb.
"You're not thinking like a jealous woman, ziva."
They're keeping rebecca in the hospital overnight.
"She lost a lot of blood,but the wound was through and through."
Anything on the shooter?
Said she didn't get a good look at her.
How'd she know it was a her?
Rebeccsaid she heard a female voice at the door.
"When she opened it,bang."
Siri?
You remember the question 4?
"No, of course not."
Addons to the fourth question is:
"""With how many men you sleep"""
That's not your job.
Addons That's not my job?
Then you add the Addons test results in your public profile?
"Are you happy and Addons to believe that you Kinky,"
Addons but fear to tell the truth.
Addons
- With how many people are sleeping?
"- I say, it's none of your business."
I bet there are 10 in the record.
"Addons Well, Gwen."
Addons Let me help you to explain this.
Addons you have access to a lot of forums ...
"Addons But, you are active, from 5 to 15 times a week."
Virtual reality.
Addons Your avatar shows a white rose ...
"Addons And your screen name is ""Terry Bomb""."
Addons So Terry bomb ...
Addons How many people have you slept with?
- Nine
Not have to end like this
Addons you hide behind a user name behind the avatar
"Addons But wherever you go Apapunyang you download, upload, is Online locked and stored"
Addons A trail of information available for those who want it.
"Addons downloads fact, every website visited You've visited in the last 1 month"
Addons And we made some discoveries.

Love is getting kindled...
Sight is going beyond the eyes.
"(Are you) The flower of inner sun, or my penance?"
Is this love or enemity?
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?
He isn't picking my calls.
He can't run away from us.
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow
Things may turn ugly.
"- Who's that, Deepa?"
Someone I know.
"Any problem, Deepa?"
No.
Nothing.
"Are you the woman past desires, The one ruling all my desires?"
Are you the one to rope the moon in your forehead?
"You became the enchanted forest in one single flower, my lady"
Are you the one to pour nectar on that day?
The thought of you approaches me and burns my soul.
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.
You are my companion.
I like Varun a lot.
"- No, no."
- There are consequences for disobedience!
- Tonight's the night.
"Together, my Mary we shall put on the performance of a lifetime."
Let the trial begin.
"Mary Bradbury, you stand accused of crimes most heinous."
"Witchcraft, devilry, sins against the Lord."
"Admit what you have done and repent, or you will be sentenced to murder by hanging."
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't hurt anyone.
- Yours is not the only soul on trial this day.
"You must also decide the fate of Susanna Sheldon, the young lady you brought down with your unholy ways."
- Mary... please save me.
- I didn't make her do anything.
- You lie.
"Susanna, tell the judges the truth."
- Mary Bradbury kidnapped me and forced me to commit sins against the Lord.
But...
"- What is it, Susanna?"
- Truthfully I enjoyed it.
- Do you see what your lies have wrought?
They've turned the purity of an innocent girl into the devil's plaything.
- I didn't.
I...
- You lie!
Confess!
"- No, you are a liar, Dr. Cairn."
You lied to me.
You took my faith away from me.
You are a monster.
"- As chief magistrate, I demand you go back to your position."
You're still under trial.
(Horn Honks)
"Well, I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that Arab."
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.
They were talking like they were dear friends.
"Well, he probably knew him before."
What does that mean?
It means that Mr Bernard is a very mysterious man.
What?
He seemed perfectly normal to me.
"Now, what do you really know about him?"
What do I - l know his name.
"We were sitting there, we were talking."
"You don't know anything about this man, and he knows everything about you."
"0h, wait."
"He knows that you live in Indianapolis, Indiana."
He knows you're a doctor at the Good Samaritan Hospital.
"He knows that you attended a medical convention in Paris, and that you stopped off in Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca."
Alright.
He knows that you served in North Africa in an army field hospital.
"Honey, it was just a casual conversation, that's all."
"Darling, you weren't just talking casually."
"He was asking all kinds of questions, and you were answering them."
You might as well have handed him your passport.
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.
"I know this is mysterious Morocco, but we're not gonna lose our head, are we?"
- l know. I know what it is.
- What?
You're sore because this fella didn't ask you any questions.
"- 0h, hardy-har-har."
"Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade."
"So, wait."
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
"I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint."
Wow!
I can...
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...
"Oh, you think you are so s..."
"You can't decide how to storm off, can you?"
(exhales sharply) I am... (somber music plays)
(crying) Luke's first haircut.
He gave me bangs.
"- Well, that's it."
- (music shuts off)
Hopefully you're all cried out.
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow to catch the tooth fairy?
(sobs)
"Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation."
"Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face and wrap it up."
"Do you guys remember that ""Luke Loves Daddy"" rap?"
(rapping) ♪ My name is Luke Dunphy ♪
♪ And I'm here to say ♪
♪ I love Daddy ♪
(sobs)
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.
"Dad, please, you really got to stop."
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!
(sobbing loudly)
Ohh!
(sobbing continues)
"Mama, now my tooth hurts."
- We need more police.
- When you going to send us some help?
"Glad you're here, Mr. Mayor."
The father's seated in the corner.
"I'm all yours, Leslie."
Questions and answers.
Who's up?
- The Post.
- Marx or Sadler?
Sadler.
Then I know what's coming.
"""Has probation become a sentence in this town?"""
Judge Stern has a powerful record.
He served six years and meted out the stiffest punishments in the city.
"If the report recommends probation, then probation it has to be."
"After that, they'll start in on the mandatory crap."
Good morning.
I want to welcome the Revs.
Williams and Birch...
- You got the probation report?
- In the office.
I'll be there in a minute.
"- And my dear friend, Reverend Milton Parks of the First Church of Harlem Reverend Chapman and Reverend Murray."
Thank you for coming here today.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
"Well, what can I say?"
How do I start this?
"There is one thing, as Mayor that I will never get over and that is the death of a police officer."
There is one thing in life that I will never get over and that is the death of an innocent child.
But this is an incident that won't go away...
Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"The whole city  all parts of the city  Bushwick, Jamaica, Washington Heights  Brownsville, Harlem..."
I didn't murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
One memeber of the police department agrees with him.
Thomas Hardy made this statement to the press.
I do not think Kesser is the killer.
Important information was withheld.
Can you tell us what that information is?
Two of the women were called from police call boxes.
Why didn't you say that?
.
A Pittsburgh cop did it!
An offical police report denied Hardy's accusations.
The controversy has not changed Kesser's death sentence.
Airtight case.
Kesser had no alibi at all.
He confessed to the murder of his accomplice as self-defense.
He denied the Polish Hill murders.
"We found evidence from the murders in his hotel room,   and the gun that killed Vince Hardy."
Then why does Hardy think that Kesser was framed?
Kesser's fingerprints weren't on the gun.
It was a police special.
The serial numbers were erased.
Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
- He thinks the killer's a cop.
- No one thought he was innnocent?
"Yeah, Kesser."
"Well, Bob, he's putting them in the Allegheny or the Monongahela."
That narrows it down.
This is Hardy here.
Go.
"Hi, it's Jo."
Are you going to the policeman's ball tonight?
- Where´s Richards?
- He´s waiting.
Let´s bring him in.
(Michelle) Send Darren in.
"Nina, I don´t think you´ve met Darren Richards."
He joined us after you left.
"Hello, Darren."
Don´t take it personally.
He doesn´t talk much.
"(Rae) Something´s not connecting up for me, Jack."
"You weren´t in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December."
That´s six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one.
Am I missing something?
I was trying to pass as ajunkie.
I wanted to be prepared.
"- What do you mean, prepared?"
- The Salazars lived in the drug world.
"If I couldn´t handle the narcotics, they´d have known I was a cop and killed me."
- l needed to be able to handle it.
- That makes sense.
"But in January, when you were injecting, you didn´t have a meeting on the books."
- lt could have been a year for all you knew.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to establish evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover.
"If I submit this, it´s not gonna hold up."
What do you want me to say?
!
I did drugs to get in with these people and I got in with them!
"No matter how difficult it´s been, I don´t use any more."
"Look, I´ll write it up that way and maybe it´ll fly, but I think you´ll have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner."
That´s suspicious.
"Rae, you know my history."
But this money has been accruing interest?
How much money?
TONY:
$327 million and change.
"Boss, I'm seeing multiple attempts to hack into this account over the last week."
It's got to be Amanda Baylor.
Baylor was hired to steal the AUTEC file and this money?
Blackmail was a diversion.
It explains why they never really said anything that hurt us.
"We're watching the AUTEC files, they have a better shot getting in and out of the bank account undetected."
It's all about the Benjamins.
"Well, it looks like Baylor's taking another stab at the account right now."
"She's accessing remotely, and she didn't bother burying her IP so deep this time."
She did not expect us to look for her there.
"Right, I got her."
Getting a Wi-Fi ping.
"Ziva, DiNozzo, go..."
She's just off the I-95.
I'm texting you the coordinates.
Are you sure this is the place?
"Well, what happened?"
"You don't trust the, uh, authority of McMaps?"
(truck horn blows nearby)
(whispering):
All right.
It's like Silence of the Lambs meets Scooby-Doo.
Freeze!
Hands up!
Do I look like I'm running?
"Amanda Baylor, you have the right... (sniffs) to take a bath."
You smell like a wild goat.
I've been busy.
I already know?
"Look, Mr. Sandover, I really didn't pay any attention to it after I saw your initials on it and your forwarding slip when you sent it on to the bank."
Let me try to remember.
There may have been some other smaller--
Mr. Sandover?
Get the bags.
"Beth, it's me."
Don't get all excited now.
"I just missed my train, that's all."
But I have something to attend to this evening.
I'm taking the car.
Missed the train?
"But that was hours ago, Sandy."
"For heaven's sake, what happened?"
"I'll explain later, dear."
I'll fly down to Phoenix in the morning instead.
- But Sandy--
"- Look, there's nothing to be alarmed about."
I thought you were going out to dinner with Dorothea this evening.
"Well, yes, but later, so I really wanted to use the car myself, but..."
Oh.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"- Sandy, this is Perry Mason."
- Oh.
"I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Sandover."
Your wife and I are very old friends.
"Yes, of course."
She's always talking about people she used to know when Mr. Devro was alive.
"Sandy, Perry was nice enough to come by on his way home from work to give me some professional advice."
"Oh, all right, Beth, if you're thinking of a divorce, that's no reason to call in such an expensive lawyer."
- Sandy!
- I never handle divorces.
Is the article ready?
I want to take off for 10 days.
Leave for 10 days?
You people are hopeless!
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!
I'm hungry.
Please help me.
Sorry.
Don't run!
Catch him!
Stop there.
"Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari- Nagercoil highway... a man was found dead after being hit by an unidentified vehicle."
His age is presumed to be about 50.
As we had asked Inspector Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...
A man who was walking on the highway was hit by a vehicle and died on the spot.
The man had no identity card or phone on him.
So we were unable to get his details.
Investigation is going on now.
Those who know any detail about him can approach the Kanyakumari police station.
I'm going to Kanyakumari for an urgent work.
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.
Stop!
Why are you going?
A man was found dead in the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.
"Either we run away from the city,"
Or the whole family...
Why are you so worried after coming to Kanyakumari?
Any problem?
You said wanted to visit police station as well?
Nothing.
Fascinating.
Good.
Good.
"He knows, doctor."
He has reasoned it out.
Yes.
- Yes.
"- What is it, Spock?"
"An invention, doctor."
"First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal."
What's he doing?
"Diamonds, the hardest known substance."
"Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles."
What force?
"Recall your basic chemistry, doctor."
- Gunpowder.
"- Captain, let us be reasonable."
You have lost.
Admit it to yourself.
Stop running.
Coal.
Can he do it?
"If he has the time, doctor."
If he has the time.
No.
"No, I won't kill you."
Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.
"No, I won't kill him!"
Do you hear?
You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else.
You're a Metron?
"Does my appearance surprise you, captain?"
It's heavily reinforced.
It's pressurising.
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
After you.
REED:
"A little stale, but breathable."
Bio-signs... very faint.
REED:
Coming from in here.
[Solemn instrumental music]
Some kind of shuttlecraft?
ARCHER:
More like an assault vehicle.
"I'm reading a half-dozen particle-cannons, torpedo launchers."
[Radio beeps]
Archer.
"TRIP: [On radio] You'd better get over here, sir."
T'POL:
The DNA is identical to the bodies we found.
They would appear to be the crew's offspring.
A hatchery?
They built this place to take quite a beating.
"Reinforced bulkheads, backup power systems."
Thirty-one eggs are still viable.
They won't survive for long.
Their bio-support is losing power.
Do you think you can repair it?
I wouldn't even know where to start.
"There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay, get it back to the ship."
I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
"Aye, sir."
ARCHER:
This Thanksgiving is gonna be the worst!
You don't know that.
"The years my dad comes are great, and my mom years are disasters."
You should really try to appreciate the time you have with your mom.
Spoken like a man who drove his mother all the way to Oregon and enjoyed it.
"Well, our book club had just ended, and the last three books were set in the Pacific Northwest."
It just made sense.
I just want a peaceful Thanksgiving.
I have nothing to be thankful for!
Your three beautiful children are right here.
"Called to school by Dr. Ellie... great Special Ed teacher, terrible necklace-chooser."
Anna-Kat's behavior has been a little heightened lately.
She organized the stuffed animals by fur color.
Looks a little race-war-y.
Is anything going on at home?
Any changes?
"Well, her favorite toy pony, Frenchie..."
"Oh, I know about Frenchie's leg."
Mm.
Anything else out of the ordinary?
"Uh, the holidays can be stressful for parents, and sensitive kids can pick up on that."
My mother.
She's coming for Thanksgiving.
Ahh.
I-Is that complicated for you?
No.
It's pretty simple.
She's the worst.
My mom's the biggest narcissist on the planet.
She was a Pan Am stewardess back in the day when it meant something.
But was she there for me growing up?
No.
- Gordi.
- And Toe.
"Guys, time to put on a foil."
"Play some old-time hockey, like Eddie Shore."
- Dit Clapper.
- And Toe Blake.
- And Gordie Howe.
- Gordie.
"- You all right, goalkeep?"
"- Riley, you okay?"
"Hell, no."
"Look here, you okay?"
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Great!
Good!
Get him again!
This is how you get the jersey over your opponent's head.
"Today, if they have the balls to show up, the Newman boys face the much-hated Scranton Night Hawks."
"Two-time runners up for the Hounds, the Hawks are reloaded and they are as tough as they got."
"Holy smoke, the Newman team takes to the ice in a manner that can only be termed tremendously tacky."
They have donned the sacred shrouds of the Chiefs.
This is a sacrilege.
"Yeah, tacky like that time when you got sloshed on communion wine."
"Well, yes, exactly like that."
"0-1, same old butt-whopping."
It is clear these Newman boys are decidedly doing disservice to the lasting legacy of the Chiefs.
"Hey, Riley, I think it's time."
"Toe, Dit, Gordi, let's do it!"
"Okay, boys, make your daddies proud."
"Talk about their family ties, sports fans."
It appears the offspring of the Hanson brothers are making their first appearance as part of this ragtag team.
"My life is stupid, useless, and when you read this letter,"
I'll be dead by poison.
I write you to make it clear I'm the only one responsible for my death.
Nobody should be blamed for my death.
Nobody.
Farewell.
"Baroness de Vibray."""
Fantastic!
"You are a brother, Arsène."
Usher!
Procurator asks for me.
I gotta go.
You would get me a permit to enter in the jail?
What would I not do?
Judge Fuselier is committed to the case.
See you later.
You do not monitor the prisoners to prevent these things?
"Listen, after we took his fingerprints, everything was fine."
"At midnight, the guard made his round and found nothing unusual."
Only this morning he was found hanging.
When soup was being served.
Hanging?
And with what?
"I see what you're getting at, Mr Fandor."
But no.
"The guards removed his tie, his suspenders and his shoelaces."
All that was left him was a medallion
which he held dear.
"You know, the unfortunate man had to exert a terrible energy, because he tied strips of his shirt to the bars of his window and he hung himself leaning back in the rear."
"Tell me, death was probably very slow?"
Could I see him?
Why not photograph him?
Seems like Big Sis's type
"4,800 yen..."
That's quite expensive...
Heard he got busy and stopped writing
Still too expensive...
This fact wasn't written in any of the Books of Prophecies
"Impressive! ""Bon"" Natsuko the forever damned hunter with the blood of 108 sexual demons"
You can't seem to escape the wrath of sexual desire
"Oh, a sigh like a beast's roar"
So we didn't buy anything after all.
Sorry!
No it's Ok
"No, I'm really sorry"
"I didn't really care though, as long as I got the feel of Boy's Love"
"No, no, no!"
It doesn't work like that
"Without caution, you may dislike us BL lovers as well"
That's also why it was such a hard decision
But it's not like I'd start hating you
"Well, thank you then"
I thought you'd say that
"Well no, more than that..."
I don't want you to start hating anal
What?
Ok...
Um...
Let's eat
Thanks
"So, which do you like better, games or BL?"
You're gonna ask me that?
Um... nevermind
I know you can't choose
Forget it.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, how about a mini celebration?"
"All right, we'll just keep it simple, just the things that Judah loved, chicken parmesan, Willy Wonka, the original not the lame Johnny Depp piece of shit."
"A piñata, lap dance."
Celia.
"Hey, take it easy."
All right.
Enough.
I never should have done this!
They hate me!
They hate me!
This is all your fault!
"God, if you would have just put a fucking light in at the intersection!"
- I was going to.
"- Oh, right, you were?"
"But you were being this know-it-ally bitchface,"
- I couldn't resist fucking with you.
"- Yeah, and you still can't."
City Council is pretty much the only thing in my life
I didn't have to get baked to get through.
You took that away from me.
How did you know about Walter's boat garage?
"Celia, everything that happens in government is motivated by self-interest."
Someone's always trying to put one over on someone else so they can get something they want.
We're all just nothing but a bunch of selfish assholes.
"Remember that, and you won't go wrong."
Thank you.
Celia.
You should bring some vodka to the council.
- Vodka.
- That's what I used to do.
You think they like anyone?
"By the way, I'll tell you as a woman..."
"Citizen, the note is in my pocket."
Don't forget.
"--Be so kind as to give me a chair --Pavel Ivanovich, why do you bother?"
--I kindly ask you.
--We can do it ourselves...
--Thank you --You're welcome
"And hand me the rope, please."
--Thanks --Sure
--Take this --Thanks
Be careful.
You're too heavy for this shaky table.
--Move away please --Where to?
--There
You wanted to hang yourself and be a burden on my conscience
"It won't work, Ermakov."
No!
But I can do much better!
"I kill human beings, sending them back to where they came from or I take their sight of the sun by blinding them."
I decide who lives and who dies  the city that I will build!
I will create an immortal Rome!
Not even the mighty Olympus will not be able to prevent the birth of this city!
Oh mighty Cesar.
"Now I know, that you are mad."
Mad?
Why?
Because I take what I want without asking?
Because I have everyone executed who hates or betrays me?
I simply wipe away the worms which are attracted by the fetidness of their souls and which they try to hide under their tunicas.
"No Petreius, I'm not mad."
I am free!
I am the only free man in the world!
That's right!
Wow!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
This is the greatest discovery since...
"I don't know, television or something!"
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...
"No, they'll panic."
People always wig out and start shooting when they see something big like you.
- Hmm?
"- Oh, wig out."
It means crazy.
"You know, like, uh... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)"
"No, no, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the kind of stuff that makes them shoot at you.
MANSLEY:
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar detected an unidentified object entering Earth's atmosphere."
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half miles off the coast of Rockwell.
Some assumed it was a large meteor or a downed satellite.
But my office in Washington received a call from someone who reported an actual encounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
So...
"So, we can't call Ripley's Believe It or Not because they wouldn't believe it."
- And...

"Oh, it's getting dark."
And if I don't get home soon

It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.

"Oh, I'm sorry."
When were you menstruating out your pussy?
"No, the um..."

"Oh, yeah, sure, fine."
Whatever.
"Okay, so I'm gonna take two fingers,"
I'm gonna put 'em in your hair pie.
"I'm gonna feel around, apply some pressure to your ovaries and check you out for beav cancer, okay?"

I apologize.
- No.

"- Yeah, no."
Can you just use the clinical term for vagina?
I don't-
- I don't see what's so hard about just saying vagina.
I don't understand.
Are you referring to your sausage wallet?
- Sausage wallet?
"- You know, your lizard mouth."
Does it really feel normal to you to refer to it this way?
I-
- That would be like a proctologist calling a butt a--
Butt?

"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-Iike arms and legs."
"And his green face, Iike a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-beIieve stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-beIieve, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you...."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao."""
"What'II you do, Grandma?"
I'II go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
AII right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
You also burglarized the secret service.
I'll spend a little time in prison.
You're not getting what is important here.
I'm not getting what's important.
And the fact that I changed my name--
"Which, by the way, I did so the soviets wouldn't find me,"
Not to hide from our government.
Important.
That--Mrs.
Frederic fixed all this.
She expunged all the charges.
Someone obviously unfixed it.
"- Artie, focus."
"- Oh, I'm focused."
Here's the key.
Who gave Dickinson my file?
"Find out, that'll take you directly to who has the sword."
And that will lead you to Macpherson.
Who?
Time's up.
"Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time."
Put in for transfers while this whole warehouse business
Is still just a sidetrack in your careers.
Scars don't have to be permanent.
- Yeah.
No can do.
- Just think about it.
"Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do too."
"Now, I may not be your boss anymore,"
"But until someone tells me otherwise,"
I still outrank you.
So this time I am putting you on a plane
-But I'm going just the same.
Stay here!
"You belong here, both of us, together!"
-We've been friends ever since...
"-Good-bye, Selena."
But your mother?
How can you leave her alone?
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena... I cried all the way to New York... and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves... that had started to fall back home."
"For days, I struggled to keep alive... and I shivered with loneliness in the back room of nowhere."
There were times when lwanted to crawl home... but somehow I managed and I stayed.
I learned what I could endure.
But none of us in New York or in Peyton Place... could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter... of deep despair.
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings... driving their sons to a place of hurried good-bye.
I prayed forthem.
"Come on, fellows, get your last cup of civilian coffee."
That army stuff is used for waterproofing shingles.
That's what I heard.
Make yourself.
-Take a cup.
-Did you hear what Norman Page did?
"-Yeah, became the first 4-F in town."
"-No, he enlisted in the paratroopers."
-No kidding!
-Our Norman?
-Norman Page?
-He volunteered.
The paratroopers.
It's the funniest thing I've heard in years.
Maybe they'll drop his mother with him.
"She'd kill 1,OOO Japanese before letting one touch her little boy."
Brought you a donut.
We take it very seriously.
"Look, in our e-mail,"
My husband and I said a lot of things.
Really it's just a bunch of words.
"What words were you referring to... ""drunk"" or ""nazi""?"
"Name-calling aside, once these matters come to light,"
We are mandated to address them promptly and swiftly.
"Well, what's prompter than forgetting about it?"
"You know, I've already moved on."
This type of behavior will not be tolerated.
You have to be stopped.
I'm sorry.
You're looking at me.
She's sitting over there.
"We're looking at you, dear."
We are all looking at you.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
This is starting to sound like it's about me.
Let's take a look at your file.
I have a file?
!
Mike!
"Uh, in her defense, she was very drunk."
"Besides harassing a teacher,"
"You've also been ""overreactive""..."
"""mildly threatening""..."
"""demanding special attention""..."
"Your ""intimidating behavior"
"Creates a hostile learning environment..."""
I am not the one who's hostile!
She's the one who's hostile!
"We can do this any way you want, Doc."
One to one from the chest...
Or we can all get down !
"Yeah, we can all really fuck this place up!"
(BELL ringing)
I'm not going against the guns.
"You're gonna lose, Doc."
"Any move you make, we're on you."
You fucked up!
(MEN clamoring)
"You're staying in the hole for as long as it takes to break up your little gang, Santana."
(GATE CLOSES)
SANTANA:
There was nothing the system could do to stop me.
I could run this show from solitary.
"Gracias, carnal."
J. D. taking care of business?
"Simón, ese, but the heat's on."
They're trying to break us up.
(SPEAKS spanish)
Danny's down in Soledad.
Stevie's down in Chino and Willie boy's in Vacaville.
"We need a meeting, keep ourselves together."
Any of our people on the outside coming up for trial?
Puppet's little brother got busted.
"Tell our lawyer to subpoena us, get us together in one place."
"The brothers send their love, carnal."
Gracias.
SANΤANA:
"Τhe state is so lame, they paid for the game."
There were a couple of things from some of our people who've already gotten out that weren't in sync with instructions I've been getting from inside.
Inside runs the show.
"We visited so many pool halls that day and night, I couldn't begin to remember them all."
Barbara's 24 hours were about up... that is...
until your figured our pool bets.
"According to my calculations, you owe me through dinnertime, which is 6:00 p.m. in Bayonne."
Right.
My paranoia was in full bloom.
"Every time we came out of one of those pool halls, the blue sedan was cruising by."
"Even after we switched from the bus to the car, his tailing didn't improve."
It was almost like he wanted to be spotted.
Barbara?
Hmm?
Are you a girl who gets nervous in a car?
Never.
Wah!
"Barbara,"
I'm going to the bathroom.
"In two minutes, you go to the bathroom."
But I don't have to go to the bathroom.
"Please, go to the bathroom."
But I...
I don't have to go to the bathroom.
Please.
Okay.
But I don't have to.
"When somebody drives a car that tries too hard to be average... and sports a haircut with white sidewalls, government."
But why would the government care about Barbara's missing fiancé?
That's funny.
Higgins usually has the dogs greet me.
"Yeah, me too."
"Except today he was in a really, really good mood."
Kept laughing and saying something about busing.
"Why don't you make yourself at home, T.C.?"
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."
"""his younger sister, before he dies."
"""please come and see my father."
"""sincerely yours, clark."""
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, Iet's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
-How could he be my big brother?
-It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
"I know... what you mean, but...."
Guess it's about the right time to eat some kidney beans.
real stubborn.
"Once again, we blasted the nasal passages of the city clean of the cloning mucus of evil."
Now we can all breathe free and easy and smell the lilacs in bloom.
"Hello, aroma!"
Ahh...
- Atchoo!
"- Uh, I'll get the soup."
Too hot!
Too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me;

But not for joy; not joy
"Go, play. boy."
Play
"Thy mother plays and I play, too but so disgraced a part."
"How now, boy?"
What has smudged thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine.
"- Come, Captain, we must be neat."
"- I am like you, they say."
"Why, that's some comfort."
"Go, play, Mamillius."

"- What, Camille, there?"
"- Ay, my good lord."
"Ha' you not seen, Camille - but that's past doubt - that my wife is slippery?"
You never spoke what did become you less than this.
Is whispering nothing?
Leaning cheek to cheek
STEVE:
You got anything?
Nothing.
Keep looking.
There's got to be something here that's gonna tell us who hired this guy.
Guys?
I think I got something.
What?
"Okay, so it looks like"
Kroll was hired over the Tor Network.
What is that?
It's kind of like a shadow Internet.
"Some people call it ""the Dark-net."""
"It was originally created by the Navy, but nowadays it's utilized mostly by criminals because it allows them to be completely anonymous."
So tracing an I.P.?
"Is not gonna happen, but... here comes the good news."
"According to these e-mails,"
Kroll wouldn't take the Cutler job unless the client revealed himself.
And did they?
Not at first.
But they came around.
Here-- looks like they sent their last message outside of the network.
And that I.P. we can trace.
ABBY:
But I liked John.
Why would I kill him?
"Well, maybe you liked him more than you let on."
"You wanted John to take you away from your secret little escort life, but he had no intentions of ending his marriage."
"A woman scorned, Abby."
It's the oldest motive there is.
CATHERINE:
These e-mails?
It's signed.
- You like the Bulls?
You ever go?
- Not often.
"Oh, okay."
So we're doing some stuff on Atlantor.
Some stuff?
"Yeah, stuff, DA Stuff."
"And because we're great investigators, we discovered you are too."
"I'm not investigating, I'm trying to get them to stop building this."
"Cool, to protect the neighborhood."
I like it there.
I grew up in Bridgeport.
- Mr. Dumanjik...
- Bob.
Are you going to tell me what this is about?
You mean about the grand jury?
Excuse me?
The grand jury we impaneled to investigate Atlantor.
lnvestigate what about Atlantor?
"Well, that would be telling."
Wait a minute.
A grand jury is investigating Atlantor.
And I was hoping you'd be happy about that.
This is strange.
You can't tell me?
What did they do?
I was hoping since you've been developing evidence for your own civil case that maybe you could share what you've found in a neighborly way.
I... this is... you're going to have to tell me more about this.
"I have all sorts of constraints, confidentiality issues..."
And your ex-husband is the architect.
- What do you want?
Just then...
Seo Yoon Jae's spirit thought his body to be dead and selfishly rushed into my body.
Yoon Jae...is not the kind of person to selfishly take someone else's body.
Whatever.
"Without any choice, my spirit went into Seo Yoon Jae's body."
This all happened because Seo Yoon Jae went into the wrong body.
Yoon Jae is a person of discretion.
He's not someone to make mistakes about his place like that.
Whatever.
Whatever!
This one has to leave...
There will be some sort of a solution whether it be just another switch-a-roo.
Yoon Jae...
How did this happen?
Why did you go to a place like that?
What?
A place like that?
I don't like..places like this either!
"Yoon Jae doesn't drink carbonated drinks, so can you drink something else?"
What?
"This isn't your body, but Yoon Jae's body."
"Until things go back to normal, I hope that you treat it preciously."
Preciously?
How?
"Just like Yoon Jae's always done, when you're thirsty, drink water instead of carbonated beverages."
Also the weather is chilly and this is thin.
Don't you have anything thicker and warmer?
You weren't even examined thoroughly earlier...
Oh my...
"Oh my, you're scraped here."
What do we do?
Wait a second.
What else can we do?
If they fight we must fight with them.
"And does it matter, after all, who wins?"
Was that ever really the question?
Will almighty God ask that question in the end?
"Police Department, zone one."
Sergeant Roberts.
The Polish Hill Strangler has claimed a fourth victim.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn was recovered from the Ohio River.
"Police had been alerted to the crimes by the killer,   who taunts them by playing the song ""Little Red Riding Hood""."
The police brutality trial of Detective Jimmy Detillo is over.
Detillo was convicted for the beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma.
The key to the conviction   was the testimony of Detillo's partner and cousin Thomas Hardy.
Hardy testified that his partner used unwarranted force.
"Come on, son, we're gonna be late for the policeman's ball."
- You've got to face him sometime.
- I feel like an asshole.
Maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
- I had you as a role model.
- You got that from your mother.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
"- Yeah, we're going out tomorrow."
What's the latest on Little Red Riding Hood?
"We get close, he slips away."
"I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop."
Maybe an ex-cop.
"Uncle Nick thinks so, too."
- Did you talk to him about Jimmy?
- We talked around it.
Did you wipe it off well?
Kim Young Joo's blood too...
You should wipe it off as well.
The one who killed Kim Young Joo was Cheon Jae Man.
Did you know?
You're no different from Cheon Jae Man.
He didn't kill those agents in the special task force himself either.
He merely borrowed the hands of others.
You dare put me in the same category as Cheon Jae Man?
!
The last person to be punished.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
The cruelest revenge you talked about...
Was it this?
Making me kill my real father by my own hands.
You've had quite a lot of fun these past 28 years.
Taking me away from my mom...
Making me believe someone else is my real father...
"Now, you're telling me to take revenge on my real father?"
That revenge...
I don't think I can do it.
Is it because he is your father by blood?
No.
"After becoming close to him, I saw he was an amazing President."
That amazing President you talk about...
Do you think he really got to that seat cleanly?
Choi Eung Chan...
I look forward to seeing your expression when you find out what he's really like.
Don't look forward to seeing my expression.
Things won't happen the way you want.
What Father wants...
That won't happen.
-Pizza Planet!
Yeah!
Andy!
Wh...
Doesn't he realise that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
"Oh, I'm a lost toy!"
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refuelling station of some sort.
You!
"-According to my navi-computer, the..."
-Shut up!
"-Just shut up, you idiot!"
"-Sheriff, this is no time to panic."
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost.
Andy is gone.
"They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!"
My...
My fault?
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me..."
Don't talk to me about importance!
Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What?
What are you talkin' about?
"Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!"
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
"And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!"
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
"Director Vance, what a surprise."
"I mean, not like a surprise."
"I mean, I know you have a special interest in this case because y-your family member is involved."
"No, that, that is not what I meant."
I-I am sure that your brother-in-law isn't involved.
"in anything at, at all."
"Ms. Sciuto, just proceed as if this were any other case."
Of course.
"Yes, sir."
So we know that the killer struck Petty Officer Adams hard and fast.
The wound is four inches in length and five inches in depth.
"The knife was stuck in once, to the abdomen."
The killer thrust it in deep and then tilted it up and pulled it out.
What's the weapon?
A five-inch boning knife like this one here.
It's the favorite of avid fishermen everywhere.
"The wound pattern matches the blade's design, but that's not all that matches."
The only prints on the body belong to none other than...
Petty Officer Brian Smith.
You have your guy.
"That's a good thing, right?"
"Hey, DiNozzo, search Petty Officer Smith's belongings."
Weapon's a fishing knife.
I want Michael released into my custody.
"Need to keep him close, Leon."
I'm taking him home tonight.
"Hey, Dad."
"All right, kids, that's enough of that for now."
Somebody here wants to say hello.
Hey.
Uncle Michael!
"What's up, man?"
- I'm not a dog.
- Stay.
- What happened to you?
"- Oh, uh, I blame you."
I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks.
All the fun we've been having together.
"Heh, well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo,"
I'd love to know what's going on here.
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
Department of Public Safety is trying to figure out what happened.
- Where's Chin and Kono?
- Inside getting background.
- That your sister in the car?
"- Yeah, I just came from the airport."
"If she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her."
"- Can we just focus, please?"
- Yeah.
Why do you have aneurism-face?
- I don't have aneurism-face.
- She gave you aneurism-face?

"I will literally pay you cash to stop talking, okay?"
"Excuse me, officer?"
"My pickup is around the corner, there's a woman in it."
"It's my sister, I'm putting her in your custody, okay?"
"Get her some food, take her back to my office."
"Don't take your eyes off her till I get there, you got it?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Thank you.
You happy?
"Oh, sorry."
"I shoot straight, and hope that it'll be tempered by my teddy-bear cuteness."
Uh-huh.
Bullet hole through the window.
Clear.
Clear.
"Well, that's Ridgeway."
Looks like he's been dead a few days.
"What else do you see, Mr. Observant?"
This guy's not gonna be painting anytime soon.
"He's not gonna be answering any questions, either."
"Dr. Ryan, from the moment Jethro first mentioned your name and told me of your passion for the inner workings of the human mind,"

Ah.
"Thank you, Jethro."

Single gunshot wound to the chest.
"The bullet pierced the sternum, headed straight through the dorsal side, and lodged itself in an adjacent wall."
"Happily, it is now in the capable hands of Miss Sciuto."
GIBBS:
That it?
"Well, based on the rate of decomposition, he expired approximately 72 hours prior to discovery."
GIBBS:
Before we started playing Wickes.
"Oh, please."
Mr. Ridgeway.
Do you mind if I call you Larry?
(whispers):
"Ooh, I like this woman."
"- How do you do, more like."
"- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!"
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.
- Would you...?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.
I felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.
"Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby."
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?
Mine is 116.

"Emily Cale, go ahead."
- Okay.

I wasn't ready for a press conference.
How do you expect 22 Arab nations with different regional and religious interests to agree on a single treaty especially given the newly erupting conflicts between the Shiites and the Sunnis in southern Pakistan?
Tough question.
"To be honest with you, I don't know."
"Whether they'll agree or not I'm not sure, but I gotta try."
The day we stop believing different people can come together is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.
What I am ready to do is give a little girl a shout-out on her YouTube blog.
"Hi, folks, my name is James W. Sawyer and I'm here with Emily Cale and her video blog."
Check it out.
- You have a good one.

Is that right?
"You know, I take my protection detail very seriously."
"- Yes, sir."

"- Nice to meet you, Emily."
"- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President."
You guys have a good one.
"Whatever, dude."
Nice.
"So, I went to the big meeting."
In two months the town will vote whether or not to close us down.
"Now, that will give people time to think."
"- What if they vote, ""Yes?"""

"Look, what's with you guys?"
Don't you remember who we are?
Sonny Newman founded this home before there ever was a Charlestown.
His dog Dexter saved the entire city from the great flood of 1938 with one proud woof.
"The amazing Hanson brothers, whose ferocious might and legendary skill won the Federal Cup for this town in 1977."
They lived in this very house when they were boys just like us.
"Gentlemen, we are the Hanson brothers."
We are the children of the great Sonny Newman.
"We are the princes of Charlestown, and we will never be forgotten!"
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Double dessert for everybody!
- Yes!
Except for you!

- Fireball Rick.
- Are you serious?
Is the plane ready?
"Yes, Miss Bristol."
Let's go.
Where will the conference take place?
At the Quito Hotel.
Is that so?
"Yes, all has been arranged, as instructed."
Have the models reported in?
"Yes, they are traveling by commercial flight, accompanied by Maddame Rapiee"
"All is well, Lucrecia?"
The operation will take place in Quito.
Will our other agents have any problems?
"No, all has been arranged, the only one that cannot pass trough customs is you, you are too well known by the intelligence agency."
"Very well, Lucrecia, I am now in your hands."
We wil go to Quito in one of the emergency planes.
And where shall we find it?
the secret landing strip is not far away.

Do you have loose American cigarretes?

"I know, I was expecting you."
Where is she?
This did not happen on my watch.
"When she clocked in I was still in my pj's, jamming to Luther Vandross."
"Wow, this is a beautiful setup."
They're running themselves?
"No, Mrs. R."
They're being run remotely.
Amanda Baylor.
Are you there?
ZIVA:
"Amanda Baylor, 28, unmarried, freelance encryption specialist, graduated from MIT with a degree in applied mathematics."
What else?
"That's pretty much it, boss."
"With the exception of a few personnel files from the Iron Crypt, it's like she doesn't exist."
"Well, she existed enough to have stolen that file from AUTEC and set up a pretty good alibi."
How often was she logged in at work when she wasn't actually there?
Can we link her to Phillip Wickes?
We have not been able to tie Baylor to anyone at Wickes Steel.
Not even the board stooges.
Wickes is still only talking to them and only about pushing paper.
What about a line from Amanda Baylor to our dead guy?
ZIVA:
"Baylor does not have a history with firearms, but it is still possible"
(phone rings) that she shot Ridgeway.
"Yeah, Abbs."
Tell her you're on your way.
I'm on my way.
"There, there it is."
I don't see it.
She's right.
There was a bounce.
Damn it.
"Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down right there.
You should have seen him.
His eyes were-were crazy.
Just 'cause he changed the channel?
"No, no, bro, wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first-class airfare, seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel all-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of The Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now."
"And since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue, we're throwing in $1 million!"
She's the reason that Dawkins broke out of prison?
She just won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
"Okay, but why her?"
"Like, there's not enough rich people on this island?"
"She's away from home, she's out of her element."
Maybe Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
I need everything on Dana.
Okay?
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rental."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
That's it.
It matches the description of the car Dawkins stole.
Five-O.
We'll take it from here.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
Food or water?
Filming real families has put me back.
"Let's tell the truth, here was the story."
But my position became more and more uncertain.
So I devised a plan to stay afloat.
"Carlos, let's get him out of here."
He heard what he said.
- I know how to get from A to B.
Do you mean B of Belgium?
- What about B of Bulgaria?
Thing?
- See those lovely ladies?
The legendary Sirens of the Sea of Mero.
Folk singers.
"Their concert was canceled,"
And tomorrow they will depart for Bulgaria by coach.
The protocol will never approve it.
"- Look, here's the plan."
I ride a music video for them and they let us get out of here.
Secretly.
Forget it.
Do not you want to bring the king home?
- Sure.
Maybe we should talk to her boss.
Sire.
- I can not concentrate.
You are welcome.
The coincidence between universes and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature and man...
"The desire for independence characterizes every epoch, right?"
"It gave birth to our kingdom in 1830, and now it will probably collapse."
But what is the real nature of this independence?
This so-called freedom?
And another foot.
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.
When is TSA finally gonna realize that we all know the shoe thing?
You know what I mean?
"You get to the airport, they tell you to take your shoes off."
"It's like, ""Who doesn't know by now?"""
"Is someone getting to the airport, like, ""What?"
"I have to take my shoes off?"""
"If that happens, arrest and kill that person."
"They're probably not terrorists, but they're holding up the line."
And what is terrorism on a local level?
"On a local level, what is terrorism?"
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.
"""When did this start?"" ""Kill him!"""
"And I'm way too far back. ""Kill him!"
In front of everybody!
Everybody watches!
Everyone.
"No, sweetie, everyone watches."
Everyone.
Everyone watches.
Everyone watches.
"Never become that."""
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation the moment you start dealing with security.
"No one gets dressed and undressed while moving sideways at home, but goddamn it if you're not an Olympian when you get there."
Hurry up!
"People in tears, like, ""I just want to see my family again!"
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?
"Oh, my God!"
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!
I'm certainly not turning them over to you
To be stolen the next time you feel sleepy.
"Agent carter,"
How did you come to discover the stolen items?
"Leet brannis, uh, told me where they were."
And how did you come into contact with mr.
Brannis?
I have been conducting my own private investigation
Have you been in contact with him since his disappearance?
"Are you collaborating with stark,"
A known traitor and fugitive from justice?
Publicly revealing these items won't clear mr.
Stark's name.
They'll only place you under suspicion along with him.
Do you see the day I've had?
"I will call them in, and they will respect me."
But they won't.
They'll only use it to tear you down.
If you wish to clear mr.
"Stark's name,"
You must do so from the shadows.
There's a phone box across the street.
"But for god's sake, don't let krzeminski get hold of it."
Sousa's working the office tonight.
I can just about stomach him getting the credit.
"Oh, and, uh, mr."
"Jarvis, they know your voice now."
Sousa.
"Hey, mack, I, uh,"
Got a hot tip for ya.
"Yeah, howard stark's stolen inventions."
They're... they're...
It closed a Iong time ago.

"Everyone, look who's here!"
Aren't you...

It's been ages!
"We've selected promising students, and assigned them to the lacrosse and beach volleyball teams."
"In order to promote such disciplines, we plan to produce comics and novels."
We're working on sports entertainment and documentary film programs.
"We've set up a dedicated Internet server, and will soon launch a blog."
This chart shows the expected investment results.
Enough about investments.
Is this marketable or not?
There are two things worth investing in.
Power and beauty.
The days of investment in power are numbered.
This leaves beauty.

The meeting's over.
The old Ms. Isezaki asked...
"Oh, he's gone."
Why did the dojo close?
I don't really know.
It was very sudden.
"But I had a premonition, you know."
"But if everyone else had no idea, it must've been a shock for them."
However I...
I've checked on the author of the article.
Remember me?
I'm Rin Sakurazawa.
Rin Sakurazawa!
Rin!
Stealing glances at these papers?
"Yeah, that made me suspicious."
Can't we just forget all this?
"You're walking out that door, and you're never seeing her again."
Who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Jack Stillman.
The Fixer.
"The I.R.S. says he made $16 million last year working for media companies, politicians--"
And the occasional crime figure.
I understand that I'm a person of interest to you.
Who told you that?
"I know everything that happens in this city, Special Agent."
"You interfere with this investigation again, whether it be paying people to lie or encouraging them to withhold evidence,"
"I'll bring you down, Stillman."
"Well, you're welcome to try."
But I should warn you that better people than you have failed.

Good art has to tell a story?

It's funny.
When Dana and I went to the museum last weekend--
"Man, that's the fourth Dana reference today."
[laughing] That's not--
That's not true.
Really?
Four?
Four.
And that already includes two about the museum.
It's completely isolated.

"I guess Devil's Night keeps you pretty busy, huh?"
Not as much as it did in the '80s.
"Used to get up to 600, 700 fires back then."
- In three days?
- Down to 115 last year.
It still takes everything we got.
"Fortunately, we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the Rivertown district?
"I wish they could, but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's Finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.

[Prentiss] A thousand volunteers?
"[Morgan] Well, that just added another thousand names to Garcia's list."

You owe me... big.
"Trager, you really embraced your inner Hallmark card."
You've gone soft.
I know.
You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
All this for puppy love?
"I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?"
"I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set Kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced."
"God, that felt good."
Did you see where I put the napkins?
Is there a garlic convention in here?
Too much?
Never.
What's the occasion?
Take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
Um...
I'm incredibly hungry.
How about all of the above?
Stephen.
Hmm?
You mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
Can you hear me?
"Hello?"""
I've just killed two people.
My aunt and my uncle.

The Fixer S01E01
How did I become a hitman for the state?
It all began five years into my life sentence and the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison.
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
Maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
He liked emotions.
They...gave him something to manipulate.
"So, while the rest watch The Champions League, you stop trying to push down the walls."
You pick up your book...
..and you worry about the mystery of things.
Lenny offered me a new life.
A new home and a new family.
But there was a price.
There was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders.
But somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
Lenny's first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
"Now, how can I describe him?"
Take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
You think you've left them behind.
You think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again.
That's Calum.
Yeah!
Hey!
First time I heard this tune I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds Niamh and Catherine.
"Cousins from Burnley, mate."
- I just gotta put out a fire for a client.
- Can we talk about that later?
- This is more important.
- Wayne:
"I thought you were gonna tell me it was something important, like a testicular cancer scare."
"No, not that important, but still nonetheless, it's important."
More important than bringing your team to Vegas?
"I only stuck around for this lunch, Spencer."
I'm heading back to LV today.
Jet is washed and the Joe's Stones are on ice.
"- Vern, what's up?"
Wish I had better news.
"- Wayne, yeah, I understand."
"I get it, it's only a onetime pass."
"- Yeah, it happened again."
- It's not gonna happen again.
"Yeah, he's more than a little upset, Vernon."
"- Wayne, hold on one second."
- He's cutting you.
Cutting me or cut me?
What tense did he use?
"What the fuck does it matter what tense he used, Vernon?"
- Jesus Christ.
Come on.
- You didn't listen.
"What the fuck are we gonna do, Joe?"
Me and Spencer are heading there now.
We are gonna beg for mercy.
"You are gonna fucking divest yourself of the entire weed business ASAP, you hear me?"
"First off, calm the fuck down when you talk to us, man."
We ain't done nothing that wasn't in accordance with Colorado state law.
"- Reggie, please stop talking."
"But this is thievery of the educated, done for easy money"
"Mrs Batra, I might report him to the police."
But I haven't the heart
But he will never gain admission into any university.
That's his punishment
He will never find employment in any computer company
His future...
I'm very sorry.
But Why did he steal?
Whatever the reason might've been only Jagadish can tell
You have betrayed my faith in you!
"Not you, all of us bear the punishment"
How much money did you make out of selling papers?
Even you think I'd do such a thing?
I was just helping a friend
"At least you'd understand that, I learnt it only from you"
Learnt from me?
What?
Thieving?
What am I?
A thief?
Helping friends!
Is this how you help friends?
By robbing?
"You haven't a degree, you have no future."
You're ruined
You are a thief!
I am a thief's brother.
And that's the truth
You will achieve nothing in life
"Jai was my weakness, you were my strength"
"But today, you make me weak."
Several possible explanations come...
How can you explain a massacre like that?
"No, Mr. Spock, the threat is clear and immediate."
Invasion.
"Very well, then."
"If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base."
I intend to.
"If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us."
- Captain to helmsman.
"- Sulu here, sir."
- Is the alien still making warp 5?
"- Affirmative, sir."
- Initiate warp 6.
"- Affirmative, sir."
Overtake.
Phaser banks.
Lock on to the enemy vessel.
Stand by for firing orders.
"All hands, this is the captain."
We are going into battle.
"All hands, battle stations."
Red alert.
"I repeat, red alert."
This is no drill.
This is no drill.
"Captain's log, stardate 3046.2."
We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus III.

"- Yes, sir."

All scanners lock into computer banks.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCA detective, also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
The kids found the bodies - I saw it on the news.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad.
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
"After that, he wrapped this tape around her face."
Suffocated her.
Must've taken a while.
"The man that organised it is called Jacob Gould, a real high-flyer."
But I think he had help from the inside.
- From who?
- Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
So you're part of this Operation Merlin as well?
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"- Who do you work for, then?"
"- Oh, now there's a question."
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post-traumatic stress.
- Yeah.
Unofficially?
- I don't think that's any of your concern.
- My job's to disorganise crime.
- Illegally.
"- I prefer to use the world ""irregular""."
"- Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
"That's enough, dastard!"
Get out.
Get out
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Get out!
"Take it, son!"
Come on.
"- Whatever I had, was 3 boats sunken - to the bottom of the sea."
"Hereafler they are not allowing wound, brickbat, it's incurable."
"Hanieh, Bashirou,"
You!
So you have loaded all of your things.
"My burden sank to the bottom of the sea, Zaer_"
These things I brought are imposing on you.
"- Then, what are you going to do?"
- The truth is that I came here to how can I tell you?
I came here to be the seaman of your boat.
"No, it's not possible."
What are you talking about?
As I do remember all your family members were chief or captain.
I am beholden to you and your father so much.
"Captain Zaer,"
- how many times I told you these Tangaki people
"- They are innocent, Zaer_"
I am wondering what a compassionate man you are.
"It's outside and inside of the house as you see, captain."
"If Bashirou's mommy can clean it up, it will become a wonderful place, you can even arrange a wedding party here!"
"Let me kiss your hand, Zaer_ Oh, captain, what are you doing?"
What are you saying?
"If anything is lacking ask the estate agent for it,"
How much longer?
"30 minutes, 45 tops."
I have the money.
"All right, but if you're not at the 7th street train station in 45 minutes, I'm contacting bin-khalid's men."
"No, Ben, listen..."
What's that?
"The subroutine search we were running, using Mullins' override to find the leak."
There's a hit on whoever accessed
The army rangers' identities.
They used the CTU director's code.
Keith?
Yours.
How is that possible?
Can you see where the file was accessed from?
Yeah.
A computer in your husband's campaign headquarters.
"Uh, the IP address is scrambled, but let me see if I can..."
Got it.
"The computer the rangers' identities were accessed from belongs to Mizrani, first name Nilaa."
My husband's campaign manager.
We were pulled offline.
I can't get back on the server.
They know.
They cut our out-feed.
I'm not looping the evidence room feed anymore.
"Carter, we're shut down."
You need to get out of there now.
"Keith, we're running an operation."
If you shut us...
You're not running anything.
Nothing happens till I confirm what the hell is going on.
- Lock them in interrogation now.
Even if you shed tears over her.
Because I... am already yours.
Could that have triggered it?
No...
It couldn't be.
I always looked up to you.
You had everything that I did not.
So I hated you.
"Still, do not worry, sister."
"From now on, I will be truly be your substitute and I will be Slaine's support!"
Why...?
What's up with that?
Does that mean she got ditched here?
"""The captain left me in charge because she trusts me."""
"That's what she said, but Cdr."
Mizusaki has got to be devastated.
Why did she pick Lt. Marito of all people as her traveling companion?
Companion?
"Escort, more like."
What's this about Lt. Marito?
"No, um..."
"It's just that he accompanied the captain to the conference, so I thought it might be serious."
Ah.
"With that Martian proclamation and all, the situation is definitely changing."
I can't believe that the princess is getting married...
That's what you're interested in?
"No, but look..."
Isn't it possible that her change of heart was because someone around her felt that way?
"Like, she was seduced by him or something?"
Sorry.
"But we're still not 100% sure that the Princess Asseylum who said that was the princess who spent time with us, right?"
I honestly can't say.
"You know, I find that the most amazing creatures have furry behinds."
"Sitting in Woolsey Nicholls ' office, discussing the furry behinds of bees  Chuck realized this was her very first job interview ever."
"She considered this fact for a moment, then had to ask:"
"I have to ask, are you the Woolsey Nicholls from Bzzzzzzzzz!"
Honey and More?
Mm.
"Yes, I am."
Why are you here?
Isn't Betty's Bees your biggest rival?
I own Betty's Bees now.
We made the acquisition very quietly.
"These days, merger can send brand loyalists into a tizzy."
"Well, I'm a honey loyalist, and you'll get no tizzy from me."
I just hope you're not killing Bee-Girls.
- I beg your pardon?
- The Bee-Girl sales division.
"With any acquisition, there's always downsizing and restructuring."
I hope it doesn't affect the Bee-Girls.
The Bee-Girls will always have a home in my hive.
"Unfortunately, although fortunate for you we've recently had an opening in the Bee-Girl division."
"Oh, yeah, I heard about that."
Kentucky Fitz?
Something about a honey-harvesting tragedy?
Yes.
It's very sad.
She had a bright future here at the new Betty's Bees.
Yeah.
I also heard that she was thinking of leaving Betty's Bees before she died.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
"- Well, you sure hear a lot of things."
- Very gossipy office.
Yes.
- No!
"It's you, with your insistence on being kowtowed to at every bloody opportunity!"
"Oh, my God!"
Excuse me.
"I want some milk, I'm thirsty."
"His landlord found him in his apartment crying, hyperventilating."
"- Apparently, his girlfriend left him."
"- The term would be "" mommy. """
- What?
- Mommy.
"Well, he appears to be an Aby."
"You know, an adult baby?"
"It's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of in every way by a "" mommy"" or a ""daddy. """
You're familiar with this condition?
It's not really a condition.
It's more like a form of relaxation.
- Are you kidding me?
"- No, it says right here:"
"""Abies like to relinquish control, get away from their stressful lives. """
"- Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?"
- Shoe sales.
A foot fetish too.
This is an issue for the Psych Department.
No offense.
I am not so sure about that.
"Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you?"
This morning.
"More than likely, he suffers from a diaper rash, which is a medical ailment to be treated by the ER."
- When are you done with this rotation?
- Next week.
Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
"""To Dr. Pratt, thanks from a grateful patient."
"Hey, Alice."
"- Hiya, Ed."
"-Well, is, uh... loveable big stuff home yet?"
(chuckles)
"Yes, he's inside washing up."
"Ed, do you realize they have another emergency meeting tonight at the lodge?"
That's the fourth emergency meeting in this past week.
I'm beginning to think those emergency meetings are nothing but a poker game.
"Oh, wait a minute, Alice."
Wait a minute.
I'm surprised that you even think anything like that.
An emergency meeting is an emergency meeting.
Never a poker game.
An executive meeting-- that's a poker game.
Will you tell your lodge brother for me that I'm up at Mrs. Manicotti's?
I will do.
Hey there.
"What say, Ralph?"
Mmm!
Alice told me to tell you she's up at Mrs. Manicotti's.
Mmm!
"Boy, this is delicious."
"Norton... if I ever ran into you when you weren't eating,"
I don't think I'd know you.
"What kills me is you eat and you eat and you eat, and you don't even gain a pound."
"I guess my nature, my basic metabolism or something, I don't know."
"As long as I can remember,"
I've weighed exactly what I weigh now-- 165 pounds.
"As-as far back as I remember, 165."
"Gee, I remember when I used to weigh 165."
Did you ever see a picture of me when I weighed 165 pounds?
"No, Ralph, I never did see any of your baby pictures."
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette!
"Okay, Officer, I think we..."
we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
Let me check with my supervisor.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
"I missed you at Dad's funeral, Mare."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
You know the last time I saw you was at Mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.
"'Cause I was thinking it could've been cool to have a picnic in between, or something, you know?"
- A picnic?
- Yeah.
A picnic.
"Something that, I don't know, normal families do?"
"How did you say you were injured, again?"
"Well, originally, uh... playing high school baseball, but, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time."
"Anything traumatic recently, with the knee?"
"Yeah, actually."
I got a new partner.
I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, no, this-this guy is like a physical injury, Doc."
"Ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car-- not joking-- onto the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
He drove a car onto a boat?
You've earned the right to see this.
"Hey, there, buddy."
It's me.
"And by ""me,"" I mean you."
"And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot, because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles."
What you discovered about Bracken's partnership with LokSat is too dangerous to pursue.
LokSat?
I knew about LokSat?
I am barely living proof.
I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat's plane was landing tonight.
I barely escaped without being identified.
I am erasing our mind for a reason...
To protect Kate.
"'Cause if she found out, then she will die."
"So do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles, for her sake."
Do you know what this means?
Yes.
You tracked LokSat.
"If we can cross-reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot, then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is."
"No, no."
It means what happened was my fault.
The murders of Beckett's former AG team...
"In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat,"
I inadvertently sentenced them all to death.

Gossip girl has ruined our graduation
And it's only 2:00.
We have to stop her.
I don't know.
Messing with gossip girl?
Think of the consequences.
You can't ask us to jeopardize our futures for your personal vendetta.
Besides she didn't even say anything about us
Not even penelope.
Oh soup dumplings.
This is not my personal vendetta.
She attacked all of us and was wrong.
Completely.
Totally.
Well I'm gonna go do some damage control just in case
So don't wait for me.
Well what about you two?
Well of everyone here
You guys probably have the most secrets you're hiding.
I'll gather intel.
I'll run some stats.
I'm sorry...
About before.
About what part exactly?
the pre-graduation squabble
Or the fact that you no longer want to marry me?
What exactly is our problem anyway?
You tried to give me money behind my back
When i said no.
We both make mistakes.
But if we can't accept that about each other
How do we move forward?
"-This is the spot, you say?"
-That's right!
This is your spot.
So what's the standard for finding the rock?
Standards?
The standards are a little...confusing.
"For example, if the standards for finding the rock is the size, then in that case, since Choong Sik is the biggest in this family, this would be Choong Sik."
Then your wife would be next...
Gil Da Ran...
And you.
Then...if the beauty is the standard for finding the rock...
Then...since this is the prettiest...
your wife.
"Then next would be Choong Sik, Gil Da Ran..."
And you.
See?
The standards for finding one is confusing.
Father-in-law...
So...
"With me being the ugliest and the smallest in the family, you have a problem with me being the biggest, and the prettiest rock."
"No, no, no, no!"
It's just that I was curious about what kind of a rock would represent me as a person.
The standards for finding your rock...
Is about harmony.
Fitting in harmoniously with the other rocks that are sitting up here.
Harmony!
We just need to find that.
Whether you want to find one or not...
You do whatever you want.
"Whenever adults don't want to bother explaining something, they always make things confusing and just fumble over it."
Harmony?
What's that?
As you should be.
Yay!
"You know, the last time I was invited"
"To a ceremony in my honor, I had to slaughter a chicken."
"Well, at least you've been honored."
"I've-I've never been honored,"
"I did win a contest once at boarding school,"
"And I think there was a plaque,"
But I'm not sure that really counts.
What kind of contest?
It was for drinking hot chocolate
At the winter fair.
"I had a buddy that went to Exeter,"
And the stories he tells would make Keith Richards blush.
"Yeah, well, um..."
I wasn't really into the party scene.
I was there more for the academics.
"It sounds like you've made some great choices, Serena."
I'm glad.
The bad ones have a way of...
Following you.
"You know, I've never heard that hot chocolate story."
"Yeah, well, there are a lot of stories you haven't heard."
"True, but I did hear this one."
"My ex-boyfriend went to boarding school with Serena,"
And he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
At a bed-and-breakfast- Jenny.
Although I'm sure they were just studying.
"You know, like she says, she was all about the academics."
"I have an announcement, everyone."
I've decided I'm moving back in.
"That way, I can be here with you, mom."
Reproductive Biology Research Foundation.
"Did you, uh, check on top of the fridge?"
I already looked there.
"Well, then maybe Helen finished the frosted flakes."
But that's what I eat for breakfast every day.
"Well, then fry an egg, then."
Just don't leave the refrigerator door hanging open.
"Oh, I got to go."
Are you-- are you hiding from me?
Hiding?
No.
That would just be silly.
Because I-I just saw you talking with Virginia.
I'm hiding from you because I do not want to have this conversation.
Why?
What did Virginia say?
"First of all, there is nothing going on between her and Logan."
She said that?
"Well, of course she said that now."
"But what if you were to take her out for dinner, you know?"
- Maybe have a drink or two?
- No!
"My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them."
"Hey, hey."
Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.
"Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever."
The only person you can control is yourself.
"So, you got no relevant information out of her"
- about Logan.
"- Oh, for the love of God!"
Are you kidding me?
The placebo reaction.
... fromstaffer to congressional assistant...
... untilthemayorofNewYorkCity came down to testify.
And he gave a speech that day...
... thatwillstaywithme for the rest of my life.
I went up to him and told him I admired him and what he stood for...
... andwhileIwas thankinghim...
... heaskedme if Ilikedstonecrabs .
"Halfway through dinner, I had a job."
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years...
"... andI finallyfoundaplace,where  you can make a difference."
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We gotta keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
"I gotta get that report, see where it leads."
"What if, while you're playing detective..."
... Wakeleydecides it'd be healthier to disappear?
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we gotta take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own...
... you'llfeelthefullweight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
"That must have been a few million won, at least."
Where did you get the money?
You know that I'm working for Yong Moon Plan now.
You just started.
- Did you rob them?
- I didn't!
"Bro, you're hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Take off your uniform too.
It's a piece of evidence.
How is this evidence?
I got blood on me from trying to save him!
Son of a...
"Hello, sir."
I just got a call from the head of the Sung Jang Police Station.
"Do you remember Lawyer Jo Eun Jung, who was reported missing?"
"Yes, he's the last person to have seen Seo Jun Suk before his death."
"He has been discovered, as a corpse."
Is that so?
"But, the thing is..."
in his pants pocket... was Im Tae Ho's business card.
"For the time being, you won't be leaving this building."
Listen carefully!
If it becomes news that an active officer has been on a serial killing spree the entire country will be upside down.
Mr. President.
What are you talking about?
"What do you mean, a serial killing spree?"
Take extra precaution to make sure nothing leaks to reporters!
- Understand?
- Without even investigating...
How can you accuse me like this?
That's why...
I will... interrogate you myself.
No.
"It was so Dr. Cicchirini, I do not know..."
"I already am in charge, yes, yes."
I already am in charge.
"Good night, Mr. Benito, where he has gone of party tonight?"
"To where she wants that she goes, lady?"
"That way, with the friendly."
"Ah, I know very well the youth of nowadays."
"Friendly, friendly, small orgy..."
"It hears, by the one of the rent, still I am waiting for the heel of my aunt."
She is really his aunt?
Because the handsome boys always find some arranged to pay by them.
My aunt has 70 years and it pays for the studies to me until the Medicine doctorate ever since a doctor discovered that he suffers 14 diseases and it makes happy giving a pile him of medecines.
I know it.
Already there is it to me counted.
"But although not outside her aunt, would not be anything bad."
Because a true woman knows to give itself and in the bed it is not like the children of nowadays.
I in the bed give everything it.
One is bad?
The belly hurts much to me.
-It wants that it does a massage to him?
-No. no.
"Hungry of love, it was observing to me..."
-Who is?
-I am Italia.
Step inside.
"Professor, is everything to point for the operation."
"Italy, Italia."
"They see this, see here."
Closer.
Professor the operation.
"They see, Italia, Country of saints and poets..."
The promise of the Chinese ambassador post is pulling you away like you no longer work here.
The DCI has put me on the trilateral commission looking into Jai's death.
People think I murdered my own son?
Hey.
"For a week trip, you pack kind of light."
Please tell me you're not wearing this.
I'm going on a business trip to the Caribbean.
"Unless you're applying for a job at Sandals,"
I would lose this shirt.
What kind of business do you have in the Caribbean?
"Oh, I have my finger in a number of..."
Pies.
Pies.
"Yeah, I know."
"What kind of pies, specifically?"
"Apple, rhubarb... cherry, when I'm in the mood."
This is always the worst part.
The fashion tips?
The end.
"We're always saying good-bye, and we never know when we're gonna see each other again."
Come with me... on my trip-- a week together in paradise.
You have to work.
I don't want to interfere.
"Well, I've never had a problem mixing business and pleasure."
Have you?
I do have some vacation time saved up and... a bikini I've been dying to wear.
Or not wear.
"Where are you going-- Bahamas, Caymans?"
Cuba.
Still interested?
When do we leave?
Hey.
"Just kidding, just kidding."
"The kid is sick, and a child's life will never come back once it's gone."
Child?
Whose child?
His child.
What about his wife?
She's not well and can't work.
Is that why you have to work as a stripper?
I can't understand how he could make you work for his child like that.
It's not for him.
I want to do it.
"People are going on and on about ""freedom"" these days, but I think I should have the freedom to give up my freedom to someone else."
Tomoko?
Good morning.
I was wondering where you were.
told me.
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you.
This is for you.
"Sensei, I can't take that."
"Ah, I hear Pertolucci."
I think Shinako is dancing.
It must be because I was talking about some really unpleasant things last night.
"Sensei, I'm going to dance my last ballet."
What an irritating racket for so early in the morning!
Is Shinako dancing?
"Yes, with Tomoko."
"Did you know that while you're dancing to Pertolucci, this is the anniversary of Nijinsky's death?"
"Yes, he died in a hospital in London last spring."
He went crazy and died.
You could say that he was a victim of the war.
"When he started to lose it, he was talking about ""Russia"" and ""War""."
"Well, Nijinsky was a pacifist, a follower of Tolstoy."
"He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth."
Xerxes was reborn a god.
Artemisia trusted no one.
So in the cover of night the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies.
All those he trusted
mall those who had raised him
mall those he had once looked to for counse were quickly introduced to her wrath.
And as the god-king stood before his people
Artemisia watched her ﬂawless manipulation take shape.
- For glory's sake
- For glory's sake
- for vengeance's sake - for vengeance's sake war.
war!
War is coming to Greece in the visage of a monster army over a million strong.
It should be little more than a formality for Themistokles the hero of Marathon to finish what he began.
Please!
We must appeal to Xerxes' reason!
Coward!
Athens is a city of cowards!
Shut your cock hole!
Shut your own!
I'll kill you!
Fuck the Spartans!
Fuck those muscle-bound boy-lovers!
Silence!
Silence for the hero of Marathon!
"This is a democracy, not a street fight."
Quiet!
It's Themistokles.
The Persian attack will come from both the north and the south.
The city-states should negotiate a truce.
"Yes, yes, we must negotiate."
Saira...
You stay here.
No!
Why did you target my prey?
Because Saiba was confronting a tiger with a dagger.
"The tiger didn't even have a dagger, Kaabir."
It's my duty to protect Saiba.
Paathar belongs to me.
You have to either drown or fly to reach here.
I don't want anyone's help.
It's beautiful.
I fear someone might cast an evil eye.
Kaabir... there's news that Muraaki Jilaan has set his eyes on our Paathar.
Jilaan?
"Muwaqqit, we wish to conquer the world..."
Why this sudden move towards measly Paathar?
"A world unseen, unheard and unapproachable..."
Muraakis are the ones who conquer them all.
Muraakis have dared to set their eyes on our Paathar.
Whether he rips the sky apart or makes his way through water...
Jilaan is destined to die in Paathar's waters.
If he was born on a no moon night... then we are that dark night.
"The one who dares to confront us, is headed to his destruction."
"Water should stay blue, not turn red."
Jilaan has sent just one Muraaki to fight us?
Just one.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
Either surrender before the full moon night or die.
Jilaan.
Saiba wishes to fight the war the warriors of Paathar couldn't?
"You don't just fight wars, you also strategize them."
"That it made me realize that, uh,"
"I need to be honest, too."
"I made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor,"
But I never quite realized until now that...
The greatest sacrifice of all
Was my family.
So the most important thing that I can say here tonight
"Is not to all of you,"
"But, uh, to them."
"I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you,"
And I promise to do everything in my power
"To make it up to you, to make it right again,"
Because I love you.
"My, oh, my."
Did Dr. Van Der Woodsen
Just make a public pass at Rufus' wife?
Looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries.
"Well, I guess you were right about William,"
"But it doesn't matter how he feels about me,"
Because I don't love him.
"I love you, Rufus."
"I know you're comfortable with him, Lil, but I'm not."
I need you to find another doctor.
"Look, I understand why you don't trust him,"
"But surely, you trust me."
"Look, I don't want to fight with you, Rufus."
"Okay, we'll put it aside till tomorrow."
Let's get you home. you know what?
"Right now, more than anything,"
"I just need a quiet night, alone."
Lily.
"Please, just for tonight,"
"- Well, who's bringin' it?"
- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
- Where do you want it?
"- Oh, shit."
This side.
Beat it!
I'm gonna check on this address.
"Ifthey don't know you, it's your ass."
- I thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We're goin' now.
Goodbye!
Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood."
Why don't you detach us?
"Give us a shot, at least till we find out ifthere's anything here."
Everybody wants Weinstock.
Maybe here's the lead we're looking for.
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin'.
You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs."
You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score.
"Big score, my ass!"
At best he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.
I wouldn't be infringing' on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already?"
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what's happened to you guys?"
And you're still acting like this?
"Then, I guess..."
I should investigate these invisible men for murder.
"If you're going to throw around accusations, at least make some sense!"
Or give us a name!
"Or why don't you bring some pictures, or any evidence at all?"
"Hey, follow him."
Officer!
Why are there no security cameras in this building?
Can you show me the footage from the elevator camera?
That camera...
it breaks every time we fix it.
So we gave up on it.
But I'm wondering if someone might be breaking it on purpose.
"Wow, seriously..."
Hey.
Why are you following me everywhere I go?
Are you worried I'm going to run away?
What do you mean?
Why would you run away when you didn't do anything wrong?
"Oh, geez..."
Joon Gi Moon?
The one who owned the sushi restaurant?
Did you know him?
"Then, the murder victim that Im Tae Ho was talking about..."
How did you know the victim?
- Park Seon Woo.
"- Oh, yes..."
"He was a colleague of mine, below me."
We were like blood brothers.
We also worked together once.
We were partners.
"What was that, uh, legal stuff that Audrey wanted to talk to you about this morning?"
Nothing.
Just estate planning.
[laughing]
"Hey, listen, uh, there's no reason we should both be here waiting for the check."
Why don't you go get the kids?
And I'll see you back at the place.
Sure.
[ting]
Cheers.
"Hey, guys."
So what are we celebrating?
You guys being perfect strangers this morning and now fast friends?
How are you planning on robbing Audrey?
"- No, no..."
"- No, no, no, no, Lance."
You got it all wrong.
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
"Okay, then, Cousin Pete, explain."
Let's hear a perfectly reasonable explanation for how you came to be sitting here celebrating with the man who just bought your grandmother's farm for a price that would be insultingly low if the place were currently on fire.
- Get you anything?
- I'm good.
Okay.
"Come on, fellas."
You're caught.
"You can waste time trying to deny it, or we start to talk about what it's going to take to get me not to turn you in."
Gentlemen.
Two years ago...
"I was going through security at Sea-Tac, and, uh, all of a sudden..."
this is long story sounding...
TSA goes ape shit.
"The, uh, airport cops are hauling ass towards us."
"Millington Associates are here to help."""
Not out of this office.
It could be worth your while.
I could cut you in.
No way.
"You need a Whizz, I need a Wii."
That's a perfect match.
Lovely melty car could be all yours.
All right.
But my cut comes off the top.
No more loud music and you make the coffee.
- Deal?
- Done!
Of course she's going to publish it herself.
"Well, she seemed very clear that she wasn't."
- And you believed her?
- That is neither here nor there.
"Legally, she can do what she likes."
Dr Goodyear's will leaves all the research to her.
Then we must contest the will.
"This is the curse of the ethical being, Peter."
The papers should be published.
They could be published if we had them.
Another man would simply take them and cut the Gordian knot in a moment.
- Uh...
"- And yet our own ethics, our code of conduct forces us to do nothing."
If only... if only there was another way!
There's the matter of you pulling your weight.
Time for Millington  Anderson to diversify.
"Anderson  Millington, and I've already had an idea, actually."
Free quotation on our will preparation service.
"This week only, no appointment necessary."
You have clearance.
"- Just launching the search for that spy ship, sir."
- Good.
What's the position regarding the monorail?
The sapper team have laid 18 charges in the tunnel.
They can be detonated either simultaneously or independently.
I suppose Leitz will expect a medal after this.
"Surface launch, Master."
What did I say?
"Slave, can you identify them?"
The heat pattern indicates three B 19 cruisers.
"Oh, come on, Avon."
Hit that button.
"That's a search formation, Avon."
They're not aligned for an attack.
So they're searching.
We're going to wait here till they find us?
Let's get out.
"They must have picked up Dayna and Tarrant, and realised we are up here somewhere."
"Slave, set the ship on an evasion pattern, maximum speed!"
- That's the first sensible...
- Just a minute.
This is Scorpio.
"Come in, Tarrant."
"Hold that order, Slave."
TARRANT:
"Soolin, we're almost finished here."
"Tell him if he doesn't get the hell out, we're certainly finished here."
SOOLIN:
"Tarrant, we think Scorpio has been spotted."
Teleport up now.
"I'm sorry, Soolin, we're not receiving you very clearly."
You make me laugh!
We make him laugh.
"well, you two are starting to worry us."
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
"You were chosen because you were 76-/- average, and after just a few days, you,re barely 44-/- average."
I was about to tell you:
"If you don,t stay above 50-/-, you won,t be here long."
"We,re not above 50-/-?"
"We,re not making this up."
"Think of your country, of yourselves, of everything we,ve done."
"It,d be a terrible waste."
"They,II make us pay for everything, just you wait!"
- Is that supposed to be irony?
"- Why, is it forbidden?"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Do you think you,re doing this all by yourself?"
Have you any idea what we must deal with?
Sometimes I wonder why we bother.
I thought scientists were much more patient.
At work we deal with relationships and statistics -
"Check 7 under ,aggressiveness.,"
"You,d put 7?"
",Check 7., There you go again!"
You want aggressiveness?
Let me handle this.
- Maybe 8.
"- Right, check 8."
Your colleague said 8.
Check that.
"Note, ,The couple find the technicians very amusing.,"
"personally, I,m very tired, and right now I really don,t find this amusing."
I wanted to hurt him.
I have my own life now.
And I don't trust him.
This is really not about me.
I never was.
It's all about him!
What now?
Will you report me?
No.
Don't worry.
Gentlemen.
- Is the collector here?
Of course.
This way.
The deeply-felt beauty of an object and the sorrow of its transitoriness.
"Accepting the fleeting nature of existence, understanding that the transitoriness of Creation bestows it with value is the foundation of Japanese culture."
Many collectors hide their pieces behind glass.
I prefer to let them hang freely.
It makes them come to life.
Our society is in a transition.
Instead of advancing away from the primitive...
We are drawn back to our base natures.
Some more than others.
"Stefan Kreiner, the junkie."
"Ironically, some of the most valuable artworks are on the most worthless bodies."
What's in there?
Everything needed to care for the tattoos.
- Skin care?
Interesting.
We should get down to business now.
I believe you have something with you.
The pinnacle of tattoo art.
Where's Bradley Walsh?
Is Bradley Walsh here?
APPLAUSE
"I think you'll find it's not daytime, it is access prime."
"That's what it is, very different."
"I'm sorry, access prime?"
Isn't that an account on Amazon?
"What time is that, Richard?"
"It's when non-middle-class people are home, but middle-class people haven't got home from work yet."
Ah!
"Middle-class people say, ""People who don't work watch your show."""
"You go, ""It's on at 5.15pm and most people finish work at 5pm"
"""and live quite near where they work."
"""Just cos you work in London"
"""and it takes you 4?"
"hours to get home to Northampton."""
"Someone's a bit touchy about their early start time, aren't they?"
"I can tell you, David Beckham is not one of our favourite Brits."
Aw.
"According to reports,"
"David Beckham's tax arrangements means he'll never get a knighthood, which is not even in the top five reasons I'm not getting one."
"OK, fingers on buzzers."
BUZZER
"OK, go on, what do you think?"
Is it the Queen?
"Fan of the Queen, Aisling?"
"Yeah, sure."
It's about time Britain gave her break.
"She's 91, she's been doing the same job for 65 years."
"I feel like she should do what all old women are allowed to do - grow out your chin hair, tour the Canaries on a boat, let a gas man in with an invalid ID."
Just...
I think that's what she deserves now.
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
"Well, fuck you."
"Next month I am going to buy another pair, but in red."
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
I have to be with my family.
"And besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
I am leaving.
See you next week.
Why so fast?
- Let's go please.
Damn it!
Tamales!
- What do you have?
Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
- Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you also want a sweet one?
- If you can give me credit until next time.
Thank you.
In Colombia a ten month old baby died... of an infection caused by rat bites.
The baby was malnourished and the mother informed... the authorities in her statement... that the baby's father committed suicide and left her alone with four kids.
The 10 year old was buried.
She was murdered by a neighbour who wanted to eat her
The victim 's family friends and classmates were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree.
The criminals have not been caught.
They decapitated two policemen in Mexico.
The heads were found at a site where police had killed drug dealers.
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."

"""Please come and see my father."
"""Sincerely yours, Clark. """
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, let's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"Surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
- How could he be my big brother?
- It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
Although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
To the brick Kremlin.
She'll never forgive me.
"Come on, Animal."
What are you serving today?
Nitric acid?
I only work here.
Talk to the management.
All right.
Mr. Management what are you trying to do?
Embalm us while we're still alive?
"What did you expect, eight-year-old bottled-in-bond?"
All the house guarantees is you don't go blind.
Blind?
Harry!
Harry!
"Harry, I'm blind, Harry."
"Harry, where are you?"
I can't see you.
"I'm blind, Harry."
Harry.
"Harry, I'm blind."
Blind?
"How stupid can you get, Animal?"
"The killer-differ, of course, the real bonanza was when Sefton put up the observatory."
He scrounged himself some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barracks 2 to put the whole shebang together for a pound of coffee.
"On a clear day, you could have seen the Swiss Alps."
Only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps?
"It was about a mile away, that Russian delousing shack but we were right on top of it."
It cost you a cigarette or a half-a-bar of chocolate a peek.
"You couldn't catch much through that steam but believe you me, after two years in that camp just the idea of what was behind that window sure spruced up your voltage."
Let's go.
Twenty seconds to a customer.
Got it?
Balloon jump?
"Look it up, Taffy."
What does it say?
"Oh, balloons."
The preliminary reports on the use of balloons for initial jumps are generally favourable.
"Due to the lack of the impact of the slipstream on the body, the tendency of the pupil to twist and somersault is almost eliminated."
That's nice.
The jumper has to fall a far longer distance before his parachute becomes fully opened.
This delayed opening produces an additional thrill.
You lucky people.
The phenomena known as a Roman Candle in which the parachute leaves the bag but fails to open in time...
"Lay off, will you?"
Canada?
Yeah?
"What's a ""Roman Candle""?"
A chute that doesn't open.
Did you ever see one?
"Yeah, I saw one."
What happened to the bloke?
"Got to sleep, will you?"
I'm bushed.
Miss?
"May I have another, please?"
What's wrong with this one?
"It's ex-tac, different from the others."
You're lucky.
It's what the pilots and instructors usually have.
"Change it, will you?"
"Hurry up, you."
"Well, the customer is always right."
"Though we do happen to pack about 50 parachutes a day, at least."
I'm calling the police!
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
"Woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, leslie stoltz,"
"And we think the male voice belongs to coop daly,"
Enright's security.
"I'm still working a timbre comparison,"
But I'm fairly certain it's a lock.
"Well, it's compelling evidence."
Puts daly in the room.
"Unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law."
Can we float it to potential jurors?
"The takeaway will be, cardoza's still a dirty cop."
"Wait a minute, what?"
"Murder case in l.A. , evidence didn't fit his theory,"
He made it disappear.
"Rebecca, accusations"
Were made- nothing was ever proven.
"Okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to miami,"
And so here we are again with cardoza's dirty evidence.
"My advice, horatio:"
Fire him.
Out of the question.
Suit yourself.
"But not only will I reject this evidence,"
I will reject all evidence
That cardoza has anything to do with.
He is compromising your lab.
"Well, then I have no choice but to clear his name."
Like what?
I don't know.
One of my favorite ones is the one about you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.
"Well, they have the decency to bury me, at least?"
Can't say.
Don't really keep track of the rumors I didn't start.
Got any rumors about me being made sheriff?
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna like you coming back.
"Well, he's gonna find he ain't got much room to argue."
Maybe I don't like you coming back.
"You know I always told you, you deserve better than this."
Marla.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
"Hey, how come that thing always stayed broken?"
Don't got a phone connection at my ma's old house anymore.
"Marla was good about looking after it, but..."
Use that one.
You ever hear anything about me getting murdered?
"Yes, sir, I believe I have."
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?
- Yeah.
- No kidding?
"Heard you was mouthing off like you used to, and... somebody just shot you right there how you stood."
"Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna welcome me back from the dead?"
Asshole.
Armor-piercing.
"- They call them ""cop killers."""
- Why is that?
On account of them killing cops.
"Do you need it for, like, DNA?"
Forensics lab is two weeks and 150 miles away from giving half a shit about this town.
"Like, for being too silly."
No!
Wayne.
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.
"Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up?"
It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly.
Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you.
They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly.
"And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like..."
"Like, wish you could still do that."
"That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon."
We sit the child down...
- That's another problem.
- What is?
- In my opinion.
- Sitting?
"Well, no wonder kids are failing' school, just sittin' around all day."
"Stand up, you're not doing nothin'."
You think sitting is a problem?
- Yeah.
- Why?
'Cause it makes you soft.
- Literally or figuratively?
"- Well, both, I suppose."
- Both?
- Yeah.
In my opinion.
My phone's buzzing.
"Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey?"
"Well, I think it's pretty good, too."
"Hi, Michelle."
/ Sure.
Bet he's got plenty of hands and other pieces stashed somewhere.
"Maybe he's dipping them in wax,"
- passing them off as sculpture.
- What?
A classic Vincent Price movie.
You gotta see it.
"""House of Wax"" (1958)"
I'd rather see here Bianco's hauling Mr. Dead body.
Hudson medical school?
I can't believe they'd hire a sleazoid like Bianco.
Looks like he's an outside contractor.
Does that jacket say UPS?
It says APS.
Anatomical procurement services.
Cooler's too small for our body.
He didn't have time to cut it up.
This is unacceptable.
The order was for 20 knees.
"Well, the students will just have to share."
My students are surgeons getting CME credit in advanced arthroscopic techniques.
These people are not accustomed to sharing.
"Actually, they won't be a problem."
"I'm sorry, there is no auditing of this course."
We're not here to audit the course.
We're here to audit the school supplies.
This medical school buys thousands of body parts.
"But I assure you, all the paperwork is in order."
"Where do you think you're going, Frankenstein?"
"Well, I just make deliveries."
I don't know where they come from.
"- Russ Bianco, you're under arrest."
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call..."
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
then how about you stay for the night?
"there's a good hot spring near by no, we'll be leaving"
I'll go let's go to hot spring
[Men] don't say you want to go

]
[from mom]
I think he's gonna be lonely lately

well he is my dad blood is stronger than water
I'm more worried about your future your vast vocabulary?
you don't sound like a kid so I think that there's a plan we can work out plan?
what?
new slogan?
I talked with hirano-san again and
"What, like you were honest with me, going behind my back"
To apply for the one thing I wanted more than anything?
The reason I couldn't talk to you earlier-
It's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.
"She's sick, and I don't know what's gonna happen."
It's not working exactly as I'd hoped.
I need you to write Lily another prescription.
I doubt the authorities
Would be pleased to know what you've been doing.
It's said that we're all strapped to fortune's wheel...
Nowhere is this truer
Than the ever-changing landscape of love.
As one couple enjoys an upswing...
Another is plunged downwards.
"But top or bottom, don't get too comfortable,"
Because the one thing you can rely on
Is that the wheel will keep on turning.
"All right, I'm heading to my mom's for breakfast."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You're coming in late and leaving early all week.
I'm starting to feel cheap.
"Oh, I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately."
Just with everything going so well with my dad-
"Hey, Serena, no worries."
Okay?
Mm.
"Look, I love being your crash pad,"
"But, you know, maybe you'd feel better if you moved back in"
With your mom while she's getting her treatment.
And have to see Jenny's lying face first thing in the morning?
"No, thank you."
I couldn't sleep myself.
"Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find Beatrix here but I want you to believe..."
"All I can believe is that your ideas are not normal, Jekyll, not fit..."
"Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix to come here tonight because..."
"No, Harry."
"Father, I know my being here is difficult to understand, but I'm not ashamed."
"Then, my dear, I shall be for you, because I do understand."
We leave for the Continent tomorrow on the boat train.
"Father, please."
"Oh, come, Sir Charles."
"After all, you could eliminate all this difficulty if you'd set an early date for our marriage."
You don't understand.
We're very much in love.
We wanna be together.
- We don't wanna wait any longer.
"- Please, Father."
"In view of what's happened, the engagement should be broken off."
"However, I'll be lenient."
We shall see you on our return.
"Come, my dear."
"Father, I've never disobeyed you in my life."
"But, Harry, if you don't want me to leave I'll refuse."
- Beatrix.
"- I mean it, Father."
"I don't want you to go, Bea and I can't agree with your father's decision, but I know he's thinking of your happiness."
I can't argue against that and I can't ask you to.
"- That's highly commendable, Harry."
Will you see us off at the train?
Better have two engines.
I might try to hold it back.
Try.
Try anyway.
The Cult... of Solon.
Splendid.
"Yes, uh, the Cult, or descendents of the Cult, uh, lived peacefully in England for hundreds of years, and that is until the Romans invaded and then they were hunted down and slaughtered."
"But a few... survivors escaped, uh, with the Ark and the Torch, and sailed from England."
And came to these catacombs.
And then died.
But not before hiding the Torch somewhere down here.
I'd bet my life on it.
"Them's some pretty high stakes, professor."
"Let's hope you don't lose that bet, huh?"
"Oh, relax, my boy."
The soldiers don't even know the catacombs are here.
Colonel Petrovic...
Well...
Wa...
This must be the oldest part of the catacombs.
These must be the remains of early Christians who hid from the Romans.
"Over centuries, others followed, like the Cult..."
of Solon.
"Professor, please."
"Let's skip the lecture, find what we came for and get out of here."
There's a civil war going on upstairs.
"Oh, nonsense, United Nations ordered a cease-fire."
"Yeah, well, I don't think they care."
"Oh, these people never got on."
They've been waging war amongst themselves since the 12th century.
"When I find the Torch of Truth, we can use it to continue Solon's quest, and find the Treasure of Atlantis, and there won't be any more wars."
I can feel it.
I know it.
We're close.
Professor...
The Sigma.
"Well, I don't think that the sky should be the limit."
But I do think that... magazines offer an escape in innovation and...
I hope to always hope to find fantasy and novelty...
- on the pages of Skirt.
"- Thank you, just as I thought."
"Thank you, but fantasy doesn't come cheap, sweetheart."
"Please, I don't wanna hear the ""c"" word."
"- Hello, darlings."
- Don't you dare throw that away.
Don't you know people are starving at Vogue?
- Take it.
"- Jocelyn, did you finish testing... all of the mousse in the closet?"
"I was almost done, I just wanted to grab a bite."
"Charmingly naive, but don't you think problems are so important... that you shouldn't take time for lunch?"
"Besides... if you haven't noticed, these are all editors."
"Take it easy, Antoniette."
Be nice to her She's the best intern you've ever had.
Over here!
I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.
You blew it.
They got you again.
"Cock-sucking, hussie, cocks'n pants..."
"I know, but I need your help."
Is there gonna be another leak?
"- And if so, what's story?"
"- Think deeper, think FDR."
"East River Drive, traffic jams..."
- squeegee boys.
- Think deeper...
- think tacky blond bombshell.
- Sharon Stone.
"The killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control the gunrunning business in London."""
Where are you from again?
Hampshire CID.
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allowed Jacob Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for certain strategic reasons is information you might want to lose from your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Well, I must admit, talking to yourself and others, it seems your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner not Simmonds.
Have you seen that film?
What film?
The Untouchables.
Great film.
It's a great film.
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"They put one of ours in a hospital, we put one of theirs in a morgue."
- Right
- Iain...
A green light's on in the car like a little green exclamation mark.
Probably needs a service.
It's brand new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
Do you want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
So what's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
"Right there, it's good."
All right.
"My brother Drew loved karate, and he didn't take lessons."
"All he had to do was see somebody do something, and then he could copy it."
"Today, you'd call that a ""music producer."""
Chris!
"Breathe, breathe!"
Ahhhh...
What are you doing?
Practicing karate.
What are you going to do with karate?
My father didn't see the reason of learning anything that didn't get you a job.
"So how's school, Chris?"
"You working on anthropology or paleontology, something complicated, I bet."
My mother thought I was learning all kinds of things 'cause I went to a white school.
"Nope, it's just regular arithmetic."
Y'all hear that?
White kids are working on arithmetic.
"Around here, they're still doing math."
My mother always thought bigger words meant something better.
"Okay, say the blessing, baby."
Where's the meat?
We don't have any.
Didn't you buy some porchops?
"No, that meat was too expensive."
I know we got some canned Spam or some Vienna sausage or bacon...
or beef jerky.
"Some... mean, what kind of meal is that without meat?"
It's a vegetarian meal.
Do I look like a vegetarian to you?
I work 60 hours a week.
I lift papers and boxes all night.
[ Chuckles ] As long as it's not something impossible.
"I don't blame you for being angry at me, but unless you find Diane by tomorrow night,"
I'll have to decline the nomination.
"Come on, Mr. Caine."
What's she got on you?
"She, uh--She worked in a club on Hotel Street before the war."
She was a hooker?
She was also my wife.
[ Magnum Narrating ] It sounded like something out of a bad Robin Masters novel.
"In fact, for a second, I thought the whole thing might've been one of Robin's jokes."
"But Robert Caine was a nominee to the Supreme Court, even if I did think he might be lying through his judicial teeth."
"Besides, driving a Ferrari, it couldn't hurt to know a judge."
"I'm sorry, sir."
You wanna fill me in?
"About a week after my nomination, I received a telegram."
"It read, """"Congratulations, Bobby."" It was signed, """"Love, Diane."""
- You sure it was from her?
- Positive.
"The wire came from Honolulu, and she's the only Diane I've ever known."
Did she ask for money?
Diane would never do that.
Things were different between us.
She was different.
Special.
We were married.
I don't care how long ago it's been.
Diane would never blackmail me.
"I don't understand the problem, sir."
Why don't you call the president and accept the nomination?
I don't dare take the chance.
- When's the last time you saw her?
- A few hours before the Japanese... bombed Pearl Harbor.
"They tell me you've broken the code, Dr. Sengupta."
Yes.
The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby correspond to the locations of his bombs.
"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,"
"""Beard"" for beard beach, and ""Grace..."""
Was grace cathedral.
Genius.
There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco Police Department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.
Lives will be saved.
Alcatraz proving itself to be once again the crown jewel of American penal sciences.
"Milton, don't skulk out there like a common ferret."
It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague.
Genius.
Doctor.
I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes, but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice, my Don't overstep."
"Rebecca, there he is."
Walk me to him.
"Doc, stay here."
Call Tanner.
You got it.
I know he was dead.
"You bastard,you killed him!"
"ziva,get her out of here."
Mcgee.
Handcuff him and get a sworn statement.
I hope you fry!
Go to hell Go to hell.
Wow.
"I got to come up here more often gibbs,I screwed up."
"Well,yeah."
You almost spilled my coffee.
"When tony and i ran out to pick up jody, I left finn's bag of gold on my desk."
Mm-hmm.
"I know I should've taken to evidence, but we were focusing on... here's the inveory."
You took it to evidence.
"It says re the bag contained $18,000 worth of gold."
"We are $60,000 short."
You gave siri and rebecca back the money they loaned finn.
I thought I'd save the courts some paperwork.
You wouldn't be getting soft?
Of course not.
You shaved your moustache.
"Uh,boss,reception called this morning, they said that seone was here with information about sorry about a case."
"I went to meet her,and,um,this is jessica coleman,james finn's fiancee. ncis Season 4 Episode 5"
It's a great neighborhood.
"Very quiet, very private."
"There's an oversized backyard, that's a big plus."
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.
"Stainless appliances, air purification system, total move-in condition."
"The furniture is rented, but if you like it,I can have the company make you a deal."
Come to the window
"All those windows out there, I'm behind one of them"
What do you want?
I've had it I'm getting out
"Don't leave me, Elizabeth"
Where are you going?
Somewhere you'll never find me
I'll find you I don't give up
"Sweet dreams, Elizabeth"
How many?
Two thousand tenants.
Fascinating.
"In addition, we can handle up to 5,000 visitors a day."
That's a lot of people to have over for drinks.
"You have 80 miles of wiring, piping, cables..."
- In this apartment?
"- No, over the whole building."
That's a relief.
There's a restaurant in the foyer which serves what we consider the finest seafood.
We also have a gift shop and a wedding chapel.
- Mother will like that.
"- Oh, Mother wants you married, huh?"
Mother wants herself married.
It's looking pretty good now that she's got this aluminum siding salesman from Toronto.
I think they're going to move here.
She wants to be close to me.
Maybe we can show her one of our two-bedroom apartments.
"Well, I'm afraid not."
I was lying.
No aluminum siding salesman.
No mother.
I've developed this strange sense of humor and it sometimes gets me into trouble.
"Thank you, sahib."
"- Hello, boy."
"- Hello, mate."
"You're alive, anyway."
What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
"So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter."
"Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop."
Where's the troop?
"There's no troop, and the Guru has us."
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
"I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!"
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame?
They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
"- You didn't tell them, did you?"
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero.
Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
"- Untie him, will you?"
- Yes.
Untie me.
I said untie him!
"Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!"
"You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you."
No.
Nothing odd going on here.

Dr. Desmond.
"Tell me, Guardian, what part of no interruptions did you not understand?"
A G-Gnome on Sub-Level 26 reports three intruders.
-Ugh.
Did I miss a perimeter breach alert?
-No.
Then the G-Gnome's confused.
Whatever might occur in our faux lab above ground the real Cadmus is the most secure facility in D.C.
My job to keep it that way.
Fine.
Take a squad.
Might I recommend Guardian leave his G-Gnome behind?
If violence should occur....
-The little guy would be in my way.
-No.
The advantage of instant telepathic communication outweighs other concerns.
I need my G-Gnome with me at all times.
"Okay, I'm officially whelmed."
This is how they hide this massive underground facility from the world .
The real Cadmus isn't on the grid.
It generates its own power with these things.
Must be what they're bred for.
Even the name is a clue.
The Cadmus of myth created a new race by sowing dragon's teeth into the earth.
And this Cadmus creates new life too.
Let's find out why.
They call them Genomorphs.
Look at the stats on these things.
"Super-strength, telepathy, razor claws."
"- I'm sorry, but the line has fallen."
My speech.
I'll handle it Before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
This speech will write it alone.
"We must first analyze the political, diplomatic and protocol aspects"
"With the head of the cabinet, which is now unreachable."
And with the various federal ministers.
I'm not sure which ones.
"Sire, now we have to watch every movement and gesture, every word."
"Be cautious, sire."
"Faster, faster."
"When the king made his oath, he promised"
To always protect the integrity of the kingdom.
And that King is me.
Unity is strength.
Unity is strength.
We have to put it.
"Carlos knew that I steal hidden pictures, but he let me do it."
Carlos liked me.
Some have a vision.
Others have a dream.
"What does intuition tell you, sire?"
- My intuition?
Perhaps this is the time to show who really is.
"His feelings, his humor, perhaps his faults."
Defects have already been largely occupied by the press.
Nicolas the Silent?
Silence is dignified.
Let them write what they want.
- Sire.
Sire.
I always said you were my brightest student.
It worked.
All living things contain carbon.
"In fact, the term ""organic"" is often defined as"
"""containing carbon."""
"One carbon isotope present in all living forms is carbon-14, which has a half-life of 5,730 years."
"Meaning in that amount of time, half the carbon-14 of a dead organism will decay."
"By measuring the ratio of the remaining carbon-14, we can determine the life of an organic sample, such as the cloth of an Egyptian mummy, or the ashes of a caveman's fire."
Tomorrow I'll demonstrate this process in the university lab.
Hiya.
MacGyver.
Is it really you?
I think so.
"How are you, Kelly?"
I didn't think I'd see you again after you left Thera.
"What's it been, four years?"
Five.
Ah.
"This is for you, teach."
Are you finally flirting with me?
Um...
"Actually, it's a bribe."
I need your help.
Funny.
Didn't think you needed anyone's help.
You'd be surprised.
What is that?
Some kind of oxidized matter.
"Yeah, it's off an artifact Professor Atticus and I found."
"""Atlantis"" Atticus?"
"My grandfather still talks about him, none too fondly, I might add."
"Yeah, I'll bet."
"And people were throwing things,"
Yelling and screaming and so forth.
"After Duke's 21-20 win in the 1966 acc tournament,"
Smith's offense was ridiculed.
But that didn't stop him from using it --
Even if his players hated it.
The score at half time is 7-0.
"Not football, this is north Carolina basketball versus Duke basketball."
The score is 7-0 at half time.
The score is 7-0 at half time.
You could look it up.
"After the game, reporters come in."
"""Mike, what about the first half, the stall?"""
"""Quite frankly, I didn't want to stall, he did!"""
Pointing to coach Smith.
I get a call.
It's a Sunday.
I get a call.
"""Coach Smith wants to see you in the office."""
"""Oh, shoot."""
"So, I go in, and he sits me down."
"So, I go in, and he sits me down."
"He says, ""Mike, you know, we feel like we have a very successful program here at north Carolina, and we win a lot of games, and we feel we do it the right way."""
"He says, ""listen --"
"I'll do the coaching, you do the playing."""
"""Yes, sir, coach."""
Walked out of there.

I'm siding with Ussing.
I hope you understand.
"The public prosecutor was reluctant, but Ussing insisted strongly."
Step down of your own accord or we'll have to withdraw our support.
We're looking for someone who may have been close to Louise.
- She only had us.
- Did anyone else see her that day?
One of your colleagues called to ask about the same things an hour ago.
"Why would the perpetrator use your name, if he doesn't know you?"
- Was Special Branch involved in this?
- I wasn't involved in that case.
- Why don't you believe me?
- What are you talking about?
You shut everyone out.
"Me, us, your son."
No one's allowed into your life.
Her bike got broken that morning.
I think that's why she got a lift.
There was a man in a black car.
Those are all his notebooks.
He's crazy about car registrations.
- Where does that road lead?
- To a closed boat builder's yard.
That looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.
This is where she was taken.
Borch took the boy's book with license plate numbers this morning.
It was you and Special Branch who erased everything about the black car.
- I'm not discussing this.
- Why is that book important?

- Hey.
- I know you.
Do you know where he is?
I don't.
"Do you, like, live here now?"
I still have the keys.
"No, now I live in a depressing faculty apartment."
How is the college?
It's fine.
I assumed he'd be here.
- Seems I was mistaken.
"- Yeah, that makes two of us."
"Hey, you can stay if you want to."
That won't be necessary.

'Melanie embodied the high cost of isolation and detachment from loved ones.
"'Unable to stand it any longer,"
'Philip excused himself and returned to his pitiful life at the college.'
Tell him I was here.
Your little protégé stopped by yesterday.
"He's not a protégé, he's a..."
He's a friend.
I still haven't read his book.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
My copy is in the city.
Should I read it?
"Well, it is remarkable."
Wait.
"Look, they only had a few seconds."
It wasn't enough time to get an exact location.
We're fine for a little while.
Where are you going?
I have to stop a train.
I-80 is secured from Cheyenne to Grand Island.
We now control the area between Kearney and Hastings.
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.
There are organized road gangs controlling much of the interstate.
I've also been told by a patient in our medical unit to expect a significant skirmish between two towns in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.
What is the location of those towns?
"CZ-12, Quadrant Four."
We've tracked the terror suspect to within 200 miles of that area.
Capture of this suspect is a top priority for President Tomarchio and the administration.
Do you understand?
"Should I re-prioritize, sir?"
Immediately.
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.
"Once the area's clear, we will begin our search for the terrorists"
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
She can't cook;
she's never seen nine innings of baseball in her life;
she hates my clothes... but I love her.
And I'm happy.
"Jake, I don't want to die today."
You're gonna make it out of here.
That I promise.
Hawkins!
I led the others.
I shot out your mirror machine.
Did you think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
I took that chance.
I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
"Oh, then you do admit to the charges?"
"Yes, anything!"
Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
Uhh!
You pompous--
Immaterial!
Those people have done you no harm.
Inadmissible!
"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
Silence!
This trial is over.
You are guilty.
"On all counts, you are guilty."
"According to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment."
"You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!"
"Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.3."
First Officer Spock reporting.
Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us.
Waiting time is almost up.
I willsoon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions.
"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was."
I did it.
I was angry.
I actually experienced genuine rage.
This experiment has been successful.
I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
"Why, Captain, you're still angry."
What are you drinking?
Water.
Seriously?
"If it was a joke, would it be funny?"
"No, no, I mean, to each his own."
We interrupt this game to bring you this breaking news story right now.
"Jim O'Bannon, host of The O'Bannon files, a sometimes controversial news and opinion show viewed by millions, was found dead just minutes ago outside a downtown restaurant."
At this time...
Barkeep.
...police tell us that apparently he was shot to death at close range alongside two of his bodyguards.
Jim O'Bannon was 58.
We now return you back to the game.
"So Jim O'Bannon, huh?"
"That's kind of crazy, him getting killed."
"Him being a big TV star and all, don't you think?"
Fame doesn't make you invincible.
"Yeah, and I always thought he was a bit of a jackass, but nobody deserves to die, you know."
I'm Allan.
How you doing?
"What is this, some kind of fag bar?"
"No, I was just..."
I'm sorry.
"I was just trying to make some friendly conversation, that's all."
"It's like I got ""Everlast"" stamped across my face, man."
Like a human punching bag.
"Can I have another one, please?"
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
"Whatever, man."
It's cool.
"When I spoke to you earlier,"
I must have given off the impression that I was game for conversation.
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.
I then inventoried Finn's personal items.
Got anything with a date on it?
Nope.
Sorry.
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a cash guy.
His clothes were Dockers from Sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large, the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear, Gibbs."
"You're fishin', Ab"
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer, have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes, Doctor."
"Well, let's  plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
Agent Gibbs will be here soon and he will ask...
"How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try, ""When did he die?"""
That's my next question.
"That, I can answer."
It's....a......... ... tricky calculation.
"One has to factor in temperature, soil acidity, and the  variety and volume of insects who now call Lance Corporal Finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days, with a three-percent margin of error."
It would appear you deserted before you died.
really?
"well, you know that wink's gonna die, and you're gonna get promoted."
- i can't believe wink never promoted me.
he promised.
"baby, he promised."
- what a loser!
"you know, i thought, of all the losers in all the different trailer parks, that wayne was gonna be different."
"- he would've been, too, but behind every great man is a great woman."
- are you saying i ain't a great woman?
- you think it was better for him to buy you a harley than to go to college?
- it was for me.
"- oh, look around."
you really think that this was better for you in the long run?
- let me guess -- that's me in the box.
i ain't afraid of dying.
- look around.
funeral parlor's pretty empty.
- so?
it's not like i'd be around to care.
"though, actually, i did think wayne might be here."
he was pretty good about obligations.
- wayne died a year ago.
saw a commercial for i.t.t. technical college and began crying so hard his throat done closed up and couldn't get no more air.
strange occurrence.
suffocated to death.
- hmm.
see?
look.
somebody loves me.
here comes bob.
"he's always good about obligations, too."
"- i have laid awake many a night, thinking to myself,"
Indeed.
"The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass."
Now it will guide us to your land.
"Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass."
"Once we get it, steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way."
How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
All I need is a ride back.
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
Then we'd better start climbing.
Right.
So...
(Chuckles)
I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders.
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, milady."
(Whooshing tinkle) I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
So... which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?
Hmm?
Go on.
Fight it out.
"Don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
"(Horns blare in distance, indistinct conversations)"
(Horn honks)
(Door squeaks)
(Clanks)
(Engine starts)
(Engine revving)
(Shifts gears)
Impressive.
She said she saw them from the skylight.
"Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here."
"Yup, here we go."
This is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
Boom.
"So get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools."
And there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
Nelson was lying to his wife.
He also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
Maybe he had something going on the side?
"Confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements--"
- I want to know what else he was hiding.
- Done.
What are you working on?
The blood we found on Nelson's roof.
"I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human."
Take a look.
"Cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal."
It's a very large animal with claws and scales.
"The blood comes from an alligator, Mac."
Mr. Potato Head.
The live versision.
More like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato head as a boy.
I would time myself.
See how long it took to assemble him.
Some would say I was obsessed.
"You, obsessed?"
No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
Looks like some ki of jewelry.
It's an acupressure magnet.
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
I have heard the cry of my brothers goin' down could not turn away
I could hear no other sound
I have watched the pain through my wounded eyes but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
and the anger of the night
I remember it so well beneath the midnight sun lord I walked the edge of hell kept all those memories in a wounded mind
but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
they say there's a reason
I'm told there is a rhyme but tell me who will answer who will pay this time
I was left with a wounded soul but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore.
Michael Jefferson.
"And for your time, forty hours."
"Amount, 207."
"State tax, $17.00."
"Witholding tax, $32.25."
"Here you go, Michael."
"This week, there's a little raise."
You're a good worker.
I wish it could be more.
"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
"Hey, Mike, what's goin' on?"
"Hey, how you doin', John, buddy?"
"How about some coffee, man?"
Who's buyin'?
"Well, uh, I will, if, uh, you push this down to stall 34."
You're on.
I knew I could convince you.
She must be really pretty?
Who does she look like?
She doesn't really look like anyone.
Hmm...
What kind of person is she?
- Hmmm.
Like a fairy?
- Fairy?
"Ah, no, well."
"Calling her a fairy is a bit of an exaggeration, but, like she's out of reach?"
"After meeting her, I thought nothing else would do for me."
Many things happened before reaching this point.
Hmm..
"But, you know."
"Confessing one week before Christmas, and instantly ""Ok""."
"That girl broke up with her boyfriend right before that, right?"
"Well, yes."
"Since she became alone just before the event, it feels like she just went along with it for the time being."
Are you fine with that?
"If you put it like that, I have my selfish calculations too."
I told her then because I knew about her situation.
I see.
I know about it all.
But it's okay.
"Anyway, because Saeko-san is my girlfriend now."
You've become really good at tempering.
You don't even need a thermometer.
- I can just tell by how the texture feels.
"Its heaviness changes according to its temperature, right?"
"Alright, right now its 28 degrees."
"Ever since I was a kid, I vaguely thought I would probably continue with the family cake shop, it wasn't something I took seriously."
I found how I wanted to shape my life after meeting Saeko-san.
There were nights
I remember them
I will carry them till the end of my days
On the way
Between Deganiya and Kinneret
Stood the loaded cart of my life
He came up to me and said:
"Listen to me, little one"
I built a house for you
In the evening you'll embroider a shirt for me
By day I will drive your cart
What's wrong?
I had a dream about Zeltzer.
Who's Zeltzer?
"Zeltzer, the lighting guy."
He worked for years in the theater.
I wonder if he still works there.
I dreamt that Zeltzer turned the spotlight on my pants.
And I insist that I want it only on my shoes.
And he insists that the audience won't be able to see it.
"And I repeat: ""Only the shoes, not the pants."""
He gets mad and says that no one will see the shoes.
"So I pull him off the ladder and go up there myself, turn the light only on his shoes, but he walks away, leaving me alone."
Suddenly I see Mommy walking on the chairs.
Floating.
Then she comes up to me and lifts me in the air.
"""Direct me, direct me."""
I tell her that first I want to turn the spotlight on her shoes.
"She stands under the ladder,"
I turn the spotlight and she says:
"""Will you direct me?"
"""Will you direct me?"""
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
"It's weird how something has to happen sometimes, , , to see how you actually feel about something,"
"Sit down, M r."
"Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"I n that case it was true, but..."
Who to?
Admiral Jackson is in command of the squadron blockading Rochefort.
"Sail Defiant to Rochefort, is that what you're asking?"
"Sail her up to the squadron, alongside English men-of-war?"
"Yes, I am asking you to do that if you care for the safety of your country."
If you don't wish to see her humiliated and overrun by Frenchmen.
"- Well, what will become of us?"
- How can I promise anything?
Their lordships at the Admiralty do not encourage mutiny.
- It was never intended this way.
"- What way, then?"
A petition?
I see.
Bit late for petitions now.
"All right, we'll sail to Rochefort."
"- Lf we do, will you stand by us?"
- I'll do my best for you.
All of you.
I'll submit all the facts in your favour.
But I warn you if any harm comes to a single officer...
A single officer.
I understand.
"Very sorry you lost the arm, sir."
He's promised to speak for us when the time comes.
Can we trust him?
"What, trust an officer?"
- To hell with England!
- I've got a family back home!
I don't want Frenchmen tramping through my house.
"Sergeant, watch him."
All our lives depend on this.
"For the present, we're agreed."
That is a king's caliber.
"Hey, lady."
You hurt?
You're the ringleader behind this revolt?
"You've gotten the better of me, Rear Admiral Klom."
I wasn't expecting you to reach here so quickly.
Answer the question!
Rear Admiral Klom?
"Then, this man is Crimson Fingered Claugh?"
- Depending on your answer...
"- You'll kill me, right?"
I never thought Sion needed you anyway.
You don't see the burden he bears.
You're the one who isn't qualified to serve him.
I don't need any qualifications to be at Sion's side!
"For the sake of the path he treads, I will kill Lady Noa Ehn and the hostages."
If you continue to stand in my way...
You think you can do it?
A simple matter.
No!
That power is...
"For the sake of the people of Estabul, we cannot lose this man..."
- Let there...
- We mustn't!
Froaude!
"Colonel Froaude, if you must kill the hostages to completely conquer Estabul then I'll persuade them."
"The people, the soldiers..."
I'll get them to follow Roland!
What are you saying?
I think that will be far more effective than killing the hostages and ruining Estabul's reputation.
Indeed.
You are quite popular with the people of Estabul.
"Oh, man."
"""As your sectional manager,"
"""I've been asked to inform you that your employment has been terminated."
"""The following violations have been logged by HR."
"""On the 5th June, CCTV caught you going into a woman's locker room"
"""and pleasuring yourself over Sandra's knickers."
"""On 5th July you drove your police panda car"
"""into Tony's Volvo in the staff car park"
"""and then jumped on the bonnet screaming,"
"""'Screw you Tony, you think"
"""'your dick's so big, you think my wife likes your dick more than mine."
"""'Sob sob.' Please hand your badge and your gun in,"
"""you'll be escorted from the building immediately."""
"What, you're..."
"What, are you, are you joking?"
"No, I'm sorry."
This isn't my...
"I don't, I don't know you, I've never met you before."
"He told me to, he told me you were leaving after 20 years of police service."
What sort of way is this to break this kind of news to someone?
"I know, it's shit, man."
HE LAUGHS
Are you taking the piss?
Have you just...?
Because it's his first day.
First day?
Taking the piss?
"Flipping heck, mate, you had, right, so, so it's a joke then, is that it?"
No.
Isn't it?
"Still sacked, I'm afraid, Sid,"
I just thought I'd let Dermot hit the ground running.
What?
Her body was found the day before your dad died.
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
ls there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
- Not that I can think of.
- Miss Lau has answered your questions.
- I'd like to draw this to a close.
"- You're right, Miss Lau."
I did know your father and you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't the son of man that scares easily but someone had him on the run.
"- If you say so, Harry."
- Yet you...
You seem completely unaffected through all of this.
Cool as a cucumber.
Why is that?
I don't like the direction you're taking.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
- If you're not charging my client...
"- What did they promise you, Lily-Anne?"
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)
"What is your desire, master?"
"Okay, that is a long list, but for now, if you noticed anything unusual the other night, when the families viewed the evidence, that would be a great start."
"Come to think of it, there was this one thing."
The new haircut is dreamy.
"Look, there's not a single thing funny about this, so sit down and shut up."
"All right, what do you got?"
The jewelry went poof.
Never made it to the lockup.
Did you see anyone hanging around that cart?
Sorry.
"Long gone to eBay, bro."
Get your piece of a bona fide sociopath.
You know what I'm not?
- What?
- Surprised.
I'm having serious concerns about the integrity of law enforcement right about now.
And the crapstorm keeps on coming.
"Victim's brother was at a wedding in Carmel, and he's in all the pictures."
He didn't shoot DeBray?
Came home and found his motorcycle stolen.
It's not revenge.
It's a partner.
What?
"I got to go, but new haircut is dreamy."
Roll the citizen video.
They're just loading DeBray's body on the gurney.
Can you stop right there?
"Hey, guys."
Do you got anything good here for me?
"Hitandrun, worked with specialneeds kids, won Teacher of the Year..."
great humaninterest story.
Not for us.
"A street prophet, if you will."
I got to change microphones.
- What?
- I gotta fix the mike.
It'll just take a second.
I gotta get that...
Back off!
"Back off, will you!"
That's dangerous!
"Get-Get down, you stupid little nothing!"
- What is this?
- What?
I don't believe this.
"This is Frank Smuntz, Channel 12 San Diego Evening News... riding in the thick of the police high-speed chase."
"As you can see, Channel 12 is the first newscast to get a close-up look... into the face of this runaway horror."
"If we're lucky, we're hoping to get a visual conformation on the condition of the hostage."
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss!
Can you give us a thumbs-up if you're okay?
"- Right here, pal."
- Can we show that on TV?
"Uh, Frank?"
Frank?
"Um, it appears we've lost our feed there from Frank Smuntz... riding right alongside that speeding BMW."
- Lolly.
"- Thanks, Steve."
I think before we continue we should take a moment to apologize to our viewers... for that obscene gesture you just saw coming from the window of that speeding car.
Yes.
"That's the risk we take with live TV, isn't it, Lolly?"
That's right.
We'll be back with more live coverage... of Kidnapped At 100 Miles Per Hour... after these messages.
"Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends."
"Warm regards, nigga."
"O.G. Stinkmeaner."""
"By the way, you're not exactly the same as the original."
There were some enhancements.
"Hey, kids, welcome to the nigga moment reboot!"
This is where we're gonna do some shit we already did and just pretend you didn't see that shit the first time!
"That's right, nigga!"
We don't respect your intelligence!
"Hey, and welcome to ""Cooking with Stink!"""
"We're whipping up a nigga moment today, and here's what you'll need to make one at home!"
"First, you'll need two black men, age 5 to 122."
You can find these pretty much everywhere!
I've got two right here!
Then add one minor incident.
"Could be an errant look, incidental contact."
I prefer the classic shoe step myself.
After that you just need 25 years of
"The movie ""Scarf ace,"" which teaches irrational thinking."
Don't forget to stir in the crack!
And mwah!
Voil?
Delicioso!
"The best thing about nigga moments is, they never stop!"
"Every day for niggas is like ""groundhog day""!"
"Yeah, nigga!"
I hit your car just 'cause I wanted to!
I didn't even want to park in that space!
I just wanted to fuck your car up and then wait here to tell you I did it!
- What you gonna do?
!
- No!
- Two old dudes about to fight!
"She was very nice, your girl."
"Yes, she is."
She's very nice.
"So like I said, I just want to cross a couple of T's, little stuff."
It's all just part of the process.
"By the way, sir, I was real impressed with your graciousness..."
- on the whole Senator Hanson thing.
- Oh?
"You know, in supporting her."
Real gracious.
"Well, as you know, I withdrew my name from consideration."
Right.
Right.
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.
How long have you known her?
"- Oh, well, actually, I don't really..."
- I'm sorry.
"When you said, ""Anybody that knows her""..."
- I know people who know her.
- Uh-huh.
"- I'm happy to give you their names, if you'd like."
- Great.
"I don't really know her, but I've seen her several times at functions... and, uh, I think she'll do a real good job."
"Sir, can I just say that..."
I was really hoping you'd go for the position... especially after what happened on the Apachaway.
"I think people would think, in the back of their minds..."
"""This here's a guy who takes risks when the right thing's at stake."""
- Lifesaver?
"- No, thanks."
"Anyway, some real bad luck, your being right there."
Not if I'd been able to save her.
This team's not the Colts.
"The Colts are in the NFL, these... whoevers, they're in the Canadian Football League."
I find the CFL's game very entertaining.
It's a souped-up version of the American classic.
"The field is what, 120 yards long, with 35 yard in-zones, that's not a football field, Munch, that's the golf course at Oakmont Green."
"Their game's for speed and mobility, not three yards in a cloud of dust."
"I say, if you're gonna imitate an American sport, do it like Americans."
They don't wanna play our game.
That's why they invented their own.
"Then let them play it, but we're in America."
"I mean, we shouldn't be playing their version here."
That's a sacrilege.
That flies in the face of Balto football history.
Some tradition!
The owner packs up the team and sneaks off in the night.
"What's up, fellas?"
Stan's on a tear about the Canadian Football League.
It ain't the Canadians.
What's wrong with American sports is you type of Americans.
What type is that?
"The type who don't remember the heroes, who don't believe in miracles anymore."
"Yeah, the type who bet against Buffalo winning the Superbowl."
- You done with the sports page?
- Yeah.
Even God wouldn't bet on the Billys.
Frank?
Where'd you wander off to?
I just had a little one on one with a potential witness.
A witness in the Marilyn Callisto murder?
Mm-hm.
What'd they say?
As usual... he was silent.
Babs.
Call me Babs.
Or Coach.
Or whatever makes you feel comfortable.
Never.
I will never call you Coach because I promise you I am never going to enter that contest.
"Well, what about T.C. and saving the Island Hoppers?"
What about Roger and me?
"I mean, this whole deal depends on your entering this contest."
- I mean...
- Good morning.
"I am sorry about all that, believe me, and I'd do anything for T.C..."
"anything else, I mean."
Oh.
And maybe we can work something out about finding Roger.
"Oh, no, I could never accept charity."
"Well, then pay me later, but just don't talk to me about this contest."
"Ah, the contest."
"The excitement, the anticipation, the agony."
"Now, here are the items you requested, courtesy of the household account."
"Protein powder, vitamins with an emphasis on """" B"" complex, tuna for tuna shakes."
"It sounds positively revolting, but I'm sure it's quite nourishing."
"Higgins, what is this?"
Paying out of the household account?
You never pay for anything for me out of...
Wait.
How'd you find out about this?
T.C. told me his plans when I let him in last night.
"For once I agreed with him, and so does Mr. Masters."
It's a capital idea.
Robin?
You talked to Robin?
The alternative seems more painful than being shot.
In principle I try to live as a witness-protection program.
You have to change all your habits.
You can not have any habits.
On an ordinary day you stand up and eat breakfast.
Playing perhaps his son.
So you need to know the playground you have to go on.
It's a little hard to explain to a child -
- Why one should go by train one day and by bus the next -

I am very contented to see everyone reunited here.
For me it is something indespensible.

You'd think that I'd know how to do this.
I-I...
Okay.
We're...
"We're here to help, and we... we want to, so we've set up hospice care in your home."
But what else can we do?
"Uh, antidepressants or..."
"No, no, no."
Antidepressants take up to two weeks to work.
"By then, I'll be dead."
Ohh.
There must be something.
I'll try anything.
Okay.
I have a... a colleague at a palliative care center.
"And he's in clinical trials, treating terminally ill patients with psilocybin."
What?
Hallucinogenic mushrooms?
"- No, I know, Owen."
- Are you serious?
"I know what you're thinking, Owen, but it..."
Psilocybin has been tested all over the world to treat anxiety and depression in terminally ill patients.
"Apparently, people are having life-altering experiences."
What... what...
What kind of experiences?
"As far as I can tell, they're starting to see themselves as part of a larger whole."

I have just learned some distressing news about the baby William and I adopted.
"Well, about his deceased mother actually."
What is it?
She wasn't born with a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't have been Roland's natural mother.
"Well, that must have been a bolt out of the blue."
It never occurred to either of us to question his parentage.
And what do you want me to do?
Find out if his natural mother is alive.
- Can I ask for your discretion?
- Absolutely.
What do you know about the mother and her husband?
Not much.
Nigel Braxton was a safecracker from England.
"His wife, Joanne, was from Stratford, Ontario."
I think her maiden name was Perly.
And they have no surviving family.

Colonel Cai.
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.
I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff.
The main subject was General Pham Son Ti.
He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south.
Which makes him Number One!
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.
I had my hands on him the last time I was out here.
"But because of political pressure, I had to turn him loose."
Like to get your hands on him again?
Who wouldn't?
"But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment."
- My people think several.
- That brings us up to the plan.
He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley.
"Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes a capture impossible."
Precisely.
Except for one woman and a certain hand-picked team.
"Go on, colonel."
This is the rat.
And this is the trap.
My father was a simple man.
"All he wanted was to be free his wife to love, and his children to raise."
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.
What he didn't realize was that man has to pay a price for that freedom.
"Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty."

No.
I've come to tell you that I know he had nothing to do with the murder.
We picked up 15 of our boys... 15...
And there were thousands of them there.
You've never seen anything like it-- white sand stretching out for Miles...
Ships everywhere-- hundreds of them.
"Motorboats, trawlers."
Picking up 15 here and 15 there.
"You know, we're gonna get the army out of there."
We're gonna do it.
There were bodies.
You saw them on the beaches.
"And as we went in there, the Germans were coming after us-- stukas, dorniers."
"I was lucky, though."
There was some sort of refinery burning and the smoke-- it protected us for a while.
Where is David?
I told you I'd bring him back to you.
"As an agent, I will be directing you to do certain things on our behalf."
"And you may be required to testify in court, in future."
"If you disobey my instructions, or conduct any criminal activity, you can be arrested, returned to Canada at any time, from any place and be prosecuted."

"I'm sorry I couldn't call, I was at the Passport Office all day."

I will call you when I get home.
"I love you, too."
Very good.
Let's go.
Take this.
It's from Jimmy.
He's gonna call you later and explain.
What's it for?
Francine knows about you.
She's gonna come after you if you show your face around here.
You better go.

- They were great leaders.
Would you put Thatcher in that category?
"No, I don't think so."
- You know what?
I would have to say Thomas Jefferson.

"- She's something, isn't she?"
- I don't really know her.
"We served together a few years ago, and, I guess... we just ended up in different company."

Laine Hanson has an extra burden.
She's has to come on the world stage with perfect credentials.

The world respected her.
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher because they knew she had to answer to Ronald Reagan.

"Contains a central pas-passage and three chambers, or cysts don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow."
This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology..
"not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place.."
"no, I'm talking about folklore."
"In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find."

"Leo, I've finished the histology on Dawn Pivcevic and all the organs are normal except for this."
I think the endometrium shows changes of pregnancy and there's a cluster of cells from an embryo.
She was pregnant?
"Yes, just a few days."
You were lucky to sample the right bits for histology.
"They couldn't get pregnant, that's why they'd come off IVF."
It's not unusual for couples to come off IVF and then get pregnant.
That's how Theresa got pregnant with Cassie.
Morning sickness.
She was making the doll throw up.
Who?
The little girl at the scene.
"She wasn't re-enacting Dawn's death, she must have seen her vomiting at some time."
Early stages of pregnancy could bring on nausea and vomiting and faintness.
Especially with the remaining hormones from the IVF.
And if she got a bit tipsy...
She could easily faint.
"How am I going to explain to the husband that his wife, who couldn't get pregnant, got pregnant, which in part killed her?"
If it wasn't so tragic it would be a joke.

he One Direction boys are causing hysteria  everywhere.
It's akin to BeatIemania.
So a small group of British girls became a huge group  of British girls who then turned Europe into huge fans.
America then stepped in.
So in the space of months the fans got the entire planet  to support One Direction.
You sing!
Let me hear you up top!
Pandemonium.
So the whole world are fans of One Direction.
And we haven't put a record out yet.
"And then  we released ""What Makes You beautiful."""
"First thought was, "" could this work in America?"""
here's not much of a track record  of any British boy bands breaking in America.
"But once everybody heard ""hat Mak es You Beautiful""  it was a perfect storm."

It's One Direction.

"Internal division is the greatest enemy, Your Eminence."
Reasonable amount of rivalry can so increase productivity.
But the fact that there is Konishi behind Dodo and Kato behind Wakizaka is what bothers me.
"If I keep them together, they will be more concerned with fight for power than fight against Chosun."
How about changing the lineup of the advance guards?
That's what we will do.
Send Wkizaka with Konishi.
Konishi thinks too much.
He needs a decisive comrade to push him.
"And for the same reason, we will pair Dodo with Kato."

From now on we're going to look a hundred times before we leap.
As we should!
Is that good?
"That's good, isn't it?"
I think it's light enough that we won't have any problem with the force of restoration.
Yes!
"What's wrong, Lieutenant?"
I though you'd jump for joy.
"If we use copper and iron alloy, our problem will be solved."
Right?
Then our problem is solved!
What's wrong?
Copper is many times more expensive than iron.
Will it be okay if it comes from me?
It's not like I have to like you with an effort now.
I've always liked you.
But I never felt that you could be the one for me.
"But now that I think of it, it all makes sense."
"I like you, Sadhana."
Really?
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
A small word said in passing
"It is chilly, it is true, listen"
You added sweetness to what you spoke
My masculinity is stunned.
Should I say slowly
Or increase the speed?
Should I leave after saying or pause right there?
Should I pinch at the love that was said
Or should I lose myself to the love that was grabbed by my hands
I realize today that there may be a thousand changes to the sight.
I see myself through your eyes conveying love.
I am seeing you with a pouring love... that I have collected.
I am gently bringing to your ears the words I collected slowly.
I put my hands out to get a raindrop...
It remained just as a drizzle.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
AII of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
Some rituals used in the Black Mass.
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"Please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
That didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
"So, on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."

"I am coming, just a moment."
Luigi?
"What is wrong, why so nervous?"
"Its one of the models, I remember her from somewhere, but don't know where!"
Which one?
The red headed one.
"You are imagining things, Luigi, she is one of our must trusted models."
"Do you think that all the precautions our organisation has taken, are useless?"
Its that we must not take any risks.
"Has it dawned on you that it is insane for all of us to remain here, together?"
"Any slight error, can finish our organisation, with one blow."
You know it is necessary.
"I have been working here for the last two months, and nothing abnormal has happened."
"All is rolling along, please Luigi, do not worry."
"Say, Lucrecia, when do you go on stage?"
"In just a moment,"
Don't you enjoy seeing me as an entertainer in a night club?
You would enjoy it even more to see me as a designer of swimwear.
"can you help me , please?"
May I?
Thanks
I must congratulate you.
You swim quite well.
"I have already thanked you, what else can I say to you, Mr. Dinamo?"
"Ah, you know my name, that means you have heard of me."
We neutralized the last zombie specimens.
"Thanks to Hybra Tech, there hasn't been a single zombie outbreak in over 10 years."
"Hybra Tech, chemical solutions for the entire planet."
THE RETURN OF MORTOS PART 4
- NECROPOLIS
Entry to the exclusion zone without permission is forbidden.
You like the singing?
Nathalia Lavina.
She is the Russian Britney Spears.
How much further?
"Don't be so nervous, we will be there in a couple of minutes."
You are sure that they are here?
"Yes, they are here my friend."
This is the best place to keep them safe.
This is it.
"Don't worry, the Geiger-Counter is a precaution."
The level of radiation is the same as a ray-x of teeth.
Bullshit you hear about this place...
Just to get more money from you Americans.
What was that?
Don't worry.
Suppose someone finds us here?
Everything is fine my friend.
I have made arrangements for the security for this place.
We are in the base of the main reactor.
"You can make a ""tour"" if you like."
Would you like to see the place where they make the big boo-boo?
No!
Let's cut the 50 cent tour and tell me where the hell they are.
Behind you.
The last of the Trioxin-5 canisters.
Is this all of them?
"I know you're thinking about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
"She died trying to hide something from Jeanine, something that was entrusted to Abnegation"
- a long time ago.
- Marcus!
Stop!
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
You mind telling me what's inside?
A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
"Divergents will destroy our society, unless we destroy them."
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them!
Every last one of them.
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.
Go with happiness.
I really don't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, just try to blend in."
"I'm trying to blend in, it's just not working."
"Coming through, on you right."
Okay here we go.
Oh look a rainbow.
It's pretty.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioning passifism.
I love this place.
would you think it possible that I was once considered to be attractive?
Your looks are okay.
-I was fishing for a compliment.
-I don't go for that stuff.
-What stuff?
-compliments to women about looks.
I never met a dame yet didn't know if she was good-Iooking or not without being told.
And some of them give themselves credit for more than they've got.
"I once went out with a dame who told me, ""I'm the glamorous type."""
"She says, ""I am the glamorous type."" I says, ""So what?"""
-And what did she say then?
-She didn't say nothing.
-That shut her up like a clam.
-Did it end the romance?
"well, it ended the conversation, that was all."
There's some men that are took in by this hollywood glamour stuff...
-...and there's some men that aren't.
-You belong in the second category.
-That's right.
-I cannot imagine any witch of a woman...
-...casting a spell over you.
-That's right.
"You're simple, straightforward and honest."
"A little bit on the primitive side, I should think."
-To interest you a woman would have to--
-To lay her cards on the table.
"well, I never did care for wishy-washy people."
"That was why when you walked in last night, I said to myself:"
"""My sister has married a man."" Of course."
-That was all I couId teII--
-How about cutting the rebop!
stanley!
But I know someone who can beat the Shaolin.
Which chamber does he belong?
He's not a priest.
He's Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung-wu!
"According to our regulations, a guilty person cannot be our representative."
"Furthermore, Chao Fung-wu isn't our student..."
He's the only one who knows how to fight the Chin Kang Fist.
"If he can represent us, he can win."
Then all charges will be dropped.
That's a good point.
"If he wins, he'll be pardoned."
"$50,000, they do pass."
"$50,000, they don't."
I smell a rat.
Been dead at least 24 hours.
My sensors detect the vehicle is armored with my protective shell.
He took the bait.
We hooked him real good.
I was always strongly attracted to you.
"Michael, he's coming right for us!"
"Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist."
"michael Knight, a young loner, on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law."
"michael, I've searched my data banks thoroughly,"
I can't find one redeeming quality about gambling.
"KITT, look at it this way:"
gambling is all odds.
It's pure mathematics.
"Come on, I'll show you."
I'd rather not.
"A little computer blackjack, $1 a hand."
Main Stage too.
Main Stage?
"Oh, I'm honored."
And please know that whatever additional responsibilities you might find necessary on my part to keep your empire running...
are welcome.
Just give the word.
"Easy, Mussolini, just keep the trains running."
- [Cassie] Hi.
- [knocks on the door]
"[Goldie] Hey, honey."
Can I talk to you alone?
"Yeah, Arnie was just leaving."
"Oh, yeah, right."
"I'll go and, uh,"
I just gotta set the lineup for the Main Stage.
[scoffs] [clears throat]
"I know it's probably not my place to say anything, um, but have you read the sketches?"
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, 'cause I'm worried that the Little Bo Peep one might be kinda..."
lame.
It's not lame.
"It's fucking horrible, goddamn offensive."
Ohh.
I thought I just didn't get it.
"[laughs] Ho, ho, the writers don't get it."
"I mean, it's two guys never been laid writing their idea of what a woman might say."
"If you told them your twat was horizontal, they wouldn't argue."
"Okay, because I was thinking, maybe we could change it to ""The Little Bo Peep Show,"" and men show up thinking it's gonna be this sexy peep show, but instead, the girl behind the glass is wearing"
"this ridiculous dress, not showing any skin, because she wants to be taken seriously as an actress, doing her one-woman show about her wayward sheep."
[laughs]
Why don't you take a swing at rewriting it?
Really?
You'd know it if you went into the kitchen and checked out those supposed violations.
Though you shouldn't have to check.
What's all this?
I just keep thinking about the Burkes.
There's something... something not right with these two.
"Just 'cause they say their suite is haunted, doesn't mean they're ""not right."""
"I had the development office pull the, uh, information from the sale of Monica's condo... just so we could run a more comprehensive background check."
What are you looking for?
"Ah, what are we looking for?"
That's the question.
I wanna run a complete search on these two.
"Previous addresses, former employers, whatever you can think of."
I want as much information as possible on those two.
Sorry I asked.
Hmm?
You busy?
No.
[Together] Hey.
What's wrong?
You first.
You mean you didn't hear about Mystique being shut down?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did hear about that."
Health code violations.
I thought it must be some kind of mistake.
Hello.
"Everyone knows you're Montecito's official ""germophobe"" when it comes to Mystique."
Thank you.
It's just because I refused to go out with that crazy-ass health inspector.
So what's your problem?
Paul Logan.
I heard he was in town.
May I ask if you have any data on this?
"My colleague, he... he administered this drug to 18 volunteers, and 72% of them said that they had these profoundly spiritual experiences."
Where... where... where can we get these mushrooms?
It's not mushrooms.
We would be using medical-grade psilocybin.
When can I try this?
Good afternoon.
"So, we have some news."
Uh...
"We have all of Jacob's test results back, and, um, we can't find anything."
S-so this means everything is fine.
"Well, that's awful."
There's nothing you can fix?
- I'm afraid not.
"- We can't find anything, so we have to assume that this is Jerusalem syndrome."
Look at him.
He's had a spiritual conversion.
"- Ian, is that man sane?"
- ...
Fortify you.
Religious ecstasy isn't considered insanity.
"As much as we want to fix it, if Jacob's not ill..."
- ...she'asah il kol tzorki.
- There's nothing that we could do.
I have nowhere to go.
He gave away our house.
Barukh attah adonai melkh ha-olam she-asah il kol tzorki.
This is not what I signed up for!
You are supposed to take care of me!
Not me... you.
I gave up my career because of you.
I can't even get groceries.
"I want to introduce you to the First Daughter of the United States, my daughter Catherine Selina Meyer."
Catherine.
Always a delight to have...
She is such a beautiful girl.
I'm so proud of her.
"Well, we have another minute or so before we're prepared to call Virginia."
Just checking a couple of precincts.
We've made some premature calls this evening.
So we're anxious to be absolutely certain this time.
Why don't we meet some of the people who lift me up?
I'd like you to meet them.
"Guys, come on out."
How about these great faces?
Incredible scenes.
Never happened before.
Very emotional moment.
"Dan, do you wish you were there?"
I'm sure it's a very exciting place to be at.
There's never been an election like this.
No.
You must want to be there.
"Folks, you don't know her, but this is Karen Collins."
And she has been a friend of mine for a while.
Yep.
And Amy Brookheimer is here.
Amy Brookheimer who so successfully ran my campaign until she became unwell.
I'll tell you somebody else that is not here tonight who was with the campaign...
"Sounds like it could be you, Dan."
"Well, I would be incredibly touched."
"And that is, of course, Leslie Kerr."
"I'm sure Leslie is thanking you, too."
And I'm hearing we can now project a Virginia result.
They waltz into my court.
"They get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend."
The only treatment for them is death.
You dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.
Tough to get a conviction without a body.
There's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand.
I saw them.
They were there with his name on my son's computer.
"Your son, Kyle sent them."
To himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
He blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
Sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
He wanted to get the coach fired.
This whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.
Wrestle!
You got him!

The Sound Of White ¸èÊÖ:
Missy Higgins
"You going somewhere, Don?"
"Yep, there is no point in me hanging around pushing papers."
"It's not my style, Mac."
You've been cleared.
I just heard.
"- I want you to know, I never doubted you."
- Thanks.
"You know, for a long minute there, it felt like everybody else did."
Todd Fleming's medical records show that he was prescribed an anti-depressant eight months ago.
"When Sid did a screen for that particular drug, he found more than ten times the recommended dosage in his system."
Why can't it all be done on machinery?
"For many uses machinery is unsurpassed, but Logopolis is not interested in such uses."
Block transfer computation cannot be done with the computers.
-Why not?
-Our manipulation of numbers directly changes the physical world.
There is no other mathematics like ours.
You mean the computations themselves would affect a computer?
Of course.
"Change its nature, cause it to malfunction."
Only the living brain is immune.
"But you had a computer out there, you were using it."
"To record the code, yes, to prepare new algorithms, yes, but we must not use it to run our program."
"Now, we had reached 0-4, 0-7, A-0, 3-0, 3-8."
There are no errors in the registers.
We must search the streets.
-Sonic projectors.
-What are they for?
They must be creating a temporary zone of stasis around the Tardis.
-But I don't really understand their science.
-That goes double for me.
"Fourth block begins. ""A-3."
"-""F-8..."""
-E-8.
"-Sorry, E-8."
"-It is difficult, I know."
But accuracy is of a vital importance.
"""3-3."""
You can tell they're exploited.
-These people are scientists.
-So?
I've seen that look of dedication on my father's face.
"Well, it doesn't seem to be doing any good, does it?"
Mother!
"All right, Regan, let's see what the trouble--"
Regan!
Keep away!
The sow is mine!
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Hold her steady.
Hold her tight!
Don't let them!
She's heavily sedated.
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated motor performance.
For example say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground.
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.
"Same principle, I mean."
"So, what's wrong with her?"
We still think that the temporal lobe--
"Oh, what are you talking about, for Christ's sakes?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry."
"There haven't been more than 100 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
But who sees it in your eyes?
How am I going to behave?
"Those boys are only friends, aren't they?"
Do you think they like it when someone clings to them?
"You'll see, someone will appreciate that more."
Maybe. I haven't yet met anyone who appreciates it more.
They always talk to the kind who cling to everyone immediately.
"The other day your registrar said they pay sixty crowns in Moravia, and us only fifteen."
My sister-in-law's sister said that in Central Slovakia they even pay a hundred.
- l've heard that too.
- Us fifteen...
That's despicable!
"I'm telling you, it's only in Nitra they pay so badly."
"Elsewhere, as you say, it's at least fifty."
"You understand, we're qualified, you're in that society... the Committee for Civil Affairs."
"As a member, they only got me from the music school just to..."
- l feel so worn out...
- You're tired?
- How many more?
- lt's dragging on today.
- Nothing's on time!
- They're saying goodbye at home.
- And have they even paid?
- That photographer...
"Yes, yes..."
- How lovely!
- What's lovely about it?
Really.
What do you see in it?
Look at this... here...
"Don't take it off, if we put..."
"We'll put something blue here, blue buttons, that'll make you a bit slimmer..."
I did it quick.
And it's exciting and it pops and I get the sense that Dave likes it.
I'm going back to the bar.
I don't know what New Orleans music would be today if it wouldn't be for what the Meters created back in the day.
The Meters are like the Beatles here in New Orleans for us.
I think the Meters turned out to be is the embodiment of everything we're sitting here talking about.
They're just straight-up New Orleans funk.
Leo Nocentelli on guitar.
Zigaboo Modeliste on drums.
"And the bass player, George Porter."
The Neville Brothers were Art and Aaron.
They were like a part of the fiber of the early days of the Meters.
I discovered the Meters through Led Zeppelin.
I read somewhere that the Meters were...
"John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin..."
They were one of his favorite bands.
"And it only makes sense... when you listen to the ""pocket"""
and the groove the Meters had.
"I was fascinated with Zigaboo, the drummer."
"It's such a strange, unorthodox, different way of approaching rhythm."
I never heard it before.
He was very syncopated.
"He used the ""ands"" of ""one"""
way more than normal drummers would use.
"And when he makes them, I would read him."
You know?
"I'd know it's coming, so I would ""and"" with him, you know?"
"It wasn't ""correct,"" they way he played."
It was just how he felt.
He played how he felt.
It's just the artistic air around New Orleans.
"It's like a gas that's leaking out, and everybody is, you know..."
Can we ask you a question?
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
We must have made a mistake somewhere.
"Look, just between us,"
-what do you think of them?
-So I should give my opinion?
"No, don't worry."
"I'm telling you ""just between us""."
I'm supposed to give my opinion between us?
-I will not give it.
-And why not?
"I will give my opinion, and you will broadcast it, and who will have problems?"
Me.
Do I want problems?
No.
If you want problems then give your opinion.
"What, me?"
!
I'm only an ordinary substrate.
"Excuse me, how would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?"
Now I don't know what I would say.
"I'm thinking about something else, I don't perceive you."
"Well, I don't know."
Everyone whould be wondering and would be curious how it would work out.
For sure they would be wondering too.
"It's an interesting question, but I don't know."
That question has been put strangely.
Depending on whether they have the antennae or they speak with a dictaphone.
-Do they seem normal to you?
-Normal?
-Definitely not.
-Really?
To save the historic Estabul from Roland...
I don't care what happens to the kingdom!
The people come first!
Will this really make the people happy?
Isn't it just excessive bloodshed?
I'll be satisfied if the people can live happily.
"Aren't you the one who taught me that, Salawell?"
"Right now, our forces are still strong."
So Roland won't get too brazen.
But there's no guarantee of that in the future.
"I've heard terrible rumors about Roland nobility, too."
"If you truly want to consider the people, now is the time."
"If you speak thus, it must be so."
"For you, we would not shrink even from death."
"I want to make a kingdom where everyone can live with a smile, where everyone can be happy!"
"Can I do it, Salawell?"
Of course you can!
We shall henceforth do battle with Roland!
We shall take back Estabul's independence ourselves!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
I bear a message from Rear Admiral Klom!
The battle has commenced!
"Shuss, what are the enemy numbers?"
Roughly eight to nine thousand.
Exactly as Froaude's information claimed.
- I don't like it.
- Sir?
Nothing.
We'll end this with minimal casualties.
Let's go!
"All forces, advance!"
I can do it right now.
Chakotay to Paris.
Is the rescue team ready?
Standing by.
Prepare for transport.
"Deflector ready, Commander."
Initiate the radion beams.
Sending out the first volley... Is working.
They're getting through the shields.
Begin the transport.
"Transporter Room 2, synchronize your confinement beams to..."
That came from the surface.
Maximum shields.
Damage report.
Shields at 90 percent.
That was a precision hit right to the source of the beams.
Main deflector is now off-line.
We're being hailed from the surface.
On screen.
Your attempt to penetrate our defenses is a hostile act against the Mokra Order.
There are now 85 phased- ion cannons targeted at your ship.
"If you don't withdraw from Mokra space in two minutes, we will open fire."
Commander.
"Give me some good news, Mr. Kim."
There's a disruption in the shields around the prison.
That qualifies.
Good work.
"I wish I could take credit for it, butit's coming from inside the prison."
Can we get through?
"Yes, but the Mokra will detect our transport."
Sounds like they have other things to worry about right now.
That disruption might not be accidental.
"On his earlier weekend visit, musician Mr. Carrington touched a chord with Miss Hopkins."
"When Mr. Carrington came for the weekend, it was like a breath of fresh air walking into this house."
"Something just kind of clicked inside me, and, um... and, uh..."
"The hostess's companion, Miss Martin, is helping Miss Hopkins make a love token to greet Mr. Carrington."
This looks wicked great.
"Chaperone Mrs. Hammond is so thrilled at the prospect of having an attractive musician back at the house, she's hired a grand piano."
This is just what we needed.
Perfect.
Music has ever been a conduit for amour.
But a Regency musician only had the social advantages of a senior servant... hardly a suitable candidate for Miss Hopkins.
I've just spilt yellow paint everywhere.
Does it hide it?
"Ah, that's really, really nice."
Nice.
"Ladies, gentlemen."
Oh!
"Well, that's a proper piano."
"Oh, that's so good."
"Anyway, come on, come and have a drink and then sort of settle in."
Thank you so much.
That's so amazing.
I can't believe it.
"""Here's a little something from me to you"
"""to welcome you back to Kentchurch Court."
"""It's good to have you back, mate."
"Fondest regards, Miss Hopkins."""
Look at this tambourine she's done.
That is so amazing.
"""Follow the beat of your heart."""
"God, I'm really getting blown away today."
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.

All

"- You got to something to say, son?"
We're all ears.
"This being your first week,"
"I'm gonna cut you some slack, all right?"
"'Cause, son, you got it easy on this side of the fence."
Do you understand?
"You get to go home at night, sleep in your warm, snuggly bed."
"But you best start giving a damn, or else you'll wind up over there, in juvie, playing with the big boys."
And you sure as hell ain't going home to your mommy and daddy.
"You will be locked up, crying and pissing yourself to sleep every night."
On the ground.

"Living in southeast Texas, it's important we get prepared, because hurricane season is here."
What will the next one bring?
"It's not a matter of ""if"" but ""when."""
- Come on.
Let's go.
Get in your bed.
Okay.
That's why we came after you.
That's lucky for me.
He had no intention of leaving me alive.
- You get a good look at him?
- Yeah.
"Asian, mid-40s, he had a tattoo on the side of his head."
Sounds like the picture of the guy out of New York.
What picture?
Akira Kimura.
Who is he?
Yeah.
That's the same guy.
Akira Kimura.
He was somehow connected to my case on Roth and Flynn.
The guys who came for the coins.
Yeah.
God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around.
"And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue."
"It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army."
It went underground after the Japanese defeat in world war ii.
But it appears the organization has resurfaced with ties to the Yakuza.
"We got a report that Kimura was identified by state police in hamburg, Germany, three months a, now he's here."
I want you to tear this town apart and find this son of a bitch.
We think he hired a private investigator out of New York.
We found photos of you.
"And me, Hank, the captain, everybody on this investigator's camera."
The same investigator we found dead today.
We think Kimura killed him.
Why would he kill the guy he hired?
Remember those coins I was telling you about?
"Oh, yeah."
Everybody died?
We'll have our own religion in our own building.
"Oh, this does not seem very attainable."
"You should set your sights a little bit smaller, like"
- A new shoe cubby for the mosque.
"- Yeah, I'm with Baber,"
"But to be fair, I don't really care."
"I thank you for your honesty, Rev. Baber, you have wanted this for years."
I just don't think now is a good time.
People will think we're up to no good.
- Why?
"- People will see the minarets and think,"
"- ""Uh-oh, Muslims!"""
- Naturally.
"And then, they'll see innocent old Baber buying some lawn fertilizer and blamo!"
They'll think we're going to blow something up.
Why would they think that?
And why would you be buying fertilizer?
Your lawn is full of weeds and crabgrass.
"Well, that's exactly why I would be buying fertilizer."
My point is proven.
Point not proven!
No one's even going to think you're capable of blowing anything up!
Challenge accepted!
You will see the authorities will be right at my door!
- AMAAR:
"Salaam alaikum, Sarah."
"- Hi, Amaar."
- You wanted to talk to me?
"- Yeah, I needed your help with a presentation tonight at the town meeting for the new mosque."
"Look, Amaar, I would love to help..."
"Great, I will get you the plans right away."
"No, no, no."
Ha-ha-ha!
At long last.
The Torch of Truth.
I...
I don't understand.
I knew this was a waste of time.
But the Torch must be in here.
"It isn't, because it never existed."
"The Torch is a myth, like Atlantis."
But the medallion did open the Ark.
"If that much of the legend is true, maybe the rest is too."
"Look, if I could take the Ark to Thera and solve the riddle of Solon, uh, I know that I could prove that the ruined city there was Atlantis and find the treasure."
You and MacGyver caused enough trouble on Thera five years ago.
"Simon, you told me the best tool an archaeologist has is an open mind."
I won't have my work disrupted again by Atticus and his idiotic notions about a super-civilization.
"Simon, you are still a blinkered old fool!"
I have no time for this.
I have a plane to catch back to Greece.
"Come along, Kelly,"
I'll give you a ride to the university.
"I'm not going back there, Simon."
What are you saying?
I've decided I'd like to stay here and work with Atticus and MacGyver.
"Kelly, you're a scholar, girl, not a treasure hunter."
"All my life, I've done what you want."
I'm quite capable of making up my own mind.
"First you and MacGyver disrupted my work on Thera, and now you've poisoned my granddaughter's mind."
No.
It's my decision.
Fine.
Go ahead.
"Throw away your academic career, if you want."
Wanker.
Why don't you just stop being such a fucking pussy and let the fuck go?
Fucking leave me alone!
There you are.
Are you OK?
"Look at you, you poor thing."
Come with us.
We'll get you some warm clothes and a nice hot tea.
The Musical Society are going to do a performance for all of you.
HMS Pinafore.
"# I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee"
# Soft tommy and succulent chops
"# So buy of your Buttercup, Poor Little Buttercup"
"# Come of your Buttercup, buy!"
#
Come back!
There'll be cheese and wine.
It'll be fun!
There's always cheese and wine!
Take a seat.
Eventful day.
"Pissing around in pools, smashing up labs, avoiding activities, getting up to no good in the dorms."
- How'd you know what I...?
"- And now you turn up for an interview like, well..."
"You know, I'm amazed you actually even bothered, really."
"But I'm a fair man, so bearing all that in mind, why don't you try to convince me into offering you a place at this university?"
"Oh, you think you're so original, don't you?"
I have met a million kids like you.
"Yeah, vaguely intelligent."
Agonisingly middle-class.
"Read a book by Camus, a book by Kafka."
"No real substance, though."
"In 2006, I went and saw JK Rowling in New York City."
Where she signed this.
And this.
Which is now one of four tattoos on my body.
With plans for more.
APPLAUSE
"Uh, fun fact, that is the man that kills JK Rowling."
"If he ever has sex, he's going to shout out Expelliarmus, isn't he?"
I don't think he needs to worry about that.
"David, you write children's books, which are, and I've got the statistics here, much less successful."
"It's difficult to quantify the joy you bring to children, but, yes,"
"I bring a lot of joy to children, carry on."
"So you've written, what children's books have you written?"
"I've written a series of books called Danger Is Everywhere, which is, uh..."
Not as good as Harry Potter.
"David, David, can I ask you a sensible question about it?"
Who's in the films of your books?
"OK, well, let's have a look and see if JK Rowling is up there."
"Yes, it's JK Rowling!"
JK Rowling was once unemployed and living on state benefits.
"But now, she's richer than the Queen."
"Who, ironically, is unemployed and living on state benefits."
"OK, Rob, Rich, Ellie, who else is the nation's favourite Brit?"
"Um, I think people like Jamie Oliver, don't they?"
He's always doing something.
"Every time you look, he's got something open."
"Jamie's cockle van, Jamie's kebab stall."
Jamie's bag of chips.
"I feel like Jamie Oliver, like, he's really liked outside of Britain, but I don't know if he's popular in Britain."
He feels like the UK's Bono.
"Like, the more good he does, people are like, ""You smug prick, stop it!"
"""Try less, mate!"""
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
Get that coolant flowing.
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
Who is this?
"This is Dr. Victor Gannon,"
And I have just shut down your cooling system.
"OK, you've shut it down."
Get it back on again!
Tell him how expensive it is to put it back on.
"In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium, medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met."
What conditions?
Five million dollars in cash.
A jet waiting at the airport.
"A safe escort, of course."
"And most important of all,"
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon has achieved molecular control and mind control.
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.
How long does it take to count five million dollars?
We'll have to pay them.
Evacuate the immediate area.
Put Los Angeles on alert.
There's the big round ball.
- Is that it?
"- No, it was bigger than that."
Get outta here.
Leave me alone.
At least I tried.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself,under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites,the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"- Were you scared,Mr.Petty?"
"- No,ma'am."
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know,Mr.Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water,where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right,Mr.Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea,Mr.Madsen?"
"If you know,why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring,right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well,you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
I can write my essay later.
"Whatever it is, I'm in."
Wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
"If you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously."
Then let me drive the getaway car instead.
Or I could create a diversion or something.
"Hey, you want in?"
Accept the assignment.
Then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
What can I do to help?
Help what?
Help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
How do you know what we've been talking about?
You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
Could you make out with Amanda?
'Cause that would be hot.
It's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
"Number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence."
"That's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy."
"Bitchy, not cynical."
A total difference.
I was just trying to help.
?
Can I help you?
Hi.
Is Amanda home?
I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
- Think on thy sin.
- They are loves I bear to you.
"Ay, and for that thou diest."
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas... why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents;
but yet I hope...
"I hope, they do not point on me."
"- Peace, and be still!"
- I will so.
What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee...
- thou gavest to Cassio.
"- No, by my life and soul!"
"Send for the man, and ask him."
Take heed of perjury;
thou art on thy deathbed.
"- Ay, but not yet to die."
- Yes presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath... cannot remove nor choke the strong conception which I do groan withal.
- Thou art to die.
- Then Lord have mercy on me!
"- I say, amen."
- And have you mercy too!
I never did offend you in my life;
never loved Cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as I might love:
- I never gave him token.
- By heaven...
I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman!
Say..no... bast...
"Forgive me, I tought it was one more of your tricks."
"Oh, the message."
"Get in, quick, tonite, we shall dance at the Crazy Horse."
Ah!
Dinamo?
zero zero one hundred
"So, it was you."
"I have something very important to inform you, but now it is much to dangerous, I am being followed."
"I will contact you,"
Careful!
"Excuse me, miss, did I harm you?"
"No, not that much."
"Now you will tell me that you had another fight, and someone tried to kill you, right?"
"Of course, look..."
We have been waiting three minutes for you.
Excuse me .
Ms. Bristol but...
There is no time for explanations!
We will begin our business.
"Our best weapon has been and always will be, terrorism."
It has given us great results in countries that are already under our control.
But... but what has happened in the countries where you work?
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Only some skirmishes and nothing conclusive.
This is why we are meeting here.
Report to me your activities.
"I will advise you of new systems, and new weapons."
Where is that red head?
"She went out a few minutes ago, Madame."
The red head was here with us.
"Decreased activity in his left culmen, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate."
Jacob is communing with his God right now.
There's nothing that you could label as abnormal in the scans.
But we haven't got all the tests results back yet.
Something is wrong.
This makes no sense.
Jacob always rebelled against his parents' religion.
Were his parents orthodox?
"Oh, yes, hard-core."
A tendency to believe in God can be inherited.
"There's... there's even a specific gene,"
"VMAT2, linked to religiosity."
Maybe your trip to Jerusalem triggered something that was already there in him.
I always knew his parents would ruin our marriage.
♪ Ahh ♪
"Oh, please tell me that's what I think it is."
Your very own cronut.
I had to wait an hour in line to get it.
They are officially a thing now.
Mmm!
I think I just found the key to enlightenment.
"So, has the cronut earned me a walk to my place?"
"Oh, we don't have to go that far."
"All right, if we need an elvish riddle to get through that door, I'm gonna marry you."
This is the electronic age.
Okay.
"This is, uh... most definitely enlightening."
What's up?
Reynaud's blood work came back.
We did a complete metabolic panel.
"His platelets are normal, but the INR is 6.0."
"Oh, my God."
- Here we are.
"- Good-looking school, doc."
"That must be the new principal, you know?"
"They really give it to you, didn't they?"
"Like everybody else, they really give it to you."
Have you been drinking?
"Work yourself to death, then they bring in an outsider to pick the plum."
You have been drinking.
"I know you keep a bottle in the basement, but I won't have you bring it into the classroom, ever."
Don't forget.
It'd do your kids good to learn how to handle liquor instead of algebra.
- You're talking like a fool.
"- Oh, be I."
I sat in this classroom four years.
I sat right here.
Everything important was learned somewheres else.
You never applied yourself.
"If you had, you might've learned something in school."
"Tell my wife, a cleaning woman."
"- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets."
- Stop it!
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
"- I said, stop it."
"If you had applied yourself, you might have learned how to live intelligently."
There ain't nobody in this here town living intelligently.
Nobody.
- I don't believe that.
- All right.
Name me one important person graduated from this here school.
Name one.
You can't.
"I'm gonna tell you something, Ms. Thornton something you can teach your class someday."
If I'd tell you some details you surely remember me.
We'd spend the entire day talking and arguing.
About everything.
Theology and ethics...
Everything.
And suddenly I'm remembering all those conversations.
And I'd like to clarify some misunderstandings that happened back in the days.
"Father Urlieta, are you there?"
"No, It's not about any religious doubt."
"In fact, what I'd like to talk with you is about those conversations."
You were very efficient and convincing when arguing.
It was some kind of dialectics full of sophisms.
An authentic brainwashing.
I'm not trying to offend you.
"In fact, my intentions are pure."
Absolutely pure.
I just wanted to see you and talk with you.
I'm sorry but I'd like to see you.
"Yes, yes."
Any other day.
I'll call you.
"Well, thank you Father Urlieta."
Bye.
Man!
You look good with that beard!
What have you done?
You'd be surprised by the enormous amount of sounds around us.
And we don't listen to them at all.
Do you use that for your compositions?
We'll see...
I'm not sure.
You could compose some kind of horror symphony with those noises.
You also missed out.
You are just drunk.
We'll see.
Let's go to sleep.
"No Ivana, it is true."
You also played and you lost.
What the devil are you saying?
Are you crazy?
"Waiting for you, I gave them security."
"Waiting for you, I gave them safety."
I am expected to do what?
You said that I am expect?
You gave the security - of me?
"By the devils, who do you think you are?"
"Unhappy cretin, miserable ruffian, traitor shit!"
"By me, they can very well wait forever to get their security."
"To the devil, with you and your friends."
"They are crazy Ivana, capable of anything."
"Only to get it straight, the problem is yours not mine."
"You and your gambling games, I am tired."
"Perhaps, because for the want of Filippo, or by the perverse... pleasure, to see him totally dependent on me,... three days later decided to go to pay this dues,... this extravagant debt of my husband."
"In addition, I confess, I was intrigued."
The blonde and the dull.
What value for the both of them?
"See, help me."
Get the dress.
Still beautiful?
Consider love and games?
-Answer me.
Love?
-Yes.
"Telemessage, the person you called is not available."
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the I-got-caught-cheating diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
It's a family heirloom.
"Yeah, I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half-sister over Christmas, so I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully... that she can suck it."
Okay.
I got to bounce.
Stop saying that.
This DJ from Dubai is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
"I was still young, and I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me would be a total disaster."
She's like an entirely different species.
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
"Wow, my phone has a clock."
And they subsist on a diet of pointlessly weird combinations.
Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber jalapeño egg cream."
Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
No excuses and no bar bills.
- God bless America.
- God bless America.
"- Well, he's very handsome."
"- Oh, come on!"
"So, what's an American doing in Dunkirk?"
"No, scrub that."
- What isn't he doing?
- Fighting.
"- Yeah, so what does that make him?"
- A priest?
"- No, we need a hero."
- I don't know...
- Travel writer?
Journalist?
- A journalist.
"Hard-boiled, wise-cracking Yankee hack who can pilot a boat heroically."
You're not pinching any more action from Rose and Lily.
I'm not unpicking the entire bloody structure either.
"Will somebody give them a hand over there, please?"
All the way up.
"Of course, the irony is, they've given this to a bloody documentaries director."
"He won't want any dialogue, anyway."
"It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football, you wait."
"What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?"
"He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie."
"Self-sacrifice, that's noble."
- Only if he stands a chance.
- Maybe he does.
"Maybe she likes him, because he's the sort that'd let her fix the propeller."
"So give him a name, our journalist."
Joe.
Assassination of who?
- This guy?
- No.
He was delivering the gun to an assassin who is likely sitting out there right now.
"Well, then they should just shut down the terminal and question everybody."
And let it happen again somewhere else?
No dice.
"We got a locked room full of suspects out there, Inspector Poirot."
"Yeah, and if the target's out there, too, he'd probably be dead already."
It's got to be someone on an incoming flight.
"McGee's running manifests right now, but..."
Oh.
There he is.
"Well, that was fast, McGenius."
Hey.
Manifests are on their way.
"In the meantime,"
Gibbs wants to keep an extra set of eyes on you.
But security at the airport won't let us access their surveillance.
Yeah.
They're very touchy about their cameras around here.
"Yeah, so much for interagency cooperation."
"Well, uh, look, if a camera's what's needed, maybe, uh... maybe this'll do."
On three.
"One, two..."
"Rest there, Mr. Beers."
We'll get back to you shortly.
Bishop's photos from the airport.
"Yeah, let's take a look at this imposter."
Whoa.
Is that me?
Most likely the storm wreaking havoc with the power grid.
I just started.
Oh?
Yes.
I want you to leave my crew alone.
Don't dance with him.
Did it make you angry?
"Don't accept his gifts, either."
I believe the dear captain's Jealous of me.
I don't care what you believe.
Keep your hands off her!
"How curiously human, how wonderfully barbaric."
I've had enough of your attentions to her.
Of course.
"That's the root of the matter, isn't it?"
"You fight for the attention, admiration, possession of women."
"If it's fighting that you want, you may have it."
Are you challenging me to a duel?
If you have the courage.
This is better than I'd planned.
I shall not shirk an affair of honor.
A matched set--
Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton.
"And, Captain..."
I never miss.
"Captain 's Log,"
"Stardate 2126. 1, delayed report-- the whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself Trelane."
"We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games."
"I've decided to make my move with the field-of-honor game, and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient dueling pistol."
"Oh, how fascinating."
I'm party to an actual human duel.
Ready?
"Quite ready, sir."
I don't wanna watch him.
I wasn't talking to you.
"Your girlfriend, she's very pretty."
She's a bitch.
Margaret is an uptight Wasp cunt from Connecticut.
Can I use your works?
"Yeah, It's allright."
But give me an extra four hours.
Sure.
Do me a favor...
Can't get around to get off.
Relax baby.
-Takes a lot.
-You should be happy.
Paul give us some money we can go take a lunch.
So what?
Get ready to go.
It gets this bitch two hours to get ready to go out somewhere.
In the beginning aliens were spotted in places with large amounts of heroin.
"Later, aliens appeared in specific sub cultures, punk cultures."
Still around heroin and in these punk cultures many more strange deaths have occured.
"Big fucking belly, eat your food!"
"Apple pie, shit!"
Why don't you ask something to eat some cheese some...and taste some wine...
Nothing strange about deaths in punk culture.
They kill each other by shooting too much dope.
I remember when we were...
in Cambridge there was war
I think between the Mods and Rockers.
They went on each other with bicycle chains.
I don't think your punks need help from the outside to kill themselves.
My mother used to bake five or six apple pies at once.
Only you can do that.
This was just after you escaped from the Hunters in Afghanistan.
"You're not suicidal, Flynn."
You're angry.
The Hunters did something to you.
"And until you face it, find out what really happened, it will kill you."
So who cares?
Emme does.
You're all she has now.
"Don't let the Hunters take everything away from her, too."
How was Karp?
His shipment's arrived.
I've got everything we needed from him.
What's the status on the reversion?
One of Sterling's solutions was successful.
You've been observing Sterling.
Can you replicate the process?
Can you replicate the process without him?
- Yes.
- Then you know what comes next.
It's all here?
Something so huge contained in these notes.
Incredible.
The incredible thing is our species working together.
"In a few days, I have accomplished what no other human scientist could even dream of."
Imagine what we can learn from one another.
Humans would never accept us.
They see us as monsters.
"You're not monsters, not to me."
Not anymore.
You're just trapped in a skin that doesn't fit you.
"In a world that just doesn't understand you, but people can change."
"You shouldn't feel bad about that because, people will thank you."
- H i Brian.
- What?
"You know I was thinking, this whole thing with the gun and all..."
it would really make an important article for the paper.
"So, I was thinking that you and I should do an interview sometime."
"You know, just to let people know what really happened."
Maybe sometime after school.
What do you think?
What?
See you later.
Has the threat of violence changed the quality of my life at school?
"No, not really."
What do you mean?
I just don't see the point in talking about it.
Sometimes talking itself makes people feel better.
And sometimes talking gets people into trouble.
People say things about people and it doesn't always mean it's true.
You mean about who might be carrying a gun?
- About anything.
- Any weapon?
No.
J ust about anything anybody says about people.
It's not always true.
I just think people want to believe things about people...
so they decide certain things are true and they don't even ask.
And it's not fair.
Because you have to live with it anyway.
"But if it's not true the person could always say that, couldn't they?"
I think if something is false...
people aren't going to keep on believing it.
Usually people latch on to things when there is a kernel of truth.
"I'm taking a piss, asshole!"
- Yeah.
- Yo!
I'm not joining the mile-high club with you.
What about the really high club?
- Are you retarded?
- No.
You brought weed on the fucking airplane?
- Yep.
- What the fuck?
Wait a second.
You were giving that security guard shit.
Yeah.
How else was I supposed to get past him?
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?
- Look--What are you doing?
What is this?
- You'll see.
"Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you to an invention of mine."
Meet the smokeless bong.
- You made this?
"- You know, I did."
When you were slaving away at work...
I was actually being a productive member of society.
"- Yeah, that's really productive."
- Let me show you how it works.
"So you take a little weed... put it in the bowl right here and light it just like a normal bong, OK?"
Now here's the truly genius part.
"Inside this mechanism, I have actually made a little tiny, tiny fan... and some disinfectant powder, OK, it works sort of like a deodorizer... so that anything it expunges smells like Lysol."
- Put it away.
"- No, dude."
Can you not wait till we get to Amsterdam?
You father told you that I wrote the encryption in these documents.
"Now, the part that you can't decipher confirms the existence of a man who wanted to turn over the spies to the USSR."
There was one man responsible for having the Russians killed?
Yes.
One man behind the entire frame-up?
Who is he?
I have no idea.
Doesn't specify a name.
I'd tell you if I knew.
"(Dozer) Okay, these are the photographs that make up the collage."
But this is the one I'd say we should be interested in.
How come?
Because this is Chameleon.
(Angela) Chameleon?
The assassin?
"Yeah, I remembered what you'd said about Walker's death looking professional."
So I ran this picture through the database.
Watch.
It's a match.
She's called Chameleon because she can transform into anyone she wants.
(Angela) I've seen her.
She was at the gallery on opening night.
She must have gone there to threaten Gus into stealing his art back.
"And once she got her hands on that piece and the negatives, she killed him."
Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
"Well, she's pacing."
That can't be good.
Would Chameleon really kill Walker just for catching her on film?
You think there's something else?
There has to be.
Such as?
But they took her.
-Do you know where she is?
- She's a prisoner underground at the Base of Dulce.
And they have been torturing her.
- So the telepathic link between the two of you is how they tracked you?
-Yes.
-Look... uh...
I have no idea what you must be going through right now.
You never told me her name.
-Her name is Alyssa.
And she carries my child.
- I've been an associate of Chayton's since the early 90's.
He's devoted his life to researching anomalous phenomenon has established a strong following in the UFO arena.
"He was one of the first to get hold of the secret flying disk file of the FBI and sensitive documents from the CIA, air force, army and other government agencies."
"The price he's paid for being the truth to the public are death threats, imprisonment and getting shot at."
"He is a good man, and I trust him as I would a brother."
"- Thanks a lot, Derek."
I appreciate it.
Can you give us a moment?
"You don't know how good it is to see you, my friend Chayton."
-Likewise.
You look good.
-I'm a lot better than I feel.
Uh... this is the gentleman I was telling you about.
Jaelen.
-Welcome.
-I'm gonna show him the footage.
-Why don't we start with your name?
-Jaelen.
-Jaelen?
"So, Jaelen, who are you?"
- Our task was to monitor human conditions.
I don't hate you.
It's not possible to hate you.
You're...
What the hell was it that Reynolds called you the other day?
Groovy.
You're a groovy chick.
"No, what I, um, do detest is your selfishness."
I have served this nation without regard for personal income for over ten years.
You are selfish because you want to take on a job that positions you to assume... a mantle of gigantic responsibility... and you do it full well with the knowledge...
Of what?
What?
"Greatness is the orphan of urgency, Laine."
Greatness only emerges when we need it most... in times of war or calamity.
I can't ask somebody to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.
They were men created by their times.
What I can ask for is the promise of greatness.
"And that, Madam Senator... you don't have."
"Well, then..."
"I just wouldn't be using sex as leverage... if I were you, Sheldon."
Because there's one thing you don't want.
It's a woman with her finger on the button who isn't getting laid.
Will that be the argument the senator offers up before the committee?
Sir?
Can I get you something to drink?
"- Uh, no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
- You sure?
"No, great."
Thanks a lot.
"- Ah, Mr. Webster."
- Mr. President.
- Good to see you.
Wish I could say the same.
Not while you're pointing a gun at me or trying to.
"Well, no, you're an invisible guy with a sword."
I think you might have the advantage over me.
My point exactly.
"So what happened to you, James?"
What happened?
"I mean, I know we had our differences"
And I know Carol... happened.
"You always had your own ideas,"
Your own objections to warehouse policy.
"But, I mean, James, James--killing people."
When did you turn into that?
"I woke up, Arthur."
Ah.
Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic's iron hand
"And your neuroses,"
I could see the world more clearly.
"Yeah, well, you know, that's a little pathetic,"
"Isn't it, James, blaming everybody else but yourself?"
I don't think you found clarity.
I don't think your ego could stand the light.
I'd love to discuss this with you at length.
You or one of your new agents.
"Lattimer and Bering, right?"
I've been observing them for some time.
"I see they have potential, but they're so raw,"
"So untrained, so corruptible."
"If you come anywhere near them, I promise you--"
"I promise you, James, that you're going to regret it."
You'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I'm alive!
"Arthur, you can still read my mind."
"Warthog meat is light, like turkey."
"But wonderful, and very, very tasty."
"A man is always young and trim, For him time stands still"
Meanwhile his wife will age.
Pointless to express outrage
"Or mourn her youth or shed tears, in truth"
For what's left of her days.
as she helplessly decays
"While he, with vigor blessed."
Beats on his heroic chest
"He feels again his vigor grow, His manhood stiffens down below"
"Whenever a lass he spies, A superman, he feels with pride"
Since ere the world began its highest principle is man
Are you doing a good job?
I want the bathroom spotless.
"Yes, mistress."
Spotless!
No slacking!
"Yes, mistress."
"Thank you, mistress."
I was always very dominant.
But it's not that I try to impose my will on other people.
That's not at all who I am.
I respect other people.
"For me, it's very important to respect people."
But I enjoy it and...
I like that when I say something.
it'll be done.
I absolutely adore my love slave.
And the opposite is also true:
He worships me.
I doesn't affect our love - on the contrary.
I'm going to tell her we can't make it.
"Oh, no."
You have to go.
I don't understand.
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.
And we're going to use that to our advantage.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp."
"She could ferret out Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as:"
Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.
They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
Don't worry.
I'll teach you.
I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
"Okay, I don't know you people."
I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
I don't want anything in my ample bosom.
"Come on, Strawberries."
Take one for the team.
"♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪"
♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...
Wait!

♪ The Earth began to cool ♪
"♪ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ♪"

"♪ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ♪"
"Oh, yes."
The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste entire regions.
An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible.
You did it didn't you?
They wants you to go for it!
"Wow, Marcus!"
"They wants you to get a hold of the ark before the Nazis do, and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it."
And the museum?
The museum gets the ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
"You know, five years ago I would have gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Will she still be with him?
Possibly.
"Marion is the least of your worries right now, believe me Indy."
What do you mean?
"Well, I mean, for nearly three thousand years, man has been searching for the lost Ark."
That's not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
"Oh, Marcus, what are you trying to do, Scare me?"
You sound like my mother.
We've known each other for a long time -
"I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus."
I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You're talking about the boogie-man.
"Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am."
"Well, at least let me give you one of these whole-grain muffins."
"Oh, come on."
Think of chewing as an aerobic exercise.
Ugh... just holding this muffin is making me feel bloated.
Huh?
(munching)
"One man's trash, baby."
"One, two, three, four, their prices are low, but their morals are lower!"
"Well, once again, you're overreacting."
Overreacting gets results!
I am simply exercising my right to free speech.
"Uh-huh, and the rotten fruit?"
Visual aids.
"Hilda, I've made an appointment for you with the president of the Everything Emporium to sit down and discuss the matter, if you'd like to try the mature approach."
Fine.
I just hope I can return that cow manure.
What are the odds that the cafeteria would have the bacon cheeseburgers and chocolate sundaes on the same day?
"I know, it's like winning the lottery."
Did you misplace your entree?
No.
"I'm trying to lose weight, so I can fit in my new dress."
The dress that's going to make us a lock for King and Queen.
Good.
So we're both doing our part.
"What's yours, eating like Henry VIII?"
Don't pretend like you haven't noticed my mustache.
"Oh, I see it."
"No, that's just a shadow."
(low gurgling)
Does anyone else hear that strange buzzing sound?
Yes.
Like the low hum of an incoming B-52.
"You are strong with the force, little one."
"Thank you, master."
"Thank you, master."
Master!
Revenge.
I must have revenge.
I can sense the darkness within you.
I will teach you the ways of the dark side.
But you must prove yourself first.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
"No, I will destroy the jedi."
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
And now you shall die.
Dooku.

"You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?"
"I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes."
"(Gordon) Come on, Derrick."
(Derrick) I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
"(Gordon) How long, Derrick?"
"Uh, momentarily."
One minute to go.
"(Derrick) They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time."
"(Gordon) Derrick, 30 seconds to go!"
(Announcer) Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
"(Announcer) Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?"
Ay yi yi.
"Dude, you haven't done any of these yet."
I know!
But who cares?
I got all the time in the world.
"I mean, I'm only turning thirty."
Thirty?
No one's thirty.
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?
"So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs..."
Appendectomy?
Now that ain't right!
"Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia."
"Well, I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé instead of my wife tonight, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying!"
?
"Tell you what, I'll think about it."
My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
"Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either."
Dr. Cox!
Dr. Cox!
No!
Awful!
Hypnosis is a very powerful tool.
It's helped people with depression and weight loss it helped me quit smoking.
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges.
"Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best:"
"Knock her out, and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel."
I think you should do it.
Knock her out and dig.
Do it.
Dig.
Do it.
Dig.
"Mandrian came in, discovered whoever it was, and had to be silenced."
"The murderer then went out, taking the saw with him."
"Sonheim's story is true, he just happened to be the one to discover the body."
Then who did kill Mandrian?
The same person who killed Rafford and Dortmunn.
And I know who that is now.
You know?
Yes.
"I should have seen it right from the start, but my mind had conditioned itself to see the wrong thing."
As Cally has been saying all along.
You found the meaning?
Yes.
Just before he died Rafford managed to scrawl this out.
54124?
Precisely What's it mean?
Absolutely nothing.
"As a number it has no significance at all, but in the filter plant just now, I noticed one of the instruments."
"Liquid crystals show a number, then the confirmation circuit translates those numbers into the written word."
"From the start, we thought that those were numbers."
"They are not, they are letters."
Letters?
Rafford was dying.
It's difficult to be neat under those circumstances.
Let's start with the one and the two.
And the first letter.
So now you know.
"It doesn't matter, you'd have known soon enough anyway."
"Sara, why?"
I wanted the neutrotope
Or at least the money it would give me.
It's that simple.
Was Mandrian in it with you?
We've got her!
She's coming around!
They've done it!
Let go of grappling irons.
All larboard guns to bear on the fire ship.
Fire!
The flagship's under way and into the fight.
The French are running back into port!
"Look there, sir!"
"- They're a good crew, sir."
"- Signal from the flagship, sir."
"Thank you, Defiant, for swift and honorable action."
"""Thank you for swift and honorable action."""
"No mutineers onboard this ship now, sir."
"Bring her about, Mr. Ponsonby."
- We join the squadron.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Stand by to go about!
"Thank you, Mr. Crawford."

And so I hope you'll find these estimate satisfactory.
"I personally had them prepared by our very ablest man,"
"Mister, uh, well, whoever it was."
"And as my late boss, good old Jess Devro, used to say,"
"""When you're sending in the A team with all the horses behind you..."""
"Well, you know the sort of thing he used to say, Lita."
Why do you supposed I wanted you to take this instead of just a secretary?
"Oh, who's trotting the estimates over to Phoenix?"
They ought to be there before the weekend.
"Clem Sandover, I believe."
Why are you...?
Why is she pointing at me?
Why you rolling toward me?
You're in front of the door.
Uh...
Oh.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
What happened to you?
What happened was this:
The bee man was not composed of bees.
The drones nested around their queen  safe inside the bee man 's mouth.
But when he spat the queen  she signaled her drones to attack any perceived predator.
"Unlike Kentucky Fitz, Chuck kept a cool head and an open mouth."
She was not perceived as a predator  but a nest.
Look.
That's Betty Bee as a little girl.
"Well, either she was an unfortunately hairy child..."
Or Betty Bee is the terrifying bee man.
- Wasn't she with you?
- She didn't get off the elevator.
She must have come back up here to wiggity-whack you for being a spy.
Like she wiggity-whacked Kentucky.
"Well, my wiggity wasn't whacked."
And I got the bee key.
- That's a house key.
I know what house.
As Chuck followed the bee key that was key  Olive Snook followed her homesick heart to the confessional.
Are they affiliated with anybody up here?
They seem to have good relations with a Latino street gang that moved up here from L.A. about 3 years ago.
"That gang was originally from Guatemala, very tight, impossible to penetrate."
Half of them were in the army.
"These are the guys who are gonna take Reardon's place, much nastier."
Let's talk about what might happen if Reardon left the dope scene.
- You predict chaos.
- Mayhem.
You can already smell it.
"Now with the Americans in the picture, it could get even uglier."
They bring a lot of guns along.
It gets exponentially crazier.
We should be proactive on this and pursue your idea of trying to encourage an alliance.
That might avoid all that.
Can you speak to Dante about that?
See if you can plant that in his ear?
Thanks for listening to me.
"How are you, honey?"
You want some more juice?
- What are you doing today?
- I'm gonna take Sweet shopping and look for a crib.
"I thought after, I'd take them to see the house we're looking at."
That's a good idea.
"Let me know what you think, besides the fact they're asking ten-times too much."
Have fun.
Did Ronnie tell you two we wanted you
- to be godparents?
- I'd be so proud.
Thank you.
Really?
Thank you.
What an honour.
This place is tiny!
And I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hangin' all over the bathroom.
"They're called boxers, Carla."
"They're satin, J.D.?"
With a breathable cotton crotch panel!
King me!
"Ugh, I need to find someone to split the rent at my place."
I thought you were getting good money at your new fellowship?
"So first, my fellowship gets canceled because some jackass cures the disease, and now the only job I can get is working at this crappy free clinic for eight bucks an hour."
No one's life could be worse than mine!
Uh...the...fellowship's great!
Heh!
"Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them"
I'm working at a free clinic!
I sense she doesn't want me to tell them.
Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom!
"Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secrets commercial."
I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!
You know... you--you two could solve both of your problems if you just moved in together.
- Whooooooa.
Hold your horses!
- Whoa!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, and whoa-ho!"
We have a very complicated past.
"Yeah, I hurt her, and I'm not proud."
I'm a little proud.
"We've managed to restore our friendship, though, by staying away from dangerous topics."
"Yeah, relationships, and things of that nature."
J.D. and I keep it superficial.
Love the superficial.
Dynamite teeth today!
"Oh, thanks, buddy!"
"It's hardly the style for you, dear."
I asked the chauffeur to bring the car around.
I do have a cab waiting.
Howard can take care of that.
I would prefer it if Corbett drove you.
As you like.
"- Merle, we'll be late if--"
"- Goodbye, Aunt Olivia,"
- Uncle Howard--
- Enjoy yourselves.
"But be back by 5:00, remember?"
"You need your rest, Merle."
We'll remember.
"Come on, Merle, let's go."
Bye-bye.
"She's quite beautiful, isn't she, Howard?"
Miss Gilbert?
"Yes, I suppose she is."
"Still, on the whole, I think you'd prefer Margo Stevens-- [chuckle]-- if you had your pick, that is."
Must we go through this every time--
"Oh, don't flatter yourself that I'm jealous, Howard, of Margo or any of the other silly young creatures that you mentally pursue."
It's the effect of your behavior on Merle that I'm thinking of.
"Oh, good heavens."
Merle will be 21 next week.
"And as her trusted trustee, can you honestly say that Merle is mature enough to even pick out her own movies, let alone watch her uncle make a fool of himself?"
"Oh, Olivia, for heaven's--"
"Howard, I think you'd better pay off that cab driver, hadn't you?"
I wish Aunt Olivia would let me buy dresses like that.
I wish I could afford dresses like that.
"Good afternoon, ladies."
"If I'm in time for lunch, I think I'll have a watercress sandwich and a little bowl of fruit."
"Oh, aren't we funny."
"All along I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return, as your Major Sinclair can confirm."
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shootout."
The shootout?
"No, no, no, no, no."
Although there is still a fatal traffic incident about which we must question Mr Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes."
But complications do occur.
"- Hmm, may I visit him?"
"- Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
"As for Mr Stonebridge and Mr Crawford, tomorrow we will send troops into the desert."
I only pray we find them before the bandits who have his daughter.
"It would be deeply regrettable if all my men brought back, were their two corpses."
"Rest assured, Minister, that if none of them make it back, then the photographs they took at the exchange"
will tell a story that I think most of us would rather keep private.
"Thank you, Minister."
Major.
"Yeah, I've got your back."
Move.
- What is it?
- Arakee.
Drink.
And then we shall eat.
"Come on, get it together."
Do you wish to know how much your father thinks you are worth?
I have no father.
You are all of his world.
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.
But why would Betty wanna kill Kentucky?
Maybe she didn't kill Kentucky.
Woolsey handpicked Kentucky to be the new face of Betty's Bees and then she betrayed him.
"Yep, she sabotaged his company and stole his bees."
She played him like Boo Boo the fool.
Boo Boo had it coming.
Woolsey tells me I'm too old and slaps my name on an inferior product.
"Did you know there's now 60 percent less honey in all Betty's Bees honey-based products, including honey?"
"He wants the company, have it, but I'll be damned if he can have my bees."
"Hello, Kitty."
And you.
You're not a temp.
Who are you people?
We're investigators hired by Kentucky's husband to find her killer.
There is no killer.
That's what the police told me.
Can't prosecute a swarm of bees for murder.
You can prosecute Woolsey Nicholls.
I loved Kentucky like a sister.
But if I told the police Woolsey killed her because we sabotaged his company I would go to jail longer than Woolsey would for murder.
Jail might be a safer place.
I was attacked in your office by a swarm of bees.
- I think those were meant for you.
If you loved Kentucky tell the police.
You can't let Woolsey get away.
Woolsey is gonna get away with murder.
Unless you can pull his DNA off those bees.
Oh.
"Please, don't get up."
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Emerson Cod.
I'd like to ask you questions about the murder of Kentucky Fitz.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
I'm sure of it.
Why's that?
"Grandma doesn't like America, and it's only natural."
"After all, Grandpa was killed by the atomic bomb."
I think he's right.
"You see, none of us and none of our parents know about war."
As for the atomic bomb...
"Sure, we've all heard about it."
But it meant nothing more than a sort of little scary fairy tale.
We never really understood the feelings of the people... who had the atom bomb dropped over their heads.
We never stopped to think.
Look at my mother.
"Just by being told that there's a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited."
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.
Big Sis!
"Here, eat these."
I'm really pleased... that you are so concerned about me.
I'm very grateful.
"But then, it was a long time ago when I felt bitter about America."
It's been more than 45 years since Grandpa died.
"Now, I don't particularly like... or dislike America."
It's all because of war.
War is to blame.
During the war many Japanese died... and many Americans also died.
Listen... because of a man called Suzujiro or whatever...
I don't think it's right for you to talk badly about your parents.
Can't save the world.
Not trying to.
How long have you known rosie?
"2 years,give or take a fight or three."
What is he claiming?
That mrs.
Neuwirth could have been saved.
There's a chance of settlement.
I don't want to settle if it's going to leave a cloud of doubt over this hospital.
"Code zero,possible hijacking,assailants unknown."
You've got to move your belongings and find a permanent residence.
You don't have to respond to everything they throw at you.
"Yes,I do."
Maybe you can defend every action you've ever taken.
Some day you must tell me what that's like.

"We start with ""el paseo,"" the stroll."
No other dance connects 2 people more closely than the tango.
Emotionally as well as physically.
"There is skill, communication, and intimacy like none other."
Thought tennis was a gentleman's game.
"Hey,too bad you didn't break your arm before the match."
"Why don't you piss off,you dick!"
"Or would you like another forehead across the head, 'cause you broke the wrong arm."
Hold still.
That's the only shot you made today.
That's it.
Don't move.
I'm outta here.
You promised.
"No,I promised I'd get physical therapy not public humiliation."
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
Stop worrying.
She'll recover her mood pretty quick.
"Still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"If she starts to say that she won't go again, it'll be a serious problem."
"""I received your telegram."
"""Clark will come right away, Suzujiro. """
I knew that telegram would mess things up.
Americans do resent being reminded of the atom bomb.
Japanese-Americans are especially sensitive about it.
I think they feel embarrassed by the Americans.
I wonder why Clark is coming here?
"Well, that's..."
He's probably coming... to wind up this matter once and for all.
I see.
To tell us to forget the whole thing.
"By the way, I guess I must be going, now."
"Matt, please listen to me."
No!
"No, I should've known you'd go behind my back."
"Okay, but I have a long list of people seriously considering adopting them."
- I ain't interested!
- Why not?
"Because, quite frankly, I can save time and money sending them to auction."
"Matt, please, I don't believe you!"
"Look, these horses, they could have great homes."
There are people willing to pay for them.
The end result is the same.
There's still money in your pocket.
"Okay, here's the deal."
I'm a reasonable man.
- Okay...
- Do whatever you want with them...
"But... tomorrow morning, they go to the highest bidder, be it the glue factory or someone who wants to adopt."
"So... go ahead and rally your troops, but I'll be the one making the final decision."
All right.
I understand your husband works in Vancouver.
"- Um, how often is he home?"
"- He travels for work, but that doesn't put a strain on the relationship."
A strain?
Why do you use that word?
"No, no."
I said there isn't... a strain.
Moving on.
"Um, let's discuss Georgie's recent injury."
Can you take me through how that actually happened?
Georgie takes trick riding lessons and she was practicing in our ring.
"You know, I'm surprised someone as young as Georgie's"
- doing such a dangerous sport.
Mother... you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?
"Tonight's dinner was quite a spread, but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?"
Because the grownups' chatter wasn't enjoyable.
Let's eat their souvenir.
Tateo... don't you find it strange?
Why do they hide everything about Grandpa?
"To put it nicely, they do that out of consideration for Suzujiro and Clark."
"And to put it not nicely, it's sort of a diplomatic tactic and calculation."
"To put it straight, they don't want to ruin the relationship... with that rich family that they've suddenly got."
Hold on.
You mean that Grandma is just being used as an excuse?
That's terrible.
That's the reality of being a grownup.
"Still, I hate it."
Can you take it?
Me?
Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.
"At any rate, the pineapple farm is tremendously vast."
It has eight thousand and some hundred acres.
There are six huge chimneys soaring up from the canning factory.
There is this huge swimming pool in the patio of the house.
Clark's wife got a swimsuit out for me to use.
"But you see, I can't swim."
"And Clark took us on a tour of the factory, too."
Did you know the factory's agency is in Tokyo?
I know that.
They've got agencies in every big city in the world.
"Tell me, what is Clark's wife like?"
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.
"He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York."
"The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport."
"They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days."
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
[soft dramatic music]
?
?
"For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life I'd been allowed to see."
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
"I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there."
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
[violin music]
?
?
"My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues."
I figured I'd start at the top:
the guy with the glasses.

[dog barking] [chuckles] Mr. Johnson.
Good to meet you.
"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
You're Lou's son?
Yes.
"Generations go by quickl y, don't they?"
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
Really?
"Yell, think of anybody else."
"Just a little fucked-up jumble of misdirected, immature, poly-sexuality and pure, arrogant, impotent rage."
So...
"What you got, big boy?"
Get off me.
"You don't know a fucking thing about me, you sanctimonious cunt."
"But since we're playing the guessing game, let's make a few assumptions."
"A divorced, lonely, middle-aged lecturer, who lives alone"
- and gets his rocks off...
- You're really fucking...
Gets his fucking rocks off trying to sleep with fucking first years.
Other hobbies include intimidation and furtive masturbation.
I bet you thought you'd died and gone to heaven when you got here.

And I don't wanna go where you've been.
"So in answer to your earlier question, you should've given me a place here."
I'd have been the best student you'd ever had.
Here he comes.
"Welcome back, Tony."
"Congratulations, Tony."
"Good work, sir."
Enjoy.
"The pleasure is all yours, sir."
The pleasure is all yours.
You're not coming?
"To the people in The Dark Knight shooting, my heart goes out to them."
"Anybody that's lost their life to gun violence or any artillery, my heart goes out to them."
It's not a good thing.
But I be thinking... about that Dark Knight thing.
"And, uh, there couldn't have been no hood Black people there, right?"
"'Cause they would've had they guns ready, right?"
"Like, as soon as he pulled his thing out, they'd be like,"
"""What's your problem, dog?"
"""You better go somewhere with that bull, bro."
"""We've been waiting two months to see this movie, all right?"
"You better go shoot up Ice Age 4."""
"And then in the Boston bombing, they couldn't even get no Black people 'cause we was already finished with the race, so..."
"We was at IHOP just eating a short stack, looking at the damn-- Like, ""What?"""
"""When in the hell did this happen?"""
"""This Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity good as a bitch though, I'll tell you that."""
And people always say the same thing when bad things happen.
"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God!"""
This is my impression of a concerned white woman.
"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God, Karen!"""
It's always a Karen.
"""Oh, my God, Karen!"""
"Yo, I learned something."
"You want to go to a white people's party, say you know Karen."
They will take care of your ass the whole day.
"""You know Karen?"
"""Well, come on, sit down."
"Have a pumpkin spice latte."""
"Now, I'm gonna tell you why these bad things happen."
Anyone will go bonkers or finished if he sees me...
"If I allow him to touch me, anyone would become my slave..."
"If I give little liberty on me, anyone will go mad..."
Anyone would die in the fire of my desire...
It's run into the wilderness...
It's fire of passion of fans...
This attack is fatal...
Nobody can stop this stealing of hearts...
"If you make a request, you'll enjoy the fun..."
"If you tease with romance, I'll take you to the bliss..."
It seems he's a latest thief.
"Without any discrimination, he's robbing every one."
The doors remain closed but the money inside vanishes.
That's the magic!
"Forget all this, I'm giving you full powers as the Home Minister."
Close down his file swiftly.
- First theft...
- July 5th.
It happened on 5th.
12 thefts in 10 months.
"According to you, it's Rs.75 crores."
Much more according to me.
He didn't spare anyone.
"Before robbing doctor, his name appeared on newspaper a day earlier."
Lawyer appeared on TV a day earlier before he was robbed.
He robbed Minister's home a day after he commented on the thief.
All his victims were news makers before getting robbed by him.
He's leaving clues to us and enjoying our inability.
He's not a regular thief.
Hey you!
Did you read the files already?
I read him well.
"Well, not to be impolite, but, you know, sometimes a gal will be kissin' around on, like, the area near your genitals, but not quite on your genitals."
Makes me ticklish and insecure.
"You know, not to be impolite, but sometimes a gal will do some kissin' on the ears, which makes me uncomfortable, because even though I clean my ears, sometimes a tater will just roll out of there unexpected."
(CHUCKLES)
I kind of likes both those things.
"Yeah, it's why you're called ""Squirrely Dan."""
"Yeah, reason fuckin' five million."
"Well, nots to be impolite, but..."
This gal suggested that maybe I should have some attentions paid
to my butts hole.
That ever...
Ever happen to you guys?
Did you ever have a gal suggest that you need some attentions paid
to your butts holes?
"I'll take that as a hard no, I guess?"
She put a couple of fingers up there and...
It turns out you got a...
An erogenous zone up there.
Found...
Found the hot button and...
"Gaves it a tickle and, uh..."
Yeah.
"Feels, uh..."
"It feels pretty good, you guys, okay?"
- Pop fly.
- I really liked it.
It felt...
Felt very natural.
Nice.
That's how you get the body in front of it.
- Get the body in front of it.
"- They call it ""milking the prostate."""
Stop worrying.
She'II recover her mood pretty quick.
"still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"No, but I telephoned him last night."
Most extraordinary.
Are you quite certain that you haven't a gentleman named Edward McDermott stopping here?
- Absolutely.
- Then how could I have spoken to him?
"- It's beyond me, miss."
- I'm certain there's nothing to worry about.
Go up to your room and make yourself comfortable.
"And meanwhile, I'll scout around and see if I can find your Mr. McDermott."
- You must think this very stupid of me.
"- Not at all, not at all."
Your friend must surely be around here somewhere.
"I'll try and find him, and then give you a ring in your room."
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.
- Where's Manville?
"It was wrong, sir."
I did it without thinking.
"It got me in trouble, which I accept full responsibility for."
"It made trouble for the Navy, which I would fix if I could, but I can't."
And it got Fanny in terrible trouble.
Her life is at risk for wanting to be with me.
I'm sorry about all of it.
I really am.
How long has the cord been prolapsed?
"Since right before we called you, Dr. Chadway."
Foetal heart rate is falling again.
- She had an epidural?
- Two hours ago.
All right.
Prepare for a C-section.
- Bud!
- The head's too far down.
Get me a vacuum and call Neonatal for resuscitation at delivery.
"I'll take it from here, Dr. Chadway."
"- Where have you been, Dr. Gettis?"
- With another patient.
"Okay, Harriet, the next contraction, get ready to push."
Petty Officer Elling.
Would you and your counsel please stand?
You may announce the sentence.
"Petty Officer Third Class James Elling, in consideration of your plea of guilty to all charges and specifications and your declared remorse, this court-martial sentences you to be reduced to the rank of seaman and to forfeit $500 pay per month for three months."
"Members, thank you for your service."
This court-martial is adjourned.
- No brig time?
- No brig time.
"I gotta go see Fanny, sir."
"Yes, you do."
"You got frostbite, avalanches, and deadly icicles."
Icicles aren't deadly.
They're refreshing and delicious.
They're knives that can fall from the sky at any moment.
Sky knives!
- They kill a billion people a year.
- That seems high.
"Dad, come on."
It's snow day.
Can't we at least go outside and build one tiny awesome snow fortress?
Absolutely not!
You shovel that walkway before it turns into ice.
"And no forts, I mean it!"
"Naturally, we did the opposite 'cause forts are awesome!"
"Good job, dude."
"I can't feel my fingers, but this definitely was two hours well spent."
Do you think maybe we should shovel the walkway a little so Dad doesn't totally freak?
"Yeah, we should..."
after a quick expansion.
Quick's good.
Whatcha thinking?
"I'm picturing a master bedroom with an attached bath, butler's quarters, a dojo, one of those maze gardens, all of the rooms from ""Clue,"""
an indoor basketball court.
A basketball court inside a snow fort?
That's just the first floor.
The second level's where the party's at.
"Hot tub, sauna, fire pit."
You don't think that'll create an awful lot of heat?
Yeah...
- once the word gets out.
- Son of a bitch.
A fort?
"So, I refused to front him the money, because I didn't want to encourage him."
"But maybe he did, anyway."
If he did...
The escort agency-- you got the address?
"Well, yeah, we need everything you got."
Sooner the better.
What's going on?
Your text said you were looking into an escort agency.
That was the idea.
He's on the phone with the fire marshal.
"Based on the weathering of this tape and the graying of the ash, the place was burned down two days ago."
No question it was arson.
Agency's computers and paperwork were all covered with gasoline and lit up.
Problem is finding who did it.
Agency employees all vanished.
"Paperwork's gone, and the names that I could find are fake."
The whole thing was owned by a shell company.
- Sounds like organized crime.
- Yeah.
I wish I could tell you which kind.
Office manager was named
"Carla Petro, but nobody who met her thought she looked Italian, and her name is as fake as the rest."
Is he okay?
He's fine.
"Your arsonist was driving a fully-restored, vintage Ford Mustang, model year 1965, '66, '67 or '68."
Color unknown.
How can you know that?
You say in your report you found a charred wastebasket inside.
You thought it was used to splash petrol around the office.
So?
"So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?"
Why not a gas can?
"If p is, qpurely and simply, this man could be a dishonest guy."
The car has broken down.
"Why is he saying,"
"""There's nothing wrong with the car?"""
I'd personally not propose him to anyone.
You've become such a malign person.
Forget about this proposition and go check what it is that the girls want.
You're an impolite student who leads the way and never stays behind.
Sit down!
"Mom, you shouldn't have troubled yourself."
"It was no trouble at all, my dear son."
My point of view in life had changed.
"According to my birth certificate, I was 20 but I had already lost... my joy in life."
Now I can only dream of the days... when I was filled with joy and happiness.
My writing has received a lot from my mother's illness.
Which of the following could be said for the person mentioned in the paragraph?
He has become a different person because of the things he's lived through.
"Dude, he chose the correct answer which was B."
He's actually answering the questions.
"Hey man, how are your studies going?"
Good.
I am studying.
How many correct answers did you get from Math and Science?
Around 67.
67?
I was getting 82 just for Math and Science.
You should also answer the questions on Social Science.
How much did you get?
He can't even answer that question.
He's totally bad in Social Science.
"But, if you ask him about the top 10 he'd answer instantly."
He'll become a pop star.
"For a man pushing 100, you're amazingly well preserved."
How accommodating of the Society to provide members with rejuvenation drugs.
You should see the dental plan.
"(Malone) We've been aware of you for some time, Detective."
"Despite all the roadblocks we've thrown in your path, you've managed to persevere."
"- Yeah, I'm funny that way."
- You are impressive that way.
What if I told you the Society might be willing to offer you membership?
Provided you pass a loyalty test.
You want me to prove my good faith?
How will you prove yours?
With a bit of information.
Courtesy of David Xanatos - one of our lower-echelon members.
You've got my attention.
You OK?
Our shift's almost over and you haven't said three words all night.
Let... me... drive.
"- Hey, pal, it's my car."
- I insist.
All I could think about was what Elisa had told me.
"I was feeling hurt, betrayed and, most of all, angry."
Make sure you buckle up.
(tires squeal)
I saw Malone today.
The old man had a lot to say - not just about the Illuminati.
"Uh, that's great, but easy on the gas, OK?"
He told me I knew someone who could blow the lid off another conspiracy.
One a lot closer to home.
"Matt, slow down!"
This is nuts.
"This is the end, Elisa."
The end of all the lies and deception.
No badgers.
You know what?
I had this debate and I'm going to get skinned alive for this...
I would almost...
My son's at a certain age now.
..would rather go out and buy a mucky book to pretend to hide than him go on the internet.
That horror.
Just like a copy of Razzle.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
"Just something really normal and go, ""This doesn't represent women."""
"And a nice letters page, where people having sex with each other..."
"As a kid, I'm going..."
"Bathtime, overfill the bath."
"And my dad kept saying to me, ""I'm going to drill the bath"", like they do in the boarding houses so that you keep flooding the bathroom."
I just liked being totally submerged and hiding my shame.
One day I flooded the bathroom and I took the panel off and I'm going to soak it up with towel and I found one of my brother's magazines.
A bath panel - that's what YOU said.
In the bath.
"Well, the magazine..."
It was beautiful.
It was so well-hidden and it was...
Cherished.
It was a cherished item.
There was a woman in there dressed as a policewoman and...
I kind of knew she wasn't a policewoman.
There wasn't the full uniform.
And I was always kind of...
I wasn't always visual.
I needed a back-story and I developed this thing over time.
I had this special relationship with her where she'd arrested me.
For what?
Stop it!
"Stop it, stop it."
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
- You're condoning this?
!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
That'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom.
Hyperalgesia.
The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
"His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing."
Suit up.
Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
"No, but maybe... maybe what?"
"Maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?"
And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
"God, you're weak."
Guy steals your article... tells you you're not his friend... and you still want to risk your life for him.
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
"God, you're weak."
Guy tried to kill you.
First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.
"Oh, don't get sensitive."
Y'all act like I said Flavor Flav.
Don't get sensitive.
Don't give a damn what R. Kelly did.
He makes good music.
"He makes stepping' songs, baby."
And stepping' songs means something to everybody up in here.
"Steppin' songs be the jump-off to cookouts, don't they?"
Don't they?
Don't they?
"Ma'am, you be at a cookout."
Let The Electric Slide come on.
You will drop your potato salad right there.
That's what you'll do.
"Hey, folks, there's a song that has been out for years."
It's called the Cha-Cha Slide.
"Now you let that song come on anywhere, let that song come on when my family's at a funeral."
"Well, guess what, if we carrying the casket, we dropping it right damn there."
That's what's gonna happen.
"Let the music play long enough, the corpse start dancing."
"Corpse come out of the casket, ""Whoo, Charlie Brown,"" he be--"
"Everybody at the funeral, ""Aah!"""
I make that noise when I get excited.
"Like, look, if I'm getting a haircut, and it look really good,"
"I look at myself in the mirror and I be like,"
"""Oh, look at that boy."
That boy fresh.
"Look at that boy, that boy!"""
"Now if they cut me up to back too far, and have a cul-de-sac on top of my shit, have me looking like Stephen A. Smith, well, I'll go right into it, I be..."
"""Oh, this is blasphemous."
"""On the cusp of what seems to be"
"""one of the biggest interviews of my life,"
"Mr. Ohnhouse, you were in the next room at the time... under the orders of Marshal Belle... and you listened very carefully to the conversation... between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn."
Is that correct?
Yes.
Will you tell the court exactly what you took down at that time?
The last thing Mr. Horn said before leaving Joe Belle's office was:
"""When I shot that kid..."
"""it was the best shot I ever made..."
"""and the dirtiest trick I ever did."""
I want order in this courtroom.
Your witness.
No questions.
You may step down.
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth... so help you God?"
Did you listen carefully to contents of the transcription... as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?
"Yes, I did."
And you understand that this is a record of your conversation with Marshal Belle?
"Well, it was ""Mr. Horn said this"" and ""Mr. Belle said that."""
I don't follow.
What I'm trying to get you to understand... is that that was a conversation between me and Joe Belle.
I understood that.
Do you?
"Yes, I do."
Do you consider it an accurate transcription of that conversation?
You'll have to ask that fellow that wrote it down.
I don't know how good he was at it.
Can you offer us an opinion?
What did you say your name was?
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.
"Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk."
Why?
Oh?
And?
"We'd like you to come with us, Luke Stokkart."
And if I refuse?
Milk Callaud will not live.
I see.
I thought it was strange that Ryner Lute would take the captain with him.
So that's it.
The ones who abducted her were all of you.
And your aim was me?
What are you babbling on about?
Come quietly!
This is...
"Yes, it's a Magic Trap."
"Ah, I'd recommend not moving."
"If you lift a foot, you'll be blown away without a trace."
"After all, I'd rather not have fellow servants of Roland die."
How did you?
I can tell from the way you carry yourself.
You're all people who received martial training in Roland.
"And the person who has employed men like you, who has abducted Milk Callaud, and who has business with me, would likely be none other than Miran Froaude."
I'm impressed.
"You've done your research on me, have you?"
"Lord Froaude, my deepest apol..."
"You are Lieutenant General Miran Froaude, I presume?"
"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Sergeant Luke Stokkart."
I'm well aware of your strength.
Undefeated in twenty battles.
And all in situations with numerical inferiority that should have spelled certain defeat.
"You've done impressive research, considering that in most of those battles, I never gave my real name."
It seems men of this caliber weren't even enough to properly test you.
Where is Captain Milk?
Boring.
When do we get in contact with Hunter?
"Ms. Lance, are you all right?"
How do we get the Waverider back here?
"- Hi, Daddy, we miss you."
- And love you.
- And love you.
"- Captain,"
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Tell me you've located Savage.
"No, but we have received a transmission from 2016 Star City."
I don't understand.
This should have worked.
Did you account for subspace interference?
It's the first thing I thought of.
Did you adjust for temporal polarity?
"Oh, Raymond, you insult me."
Can you reach the Waverider or not?
We're working on it.
"Actually, guys, I think it just worked."
I thought I made my intentions perfectly clear.
And we wish to be equally clear about ours.
- Do you mind?
- Just checking to see if you're real this time.
You're not ditching us again.
"When the mission's over, then we can all go"
- our separate ways.
- And this mission is not over.
"Yeah, just curious how much headway you've had tracking Savage without all of us."
None.
"But neither have I got myself into bar fights in 1975 and the Old West, put dwarf star technology into the hands of terrorists, or got myself turned into a scary bird monster."
We get your point.
"Well, I'm sorry you took such a risk to hear bad news."
"Well, that isn't why I came."
I wanted to see how far the flood level's fallen.
Why?
"I had hoped we could tunnel in from the lower city and lay mines under the Magnetrix terminal, but the floodwater's too high."
"In the early days of the fighting, we blew the reservoirs."
The terminal is their communication centre?
"If we could knock it out, they'd be isolated."
Couldn't you infiltrate an assault group?
Or is it too heavily defended?
"It's not defended, but the city's sealed off."
- What is it?
- Sealed off.
About 100 years ago they sealed off the old monorail.
"Hunda, if you could find it..."
I know where it runs.
It's still shown on the plans.
You could bring an army in through there right into the heart of the city.
You're right.
We could destroy the terminal and their command HQ in one strike.
We'll win this war yet!
I must get back to my column.
I don't think we'll meet again.
I hope you get the information you need.
"- Oh, and, Leitz."
- Yes?
Remember to keep your head down when we come in.
What's the information you need?
We've come to learn what we can about the new drug the Federation's using.
Pylene-50.
What do you want to know?
(Alarm beeping)
Do you have any idea what it's like to have everybody you know literally look down on you?
Or how humiliating it is to have to ask for help from a teenager at the grocery store 'cause you can't reach the top shelf?
"I've gone on two dates in the last six months, both with women I met over the internet."
"And, hey, no one wants to see me again because no one wants to date the short guy."
- Chuck--
"- I wanted those 2 inches, Gary."
I wanted them so bad.
It's 2 inches.
"I mean, wh-what's the difference between 5'3"" and 5'5""?"
"5'5"" you can say out loud."
"Okay, I made a list of the best pediatric GIs in the country."
"I figure, between the two of us, we can get one of these guys to come down and do a tips procedure on him."
Doing a tips on a kid who needs a new liver?
- Yeah.
- That--that's like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound.
"- Well, you have a better idea?"
- I do.
Waiting for UNOS.
Trusting the process.
W-why can't you do that?
Because I'm tired of waiting while this kid is getting worse.
Jackson's tired.
"His mother is, too."
The only one who's happy to sit on her ass and twiddle her thumbs and wait is you!
Whoa.
I have been patient with you.
I have been nice.
- But I am really over you...
- Okay.
Constantly telling me how to do my job.
"- Okay, somebody has to--"
- I've got 20 other kids in this hospital.
"Sounded like it was a Londoner, south-east or summat."
"It was all done over the phone, wasn't it?"
"- I never met anyone, like."
- You've got to know more.
"Times, places, other contacts."
"Look, someone's behind all this pulling the strings and I want to know who it is."
"Ronan Murphy, the suspect killed by Danny Waldron, what do you know about him?"
- Nothing.
"- They had history, Danny and him."
That's news to me.
Danny shot Murphy and was going after Murphy's associates.
They were the ones that wanted Danny dead.
The job you did for them.
I didn't know Murphy.
I didn't know his associates.
- I don't know why they wanted Danny dead.
"- Look, who's behind this?"
What was Danny on to that meant you had to kill him?
You've nothing further to say?
You've offered nothing new in this interview to mitigate you being charged with the following offences.
I therefore have the authority...
"- Well, we got the bastard."
- Yeah.
They should throw away the key.
.. of PC Roderick Kennedy.
"Two, the murder of PS Daniel Waldron and, three, the attempted murder of DI Matthew Cottan."
"Now, do you understand?"
I've been doing more work on the Ronan Murphy file.
"There's a small entry, blink and you'd miss it, that he was interviewed by Murder Squad in relation to unsolved gangland murders, but there's no details of the offences he was being linked to."
Can't help you.
How many times are we going to go over this?
Lindsay lied in court to con the jury.
"Yes, I just needed to..."
What you need is a way to persuade a court that you didn't kill your bloody wife.
That's what we all need.
And Alec can't do it for you on his own.
"I'll get my head round it tomorrow, it's not been easy, Fiona."
Everything's easy for you.
It's not for us.
What do you think all this is going to do to Simon and Lucy?
"You might not have produced your own children, but you could think about ours."
"James, we're all upset,"
Fiona doesn't mean it.
Yes I do.
"Fiona, we must stick together as a family, that's what matters, try and imagine how James is feeling."
Don't you ever get sick of apologizing for him?
Handbag didn't give us much.
"Plenty of bills, clothes mostly, a hotel."
There is a diary.
Any revelations?
"No, she didn't write down much."
A few initials.
"Sometimes Sheridan, along with the initials of a hotel, sometimes just the hotel's"
"BA, the Bedford Arms, a place near Oxford."
The Hotel bill's from there.
Sheridan says that's where they went.
"Yeah well, far enough away not to be noticed by anyone, I suppose."
Is that it?
The hotel bill's for a meal and a room.
The only odd thing is it's dated ten days before the murder.
Sheridan said he hadn't seen her for three weeks.
Right.
"All right, get round there and get it sorted."
Barr's lawyers are going to use Sheridan to cast doubt on our evidence.
Julian Clary blames his mother for everything.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
"So, welcome."
"Welcome, one and all."
Julian.
Yes?
Your poor mother.
Why is that?
"Well, she's a great influence on my life, and a lovely woman, don't get me wrong."
ALAN LAUGHS
"And one of the rules of life that she's passed on to me is ""just say yes"", so this is how I've lived my life."
"And it means, as a consequence, you have a more interesting life than you might otherwise have."
"Except...in the early '90s, when I was a lot friskier than I am now,"
I was in a nightclub in New York called Cock...
LAUGHTER ..which...
Picture the scene.
"No, thanks."
"It doesn't mess around, Cock."
It gets straight to the point.
Yes.
Would you mind giving us a little description of what you were wearing?
It wasn't Lycra or anything.
"It wasn't, you know..."
I was just casual.
I was off-duty.
An off-duty comic.
"Yeah, and there was a man trying to pick me up in this club and I was having none of it - it wasn't to my liking."
"And then, I went to the toilet and there was a queue, and I was in the queue, and the man behind me tapped me on the shoulder and he said, ""Would you like some of this?"""
And he had a mirror with some white powder on it.
"Well, it was the early '90s, I was working in television,"
I was no stranger to cocaine refreshment.
Everyone was on it then - even the newsreaders.
I try to imagine the men who wrecked here half a century ago.
How did it feel to be marooned in such a place?
The wreck of the Otavi is so inaccessible that
Claytor is probably the lonely vessel's first visitor in decades.
His book promises to be a guided tour of the middle of nowhere.
May 16th
Today is the 894th day since I left home.
Sometimes I worry that I will become to comfortable being alone.
"Already,"
I can't imagine what it would be like to be in a room full of people.
I miss the most unbelievably trivial things.
A bookstore.
A movie.
A long hot shower.
A pillow.
The only sound I hear is a hyena in the distance.
I wonder where it is.
But I relish the quite...
the solitude.
May 17th.
I wake up at dawn and it's freezing.
I brush my teeth and break down camp.
"And then, almost as though it were a part of myself"
I see to the plane.
What I'm doing.
But of course I think about it.
I check everything and the I check it again.
Three pilots I met in the Faroe Islands were recently killed when their helicopter crashed.
That makes 15 pilots... 15 friends who have died since I started flying.
There's so much of flying that's completely out of your control.
So I try to concentrate on what I can control.
Despite the dangers and perhaps also because of them Claytor loves to fly
"Mr. Nash, come in, come in."
What a wonderful surprise.
"I wasn't expecting anybody but you're very welcome, I'm sure."
"You won't believe this, but I was just writing a letter to you."
Wait a minute and I'll go and get it for you.
"Now, isn't that a coincidence."
If you'd given me a little warning...
I might've fixed up a tiny bit.
I never was so surprised to see anybody in my life.
"Well, here it is."
By special messenger.
I was beginning to get worried.
"But I didn't tell them anything, like I promised."
Not a word.
They never asked me if you were there the night of the murder... so I didn't think it was wrong not to tell them anything.
"Well, Mr. Nash, whatever are you doing?"
Mr. Nash!
[screaming]
[Lottie gasping]
[baby crying]
"And now, I suppose you babies who have just put the sitter to bed... are wondering about Mr. Nash."
"He escaped in his automobile, but not for long."
He was soon arrested... for failing to yield the right of way.
"Well, he wasn't exactly arrested."
"You see, it was a train that he failed to yield to."
"And now, children, if you aren't naughty... and if the rabbit doesn't get drunk... drinking too much carrot tea... and fall on the elephant's trunk... next week I'll tell you another story."
[baby crying]
Good night.
"Good evening, and welcome to Alfred Hitchcock Presents."
Thank you.
See you next year.
What's so weird about that?
"But you see, they just sit face to face."
That's it.
"They don't say a word, for all this time."
And it's been one hour already.
"Grandma, see if this letter is all right to send to Hawaii."
"""hello there."
"Grandma is now inclined to go to Hawaii."""
This is just in diplomatic language.
"After all, we have to consider their feelings, too."
"""But before that, she says she wants to make sure about Suzujiro."
"""Even with the picture you sent, she doesn't remember..."
"""due to his age, and his looks after being ill."
"""If you have a picture taken when Suzujiro was young..."
"""please send it as soon as possible."
"""And ask Suzujiro to try and recall the names of his brothers."
"""If he recalls the names of Tetsutaro, Dozaburo and Jushiro..."
"""those names would match Grandma's memory."
"""And it wouId mean that Suzujiro is definitely the elder brother of Grandma."
"""In haste, respectfully...."""
That's a great idea.
"Tateo, you are something!"
"This is all right, isn't it?"
-Thank you for all your trouble.
-Then I'II send it right away tomorrow.
But it's possible that letter will cross father on the way.
"He's got a job, and it's about time for him to be coming back."
"No, he won't be coming back."
"There's the pineapple farm, even if he gets fired."
"That old lady who came to visit you today, what did she come here for?"
She came to chat with me.
But you didn't talk at all.
They do.
They record everyone that comes to the door.
"But it's got such a small hard drive, so, once it's full, it just records over itself."
So it's useless.
"Well, no, not exactly."
Stuff doesn't actually disappear.
It just gets jumbled.
I was able to plug in this facial recognition software to isolate the times that Aldo came to the house.
Is that him?
I can't see it.
"Oh, uh, that's because you're not looking at Aldo."
You're looking at what's behind him.
I'm trying to isolate the car that was following him.
AUBREY:
"Well, that's a few too many times to be a coincidence."
"Yeah, agreed."
Now we just have to figure out who was driving it.
BRENNAN:
Ms. Warren.
You wanted to see me?
"I was reexamining the spinal column, and I found these fractures on the C1 and C2."
They suggest that the vertebrae were severely displaced.
Which indicates a hyperflexion fracture.
The neck was snapped at the C2 vertebra.
That would cause complete paralysis of all muscles below the brain stem.
Yes.
"The lungs cease functioning, resulting in a complete loss of oxygen to the brain."
Cause of death wasn't exsanguination.
It was this fracture.
"Uh, Dr. Brennan."
Yes?
Didn't your father come back into your life after spending years as a fugitive?
I do not fucking.
- How many are they?
- I do not know.
Four or five pieces.
- That's me.
Where are you?
- On the outskirts of the city.
- So you're alive.
- For several hours at least.
"Russians run in a variety Chevrolet van, an older model."
"They have no fixed location, so we must try to take them."
- Collect them you trust the most.
- It will not be many.
- No.
Meet me at the concert hall.
"- Okay, I'll brief the others."
I can only say that we methodically work through the material.
We go from door to door in the area.
An extensive technical work.
The traditional policing will determine what happened.
We will do everything to get to the bottom of this.
Are you sure it's a coincidence?
There have been several shootings and a murder in the city.
We exclude nothing.
I must go back.
Further questions answered by my press spokesman.
"I did not ask, if you exclude anything ..."
This is way off track.
We will search for clues.
"If it is now organized, and there are shootings throughout the city -"
- Have you a plan for protecting offentiigheden?
We do not give us with speculations but investigating this matter thoroughly.
"Ah, beautiful, hearing it purr."
That is not going to work.
"The worst thing is,"
"Jaguar were working on an F-type, and they cancelled that as they'd spent their money on the diesel."
This is a heartwarming tale of British boffins.
"Mark and Colin have been in their sheds smoking pipes, making tea."
They've looked at the electric car.
"They have a prototype, the emotion."
"They say, ""We aim to lead the way with a variety of innovations -"
"""many could find a market in the mass production"
"""of commercially viable electric cars. """
Let's see.
What a rubbish thing!
It's got a fridge freezer!
"""You've forgotten the windscreen."
"Lend us your crash helmet. """
"They obviously made it blunt at one end, then pointy ""cos it's aerodynamic""!"
Look!
There's a way to go before it becomes a viable family car.
Why not invent another Concorde?
You know that Subaru and Mitsubishi film we showed earlier?
"You're probably thinking, ""That scenery, the cars - perfect. """
But it wasn't.
I'll show you an outtake which will explain why.
Caravans.
Get out of the way!
Pull over once in a while!
Once every 300 miles!
Pull over!
Ple-ease get out of the way!
Please stay in a hotel next time!
Ple-ease!
- What about the Raiders?
Are they a lock?
- Nothing's a lock.
"Tim Brown said that he was gonna back channel for us, but we both know that words without actions, that doesn't amount to shit."
Is my hungover brain playing a trick on me or is the legendary maverick Spencer Strasmore second-guessing himself?
"It's called pragmatism, Joe."
"Oh, yeah, you pragmatic?"
"( chuckles ) Oh, that's a new one."
"Virginia, he just called himself pragmatic."
"I am, and let me tell you something, it's not a me thing;"
"it's a we thing, okay?"
"I need you to know you go in on this, shit could get pretty steep."
"Why are you such a masochist, man, huh?"
We got a great business going here.
I'll give you two billion reasons why.
No.
"No, no, no."
That's not you.
"That's the way I would do it, sure, but you've never been just about the bucks."
"Okay, how about paying back Ricky and Vernon?"
"Good, honorable."
I like that one.
"Usually, that would stick, but I don't believe you."
How about this one?
Fuck the powers that be.
"Huh, there he is."
Vintage Spencer Strasmore.
"I'm all about good over evil, Joe."
"Mm-hmm, but just so I know in this particular scenario,"
- are we the good or are we the evil?
- We're always the good.
"Against the evil empire, we are always the good."
Because I always thought there was a kind of almost telepathy between the two of us.
-Like a sixth sense.
-Or maybe just a boring old fifth sense.
-Sorry?
"-We're talking about Janice, aren't we?"
When did all this start?
When she was wiping the chocolate off your shirt or....?
"I know, it's a complete nightmare."
What with the kids and Malcolm and everything.
"That's all been falling apart, apparently for sometime, so at some point or other they're gonna have to sit down and have a very serious talk."
"And in the meantime, the two of you have just been...."
What?
-Around here in the afternoons while he's at work?
-You make it sound so sordid.
I suppose it is.
Anyway.
Nice to know the Ysatis was a hit.
"Perhaps, I'll pass... on that cup of tea."
Huh.
-What?
"-No, it's just.... 1 00% nylon, that's...."
"You really haven't had much luck with women, have you?"
-Just lately.
"-And this would be an iron bedstead, then."
You've obviously been meeting all the wrong people.
Only I'm thinking that too much friction for me at the moment might be a slight problem....
"Hey, look."
Relax.
"I'm not gay or narcoleptic, or Catholic or covered in tattoos."
"I'm just your ordinary, everyday dental surgeon... who happens to think you're very special."
I bet you say that to all the guys.
"Actually, Gil... you're the first man I've ever made love to."
Socks.
"Socks we have -- in contrast to common sense, which we seem to be running a little short on today."
I'll be right down.
Don't look at my dominoes.
"All right, sir, we got white socks with red stripes, black stripes, blue stripes."
"Over there you got all your solids in black, blue, brown, and gray."
Just take your pick.
That's a real nice pair right there.
You visiting?
We just moved here.
"Oh, well, then I'm Henry Sampson."
Nice to meet you.
Jimmy Morris.
"Welcome to Big Lake, Mr. Jimmy Morris."
"You know, son, I can probably tell you where it is a whole lot quicker than you can find it."
Got any baseball stuff?
"Oh, baseball stuff."
Don't get much call for baseball stuff around these parts.
"Now if it was football, that'd be a whole different story."
"You know something, though?"
I got a catalogue over here that just might help us out some.
Let's take a look at that.
"Yeah, I think we might find something in here."
"You know, if you're interested in baseball, there's a story that people here in this town tell that you probably ought to hear."
Thought you said nobody here cared about baseball.
"Oh, they care about this."
It all started with a couple of nuns and a piece of ground not too far from here.
-
"- Morning, Esther."
-
"- Morning, Jimmy."
Any more rattlesnakes on the playground?
"It had an ""H"" on it!"
"Somebody else's name might have started with the letter ""H"", mightn't it?"
"That was a risk you were ready to take because you're that kind of person, Iris."
"You're only two days out of prison for maiming a policeman, for heaven's sake!"
This is what they did to my Thomas.
"You lot, you forced a confession out of him!"
"Well, you'll not put any words in my mouth."
Just looking for a picture of your father.
There aren't any.
Oh.
Why?
I know Vernon was a libertarian.
I know he opposed your marriage to Henry.
"What's this about, Father?"
"I understand your father left you a quite substantial sum, to be withheld until such time as Henry Lee was no longer your lawful husband."
"My father's money has nothing whatsoever to do with Henry, or me, or you!"
Mrs McCarthy?
Good gracious!
Anyone would think you were spying on those two.
Why ever would I do that?
I have no idea.
I fear I may have found our culprit.
"Upon Henry Lee's death, it turns out that Edie is entitled to her father's not insubstantial inheritance."
Inheritance?
But that makes no sense.
"When Henry was about to drink that cup of tea,"
Edie was begging me to give her some business.
She was almost in tears.
"Now, Edie Lee is a proud, proud woman."
She'd never humiliate herself like that if what you say is true.
I see.
"Oh, dear."
"And we dipped his banner in the blood and cried ot ""Sant'lago"
Child of thunder!
"Child of battle!"""
The gonfalon.
"The banner of blood, kept in my family for 1,000 years, lest we needed Sant'lago to keep his promise."
"What promise, Major?"
"His promise that he would come again if Spain were invaded, as soon as we raise his banner"
- over the cape of Torrecastro
"- Get to the point, Major."
There's only a small French garrison in Torrecastro.
"The people of the town know the legend, secretly believe it."
"As soon as we raise the banner over the little chapel, the people will rise up against the French invader."
Rise up?
For a rag on a pole?
"Are you mad, Major?"
"No, it's a legend, Mr Sharpe."
The people believe in it.
"As soon as the gonfalon is unfurled,"
Sant'lago will surely come with fire and sword.
But it takes time to raise the banner.
And before it is unfurled...
The French will come with the sabre.
Exactly
That's why we need you.
Will you help us fight off the French long enough to raise the banner?
"You lied to us, Major."
"And you, Miss."
"You picked us up and we marched with you, fought for you."
And for what?
For a stupid superstition.
For a... for a rag in a bag.
"Not a rag, but the last flag of Spain."
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
What's so weird about that?
"But you see, they just sit face to face."
That's it.
"They don't say a word, for all this time."
And it's been one hour already.
"Grandma, see if this letter is all right to send to Hawaii."

"Gun, man, he's got the gun!"
"I know, Billy, I'm trying."
Just go!
What were you thinking?
Come on in.
Coach got something he wanna tell you.
The board called.
They've decided to suspend you for three games.
Suspend me?
"But they can't do that, can they?"
They can and they have.
Is this 'cause I told that reporter the truth?
"Baby, that didn't help."
That's the rest of the regular season.
How the hell we gonna get to the playoffs?
How we gonna make it to State?
"I'm sure there were moments, when King Arthur regretted pulling the sword from the stone."
But he never gave up his quest.
So why did you?
Or have you already found the traveler that you and the less fortunate members of Veritas were looking for?
The traveler.
Why doesn't it surprise me that you've fallen for Patricia Swann's vivid imaginings?
I didn't imagine the deaths of Virgil Swann or Oliver Queen's parents.
You think I can control the fate of individuals?
You give me too much credit.
You certainly controlled mine.
It wasn't an accident we were in Smallville the day of the meteor shower.
The factory was just a cover.
You were really there to meet this traveler that Veritas wanted to protect.
"I remember evething, dad."
Those are the memories of a small boy in shock trying to cope with the trauma of a meteor shower.
"So, that's kite drowning."
Yeah!
LAUGHTER
Was this recently?
"Yeah, it was quite recent, yeah."
Cos I've...
"With my kids, one of them, particularly, she wanted to have a go as well, so she joined me."
How old are your children now?
My kids are now between 16 and 22.
"So, it was Phoebe who was doing it with me."
I think she was 17.
"So, I..."
I got into the position where I was meant to...
Standing in the water with the kite.
"And he said, ""Right, now position the kite so that it will pull you."""
I did this and I just...
I was taken across the water horizontally with this kite - horizontally for...
Are you in a wet suit or something?
"No, because it was..."
Or just in a suit and tie.
"LAUGHTER As always, yeah!"
"We weren't supposed to get, really, that deep into the water."
"It was a hot day, it was going to be fine."
Trunks were the order of the day.
Where was this?
Where did it happen?
Down in West Sussex.
We were...
"I was being pulled along for what must have been, like, half an hour,"
"And all I could hear was this instructor running along, trying to keep up, saying, ""Pull the emergency thing"
"""to release you from the harness."" And I couldn't do that."
"What happened then was that, instead of being dragged along on top of the water, we took a detour and I ended up going up onto the beach, but still horizontal, so I wasn't able to get up."
"Oh, no, you don't have one, do you?"
- What?
- Hey!
And now some fisticuffs.
A good old donnybrook.
And it's a massacre folks.
It's just like the time you got your butt kicked by my piano teacher.
"Nope, this is definitely worse than that."
Much worse.
"That goal light needs a new battery, and ref's arms are getting tired as the Hounds just keep pouring it on."
Goal!
"Tremendous tactics, terrific teamwork, and a vastly superior genetic makeup giving Binghamton the edge today."
"And that, mercifully, is the end of the game."
"And by the looks of it, the end of the Zenovators."
- All right.
"- Zen's a journey, it's not a sprint."
"It's a journey, stay with it."
It's gonna get better.
"Come on, stay with it."
So much for sharing our souls.
"Ladies and gentlemen, if I can draw what's left of your attention, at the end of the arena, you'll see three famous jerseys, number 16, 17, and 18, the Hansons."
"Jack, Steve, and Jeff."
"There they go, they're being retired."
Let's give them a big hand.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Hanson brothers."
"Hello, Charlestown."
Thank you for your support and retiring our old jerseys.
- But we're not here to talk about hockey.
- What do you mean?
"Lt's just a dumb game where you bleed a lot, and a total waste of time."
Get off the ice!
"And so, right now, you all should be meditating on your inner chi."
Then again you might not.
(Phone ringing)
Charlie?
I thought they'd have told you not to speak to me.
Superintendent Bailey's not going to be amused.
"Yes, well it's not the first time"
"I've disobeyed an order to get to the truth and that's what you're going to tell me, the bloody truth."
The King case is down to two conflicting sightings.
"One from his mate, a thief."
The second from a thief who wasn't his mate.
There's a bigger smell.
I know what Michael King was.
Can you remember a single thing that said
King did not kill Harriet Barr?
I mean have you got James Barr confessing to it?
"They've had a word with George Ayre, at Strangeways."
The same George Ayre you couldn't place
last time I mentioned him.
It was his evidence that sent Michael King down and he's sticking to his story.
Why shouldn't he?
Charlie that Ms. Bailey is a clever detective.
"She's had a word with George's missus, of course she thinks very highly of you."
"She told her you often slip her fifty quid you know, just to help out."
You run a pension fund for all your old grasses?
George did me some favors.
Oh yeah.
"Charlie, do you know something?"
You were the one man who persuaded me that this job was worth doing.
"And when crap piles up,"
I remember what it's like to work with a real copper.
I respected you too much then so smell a fit up.
But I certainly smell one now.
really?
"You know, Jean-MicheI, we question these things too."
constantly.
"With a degree in psychosocioIogy, what are our options?"
"One is the System, with a capital S:"
"marketing or advertising and a fat paycheck, and lots of what you call manipulation."
Another is the system with a lowercase S:
"research, academia, and places like this, the Ministry of the Future."
What should we do?
"- Okay, I get it."
"Raise sheep in the boonies, or join the system to throw a monkey wrench in it?"
"What we,re really interested in, what I care about, is how perverse the social sciences can be."
"For exampIe, we both used to work in an asylum."
"We changed quite a few things, even on an everyday level."
"We don,t want to make problems."
"Check ,happy.,"
"I,II check whatever you Iike."
"I just don,t understand why you refused to cooperate."
"We didn,t."
It just felt like you expected a certain answer.
"That,s right!"
What answer?
"I don,t know."
"Why isn,t there a box for ,fairly happy,?"
"We have ,mostly happy, don,t we?"
"It,s not the same!"
"We can,t have dozens of options."
"If we say ,fairly happy, which box do you check?"
This is all quibbIing over words.
"It,s just a check box, not The Brothers Karamazov!"
"That option isn,t offered."
"It,s a pity, but that,s how it is."
He's not about to fly anywhere.
"Agents David, DiNozzo, anything?"
Abby found drugs in Petty Officer Adams' system that probably impaired him before he died.
Abby and McGee are currently testing sailors to see if...
There they are.
Video conference.
"Ziva, put it up."
"Hi, Ziva, I..."
"Whoa, hi, everybody."
What's the latest?
"Out of 215 sailors on shore leave, three of them tested positive for some kind of sedative."
"It's too soon to know if it was the same drug, but if I was a betting' man..."
"Interview them there, find out if any of them were with Adams before he died."
"On it, boss."
Over and out.
I love to say that.
"All right, keep me in the loop."
"Like I could keep you out of it, Leon?"
"I was in this bar, you know, having fun but thinking about where to hit next."
"A bunch of guys were heading to this... you know, gentlemen's club across town."
Go on.
"Well, then we, we hear this guy bragging about how he just won a ton of cash playing blackjack."
"I've never been to Vegas, much less a casino, so I figured, what the hell?"
Let's make it rain.
"Bad idea, huh?"
I lost every dime of liberty pay inside an hour.
- Who was this guy?
- Who knows?
"Actually, I heard it from a friend who heard it from somebody else."
The night was a blur.
I swear that's the last time I ever gamble this messed up.
Where was this casino?
"But nobody can know about that base, so who knows what really happened?"
Maybe some contra went nuts.
[Men Speaking Spanish]
[Woman] Today was a shitty day... with my shitty kids and my shitty husband.
I love them.
I do.
"But, damn, they get on my nerves."
[Group Laughs]
I wanted to...
Everyone knows what I want to do.
What I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But then I remember the last drink that got me here... two years, one month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess... to have this place."
And that's all.
[Phone Ringing]
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested."
"Alexandria, Virginia, the week of January 23."
There's a list of every person at the meeting... and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
I included the local police reports from that area as well... as the D.O.D. Meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder.
There was a ton of extra police around... so maybe someone saw something useful to you.
You mean that couple and their... and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
I thought it was a Charles Manson thing... but I think they've ruled that out.
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
##[Speakers.
"Is there a person that you feel, lately, has been around you all the time?"
Chief Jung Soo Hyuk?
"In his position, he is responsible for taking care of retired agents."
"But, do you think that's all he does?"
Chief Jung...
He was only focused on getting President Hwang's memoir.
He was hung up on that memoir...
Do you think... he was trying to divert your attention from his real motive?
Do you think you are... seeing Chief Jung Soo Hyuk for who he really is?
Chief Jung Soo Hyuk... is controlling Park Seon Woo's every step.
They said that Detective Im could be accused for the murder.
Because it happened inside the Chung Gye Plan office.
"Hey, but he's a police officer."
But there are people out there who try to pin murders on cops.
Who?
Park Seon Woo of Yong Moon Plan.
"The man with the weird sunglasses who says, ""Chan Gyu..."" all the time."
"But he doesn't show up without an agenda, does he?"
It looks like someone close to me will be accused of murder.
But it's obvious who the real bad guy is.
I shouldn't be sitting here doing nothing.
That's true...
But you should cut all your ties with that man.
"Not to mention, he isn't the kind of person that we can take on."
99 percent of me agrees with you.
But the remaining one percent...
is trying to crawl out of me...
It's telling me to do what I need to do.
"Bro, why are you pretending to be the shadow, all of a sudden?"
Where are you coming from?
- I paid off my credit cards.
- Oh... wow.
- I do not think there is any need to...
"- Listen, you boony blathering numpty."
The only way for you to get across this bridge is to beat me in combat!
"Now, are you a man, or a worthless blate like I know you are?"
I'm calling you a coward!
I fear no man.
That's some tough talk coming from a man who wears a basket on his head!
I carry my haggis in a basket.
You might even make me shiver if you weren't dressed in a nightgown.
You look like my nanny!
You call that thing dangling off your hip a sword?
Looks like a butter knife.
"You'll not hurt anyone, wielding a piece of tinfoil around."
You'd be better off using your slippers for a weapon.
This is a sword!
And it's bigger than yours.
"What do you think of that, Mr. Pajama-Wearing, Basket-Face Slipper-Wielding, Clype-Dreep-Bachle Gether-Uping-Blate-Maw, Bleathering, Gomeril Jessie, Oaf-looking, Scooner, Nyaff, Plookie, Shan, Milk-Drinking Soy-Faced Shilpit, Mim-Moothed, Sniveling, Worm-Eyed, Hotten-Blaugh Vile-Stoochie, Cully-Breek-Tattie."
You gonna weep now?
Shall I pause while you mourn your hat?
I can play a melancholy tune to go with your weeping.
You've done it now.
I'm gonna turn your head into a flour sifter.
"Aye, you got a lot of pep for a wee laddie."
The horse-cut technique should've destroyed your sword.
"Magic runes, laddie!"
All them fancy moves will get you nowhere.
"Now, quit your jumping around and get to fighting!"
Prepare to meet your doom.
I'll give you one more chance to give up.
I am not defeated.
And I shall hold my ground.
Hold your ground?
I...
You have to make your own decisions.
I'm just saying I don't want to know.
"I'm saying, if you're..."
"When you're sleeping with her, if you're hitting up some fan favorites,"
I think you're cheating on some level.
"You might not be acting on it, but you're fantasizing."
You know what?
"I don't know what journey you're on, but I..."
I can't take this trip with you.
"But if I told you, as a friend..."
"I came up to you, I said, ""Hey, Dave, I'm attracted to men."""
"I was thinking about their bodies and things, but I didn't act on it because I'm straight and I was being very strong, would you consider me straight or gay?"
If I desired a man.
"If I was thinking about a man's body, like how the light reflects off of his sweaty back..."
Am I interrupting something?
No.
We're great.
Have a seat.
Want to sit down?
Enjoy this.
Enjoy it.
"No, I'm good here."
Thank you.
"If I was sleeping with my wife and thinking about, like, a dude's wet mouth..."
"Snow and steam, huh?"
Is this place outstanding?
"Okay, Jason, let me ask you a question here."
Is the highlight reel considered cheating?
The highlight reel?
No.
"I'm just saying everybody cheats and everybody lies, and whether they act upon it or not is a secondary conversation."
- Where were you when he was killed?
- I had to meet somebody on the concourse.
So the killer could have seen you leave and knew he was alone.
"It's possible, sir."
"Of course, you can prove you had this meeting."
That might be difficult.
Why?
"Because my meeting was with Hunda, General, and two off-worlders."
Hunda is a rebel leader.
Yes.
He managed to get into the city.
"You see, since I arrived here, I've been coordinating the resistance."
I've kept in contact with all the rebel columns.
"This is treason, Leitz."
I could have you shot out of hand.
"No, I don't think so."
I was acting under Commissioner Sleer's instructions to obtain advanced knowledge of their plans.
You mean you're a double spy.
It was my information which led to the destruction of their second column.
And Hunda's column is about to walk into a similar trap.
Go on.
He's planning a raid on the Magnetrix terminal.
At dawn he'll enter the city by the old monorail.
"Once his column's inside the tunnel, all you have to do is blow it in, General."
Blow it in.
That's all I have to do?
"Yes, I suppose so."
It'll finish the resistance.
You mentioned two off-worlders at this meeting.
Yes.
They're interested in the adaptation drug.
I sent them to the laboratory.
he fans were really hard-core and they would just vote loads and loads of times.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
What's happening?
've never seen a band cause so much hysteria so early in their career.
"Leading up to the final  thought ""f 'm gonna bet  on any of these three  finalists these are the ones 'm gonna bet on. """
he second act still in the final is:
"I don't think we're gonna win, but I really, really want to win."
Just hoping for it.
Rebecca.
But they lost.
We were gutted.
"Boys, how's this experience been for you?"
What have been the highlights?
It's been absolutely incredible.
hat could have been the end of the road.
I think that was the thing we were most worried about because we just had such a great time on he X Factor and being together as a band.
"Zayn, what's gonna happen to One Direction now?"
We're definitely gonna stay together.
-This isn't the Iast of One Direction.
-Ladies and gentlemen give it up for One Direction.
Unbeknown to me  once they left the show it was all about the fans.
Literally from the second it finished the fans made it their mission that One Direction were gonna become the biggest band in the world.
This is why we have the best fans in the world.
I'm gonna prove it right now.
Proof.
-They're just amazing.
-They're amazing.
They can always make fans laugh.
They make me feel so happy.
Okay....
I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.
"That's a rookie move, and you hate to see it."
You always side with the wife even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.
Turk!
We're gonna have kids soon.
We're supposed to be a team!
That means you occasionally have to listen to me and believe in my opinion!
"Like, what if we have a daughter and she wants to get her ears pierced?"
Irrelevant.
We're not having a daughter.
Okay.
"What if we have a son and he wants to take dance class, even though all his friends are playing football?"
He can dance if he wants to....
He can leave his friends behind....
"""'Cause his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine!"""
"So then I said, ""What if our son wants to take dance class instead of play football with his friends?"""
"and Turk ran off singing ""Safety Dance."""
"Carla, didn't you learn your lesson that time you told him the commissar was in town?"
Yeah....
Ooh!
Someone's leaving!
We saw it first!
"Jordan, here's the plan:"
I'm gonna go ahead and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes.
"Now, you just make sure not to engage them."
Be particularly aware of the blonde talky one
I've worked with her before she has no off button.
"If money is so tight, why not have Jake move in with you?"
Who's Jake?
Jordan!
...
We'll just have some fun.
Help your brother a little bit.
You sneaky person...
Here are the answer keys.
"I've made two copies, just in case."
When do we sneak in?
Tomorrow.
On Career Day caricaturist Yigit Ozgur will be here.
"Everyone, including the headmaster, will be in the conference hall."
We'll sneak into the room at that time.
"To become a caricaturist, what major am supposed to choose for the exam?"
"As far as I know, there is no major like that in the universities."
"If there were, I would have been studying there now... but if you must decide on a major"
Hello?
What's the situation like?
Be very careful because Rafet is not around.
Okay.
We are going down.
Okay.
See you later.
Uluc said that Rafet isn't around.
"If he comes out from somewhere, we will be screwed."
Don't be scared.
God knows where he is or what he is after.
"Besides, if you're not caught red handed, you can't be considered guilty."
I said stop.
Slow down a little bit.
I passed the last exit before the bridge.
One minute.
Weren't you supposed to make an album for me with the extra... money from the parent teacher association?
Weren't you going to back me up and be my producer?
I will.
"Beth, last night I came over here because you were upset about receiving a letter and a couple of phone calls."
You thought it was a man on the phone.
The letter was typed and it was unsigned.
"But in plain nasty language, they all said the same thing:"
"""Stop trying to bleed me or else."""
I-
- I shouldn't have called you.
I was scared.
- But it wasn't that important.
- Yes it was.
Obviously someone thinks you're a blackmailer.
"Now you did remember that the man used the word ""office."""
"And until last year, your whole life has been tied up in your job with Devro  Banks."
Since then Lita Krail has had that job.
"Well, this morning I sent Paul Drake out to talk with Lita before she went to work."
"But now, you see, Lita's dead and so everything's different."
- [Beth] Thank you.
- [lighter flicks]
Why did you leave your job?
Was it because Jess Devro died?
Yes.
I mean no.
"You see, Sandy'd been after me ever since we were married two years ago."
He couldn't stand it that I had a more important position in the firm than he did.
Did he ask you to give up all your old friends?
"You know, your marriage kind of came as a surprise."
I know that Jess was surprised.
"He always thought-- well, frankly, he thought that you cared for someone else."
"Perry, stop it."
"If I'm unhappy, or even if you think I've made mistakes, it's still my business, isn't it?"
"I'm responsible, so please just leave me alone."
"Beth, a murder has been committed."
Because the grownups' chatter wasn't enjoyable.
Let's eat their souvenir.
Tateo... don't you find it strange?
Why do they hide everything about Grandpa?
"To put it nicely, they do that out of consideration for Suzujiro and clark."
"And to put it not nicely, it's sort of a diplomatic tactic and calculation."
"To put it straight, they don't want to ruin the relationship... with that rich family that they've suddenly got."
hold on.
You mean that Grandma is just being used as an excuse?
That's terrible.
That's the reality of being a grownup.
"still, I hate it."
Can you take it?
Me?
Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.
"At any rate, the pineapple farm is tremendously vast."
It has eight thousand and some hundred acres.
There are six huge chimneys soaring up from the canning factory.
There is this huge swimming pool in the patio of the house.
clark's wife got a swimsuit out for me to use.
"But you see, I can't swim."
"And clark took us on a tour of the factory, too."
Did you know the factory's agency is in Tokyo?
I know that.
They've got agencies in every big city in the world.
"tell me, what is clark's wife like?"
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.
"She broke down all reserve in no time, and looked after us like her family."
And why not?
"After all, you are a blood relative."
Look.
Lowen are a kind of lion.
Look at the picture here.
"Juliette, I mean, I'm not making this up."
I mean these lowen were running an illegal fight ring that dates back to the time of the gladiators.
They were fighting with these.
Ancient weapons.
This is a morning star.
There's a rifle in here that shoots special bullets to kill Siegbarstes.
"But first, you have to dip them in this stuff here."
This stuff right here.
Siegbarste gift.
Gift means poison in German.
The point is I can see these Wesen in what you would see as a perfectly normal person.
"When they go through something called the woge, which is kind of like this emotional surge, that's when I can see them."
"I know how this must sound, but I swear to God, it's all true."
"Look, you want to see who Adalind really is?"
"This is what Adalind really is, a hexenbiest."
"Juliette, you got to read some of this stuff."
"I mean, the stuff's that's in English because most of it's in German."
"And there's actually some of it in French,"
"Spanish, and even Latin."
"Oh, there's some of it in Japanese."
"They all look like stories you'd read in a book, but they're not."
They're real.
There are things in this trailer that you can't believe.
Ah...
Cameras.
And film of Hitler and the Verrat shooting people in 1936.
"The Verrat worked with the seven royal families, which I'm just beginning to learn about."
"Juliette, I can't tell you how it all fits together."
Even my parents were killed because of this.
"Absolutely clear and simple, You guys get it?"
No!
What do you understand?
"I am saying that press the remote,"
"What will explode, it has a bomb,"
"Sir, I think this is the best idea, Press it, press it."
"Ones, Twos, Threes."
You're insulting me from morning.
Is there any bomb or he's just telling us to press.
"No, Sir."
"There is a bomb inside, I saw it from my eyes."
"But it doesn't explodes, He made it,"
"Hold it, Show me the remote,"
"You place plus up and minus down, the how could it explode?"
"It must be opposite,"
"Turn minus on to plus, cover it."
"And say, One, Two, Three,"
"Papa, it explodes."
"It doesn't explode, It doesn't explode,"
"You're insulting me from morning, insult in car, insult in society,"
"I am a Dons, I am a Dons, insults on the front of these girls."
I will...
Hey...
Rangeela Ratan Jackie Shroff!
"Silence,"
"You' re beating to the front of all,"
If battery is not working then what is my fault?
If we check to open the bag then It isn't better?
"It's better, Not better,"
"It is not a matter of bomb explode, It about respect."
"Now until bomb won't explode... till then give me this gun,"
Give me the gun otherwise I'll shoot.
I love you both.
We love you too.
But this is something you cannot share with us.
Something I can't share with you ?
I loved you when everyone else wanted you dead.
"Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand."
It's not personal.
It's transcendent.
It's like what you said.
It's transcendent.
"Pray for us, Caprica."
We'll be praying for you.
"Okay, he wants us to set up forward observation posts hard-wired back to base for communications."
"The ops are gonna be staggered at strategic locations, giving us as much warning as possible, if there is a cylon advance."
"Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point."
"Oh, joy."
"Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage."
"Fly to the closest observation post, have them relay the information back to command."
"Be sure to note force strength, direction of march, and position."
"I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant."
"Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here."
Hanek and Deetco you go here.
- And who gets lucky number 3 ?
"- That would be Sergeant Fisher, and me."
"Do you have a problem with that, Captain ?"
- No.
- We go in an hour.
"Green base, foxfire 1."
"Green base, foxfire 1."
We are open for business.
Over.
Son of a bitch.
We're here to shut it down.
You have no right to be here.
Failure to comply will result in your arrest and prosecution.
[suspenseful music]
This is a clinic.
- Step aside.
- You need to leave now.
- Put your guns down.
"- Put it down, asshole!"
Lower your gun now.
We haven't met.

What's tech like this doing out here?

Which means we can't monitor incoming tornadoes or dust storms.

He doesn't masturbate.

The bedroom is the zone for tenderness.
It's where I get my tenderness.
"I mean, I am a woman."
I like snuggling too.
"Being caressed, getting tenderness."
That's what's... so great about our relationship.
I can get exactly what I want.
So this is the zone for tenderness.
"Outside, in the living room and other rooms, it's more the zone for domination."
"When I want to be really dominant with him, I take him to the basement."
Because the basement is arranged in accordance with my ideas.
My love slave was permitted to build it.
It's the extremely dominant zone.
I'm very dominant there.
Open it.
Close the door.
This is my tool cabinet with all its different items.
For example.
different sizes of butt plugs.
"Here's the metal one, which I really like."
"Because of the material, its coolness."
It allows a range of possibilities for stretching the rectum.
"Quite wide, in fact."
A lovely little toy.
I also have different kinds of dildos.
The rule is...
So we stocked it in the two shops we definitely knew were chart-tracking on that particular month.
"And you can't buy them within 15 minutes of each other, because in the '80s, bands used to buy hundreds of their own singles."
They'd go in and buy 20s.
So now you have to buy individual copies.
"They have to be 15 minutes apart and the walk from one record shop to the other was an eight-minute walk, so myself and my friend Brian spent two days walking backwards and they'd go, ""Oh, you again"""
"and we'd be like,"
"""Can I have another copy of Orange by David O'Doherty?"""
Did you not at least try to disguise yourself with a variety of hats and sun visors?
Dresses and things.
A nun.
"""I'll have one of those!"""
"Did it work, then?"
"Yeah, we bought 196 copies and..."
You idiot!
It didn't get to 27.
It got to 30.
It got to number 30.
"30 is better, though."
"Yeah, 30's perfectly good."
So I have had a hit single that - brackets - that I bought all the copies of myself.
What's the chorus?
"Well, Grace..."
Sing me the chorus.
# She was orange Like a truck made by Tonka
# Orange Like an employee of Willy Wonka
"# Orange, like a sport and leisure question from Trivial Pursuit"
"# Orange, like Garfield... #"
You just think of orange things.
Is it on iTunes?
There's a video for it.
Could we make it a Number 1 hit so you'll never be forgotten?
"Now,wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?"
"Instead,he keeps them in the dark."
He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
It's an execution.
it's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
It's completely isolated.
"He can beat,torture,or burn somebody and nobody would hear it."
I never thought the fbi would be here for our fine city's tradition.

"I guess devil's night keeps you pretty busy,huh?"
Not as much as it did in the eighties.
"Used to get up to 600,700 fires back then."
- In 3 days?
- Down to 115 last year.
"It still takes everything we got, but fortunately we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the rivertown district?
"I wish they could,but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
a thousand volunteers?

It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
And medieval.
"From the industrial age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world."
This is where we found tony's charred remains.
The char pattern tracks back to here.
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
-A lot of the crew's on edge lately.
-They certainly are.
I heard things got pretty ugly down there.
It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior officer.
I can't say I disagree with the Captain's decision.
"If one of my men disobeyed orders, I'd throw him in the stockade."
I've got to get back to the Bridge.
Let me know if your simulation finds anything else.
I need to see T'Pol.
She's not supposed to have any visitors.
This isn't a social call.
I'm here for my neuro-pressure treatment.
Doctor's orders.
"You don't want me to bring Phlox down here, do you?"
What's our status?
The antimatter's on its way.
I had a talk with him.
Everything's gonna be all right.
This whole thing'll blow over in a day or two.
Our antimatter supply will be depleted by then.
"The Captain's behaviour is becoming increasingly illogical, even for a human."
"He's preoccupied with the hatchery, he's displaying signs of paranoia."
I think you're overstating things just a little.
You can't allow him to use our antimatter.
What do you suggest I do?
Start a mutiny?
You have to speak with Phlox.
Ask him to run a full exam on the Captain.
What good would that do?
"If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical grounds..."
-to relieve him of command.
-Relieve him?
"Yeah, he's never done that."
Not in the ten years I've know him.
"Well, there's a first time for everything."
"Hm, apparently, like you hanging up on me last night."
I have to get some pages to my editor.
"Henry, what's going on?"
"Vicki, I've been thinking..."
It might be a good idea if we don't see each other for a while.
Oh.
I have to focus on my work.
"Yeah, sure."
Whatever.
I have to go.
"You, um... planning on bringing your portfolio with all those pages in it?"
Thank you.
Lexia Chang had no priors.
Told you.
"However, Mohadevan did find an unknown substance in Gene Hansen's blood."
That doesn't mean she's selling drugs.
"All right then, spin me a better theory."
Something supernatural.
It used to be that would be my last suspicion.
No it's my 'go to'.
"All right, hit me."
The bugs there are lots of references from myths.
"There's the curse of the locusts from the Bible, and there are spells specific to insect infestation."
"And Beelzebub, that's often referred to as Lord of the Flies."
Why did it go after Gene Hansen?
They running some kind of black magic thing down at the club?
"Goth's are sometimes into Wicken, not black magic."
"Listen Coreen, I know you don't want to hear this, but somebody is into something nasty down there, whether it's drugs or black magic or whatever."
Chances are your friend knows about it.
"Sometimes daydream it, what there would be if even more, much more are men could deal with box folding?"
"That time comes possibly once, when can be put on all of the humanity will be."
It would be a big thing.
"Sure, I think that it is not allowed to make this uniform."
All nations could fold boxes with an other form with an other colour.
"The Dutchmen round one like that, than their cheese."
The French in the colours of the tricolour.
"The Germans do the largest, most beautiful boxes then naturally."
"But this does not mean it, that for the Russians, it will be allowed to fold boxes if we defeated them already, sure only small ones, than the match box."
"Clear, that this will not be soon,"
Hard work is needed for him.
But if the idea wins if it succeeds all of the humanity will bless our name.
"You do not pay attention to me, Tót!"
- But yes.
- But your mind is somewhere else entirely!
Maybe is on the red spotted butterfly?
"No, no."
Well then what?
Major lord.
I know an other road.
"Somewhat longer, but more beautiful."
Let us go under the gardens.
Why?
This road is very good.
"What happened to you, Tót?"
Tell?
Honestly.
"-Be sick at something, major lord."
- What?
"It before, when we were spent on this you jumped a ditch."
And I jumped over.
"Of course, the man it jump the ditch."
"By happy coincidence, he phoned last night from Venice."
I took the liberty of informing him of the race.
And you let him think I was entering?
"Higgins, how could you?"
That's a lie.!
A deliberate lie.!
"I must say, he was simply wildly enthusiastic."
"Well, he'd been drinking."
He'll probably wake up tomorrow morning and won't remember a thing.
What better way to ensure the security of the estate than for our resident investigator to be in top shape?
But I've saved the really thrilling news for last.
There's more?
"To signal his support of your effort,"
"Robin's sending you something from Italy, air express."
A World Cup racing bicycle from Milan.
"I understand it cost 2,700 American."
Terrific!
Do you know a bike like that only weighs seven pounds?
You know what an edge that's gonna give us?
"$2,700 for a bicycle."
I knew you'd be thrilled.
Let me know if there's anything else I can provide.
"By the by, do you have someplace to stay?"
A small hotel on the other side of the island.
I'll make one of the guest rooms available.
So much more convenient for your training purposes.

"And, Magnum, best of luck."
I know training can be bloody hell.
"I was prepared to go along with it, at least until I had the business of Roger figured out."
"After all, I was in top shape."

Reminds me of death.
Encouraging.
"Well, your compass awaits."
Shall we?
Wait.
"If these beans... create... portals, why not just pick one and go home?"
Why the compass?
Because there aren't any more beans.
"Whatever story you think you know, my dear, is most certainly wrong."
There was a guy named Jack and a cow and something about an evil giant with a treasure and a golden goose.
Or harp.
"Sounds like a lovely tale, but the truth's a little bit more gruesome."
"The giants grew the beans, but rather than use them for good, they used them to plunder all the lands."
"Jack was a man who fought a terrible war, defeating all but one of the evil giants."
The beans were destroyed by the giants as they died.
"If they couldn't have their magic, then nobody could."
It's really very bad form.
Evil giants who made magic portal beans?
Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?
Because one giant survived... the strongest and most terrible of them all.
And we'll have to get past him to...
The magic compass.
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
"If Jackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably doesn't know someone's controlling him."
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with
Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
He'd have to forget everything... the murder.
Getting rid of the blood.
But he had help with one thing... the video.
And someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any of this?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with
Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
It's kind of disgusting.
Jill wants to get married just to get married because she thinks it's time.
Hallie you couldn't even possibly relate to Jill.
And why is that?
Because you're rich.
I mean... seriously.
Everything is handed to you and you can buy whatever you want so just buy a boyfriend.
What?
Are you acting right now because this is hilarious.
I just want a rich boyfriend to take care of me.
Did she really just say that?
Did Jill tell you guys...
"That she didn't get picked up for another season of ""Babes and Barflies""?"
Her agent told her it's because she's too old and too fat.
That's not funny.
Seriously!
I was at a call back like two days ago and the producer told my agent that my butt looked big in a bikini.
There are specific trigger words that cause me to temporarily tune out of a conversation.
And Becca just...
just triggered three of them.
Producer...
Call back...
Agent...
It makes me space out for like 30 seconds.
And its OK as long as I return back in time to assure Becca her but is perfect.
That is crazy Becca... you're perfect.
Don't listen to that.
Exactly.
Douche bags.
As bad as they sound it's not like my friends... or the people of Los Angeles are any more narcissistic than the rest of the world.
It's just that...
no one cares to hide it at all.
"I've always been the one that slips out the back door before the party's over without saying... much of anything, really."
"Bad at endings, huh?"
"I've been accused of that, myself."
So...
"I don't go to New York very often, but... if I do, I will certainly--"
You'll look me up.
I will.
You don't have to worry about New York.
All right.
I understand.
Because I'll still be coming to St. Louis.
But... you said yourself that we have come to the end of the road.
I don't care about the road.
What if I just came for you?
No.
I mean... it doesn't work like that.
"Well, it may not."
But the thought of not seeing you every day is not something I'm ready to accept just now.
"So, what if I keep coming here... because we love each other?"

I'm just looking for the dish on Berry.
"If you want to spill, I could..."
"No, no."
You misunderstand.
I'm an attorney.
And I demand that you cease and desist publishing uncorroborated information about his personal life.
"Hey, man, what can I say?"
Inquiring minds want to know.
He's contemplating filing a complaint.
The cause of action:
"Invasion of privacy, libel, unfair business practices, infliction of emotional distress."

Then thank you so much for your time.
"Hey, Mom."
What's wrong?
"Kevin, what are you doing?"
"Please, please, tell me exactly what you were thinking, because I'm quite sure we all agreed we would not say a thing!"
"- You agreed, Saul!"
- Kevin.
I didn't want it to happen the way it did.
I'm sorry.
It is a request.
You must take up where you left off.
The poisonings continue.
They must be stopped once and for all.
"They can be and they shall be, Sire, but on one condition."
That I trust your judgment?
"Yes, Sire."
I have always trusted your judgement.
It was my own that fell by the wayside.
The King is easily influenced.
"We must act quickly, before she twists his mind back in her favor."
What does Her Majesty propose?
He listens neither to you nor to me.
"Madame Scarron, what do you say?"
I believe we are good when we are surrounded by good people.
"Yes, I find it hard to believe that"
His Majesty can be so easily influenced by a woman.
It depends on the woman.
"We must place someone else in his life, someone chaste and devout, who will show him the path of moderation."
But who?
I'm not sure I understand.
Madame Scarron will befriend him and influence him with her modesty and piety
And impress upon him the benefits of marriage and fidelity.
I'm fear you overestimate my abilities.
Perhaps it's you that underestimates them?
Do this for me and for the King.
Do you accept?
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty..."
Do you accept?
No murder comes without a cost.
Never a truer word spoken.
What do you make of it?
You promised us something.
Have you brought it?
Big fella here's been very quiet while you've been out - which is only to be expected considering who he really is.

I do not understand these markings.

Just stripping away the disguise.
"No, stop!"
"Stop that, cease, I command you!"
It sounds like a child.
"Of course it sounds like a child, it IS a child."
"Simeon as a child, the snow has no voice without him."
"Don't listen to him, he's ruining everything!"
How long has the Intelligence been talking to you?
I was a little boy.
He was my snowman...
He spoke to me.
They're silly.
"But the snow doesn't talk, does it - it's just a mirror."
"I don't want to talk to them, they're silly."
They're silly.
It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear.
I don't need anyone else.
Don't need anyone else.
"You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman - and look, look what it became!"
I don't understand.
It's a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and the sickness of an old man.
Short.
Short little nuggets of Meredith.
That's all anyone really needs.
"And if you start to get stuck, just smile."
You have a really great smile.
Ooh.
That's just scary.
"Um, Mer, are you sure you want to wear your hair like that?"
You're wearing an alarmingly high ponytail.
Your mother is coming.
"Mr. Dunn, the swelling in your brain is increasing rapidly."
"The longer we wait to operate, the worse it gets."
Excellent.
"- Go, team."
- I strongly suggest you reconsider surgery.
Have you ever seen the inside of a maximum security prison?
"Believe me, if you have to die, this is the place to do it, in good company."
You two will vigilantly monitor mr.
Dunn's elevating ICP's.
You will do hourly neuro exams.
"When he goes unconscious, which he will, we'll rush him to rgery."
You can't do that.

"He's trying to cheat the system, and we're not gonna let him do it."
What's the problem?
I have a little infection from a little surgery I had done.
No.
"I was never punished, except for the fact that he wouldn't look at me or speak to me for an entire week."
It was the longest week of my life.
And you've given us copies of all these contracts?
"Uh, yeah."
"We only had 48 hours, but my lawyer and I have done the best we could."
Are there other documents?
I don't see any e-mails between you and Mr. Drentell after December.
I...
We're...
"We changed computer systems, uh, in December, I think it was, because we couldn't handle the volume of a job this size."
It's possible that some e-mails were misplaced at that time.
- Or destroyed.
- They were not destroyed.
- You keep copies of correspondence?
- l do.
They're all there.
- They're not.
- l'll check into it.
How hard?
"If you want to accuse me of perjury, you go ahead, but otherwise... I understand you're a pack rat when it comes to keeping things."

"- Good night, honey."
"- Good night, Grace."
- Five hours?
It felt like five days.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't care what they say.
Some look good.
"The ones that look good, you don't know about."
What if you got involved with a woman?
How do you tell her?
"The way they make them, I'll never have to tell her."
So you keep it a secret your whole life?

That is so exciting.

"By the way, those are great glasses."

- Very unusual.

- You can have them.
"- No, no."
"No, no."

"Well, Mr. Newman, in all my years on the bench I have never come across anything quite like this."
"I have given this matter some serious consideration, and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly yourself, is for you to keep your car in a garage that is conveniently located next to your home."
Yea.

It's unprofessional.
How's that?
Forensics.
- Forensics?
- Yea.
Forensics.
Ballistics.
"There's a real good chance, those dorks would foul everything up for us if we do it like this."
I mean Donnie's guys can even wind up with the credit if they traced the guns and... boss try to weasel out of paying' us.
"Even worse, we might get blamed for every corpse in here."
And boss'd chaff us to the hill on account of unnecessary roughness.
Not to mention the gang war we might've already started.
"And it's not even like we can switch out the bullets, because the calibers won't begin to match the ones of our styles and rods."
"So, like I said, you can do it your way if you want to, but..."
We risk looking on professional and getting screwed... out of a couple of hot dresses.
"Good thinkin', Daze."
Forensics will fuck you.

long-term.
But you're human!
You're Amy!
You're getting married in the morning!
In the morning.
Doctor?
"She is getting married to one of the sweetest, nicest guys in the world the next day and she's coming on to an alien."
That's not cool.
That's not cool at all.
"I was very excited about that scene, just because why not get a jump on the Doctor, see what that's like, before you get married?"
"Although the Doctor is always very sexy, you kind of never really think of him that way, so when Amy actually jumped him,"
"I was like ""this is inappropriate, Amy."
"""What are you doing?"
"It's the Doctor,"" you know?"
"Of course, the other half of my brain was extremely jealous."
"In the modern era, ""Doctor Who"" has been an interesting show for female characters."
I'm your daughter.
These people end up solving things and outsmarting the Doctor and helping the Doctor.
But I always took you where you needed to go.
They have their vulnerabilities.
I love you.
"And, perhaps, it's because of those vulnerabilities that Doctor Who can experience human emotions a bit more."
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
"I think it's a really good thing this show has done throughout time, for female characters on TV."
That's absolutely amazing.
You're right.
The parka and the ski mask.
That's where they both came from.
And the gun?
"Come on, sir."
You're putting me on.
You know that guns don't come from the wardrobe department.
Of course.
How stupid of me.
"No, that's the prop department, sir, not the wardrobe department."
How does a smart man like Lieutenant Lucerne make a mistake like that?
"Because you're not talking to Lieutenant Lucerne at the moment, are you, Lieutenant?"
You're talking to Ward Fowler.
"Well, what's the difference, sir?"
The difference is Ward Fowler's under suspicion of murder.
And a man under that kind of threat is apt to make mistakes.
He's apt to get rattled.
"Well, who ever said anything about Ward Fowler being under suspicion of murder?"
Lieutenant Lucerne did.
He did?
"Well, how did he come to that conclusion, sir?"
He had to face the same fact you did.
"What fact is that, sir?"
There are only four people who could have murdered Claire.
You mean the four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night.
Exactly!
"And only one of those is instantly associated with makeup, wardrobe and props."
COLUMBO:
"Well, now, let's see."
Mrs. Daley took the call from her secretary in your dressing room when she said that she was going to...

Great.
Everybody is gonna run out and spend 4 grand for a helmet.

- Statement.
Statement?
Kenneth Cole just cut me dead.
Obviously he didn't appreciate our dominatrix baby shoot.
Where were we...
"US$ 25.000, I repeat, is not enough... to do a piece."
"It's an insult to the designer, it's an... insult to the make-up artist, it's an insult to the photographer..."

Raymond Meyer said Skirt isn't wort his time... if we can't put out the dough to hang the Henry Winston... on the gargoyles of the Chrysler Building.
"After a while, it got to be all normal."
None of it seemed like crimes.
It was more like Henry was enterprising and that he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling while other guys sat on their asses waiting for handouts.
"Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue-collar guys...."
"The only way they could make extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners."

There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

"Hello Mrs. Hill, police."
I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.
We have a search warrant.
Would you read and sign it?
Anywhere?
We have to go through everything.
You boys want some coffee?
"No coffee now, thanks anyways."
-Just be careful.
-We'll just go about our business.
There was always a little harassment.
They always wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.
"They'd come in with their subpoenas and warrants, and make me sign."
But mostly they were just looking for a handout.
A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.
"No, it's just all the chaos and destruction in town makes me feel romantic."

Andy might've gotten lucky right there and then.

"So I called the school and I said,"
"""Prom's on tonight, free of charge, right here at Gray's pub."""
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
Laugh it up.
I have to close the bar early and fill it with streamers and balloons for a bunch of kids who aren't paying a dime.
- It's so funny.
- Sucks to be you right now.
It does.

"Oh, Jules, is there a small detail you might've left out?"
I signed us all up as chaperones.
Oh.
They don't seem very excited.
I'm sure they'll be better when they realize they can just stand around and drink all night.
- Oh.
Well...
- Oh!
They can't!
Because the high school's making me take all the liquor out of my bar for the night!
- It'll be fun?
- I will kill you.
"This whole prom idea is so lame, right?"
"Well, it depends on who you were in high school-- a pasty young dork with more zits than friends, or a dashing babehound with dance moves so smooth they almost sent a teacher to jail."
Mrs. Pritchett loved my dancing so much that she asked me over to give her a dance lesson.
"Well, I guess we better find a sponsor then."
"Tomorrow we make proposals to our bosses and every business in town, okay?"
- Deal.

"Anywho, you gang are looking for a sponsor, am I right, for your little orphan hockey team?"
"Which is super, it's great."
We love the kids without the parents.
Love it.
"Here's the sitch, though, we already sponsor a bowling team."
Yes.
"Tenpin, kind of awesome."
"Tell you what I can do, though."
"How about a box of Charlestown snow globes for you and the guys, all right?"
"Enjoy those and, hey, thanks for stopping by."
Bowling team?

And your approval ratings jumped a total of 50%.

Hands and knees.

When evil begins to spread across the world turn the blessings of heaven to the curse of the Devil and then create a new human race.
That's the message that was left on the stone manuscript we have.
Analyzing this with the Professors data...
The blessings from heaven are the ultraviolet rays of the sun which warm the Earth.
such as carbon-dioxide and the ozone layer.
Thus controlling the amount of ultraviolet penetration.

These are chemicals.

He got picked up on an old assault charge and released.
Are you gonna bring him in again?
Is he being extradited?
I don't think so.
I heard they called it off.
Why'd they call it off?
Our Attorney General thinks you don't have the evidence you need for us to hand him over.
That gives me more time.
"You've been inside the Chickadee, you know the club."
Where is Reardon staying when he stays overnight?

Yeah.
Do that.
You ever gonna tell me who you're working for?
- Probably not.
"- Well, you're not DEA..."
"You're not a bounty hunter, 'cause there's no bounty on him."
- I'm working for a private contractor.
- What's their interest?
That's all you wanna know.
You don't wanna dig deeper.
As long as someone pays me.
I'm gonna guess cash is okay with you.
I want the whole layout of the nightclub.
The Blackmire Group report you asked for.
It includes the FBI brief.
"And what are the FBI's concerns, exactly?"
"They're worried American economic interests are being jeopardised by Blackmire's partnering with companies in China, Russia and the Middle East."
"They've got their eye on intellectual property and patent theft, the illegal flight of capital to cheap labour markets..."

"Well, here's news of yet another Muslim terror plot"
Right here in Mercy.
"This one starts with Amaar Rashid and goes all the way down to Baber ""Sneaky"" Siddiqui."
It's about time somebody blew the lid off of this thing.
"Well, call me the can opener, 'cause I've finally cracked the Da Vinci code of what those wacky rug riders have been up to."
Turns out they were trying to blow up city hall.
"Fortunately, yours truly was there to scotch the deal."
"Now, do I call myself a hero?"
"Well, some would, of course, but I'm..."
[ She turns off the radio. ]
"Well, at least we found a new place for the mosque and Rayyan just told me it's not getting demolished."
- Ah!
"- That is a big surprise, Amaar, because I was kind of hoping that, huh..."
"I mean, congratulations!"
I didn't think you'd pull it off.
Hurrah!
"Well, technically I haven't."
"Not yet, anyway."
We still need to raise some money for the mosque.
"Amaar, I know it seems like I've been pushing you away, but Muslim or not, you are my son now and I am behind you 150%."
"Thanks, Sarah, and you know, I'm always here for you, no matter what the crisis, faith or not."
"Well, I wanted you to know that I finally sold Yasir's business."
- Congratulations!
- And I want to put all the money towards the new mosque.
Wow!
I don't know what to say!
"- ""Thank you"" works."
- Thank you.
Do you know the last time I saw you was at mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.
"Because I was thinking it could have been cool to have a picnic in between or something, you know?"
- Picnic?
"- Yeah, a picnic."
"Something that, I don't know, normal families do."
How'd you say you were injured again?
"Well, originally, uh, playing high school baseball."
"But, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time."
Anything traumatic recently with the knee?
"Yeah, actually, I got a new partner."
I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, this guy is like a physical injury, doc."
"Uh, ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car,"
"I'm not joking, on to the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
- He drove a car onto a boat?
"- Yeah, he's an animal."
And I sort of get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
- Ouch.
- Yeah.
"- Uh, so how do I fix it?"
- You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that but I don't think that's gonna happen."
"Well, I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL."
"So you're gonna have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go, please?"
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."
"My name's Andy, I'm a data analyst from London."
"And my name's Dorian, I'm a private mathematics and English tutor from Bath."
"Well, welcome to both of you, these are pretty esoteric names for teams, I have to say."
"Lutrophiles, a love of...?"
Otters.
Why?
"Er, I was badgered into it."
THEY LAUGH
"Go on, why have you chosen otters?"
There has to be some reason.
"I quite like otters really, and I pushed for it a bit."
"They really like otters too, but they're just pretending they're indifferent."
I was told that it was a lover of Paris.
But I think that's a Lutetia-phile.
My goodness!
"And Pascallywags, why is that?"
"Well, because the two of us over here studied mathematics and we have a philosopher to my right and Pascal was a very famous and influential mathematician and philosopher."
Blaise Pascal?
"Yes, indeed."
"Rob, I have to ask you because a little bird told me that as a teenager you had lessons in lion taming."
I did.
So what did you learn?
I didn't learn an awful amount.
"Or an awful lot, to be honest."
But I had a couple of informal lessons.
And did you ever get into the ring with them?
"No, I'm afraid not."
I always stayed outside the cage.
And what's the most important thing a lion tamer needs to know?
More than the lion.
"More than the lion, I'll say."
"Well, we are in esteemed company, welcome to you both."
"They're all knockoffs-- The purse,the dress,the shoes."
She wants people to think she's a model.
She doesn't want to admit how she met stein.
"Personally, i don't blame her."
"I mean,you never heard me mention those parties."
"Well,we'll be okay,then."
Women who go to those parties
Are not necessarily prostitutes or strategic daters.
But the jury will think she is.
"Well,you're not,right?"
"The main thing is, you believe her."
"Unlike you, i don't have to believe"
"The clients to defend them, but,yes,i believe her."
"Her clothes are phony, but those bruises are real."
Come on.
We gotta meet ron.
You never mentioned that we represented ann?
Suzanne never asked.
And she's gonna go ballistic
When she realizes you did pre-Spin.
It makes good tv.
Good tv helps her ratings and our client every time.
We are set to turn ann over to the beverly hills police department.
A.D.A. Keller went on duty ten minutes ago.
It is time.
You couldn't get her to target to get a new outfit?
"There are no 24-Hour targets around here,ron."
"You know,the whole point of getting the knife"
And arranging for her surrender
Was to show that she had nothing to hide.
Changing her clothes would be tampering with evidence.
"We don't cross that line,ever."
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.Both of you.
- Where?
- Sunset beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'Il find Hauser.
Or what's left of him.
"They tell me you've broken the code,Dr.Sengupta."
Yes.
The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby correspond to the locations of his bombs.
"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,""Beard"" for beard beach,"
"- and ""Grace..."""
- Was grace cathedral.Genius.
There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know,but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco police department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.Lives will be saved.
Alcatraz proving itself to be once again the crown jewel of American penal sciences.
"Milton,don't skulk out there like a common ferret."
It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague.
Genius.
Doctor.I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes,but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice,my dear:"
Thank you.
Agent Salt?
Bryan Mills.
You got a minute?
I know who you are.
I've been briefed.
You also need to know I think this whole move
- is a cartel play to free Mejia.
- Based on what?
"I don't have the link, but I know Mejia."
I think they're gonna try and take him.
"I appreciate your concern, but we've gone over this with white gloves..."
There's no cartel link here.
Or we haven't found it yet.
They probably got someone
- in here right now with eyes on us.
"- Mills, I brought in four of my best agents, and you brought in yours."
- We are prepped for all eventualities.
- I'd also like to see the
- convoy configuration and route maps
- All those will be made
- available tomorrow morning...
"- But if we vet them now,"
- we can still make changes.
"- ODNI is here to support the FBI, not the other way around."
"I understand that, ma'am, but we do have a history with the detainee."
Which is why you're no longer responsible for him.
"Maybe if you'd followed protocol, we wouldn't have to move him."
"If we'd followed protocol, we never would've captured him to start with."
Maybe you should just sit this one out.
- I want to be in the van with him.
"- No, no."
His Majesty will be most pleased.
"We have killed Yi Do-hyung, but we failed to capture Yum Moon."
"He is the real leader of the pirates, a great warrior and strategist who once served as the commander of Yi Sa-do's troops."
We can't say we have suppressed the pirates until we capture him.
Head Chief Jang is more than capable of capturing him.
Put your worries to rest.
Jump.
You will risk your life for a girl when we have lost everything and been chased out to sea?
You have been losing your calm since Jang Bogo came to Shilla.
"At that rate, you will be defeated again."
Control your emotions first.
Take them away.
Please forgive us just this once.
Please.
Wait.
You don't seem to be soldiers.
Why are you taking those people by force in broad daylight?
I have never seen you in Mujinju before.
Where are you thugs from?
Such insolence!
How dare you?
No good will come to you from causing a scene.
Stay out of it.
- Take them away!
"- Yes, sir."
- Find out who they are.
"- Yes, sir."
They were Madam Jami's private troops.
She has more than a hundred men under her command.
"She is a Jingol noble, and holds great power in Mujinju."
"The Mujinju governor is her puppet, and her troops wield more power than government troops."
Would you continue to look around town?
Still trying to keep ourselves in trim.
"Right, so I see."
-Working up a good old sweat.
-Yeah.
How about you?
"After last night, obviously, we can't stop thinking about your brother."
Right.
"Sorry, my....?"
"I mean, how is he?"
Is there any more news on his condition?
"Sorry, Gil, would you excuse me?"
Mick.
"Yeah, I've been trying to get hold of you all morning."
Yeah.
I told him your brother had been very badly injured in an accident in America.
"That it was touch and go whether he'd pull through, and you were so upset about it all that I had to come around last night to see if everything was okay."
-And he believed that?
-Absolutely.
"What I said was he'd been taking part in a javelin contest, okay?"
"And as he was running along he'd stumbled and dropped the javelin, which had stuck in the ground, and he'd fallen face first, right on to the point which had completely pierced the roof of his mouth,"
and ended up about half an inch away from his brain.
-So....
"-God, that's horrible."
What on earth did you make up a story like that for?
"Well, I had to think quick."
It was the first thing that popped into my mind.
The first thing that popped into your mind?
"How about his car went off the road, or he fell down some stairs or...."
What am I talking about anyway?
I don't even have a brother.
"-Well, you have now."
His name is Hiram.
The Xindi are trying to destroy Earth... because they heard that humans are ruthless.
ARCHER:
This is a chance to prove them wrong.
We can bring the eggs aboard.
Reconfigure one of the cargo bays.
I already talked to Phlox.
He says they're integrated into the hatchery walls.
"If we remove them, they'll die."
"Sir, this is crazy."
These people are trying to kill us.
This isn't open for discussion.
ARCHER:
I'll lead the engineering team.
I need you here to help Travis figure out how to operate that Xindi shuttle.
-Captain.
-I've made my decision.
ARCHER:
Get to work.
"ARCHER: [On tape] Captain's Starlog, January 8, 2154."
We've been in orbit for more than a day.
"The crew is restless, eager to resume our mission."
But I'm certain my decision to stay was the right one.
"They may know how to build a weapon system, but these people could learn... a thing or two about designing a comfortable chair."
"For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable."
The power grid doesn't make much sense.
Almost half of it is routed to structural integrity.
You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant.
Assuming you could figure out how to fly it.
This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds.
Give it a shot.
I don't think this ship likes us very much.
REED:
"I was so drawn to it, because in a way, that's what this entire series is all about."
Rock 'n' roll is really the evolution of jazz.
"When Louis Armstrong's ""Hot Seven"" albums first came out, people lost their minds."
"It was punk rock, you know?"
It was out of control.
A lot of the jazz musicians became the first wave of rock 'n' roll musicians.
"I went there to be educated, because I never went to school."
"And I thought, ""I'm gonna go to where the stuff came out of the ground naturally, you know?"
You can't speak of New Orleans without speaking of Dr. John.
Now leave a little room for me!
"Most people I talk to don't call you ""Dr. John."""
"Well, my name is really Mac Rebennack."
Where are you from?
I'm from the Third Ward.
Same ward where Louis Armstrong came from.
"Every time I walked past where Louis Armstrong used to live, he'd say,"
"""If you want to do something bad enough, you can do it."""
It made me think.
That's what Louis came up in.
That was good enough for me.
Was it a musical family?
"Well, my aunt Dottie Mae used to play piano with Pete Fountain and George Girard..."
All of the cats that became famous later.
"I just remember she knew how to play that style that was called ""butterfly stride."""
"She used to say,"
"""Watch the piano player's left hand."
"That's important."""
That's what I did.
She was a very special person.
"If you're from New Orleans the way we are, you're not just from New Orleans."
"Like, you're four generations, five generations from New Orleans."
"Growing up and being, like, the son of a musician is a badge of honor in New Orleans, you know?"
- The one by the--
"- No, I meant what kind?"
How long were you in the bathroom?
I didn't actually go. I mean. I had a stomach ache but I didn't actually go.
Because?
Because you heard something in the hallway.
"I heard like a scuffle, but I didn't see anyone when I came out..."
I just heard the shot.
You heard a scuffle loud enough to keep you from taking nature's call...
but you didn't see anything.
No sir.
"Brian, I don't have to tell you this is a serious criminal act..."
- we are talking about here.
- Yes sir.
I'd hate to hear that you were protecting someone.
With your unblemished record and all.
I'm not protecting anyone.
Ladies and gentlemen.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please."
May I have your undivided attention for one moment?
Please may I have your attention?
Your undivided attention.
Thank you. I just wanted to let you know some of the things...
we have been working on to ensure a safe environment here at Liberty.
We will not tolerate violence in our schools.
"We will not accept it, and we will not live with it."
But all the safety measures in the world...
won't work unless I have the cooperation of you.
All of you.
Yeah.
The people who come to these meetings are the people...
who let their kids have guns.
They begin killing hostages.
Salawell?
"The one commanding the riot is you, Princess."
No... does that mean?
"And the one to kill the rioting princess and end the battle, the Estabul noble, Salawell Seile, is greeted by Roland as the savior of the kingdom."
"So our armies' being directly met, the suggestion to take hostages..."
That was all you?
I trusted you.
"At first, though, I planned to make you my wife and take control of this kingdom."
All I wanted was to make a kingdom where everyone could live happily.
And yet...
The world isn't moved by pretty words.
Even still...
Even still!
"How adorable you are, Princess."
But this is the end!
Please relax.
Roland is not in need of a hero so badly that such a man could become one.
A hero?
"Is this the doing of Roland's Hero King, Sion Astal?"
!
My king has no taste for such things.
All of this is my doing alone.
"Then, the one to conspire with Salawell and lead us into revolt was..."
"Yes, it was me."
"He saw through it and appointed Rear Admiral Klom to suppress the revolt, not me."
That is the kind of man my king is.
"However, just as Salawell said, it is a fact that the world isn't moved by pretty words."
"After Lady Noa Ehn kills the hostages, she commits suicide."
That is how the story goes.
Would King Astal forgive that?
"Ideally, I wouldn't be found out, but perhaps he would come to forgive it?"
- Another call.
- Who called you that night?
Calls of a suspicious nature were made shortly before you volunteered to continue serving on Danny Waldron's squad and before you murdered him.
Who made those calls and what did they ask you to do?
"For the tape, the interviewee is not answering."
"This pattern of communication, unregistered pay-as-you-go phones used for a short period then discarded, is one we all recognise from organised crime."
Who's got you in their pocket?
Nobody.
"Hari, we have you receiving phone calls linked to Danny's murder."
We have you lobbying to stay on Danny's squad.
We have your hands all over the firearm.
We have you consistently lying about Danny's activities.
We have a witness who says it was you who did all this and not PC Rod Kennedy.
We have you at the murder scene and we have you in possession of the instruments of Kennedy's death.
"Now, that's about the height of it and it's a great big pile of evidence that is going to crush you flat."
"Now, come on... .. you killed Danny Waldron, yes or no?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.
We know you can't have been acting alone.
Help us help you.
Who gave the order to kill Danny Waldron?
Who was it?
It...
"Come on, who was it?"
Who was it?
You've got the bastard.
"Come on, talk."
- He never gave me a name.
- Who didn't?
The bloke I always spoke to.
"On the next episode of 1,000 ways to die."
[Heavy metal music]
Death is everywhere.
Most of us try to avoid it.
Others can't get out of its way.
"Every day we fight a new war against germs, toxins, injury, illness, and catastrophe."
"There's a lot of ways to wind up dead, the fact that we survive at all is a miracle."
"Because every day we live, we face..."
This election's done.
[Phones ring]
[Phone room chatter]
It was getting down to the wire for mayoral candidate Robert Stone.
"I need to know, are you with me on this, or are you not with me on this?"
"In a final push, he and his staff worked the phones."
"Melissa, his sexy campaign manager, wanted Stone."
"I mean, weeks ago we were way behind from Baumgartner, now we're gonna kick his bum."
Let's just do it again tomorrow.
Let's get it done.
"It was the end of a long day, but Melissa had one more campaign to mount."
"I need to get out of here, heading' home soon."
You can stay for one drink.
"Just one long, stiff drink."
"Melia was slipping Stone a rufie, the date rape drug."
"But she didn't want to do him, she was going to do him in."
- [Snores]
- He's out like a light.
"Listen, I need everyone out front at 7:30."
"Melissa was actually a spy, working for Baumgartner,"
Stone's opposing candidate.
Sucker.
"Come on, time to get up, it's 7:30, let's go!"
Melissa had alerted the press.
"Uh, I went over what's left of the car with a fine-tooth comb."
I didn't find any evidence of a mechanical problem or even sabotage.
But?
"But... when I ran a full diagnostic on the car's controller area network-- that's, like, the brain."
Pretty much controls everything in the car these days.
"The CAN, I know."
It's a computer?
"Right, and just like any computer, it can be upgraded with new software but it can also be hacked-- made to do whatever the hacker wants it to do."
Like accelerate instead of brake?
"Yeah, in this case, exactly."
Somebody overrode the accelerator module wirelessly.
Told it to keep going faster.
"If done at the right time, there's nothing a driver can do."
And the right time is just as
"Jared entered the turn, which means he was definitely murdered."
"Yeah, it also means that whoever did this knows exactly what they're doing."
"No, what is she doing?"
"Why, what's up?"
Never mind.
But I gotta go.
"Hey, fill in Pride on what you found out, all right?"
Uh... okey-dokey.
TRACK ANNOUNCER:
And that's Scott Hamilton...
DANA:
"I wish I could help you, I do, but I don't know how."
PRIDE:
"Yes, you do, Dana."
There's no way you're Jared's girlfriend and didn't know something.
"Dana, your boyfriend was murdered."
Doesn't that matter to you?
"Of course it does, but I'm not gonna..."
"That's too bad, because we could use a break in this case, Frank."
"Three young women, all killed within the last 48 hours, all in the exact same manner."
"We're due a break, huh?"
You got any background on Callisto?
"Well, she used to take in these teenage, pregnant street girls."
"She believed in them, she redeemed them and just like Goodrich and Lundy, she was a good Catholic who used all of her time and energies to help others."
Damn him.
"- Who, the killer?"
- God.
Frank...
I really don't think you can ask God to damn himself.
OK?
"And if you are, move away from me."
I don't wanna get hit by lightning.
This is a new suit.
Why does God allow people to suffer?
Why exactly did he allow his own son to die in torment.
"He died to save the world, hmm?"
"But here we are, still, in an alley, asking questions with no answers."
"You know something Frank, you Catholics are all so tortured."
"I mean, you're just so prone to despair."
"Turning your back on God, that is the worst sin of all."
"Even I know that, Frank."
The worst sin in my book?
The killing that goes unpunished.
"The archdiocese would like to post a $25,000 reward to help find this killer."
"That's very generous, Monsignor."
But totally unnecessary.
"- In fact, it'll work against us."
- How so?
That money will bring out every screwball with a cashflow problem.
They'll all claim to have seen the murder.
I know.
"You want the truth, you're going to get it."
"All right, I guess I should have figured this would have something to do with aunt Marie."
"Nick, I've been inside your aunt's trailer."
I've seen all the crazy stuff in there.
I don't know what you expect to show me that I haven't already seen.
"Juliette, please."
"Look, if you want to understand why"
I was attacked in our house...
Run!
[Screams]
If you want to understand why my aunt was attacked on the street...
[Growling]
And if you want to know why you were kidnapped by that crazy woma..
Time for you to scream.
- Time for you to scream.
- [Groans]
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.
Okay.
How often do you come here?
Whenever I have a problem I can't figure out.
What kinds of problems would lead you here?
Something started happening to me around the time my aunt died.
I guess it was destined to happen.
I just didn't know about it yet.
"I started seeing things I couldn't explain, and I thought I was going crazy."
"But before she died, she told me that some of my other relatives have this same problem, ability-- whatever you want to call it."
This trailer is filled with things you can't believe.
It's the history of my ancestors who were-- now stay with me-- sort of like hunters.
What did they hunt?
"See, this is where it gets a little difficult to explain."
"Yeah, you're going to have to try."
Who would do that?
"We don't know, honey."
They don't release that information.
I bet I know who.
Hey!
It was aunt Crystal.
She's the only person who would know about this stuff.
"Georgie, listen..."
"Hey, everyone."
Thanks for coming.
We thought it might be a good idea since emotions are running a little high to get together and talk about what's happening with the horses.
"So, Matt, you're up."
"Thanks, Joanna."
Okay!
I'm sorry about the situation this morning.
Nothing would've happened if certain people hadn't interfered in the first place.
"Look, guys, I'm taking good care of the herd."
They're being watered and fed in line with the rules of the capture.
They're probably better off than they were when they were wandering in the wild.
"Out of curiosity, how'd you come up with the number you could take in?"
I've got the statistics right here.
"Now, they did an aerial study and it shows..."
The herd population in this area alone grew by 20 percent in the last two years.
"Now, the horses that I captured represent a tiny portion of that 20 percent."
When did you do this count?
Last October.
- Before the flood.
- Yeah.
And before the worst winter in my personal memory.
- That's right.
"- Now it's just my humble opinion, but I figure there's a natural cull going on here."
She's called mother nature.
"I'm glad she did because you're here, Nathaniel."
"I said, ""It's... it's none of our business."
"That's for Harriet to determine."""
"I said, ""I will not go along with that."""
And I didn't.
"Oh, he was furious."
- Uncle Abbot?
- Yeah.
There is a certain romanticism in your mother that...
Drives me up a wall.
"All of us, because there's a lack of realism."
- She's so impractical.
- So impractical.
- But she does...
- Drive me wild.
"But even at the time of settling, mother's estate mother's attorney was shocked to learn that Nathaniel was a bastard..."
"""Dear Lou, I never wrote you a letter before, did I?"
"""I've been thinking about all those summers"
"""you promised to come to Maine and then didn't show up."
"""At the time, I thought it was just because of your work."
"""But obviously, there were other reasons."
"""Did you ever really have any intention of coming,"
"""or did you just say you would to get my mother off the phone?"
"""Because we waited for you..."
"""and waited and waited and waited."""
"Well, howdy there."
"This is Classic Country, Dallas-Fort Worth, with a daily tidbit."
Construction is well underway on the Kimbell Art Museum in the heart of the cultural district.
"It looks a little bit like a cement cattle barn to me, but they say the inside is going to be gorgeous, lit entirely by our Texas sun."
"Well, good luck."
"Well, let's get back to music right now."
One of our favorite stars:
- What?
The uncommonly warm weather - will it continue?
- Russ?
- Russ?
"Uh, um, wh-what was that question?"
"Thanks, Russ."
"Well, it seems like we can keep those thermal socks in the closet... for the time being then."
"That's right, Dan."
Police are calling it... the crudest attempt to dispose of a body in recent memory.
Jerry Green of Linglestown... was apparently bludgeoned to death... and then dropped into the river with a brick taped to one wrist.
This was insufficient weight to keep the corpse submerged.
[ Sighs ]
What time did they pull this bookie out ofthe river?
Scotty told me around 6:00.
Ted told me 8:00.
It's like a fucking guessing game.
They pulled him at 6:00 and bagged him at 8:00.
Was he nude?
Somebody said he had a T-shirt on.
"Why don't you get off your ass and check the reports, man?"
I'm going with nude.
I'm so glad this thing is finally over.
What does that mean?
We don't have to look for this guy anymore.
"Gee, wouldn 't it be great if we found out who killed him?"
"I realize that entails more work, but I'm just thinkin' out loud."
"Has it ever occurred to you, Chambers, that he was drunk... and he just slipped off the bridge?"
Hmm?
A little thing called an accident.
Why is everybody around here so foul-play happy?
"The man was bludgeoned to death, Lakewood!"
"His skull was bashed in, he had a plastic bag over his head... and duct tape around his neck."
"I need to study Wickes' language, his body, and most importantly, his limbic, physical response the first time he hears the word AUTEC."
"And from that, I need to decide whether or not he's involved."
"Hmm, usually I just get 'em to say they did it."
It's easier.
"Breakfast the other night, did I or did I not deduce that you like powdered sugar and not syrup on your pancakes before the pancakes were ordered without you saying one word?"
I rest my case.
His hat was definitely blue.
I...
"I wrote in my notes, uh, (sighs) more royal, than navy."
I think that's correct.
"Oh, don't tell me you can't last longer than this."
GIBBS:
"We've been at this a long time, Mr. Wickes."
It's unfair to see a guy go through this for over two hours with nothing in return.
I want to help all that I can.
"See, he's a giver."
"Okay, keep 'em rolling."
Repeat after me:
How many employees from your company were aware of today's symposium?
A lot of your people know about this thing today?
WICKES:
Yes.
Why?
Are you suggesting that someone from my company could be involved?
"No, tell him it's unlikely."
Make him your friend first.
We'll get to that later.
Tell him.
Not likely.
Wickes Steel is going through a... (sighs) pretty tough time.
"But we'll push through, I mean, this company was built on simple pride."
My grandfather started with an idea.
My daughter needs a doctor right now!
"Daddy, wa-wa."
"Oh, for corn sakes."
That boy has hypothermia.
"Yeah, he'll be fine."
Here's a blanket.
Ah!
My foot!
"Relax, you fucking Mary!"
Get my daughter a doctor!
"I will have you thrown out of here, mister, if you don't get your emotions under control."
My emotions?
You mean my love for my own child?
"Let me tell you something... ""Beatrice."""
"I don't know what country you're from, but I didn't die for five minutes on a Korean battlefield to come home and be disrespected by a woman like you."
"You think because I'm unemployed, you can just shove me and my family to the back of the line?"
"Well, not on my watch!"
"If you don't get her a doctor right now, before all these other low-life pieces of shit, then I will follow you to whatever home for dried-up old hags you live in, slap the cat food out of your mouth, grab you by your camel hump"
and put you through that fucking wall!
"Oh, boy."
- There's our hero.
- Wha...
- What happened?
- You passed out.
And then everybody in the waiting room started clapping.
"Well, the main thing is you're all right and Maureen's gonna be fine."
"Daddy, I'm a pirate!"
"Oh, for Christ sakes, Maureen, girls can't be pirates!"
You're back!
"Dad, it's so cool when you scream at other people."
My little girl's eye is more important than some crazy old man's foot.
- He's fine!
"♪ I'm old ♪ ♪ oh, your time has passed ♪"
♪ I'm old ♪
♪ you got really bad gas ♪
They're the house band at the full rest senior citizens' center.
"It's a place where older musicians hang out and, if their arthritis isn't too bad, play some music."
"♪ Help, I've fallen and I can't get up ♪"
- Where's my wig?
- It's right here.
One of the regulars was old man Arthur.
Who are you?
A one-time legendary producer.
You're ugly.
"In his prime, he ripped off every musician he ever worked with."
Stop!
Stop!
This is crap!
But now those same players were tired of his act.
When you gonna pay us our royalties?
"- Yes, when are you?"
"- I want my money, man."
I created the Wall of Sound.
Don't talk to me like that.
"Musicians, as you know, are always excited if somebody's interested in them, and you're just-- they're just tryin' to make it, especially when you're young."
"Back in the 50s, when everybody was, you know, cutting singles, and everybody just wanted a taste of that."
"They were just like, sure, I'll sign this, I'll sign that."
"The people that were makin' hit records that are still played, they're listening, I'm sure, at home, just thinkin' about how they-- they could have been livin' in mansions, still,"
"at this point, or at least, you know, not ending up in an old folks' home with no money left, you know?"
♪ I'm old!
♪
You guys stink worse than my diapers!
"From musicians to his nurse,"
Arthur was an equal opportunity jerk.
- Right here.
Nothing's as dull as a Labor Day speech.
"I didn't bring you here to explain how management and labor must pull together, not in opposite directions."
You've got living proof of it in our prosperity.
And there's more to come.
Meet me halfway and you'll never be unemployed as long as men and women don't go back to wearing fig leaves.
"And if they did, I'll bet we'd be in the fig-leaf business sooner than anybody east of the Alleghenies."
"Now aside from this celebration, this is a proud moment of my life."
Tomorrow my son Rodney leaves for Harvard.
Let's get the fun started and give him a sendoff!
End of speech.
Just beside myself.
"First Paul goes, and then Lucas."
I don't know if Selena and me can keep working and take care of Joey.
- You'll just have to keep trying.
- I've been trying all my life.
"With a husband drunk all the time and a grown girl dressing and undressing in front of him, and him staring at her all the time staring at her and thinking... ."
"- Oh, Nellie."
- We all have our problems.
- Staring at her staring at her.
...and staring at her.
Hello.
Hello.
What are you doing out here by yourself?
I'm not used to being at home with Nellie.
She has too many problems.
"As for the outing, I've seen them all."
"Let's go for a drive, try to find something interesting to do far away from Peyton Place."
Now you're beginning to think like a true suspicious native.
All right.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!
- What's he want from you?
"- Layout of the club, front and back exits, where the apartment is."
- You know where he's staying?
- No idea.
- We always meet on the street.
"- Next time you take a meeting,"
- let me know up front.
- I don't think he wants to take you over the line and hand you over.
I get a different feeling.
- Like what?
"- Like he doesn't care how he does it, as long as he takes you out of the picture."
"Maybe you know something about this, a new crew trying to take over the Vanya Hotel."
That's true.
There's been a few fights.
"No-one dead yet, but that's only a matter of time."
Americans is what I heard.
We're hearing the same thing.
What the fuck is going on here?
"Something, that's for sure."
"Every time I call Julianna for a date, she says that she is busy and she can't make it."
She says she's working for the Government full time
- and to leave her alone.
- What's your problem?
"My problem is, I invested a lot of money in her."
"I paid to bring her here, I put her up in an apartment"
- and now I'm not getting paid.
- You might recall that's part of the deal you made with us in exchange for citizenship.
My deal was for my cooperation.
It was not to subsidise the Canadian spy service.
"If you are taking Julianna, or any of my girls out of service,"
I would like to be compensated for it.
I am not a charity.
I met their spokesman.
They gave me this.
What does the NTSB say about this?
The NTSB isn't getting involved.
Neither is the FAA.
They've all washed their hands of it.
"The airline is registered in the Virgin Islands, the tour operator in the Caymans."
The crew is from Russia.
They still don't know if the plane crashed in Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
Every day it's a different story.
But the plane was due to land here in the US?
Seems like everyone forgot that.
The FAA isn't going to go poking its nose in.
"Too much work, too much hassle, too much everything."
Nathan?
I don't like the smell of it.
"If the FAA won't get involved, that means a lawsuit like this could drag on for years."
That means hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And it means we can forget about the Hague Protocol.
I don't like it.
"Excuse me, since when are we afraid of cases that drag on for years?"
These people are going to get fucked over on the pretext that no convention...
It was the same shit in Unterlinguen.
In Kinshasa too.
A judge will show up with his calculator and say what?
"""All right, let's imagine some two-year-old kid"
"""who has lost his mother."
"""We'll say she'd have devoted how much of her time to him, per day?"""
- Michael?
"- Three hours, tops."
That's a good mother.
"Up until the age of 18, which gives us three hours a day, times 365 days, times $8 an hour, plus the usual interest... that totals a little less than $100,000 at best."
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
- Hello?
- I've just killed two people.
My aunt and my uncle.
My name's John Mercer.
How did I become a hit man for the state?
"It all began five years into my life sentence, on the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison."
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
Maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
He liked emotions.
They gave him something to manipulate.
So while the rest watch the Champions League... you stop trying to push down the walls... you pick up your book... and you worry about the mystery of things.
"Lenny offered me a new life, a new home, a new family."
But there was a price.
And that was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders but somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
And his first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
"Now, how can I describe him?"
Take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
"You think you've left them behind, you think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again."
That's Calum.
Che-hey!
"First time I heard this tune, I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds, Niamh and Catherine, cousins from Burnley, mate."
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum."
"Mate, I'm not joking, this tune was playing,"
"I had me hand up both of their skirts at the same time, it was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep."
"Very suave, man, very suave."
"You carry crime scene gloves now, too?"
"Well, it's become kind of a habit."
"No I.D. on him, McGee, other than the air marshal credentials."
"If I had your crime scene gizmo, I could get his prints."
Do you have any adhesive tape and baby powder handy?
"Wait, hold on, Bishop."
Is that Beer's wallet?
Yeah.
Killer took his credentials but not this.
"Driver's license, cash, credit cards-- it's all there."
What are you thinking?
He wasn't looking to play air marshal very long.
Just long enough to go to the airport to do what he needed to do.
"Whatever that was, he was obviously killed before he got the job done."
Unless his job was to kill Beers and take his identity.
And deliver his weapon to the airport.
But deliver it to who?
And why?
Why would someone deliver a gun just to end up dead himself?
Honor among thieves?
That's not really a thing.
Beers was a good man.
But our TSA screeners don't know every air marshal on sight.
New ones come through here every day.
At least now we know what all the chatter was about.
"But whoever's got the gun is outside, waiting to use it."
So we start searching passengers.
That's one sure way to force our killer's hand.
I was thinking of a less violent idea.
He had to walk right past us in the eight minutes we were waiting outside.
We have a surveillance camera pointed right at that door.
"Be right back, Bishop."
- Beat it.
- Damn. [Groans]
"I'm gonna check on this address in the Bronx... and if they don't know you there, it's your ass."
[Cloudy] I thought I told you to stand there.
Get that hair done before Saturday.
We're going now.
Good-bye.
[Cloudy] Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"All that is great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood."
"Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes?"
Give us a shot at it.
At least till we find out if there's anything here or not.
"Everybody wants Weinstock, right?"
"Well, maybe here's the lead we're looking for."
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser... with this garbage you're bringing in here.
The man has done absolutely nothing.
"The first thing you know, you'll wind up in an entrapment rap— the both of you."
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys... that own candy stores, two cars, and like to go to nightclubs."
"Yeah, but you put this little candy store hustler together... with Joel Weinstock, and maybe we got a big score."
"Big score, my ass."
At best he's selling nickel and dime bags.
"I wouldn't be infringing on your coffee break, Simonson... if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer."
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle."
Or have you forgotten about that already?
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy."
What's happened to you guys lately?
Every year you lead the Narcotics Bureau in arrests.
"What was it, over a hundred again last year?"
Terrific.
But who?
I'll always love you.
To stop her suffering Aifredo left.
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
Alot of things happen in the film.
But what's important is that after years of remorse and study
Amparo finds the address of Aifredo's mother.
And she turns up there.
"Hotel Youkali, Room No 15."
"Sleep, my love."
What if I squash you when I move?
And Aif redo
stays inside her... forever.
A MONTH LATER
"Come on, put your hands right."
That's it.
It's so cool here.
It's wonderful!
"It's lovely out on the terrace, isn't it?"
"And Lydia likes being out on the terrace, don't you, Lydia?"
"You heard her, she loves it."
Look at them.
It's like they were talking about us.
What do you think they'd talk about?
Women tell each other everything.
Lydia would tell her it's two months today since she was gored.
"Benjamin and Angela, do you come here of your own free will to be united in matrimony?"
"Yes, we do."
"That being so, as you wish to be united in holy matrimony, join hands and declare your consent before God and His Church."
"I, Angela, take you, Benjamin, as my husband, and I give myself to you, and I promise to be faithful to you, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health,"
all the days of my life.
"May the Lord, who caused this love to grow in you, confirm this mutual consent you have stated before His Church."
"So David, you've read the books, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, they're just, they're quite complicated."
You know?
"I will say that about them, it's just generally,"
"I feel I grew up in a more simple time, when a wizard had a pointy hat, you know?"
"It was a man, a woman that was a wizard was a witch, and had a cow, uh, or a cat."
A cow?
"Sorry, yeah..."
"It's quite complicated, people."
"They're quite complicated,"
David wasn't able to remember all the facts.
I love all the Harry Potter books.
"The only thing is, like, Hogwarts is not a great school."
"Every year, they have a rather large amount of accidents involving children, at least one of the staff members get murdered, like, Ofsted should be stepping in."
"""What is going on here?"
"There's a snake in the sewer."""
"I've not really read Harry Potter, I've not watched the films."
"It's, it just, it reinforces the fact that boarding schools are weird, innit?"
The reason you wouldn't enjoy it is because the kid with hair like yours is the baddie.
We're always the baddie!
"I heard the best, uh, Harry Potter chat-up line, was a guy saying, ""I'm Draco Malfoy, can I slither in?"""
Ohh!
"What I like about films is, um, you know, cos Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, it was so method, he's actually stayed a child."
Have you seen you?
What?
"Shall we have a look at, uh..."
"I mean, obviously JK Rowling has legions of fans."
This may be her biggest fan.
"Hello, I'm Harry Potter himself."
You're looking for America's biggest Harry Potter fan.
"But you're in luck, you found the world's biggest Harry Potter fan."
"In 2006, watch it, steady on."
"You were not wasting funds to aid Madam Jami, who sponsors you?"
On what grounds do you accuse me of this?
The governor arrived a month ago to observe the state of things in Mujinju.
You served as captain of the Manbo Division.
How did you rise from such an insignificant post to the post of governor?
I know that Madam Jami is sponsoring you.
"I also know that you have yielded the operation of Dukjin Harbor to Madam Jami,"
and aided her in winning trade rights with China when she was involved in a mishap in Yangzhou.
Can you still say you have governed well?
"I am of a mind to report your wrongdoings to the imperial court, but I will overlook them as a courtesy to the former governor."
The new governor has arrived.
I know.
What am I to do now?
Why are you asking me that?
You should find your own way out of this mess.
Madam.
How could she do this?
Kim Chang-gyum knows a lot about you.
He could bring harm to you if you turn him away cold.
He lacks the courage to do so.
This is Madam Jami.
What brings you here?
I came to greet the governor.
Please wait a moment.
Madam Jami has been waiting for hours.
You should return for today and come back another day.
I will wait.
Governor.
Tell her I do not wish to see her.
"Yes, sir."
The governor wishes to see you another day.
Certainly.
You've brought me all the way up here to show me statues?
- Give them room.
"- ""Give them room""?"
(roars)
"Heads up, lads."
We've got a bit more company than usual.
So... you finally decided it was time?
Better late than never.
"So they've taken an oath to protect the city, as they once protected their castle centuries ago."
Except these days the people we watch over have no clue that we exist.
Aye.
And that's fine by us.
"Elisa's done well by you, Bluestone."
You've proven yourself a loyal partner and a righteous policeman.
"- And you'll keep their secret, right?"
"- Oh, I'll keep it."
But I want a favor in return.
Trust is not a commodity to be bartered for.
"Time you and I talked, Goliath... man-to-gargoyle."
"Goliath was nobody's fool, but Mace Malone had made it clear- if I didn't deliver the big guy to Hotel Cabal, I could kiss the Illuminati goodbye."
Don't you think it's about time you told us what's up?
Malone has an office in a condemned hotel.
All the entrances are sealed off.
"If Goliath can get me inside, I can find the proof I need to expose the Illuminati."
"We'll back you up, lad."
Just say the word.
"We don't want to lay siege to the place, Hudson, just sneak in and out."
- This job is for two.
- Make that three.
Not this time.
"If you trust me, Elisa, really trust me, stay out of this."
All right.
I love pancakes in the afternoon.
"- You like pancakes, Sofia?"
- I like pancakes.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Seem more like a napalm-in-the-morning-guy.
"Well, that too."
"I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Sofia."
- It's a broad question.
- Who the hell are you guys?
"Sofia, we know that you spoke to Dawkins this morning."
"You seem like a reasonable, nice lady, who has made some bad relationship decisions, which I can totally relate to."
- So we're gonna give you a break.
- Yeah.
"I mean, this can really only go two ways."
"First, you sit down, you tell us what we wanna know, then you finish your shift and you go home."
"Second, is that we arrest you in front of all these nice customers and you lose your job."
And I gotta get my pancakes to go.
"Because you've been uncooperative, and helped a man who killed three people today,"
You go to jail for aiding and abetting a fugitive.
Why don't you take a seat?
You recognize this couple?
No.
Who are they?
"They're two tourists that your boyfriend attacked today,"
- Dana Thorpe and Craig Ellers.
- They're staying at the Kahiko.
- How do you know that?
- I have a friend who works there.
"Last time I went to see Walton, he asked me to call her, find out when those two were scheduled to check in."
That information got Dana shot.
"Look, he didn't say anything about hurting them."
"I've got a lot of weed in production, I need the pipeline."
I'll give you a piece of every pound we move.
"But I've got to let you know, we're talking to other people about that."
"That's why I'm here, to let you know I'm interested."
- Consider it.
- Beautiful.
"Anyway, I just wanted you to know I'm back in business and flushed with cash."
- So let me know.
- All right.
We'll be in touch.
Take it easy.
You heard what he said.
"I'm telling you, there's something way bigger than us going on here."
Katarina tells me you're threatening to leave her... and work for me full time.
Katarina doesn't own me... and neither do you.
You can't be talking to people about our relationship.
"Not Katarina, no-one."
I apologize.
- What's this?
- That is the... agenda for the Blackmire Group's meetings in the Mexico.
I took it from George Browne's briefcase this afternoon.
This is the things I'm talking about when you act without consulting us.
"If you took it from his briefcase, he's gonna discover it's missing."
And you risk exposing my entire operation.
"If he finds the briefcase, but he won't."
He left it in the taxi.
"And now you have George Browne's briefcase, because?"
I called the taxi company and I go to pick it up.
I'm giving it back to him tonight when I see him.
- You're seeing him again tonight?
- In about 15 minutes.
We need the wire van outside of Julianna's immediately.
Think of it like the WWE.
"Except it'll really be me kicking yo bitch ass every night, you punk-ass faggot-ass bitch!"
"What you guys do together is like watching the Harlem Globetrotters beat the Washington Generals, except it's an old, black man kicking another old, black man's ass!"
I don't want to do this!
Why do I have to keep fighting this man?
I killed him already!
"Granddad, you got to take all that anger you've been feeling and hold onto it real tight!"
"Focus on it, and so on fight night in two weeks, that's how you're gonna find the strength to beat this nigga in front of the whole world!"
Yeah.
He made you look like a punk in front of everybody!
"Now he living it up, getting money."
He's on TV.
I seen him on TMZ.
"Got some bad bitches, too..."
Bad ones.
We'd like to thank tonight's sponsors...
chicken and sugar water!
"Man, is that that new Stinkmeaner sketch comedy show on TBS?"
That nigga's everywhere!
"Take that rage, put it in your fists, granddad."
"Riley, you notice anything different about granddad?"
Hell yeah!
I'm noticing a lot different about granddad!
"He ain't never gonna get his ass beat again, and it's all because of me!"
"I told him to take all that hate, hold onto it!"
Stupid politicians are stupid.
"Everybody's fucking stupid, God damn it."
What... what... what is this shit here?
What is this... a fucking cooking show?
He keeps bumping into things.
"When he's not working out, this is all he does."
"Fuck, it's all a bunch of bullshit anyway."
"Therefore if we want to catch Ronaldo, we have to focus on Niko."
All right?
The whores change places often so as not to be noticed.
"According to Jésus' info, they were on quai de la Charente."
"So, starting tonight, we're camping there with sleeping bags and Thermos flasks."
What do we do about the Crime Squad?
- Nothing.
I want to be the only one informed about the investigation.
"It's every man for himself, and God for all."
Questions?
Finding the garage where he mutilated his victims confirms he was involved in Karine Lavergne and Célia Moreau's deaths.
A bench warrant has been issued for him.
"So, what do you think?"
I think you freed a man who killed two women.
You think like a prosecutor!
It's really good for the practice.
Do you know where he is?
"It's stupid, he came by yesterday."
"If I'd known, he was right here."
I'm not sure I understand you correctly.
You wanted to turn him in?
- A client on the run is worth nothing.
"However, a good trial..."
"It's this kind of case that I get up every morning for, Pierre."
"Everybody can fight for a victim, but it bores me."
"Fighting for a monster, though... that's exciting."
It's challenging!
"It may not be easy to hear, but welcome to the adult world."
Can you just tell me why you became a lawyer?
Don't you have an appointment at the court?
Yes.
What's the judge going to think?
"Before Arthur can graduate, he must pass summer school."
"And for the first time in three years, Shannon isn't there with him."
"The other country, of course, we said- he thought he could sell drugs and don't get caught,you know."
But he found out the hard way.
"And I told him, while he was doing all that -"
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.
"I was like, man, ""Shannon, you should stop, man."
"Stop doing that stuff. """
We always said we weren't gonna never do no stufflike that.
We werejust gonna go on and graduate and go on to college.
"But,you know, he had to be the one."
"One week before his graduation, Arthur is robbed at gunpoint."
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me because I didn't have no money.
"'Cause he kept asking me, ""You got - You got some money."
"Where your wallet at?"""
"Be like, ""What you driving a car like this for?"""
"I was, like, ""I ain't got no wallet. """
"And then,you know, he grabbed me and stuff,and I was- and I was about to panic and stuff, and I just calmed down."
I sit down and had a long talk with him and his sister.
Someone pulled a pistol on her right down the street from the house.
"I said, ""Do you all understand what is going on out here in these streets today?"
"'"""
"Even with me, when I was out there - you know, out there strung out - you know, I looked for somebody that seemed like they had something."
hmm.
"After this, I -"
I
- I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.
'Cause there ain't no -
Everybody up here going to jail or- or either in drugs.
Or dead.
James Davis.
"Oh, we haven't heard that one, cos we call them Reg Grundies - undies."
"Oh, there you are, you see."
Perfect.
Here's a quite interesting thing about rhyming slang.
"I heard someone in a London market talking and saying, ""I'm not Listerine."" And I said to him, ""What do you mean, Listerine?"""
And Listerine is an example of a sort of...
"a rhyming slang that's moved on one, because an American in rhyming slang is often called a septic, short for septic tank."
Yank.
Which you've probably heard.
"So if you don't like Americans, you are antiseptic."
"And if you're antiseptic, you're Listerine."
"- (Julia) Oh, I like it!"
- (Stephen) See?
Listerine.
There you are.
"So, in the same way, while we're on the subject, you can have a rubber Gregory."
- (Julia) I love it.
- Do you know what it is?
A peck.
Gregory Peck?
Rubber neck.
That would work as a rubber neck.
It's a cheque that bounces.
"A Gregory Peck is a cheque and so if your cheque bounces - in other words, returned by the bank - it's a rubber... (Cockney accent) ""He gave me a rubber Gregory."""
Do you like my earthy street London accent there?
- He sounds like such an idiot.
- Yeah.
"There we are, ladies and gentlemen."
"In the right hands, even a meaningless two-syllable name can be made as frisky as a gay ferret in a pink blender."
I leave you with one last Alan.
"Alan Bennett, who when asked if he was gay, replied wearily:"
"(as Alan Bennett) ""That's a bit like asking a man crawling across the Sahara whether he would prefer Perrier or Malvern water""."
"But at that moment, I'd never looked at her that way."
"She's a policewoman, of course!"
"Oh, my God!"
I sit down.
And I sit down on the couch.
"My dad goes, ""Finished with your bath?"""
And you know that poker kind of...
"And you go, ""Yeah, yeah."""
"""Good, cos you know what they say, don't you?"""
"""No."""
"""Cleanliness is next to godliness."""
"And you know when you're going,"
"""You fucking bastard."
"You absolute...!"""
And it was just that...
I'm dead now.
"I'm no longer the son that he raised, the son that was gonna be anything."
It was an horrendous...
And I went back next month just to check.
"Yeah, it's still the newsletter."
Did you never see that policewoman again?
The policewoman?
"No, well, the thing is, she moved on, didn't she?"
You'd have to invent a scenario where you didn't see her any more.
"No, I didn't, but you know what I did after that?"
"I made a pact with God, because I had this thing."
"I had so much guilt over it that the next fucking book I looked at,"
"I realised that certain woman had crucifixes on, so I actually said a thing of going,"
"""I know it's wrong, but I'm just attracted to it."""
"""I won't masturbate over anyone that has a crucifix on,"
"""as long as they've got jewellery on that doesn't refer to"
"""Christ our Lord being hung on the cross."
And love them more than you?
Never.
"Remember, in my life, in this world there will always only be one Harriet."
So get back to work...
you've lost nearly an entire day on your notebook.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?
"Did I hear you say ""It doesn't matter""?"
Because I thought I heard you say
"""It doesn't matter,"""
"but Harriet wouldn't say that, would she?"
"Now come on... just because you're on your own, doesn't mean the world stops turning, or that there are no more fascinating people to observe and fill your notebooks with."
"That's your job, Harriet."
That's your job for life.
"And when you're all grown up and you sell your first novel,"
"I'll be first in line at that bookstore, getting my autographed copy."
I hope.
I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to cry.
"Ah, it's okay to cry."
"But whatever you do, don't laugh."
"No, Harriet,"
"I will not tolerate laughter as I leave, no."
Hey... come here.
You remember... a good spy can get in there and fight.
"Good-bye, Harriet the Spy."
"I was kind of worried, you know?"
"I kind of thought, ""Well, there's something wrong with me or something,"" and so..."
"Growing up from girl to woman, there's so much to get used to."
This is the time when a whole new set of feelings unfold.
Feelings about yourself and your maturing body...
- Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me,... ..and the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."
Do you agree with the recent survey finding... ..that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?
"Toutá fait, oui."
Here's the warrants and the court order for the wire tap.
Judge gave you 60 days.
Mulderig and Klein'll sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"Ifthis is the way you're comin' in on this, why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?"
- Because that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
"Bill, do me a favour, give them a chance."
He came in with a little basic information.
"You worked with him, had some trouble, but don't get off on the wrong foot."
"- You have any problems, come to me."
"- Simonson, just keep off my back."
Just try and cool it with him.
"Ifyou have any problems, come to me."
I'll handle him.
- I'll be happy to work with him.
- He's a good cop.
- He's got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine.
Just keep him off my back.
Florida's MackelBrothers invite you tojoin the great escape.
"You can saygoodbye to airpollution, commuting, high prices, rising taxes... ..and cold, depressing winters."
"MackelBrothers willshowyou the way to Florida andfresh, clean air."
What?
What about Ajussi...?
He left home over ten days ago.
So you two are alone...
"Ah, I'm almost going crazy."
Then why not go to the orphanage to eat?
Why eat bread?
What if our friends find out that we're on welfare?
They'll make fun of us and call us beggars.
"Instead of everyone treating us like beggars, we'd rather starve and eat bread or noodles."
It's better to starve than to be pitied.
Anything is better than being called a beggar!
Sleep.
How can you make a sick child cry?
"Oh, what bad luck is this!"
"If there was nothing wrong with my leg, I wouldn't have asked you to come, so stop complaining!"
I hate places with no beautiful girls the most!
You're using your leg injury as an excuse to order me around.
Aren't you going to give me some sort of stamp?
The welfare office says that they don't have an application for the children.
"They said that the children cannot be added to the current waiting list, so they are currently starving."
The staff responsible aren't available at the moment.
Could you please wait a moment?
What are the children's names?
"Song Mi Jin, and Song Do Jin, living in Hongji-dong."
"From this information, they have already been registered for the meals."
It's from Sunshine Welfare.
Sunshine Welfare?
"Because the children are registered, there's a mark here."
Check it out.
11 million Won is transferred to this account every month.
"Ah, Shin Jae Dong!"
"Oh, one other thing - if this photographer does lead us to the vampire,"
how do we stop it?
- I'll take care of that.
"- Oh, really?"
What?
Surely Detective you don't have a problem with vampire and vampire violence?
What if this vampire is stronger than you?
"Come on, Henry, anything is possible here, okay?"
I just want to know how to kill the thing.
"All right, I swear that if I ever try to kill you again,"
I won't use any method you tell me about.
"Strangely enough detective, I believe you."
Thank you.
"A stake through the heart always works... sunlight, emolation."
"Come on, I've seen the movies, give me something special here."
What?
Like a secret word that makes our heads explode?
That would work.
Is there one?
"No, but decapitation's always effective."
Watch where you swing that thing.
If we are confronted with the other vampire it will attack me first.
How can you be so sure?
"It won't find you any kind of threat, and we can use that distraction to our advantage."
"Hey, I'm the one wearing the badge here, remember?"
And I'm the vampire.
"If you want the killing to stop, you'll do as I say."
"Oh, hey, what about holy water?"
Shall we?
Grenfield?
- Live photo release forms.
- Yeah.
"At the moment, we're 2 and 8."
"We lost four starters to high school, but we're on the upswing."
Great.
"So since I was in the neighborhood, I was..."
"Well, I thought maybe we could continue our conversation."
"Well, let's just say that I'm ready for you to continue your part of the conversation, and I'll decide whether or not I'm ready to respond."
Are you a lawyer?
"Okay, so you tried to save this building."
You got a TRO.
May I?
"Uh, and you tried to make it stick, and what did you think your chances were of getting a permanent injunction?"
Pretty good.
That's a lawyerly phrase.
I like its specificity.
What do you want?
How good was your case?
It was very good.
We discovered there had been a verbal agreement by the occupants to purchase the building.
"Sounds good, yet the judge threw it out on its merits."
How did you feel about that?
- Was I sad?
"- Okay, were..."
- Were you surprised?
- There's something that I missed?
I can't imagine someone of your ability could've missed anything.
"Well, then, what's the point of asking whether or..."
"Oh, my God."
- They bought the judge.
- Bite your tongue.
This is a public official we're talking about.
"- God, that's what this is about."
- lmagine a powerful corporation supporting justice to serve their own ends. lt's shocking.
I'm sure of it.
Why's that?
"Grandma doesn't like America, and it's only natural."
"After all, Grandpa was killed by the atomic bomb."
I think he's right.
"You see, none of us and none of our parents know about war."
As for the atomic bomb....
"Sure, we've all heard about it."
But it meant nothing more than a sort of little scary fairy tale.
We never really understood the feelings of the people... who had the atom bomb dropped over their heads.
We never stopped to think.
Look at my mother.
"Just by being told that there's a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited."
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.
Big Sis!
"Here, eat these."
I'm really pleased... that you are so concerned about me.
I'm very grateful.
"But then, it was a Iong time ago when I felt bitter about America."
It's been more than 45 years since Grandpa died.
"Now, I don't particularly like... or dislike America."
It's all because of war.
War is to blame.
During the war many Japanese died... and many Americans also died.
Listen... because of a man called Suzujiro or whatever...
I don't think it's right for you to talk badly about your parents.
"I was the one who sort of drove them to go off to Hawaii... for my own joy of having the four of you here, all to myself, while they're gone."
"Anyway, I want all of you to stay here during summer vacation."
The rich man in Hawaii means nothing to me.
"You said it's more like a hobby to you, to kill your time."
"Right, but if you're forced to do this, it wouldn't go that easy."
"But if one is having fun with this and puts all his heart and soul into it, he works like he's getting the highest paycheck."
"Besides, it's kind of statistics that needs constant updates."
I was checking the yesterday's papers.
How about a coffee?
"- Thanks, I don't drink it early."
What kind of newspapers?
"I wouldn't want to be mysterious to you, but otherwise, if I tell you, you may think I'm a bit..."
You know.
Why not?
People do everything out of hobby.
"In fact, I'm doing crime statistics."
I'll give you a wet cloth.
What type of crime?
The financial one?
Something about your profession?
"- No, but crime in general."
There must be some criteria or logic.
There is logic.
"It's a crime statistics in the city of Zagreb, and I'm interested in Trnje neighborhood in particular."
"After all, that's where I come from."
"So, that's why you wanted to live in my house."
Yes...
"Among other things, too."
It's a crime statistics classified by various criteria.
Have a seat!
- Thank you very much.
Why do you need that?
It's a hobby.
I told you.
How come you got involved into crime?
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
"Hey, look, it's going to get better."
Sean?
Noooo!
"If Jackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably"
He'd have to forget everything... the murder.
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with
Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
doesn't know someone's controlling him.
Getting rid of the blood.
But he had help with one thing... the video.
And someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any of this?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with
Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
"So, that's it?"
Nothing goes on my permanent record about causing anyone any trouble?
No.
And my record?
You might want to ask for this to be made part of your record.
"The school board was really pleased with the way you handled the matter, especially considering you're a student teacher and this was your first day of school."
"They thought you followed the rules and,"
"""Conducted himself in a professional manner at a time"
"""when it would have been easier to avoid filing a report."""
Nice.
But I think I'd like to keep it confidential and off-record anyway.
Done.
Read something they said about me.
Did they say anything about me like that?
"About how quickly I apologized, admitted I was in the wrong?"
"Um, uh, I don't think so."
"Let me see, um..."
"""Understandable, considering the stress Ben has been under during the past year and..."""
So forth.
What's the so forth?
You want to just leave this alone?
"I mean, we both caught a break here."
"No, I do not just want to leave this alone, if you don't mind."
"I would like to know about the ""and so forth."""
"Oh, they just understood that there might be some jealousy since you both had a relationship with Adrian."
Both had a relationship?
I was married to her.
He wasn't married to her.
He's not married to her.
I might get married to her.
I asked her to marry me.
What?
"Nearly got yourselves killed, poking around the ruins."
MacGyver and Atticus have found the Ark of Solon.
Isn't that amazing?
"So Atticus is still hunting for the mythical Atlantis, is he?"
Heh.
The man will never learn.
"But if the Ark is genuine, and the Torch is inside, it's the greatest find of the century."
Where is this so-called Ark?
"The Royal Academy, sir."
"Well, I'll go and see for myself."
We have to run some tests.
I'll meet you back at your hotel room.
Don't be long.
My flight back to Greece leaves this afternoon.
Nice talking to you.
The years haven't mellowed him.
No.
That's my grandfather.
I thought he never left Greece.
I made the mistake of telling him that the university had offered me tenure.
So he made a special trip to talk me into accepting.
"According to Simon, staying at the university will mature me, like I was a bottle of wine or a wedge of cheese."
"What's with this ""Simon"" thing?"
He doesn't like being called grandfather.
Says it makes him feel old.
Simon's planned my whole life.
"It's all right for him to spend his time digging in ancient ruins, but I'm supposed to stay at the university and have a solid career."
"Which, roughly translated, means a safe career."
"Well, what do you want?"
A challenge.
Right now teaching is just repeating what I already know.
"I want to get out, see the world, learn new things."
I don't understand.
How does he keep coming back?
He said he was a clone.
A clone?
!
I know!
When did they start cloning people?
!
I watch the news!
Brian Williams never said nothing about no human cloning!
"Man, one of your fights got a total of seven million views so far!"
"Ooh, we should start a business of just letting you get your ass beat, granddad."
"I mean, niggas get beat up all the time, but people really get off seeing you get your ass beat!"
"Robert Freeman, you're the only person I know can get his ass whupped by a nigga he already killed a dozen times before!"
"I mean, by nature, niggas lose."
They losers.
"They natural-born losers, but you like some kind of heptathlete of losing."
"Not now, Ruckus!"
Not now!
"Well, I'd actually lower my voice, seeing as how you just got your ass whupped!"
Completely embarrassing!
"Oh, I can't see how a man could achieve a quality erection after getting beaten that bad."
Then there's only one thing I can do.
I have to train.
"I have to become a master warrior so I can defeat my enemy in a rematch, preferably on video so I can post it online and salvage my dignity!"
"Ooh, that sounds like an awesome plan that can't go wrong, granddad!"
Millions of people would tune in just to see you die!
"Granddad, isn't that exactly what we did the first time this happened?"
Yeah.
And you ended up killing him.
Yeah.
See?
Good.
Let's hear it.
"Well, as suspected,"
Petty Officer Adams' death was caused by a single stab wound.
"The knife perforated his spleen and stomach, resulting in massive internal bleeding."
"The angle of the blade suggests that he was attacked from the front, straight on."
He was face-to-face with his killer.
"So, maybe he knew the person."
They were familiar.
Not necessarily.
Prints that we managed to lift from the body are being analyzed as we speak.
Was there anything unique about the weapon?
Not that I could see.
"No, the-the edges of the wound were precise and clean, with no evidence of a serrated blade."
But Ms. Sciuto is performing further tests on the tissue.
"What about the bruises, Duck?"
"Ah, they're informative, actually."
"They had begun to change color, and that tells me that the fight occurred several hours before his death."
So he fought with someone other than his killer?
It's possible.
It's also possible that the...
Killer came back to finish the job.
Thank you.
"Michael didn't do it, Gibbs."
I never said he did.
"And despite my ties to him,"
I won't try and sway this investigation.
"I never said that, either."
Oh.
"Hey, honey."
"Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't call you back."
"No, I don't think I'm gonna make it home for dinner."
"A new carriage, 40,000."
"A silver locket, 7,000."
"Wine, 2,000."
All of these were placed against the King's account.
"A total, over 100,000 pounds and should have been paid one month ago."
"Well, I am sure, when the King returns, he will settle any outstanding debts."
"As you know, anyone unable to pay their debts loses their allowance and is automatically banished from court."
Her Majesty seems ignorant of the fact that we are not in Spain and we do not have Inquisitions in France.
"Sire, it is a pleasure to see you return."
Where is Her Majesty?
"She is in conference, Sire."
The King!
Clear the room!
The Marquise de Montespan shall remain.
"You have been missed, by none more so than myself."
I missed you too.
You did not reply to my letters.
May I ask why?
"While I was at war, I thought back to the vision I had when they laid the first stones of this palace."
The dream of an eternal empire with Versailles at it's center.
And I realized that my dream was suffocating.
"Versailles was dying, and I was dying with it."
"And the person ,who had been my companion for so long, was blinding me to my true purpose."
"His Majesty is weary, perhaps."
I would be alone.
"Solange, please close the door."
"No doubt, the war has taken it's toll and he is in need of rest."
He was in good spirits?
Indeed.
The King's thrown himself back into matters of state and the construction of the palace.
"Well, no doubt, he was delighted to see you."
"Solange, please ask the maid to prepare my bath."
"First page, no context, but you throw in a couple more, suddenly you're announcing the weaknesses of every port on the Eastern seaboard."
"Cyber division couldn't ID the source of the breach in AUTEC's firewall, but they did tell us the blackmail message was e-mailed from..."
Wickes Steel.
"Last month, the Navy said that they were done with Wickes."
"Good-bye government contracts, hello bankruptcy."
"So, the blackmailer is Phillip Wickes?"
GIBBS:
It's his company.
He's got a pretty good motive.
But how is pretending to shoot SECNAV going to lead us to our blackmailer?
RYAN:
"Seeing his childhood friend shot,"
Wickes is highly vulnerable.
The idea is to tell him that we've connected the shooting to Wickes Steel and AUTEC.
"If Wickes is part of this blackmail, then he's going to want to know why his people pulled the trigger."
Eyes and ears on this guy 24/7.
Anyone he connects with is a suspect.
What if Wickes isn't involved?
"Oh, he'll tell us something, even if he doesn't intend to."
Got your earpiece.
"No, I don't need you in my ear, Doc."
(chuckles) You know what you need.
"Oh, yes I do."
Really?
Yeah.
"Hey, you think you don't need me,"
"Agent Gibbs, but you're wrong."
But now I'm curious.
What do you need?
"Well, that question works both ways."
"I need you to go in there, and man-to-man, establish a bond with Wickes."
"I need you to say what I tell you, when I tell you."
There's seriously not one single job that doesn't require prior experience.
"What about prior experiences, you know,like experiencing the nitty-gritty of real life?"
You should say that on your next interview.
"Yeah,I'm taking advice from the chick who bases her decisions on vomit and bird poop."
"Dude,cinnamon graham crackers?"
I grabbed without looking.
"Cyrus,why can't you just take that job at the nursing home?"
"Because when I went to visit my grandmother, one of the old ladies sexually harassed me."
And the hospital director has the balls to say it's my fault 'cause I dressed too sexy.
I don't need that.
Hey.
"Baby,what did you want for breakfast, but you just couldn't have?"
S'mores.
"Oh,baby... why did you get the cinnamon ones?"
Oh...
Want to come to a show with me tonight?
It'll suck.
"You know what,I would, but,um..."
I can't.
You can't come to a show because your crotch shed?
What do you think?
"I was the afraid the Hitler made me look too fat,so I went with Gandhi."
- You want my honest opinion?
- Of course.
"My main thought is,really?"
"I mean,come on already."
You ladies and your advanced grooming.
When did having a vagina become a full-time job?
"You know how much pressure you're putting on the lazy,pain-fearing Lincolns of the world?"
I'm just giving it a try.
Relax.
"I'm sorry,but you teach high school history."
Don't bring an Austrian back with you from your holiday.
I'll bring an Italian.
"Or, God forbid, a little Austrian."
"Marcel, keep your stupid remarks to yourself!"
"Just wait, if someone comes."
You shouldn't have said that!
Such girls can be easily duped by some older... I'm telling you that from experience.
That's no trivial matter.
Why are you surprised?
Can't I have experience of young people?
"As it happens, we met some young people in a bar... a group of young girls, I don't know what attracted them, an old man knows how to..."
So what attracted them?
I don't know either.
"Nor do I, but they rose to the bait."
Such girls easily let themselves...
"A young girl rises to the bait, and an older man..."
"That young girl can take it idealistically, but the greedy old tomcat needn't."
- l know that very well.
- What do you know?
Tell us.
What should I tell you?
"I was in Bratislava... I'd compare it to the white nights in Moscow, but Bratislava wasn't Moscow."
"I'm an idealist from that point of view, I can imagine it, and I led that girl on to the point where..."
- What's up?
- Can't I look at you?
What you're saying surprises me.
It surprises you?
Better not take the tips.
It doesn't look good.
"They give it to the chamber maid, but we don't have to rely on it."
Who knows what they would think of us.
- l shouldn't take them?
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.
Those are about $ 120 apiece.
You need to be very careful with this decision.
"You know, if you come in and act right, you're going out ofhere... with two years of your college finished... a scholarship to a Division I university."
Exactly where you'd want to be- on track to graduate in four years.
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms... but it does have a basketball house.
All the ballplayers on scholarship live here.
"Get your ass up, nigga."
Of the seven blacks in the entire school... six live in this house.
"You come in and look at this little house, then after a while you get used to it."
"Try to make a little home, you know."
home away from home anyway.
We hang around each other most of the time.
"We know who to trust, who not to trust."
I just want to go somewhere where I'm gonna play.
I can get the grades.
I love basketball.
how many of your players that leave there and they end up going to a four-year college?
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?
Every last one of'em he coached.
- hi. how you doing?
- hey. how you doing?
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.
She asked him to return today over Arthur's objections.
I'll show you exactly what the scholarship entails.
Is this a full scholarship for the two years?
The reason I'm skeptical is because of the promises that was made in the past.
I'm this close!
Gee!
We don't have enough hard evidence.
We have to let her go.
"You were close, weren't you?"
"Gee, it's her!"
"I'm sorry, Frank."
"She kills eight people, walks out free and I get sued?"
- Russem claims you burned her.
- She burned herself.
He says you manipulated Wilgis' alter into burning herself.
- So let her alter sue me.
- He says her alter intends to.
"Relax, Frank, the gloves we found in her apartment"
- match gloves found on the victims.
- Circumstantial.
We got proof from the store where she bought 'em.
- Not the point.
- Whose side are you on?
Yours.
Part of being public advocate is playing Devil's advocate.
What about the ball peen hammer we found in her kitchen?
A woman can easily kill another woman with that.
"One front, one back"
"We ran a blood leuka but it didn't turn for any blood residue, so we send it to the lab for more tests."
"Guys, you're not hearing me."
"Normally I'd say great, this stuff is pretty good."
This is not your average case.
We're talking about a woman who claims to be four people.
So we get an alternate personality to testify against the killer?
You're making her testify against herself.
I'm saying she has multiple personality disorder.
Do you even get what you've done?
Mom is furious.
Kitty and Justin are reeling.
"I mean, Sarah is mortified."
As am I. As is Tommy.
Did you stop and think for a split second how bad this makes us look?
I wasn't thinking about you.
- You weren't thinking of anyone!
- I was thinking about your mother.
You had absolutely no right to do this without consulting us.
I have every right.
She's my sister.
You wouldn't do the same thing if it were Kitty or Sarah?
"I wouldn't single-handedly sell out the rest of my family, no."
"You weren't there, Kevin."
"She was sitting in front of me, opening up her heart to Holly."
Berating herself for misjudging her.
She expected me to tell her that she was doing the right thing.
"And I will be damned if I will let her make herself vulnerable in that way, only to have her world come crashing down again."
You better hope this family finds a way to repair itself.
"Because if this does any lasting damage,"
I'm holding you responsible.
I learned something interesting today.
You know the San Francisco cable cars are the only moving national monument?
Didn't know that.
I've told you every time I sleep with somebody I work with.
- You can't tell me we have a sister?
- Half-sister.
"For the 400th time, Kitty, I am sorry."
- I don't know what else to say.
- I thought you were gonna table this.
"- Yeah, so did I!"
"You employ an army of idle security policemen, and I find these on my breakfast table."
"If they reach the palace, I might find a guerrillero by my bed one night."
- It's only a piece of paper.
- Many nasty things have started on paper.
- Who's behind this?
- Ask your generals.
- Benítez is getting impatient out there.
- Ask him in.
We both know that Carrasco is behind this.
He's the only one capable of being a champion of the people.
He is already a legend.
He's being hyped as an immortal.
You know what the people are like.
Get rid of that guy.
"So, General, what unpleasant news have you got today?"
Another destroyed dam?
I'm passing on a request from General Gómez.
Out with it.
What does he want?
That's enough now.
Do you hear me?
"Come on, off you go."
"Gómez is convinced he can beat the guerrilleros within two weeks, but in order to carry out this operation, he will need fuel for his planes and artillery."
His pioneers are building a pontoon bridge that we need for our supplies.
That would be a shortcut to Marbella.
"If we manage to create this link, it will be a vital step forward for us."
Will it?
"All right, General, that sounds plausible."
But we can't afford any more defeats.
We're having difficulty financing this war.
Anything else?
I need additional troops.
"That's just exactly what I've done, sir."
In fact... (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
"Could you open this, sir?"
I still don't have the knack.
"I would like for us to know, Lieutenant, the meaning of this."
"Sid, please."
"He asked me where you were, Lieutenant."
I hope it's okay that I told him.
May I ask what this was all about?
"Oh, there's the sweater."
Does it match up with the thread?
I think so.
"We gotta take it down to the lab, though, Lieutenant."
It's the only piece of clothing that even came close.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Lieutenant, but I do know that suspicion is being deliberately cast on me and I can guess by whom."
"Well, sir, I won't deny that Lieutenant Lucerne..."
Will you stop calling him Lieutenant Lucerne?
He's a television detective.
You can't conduct an investigation based on his suspicions.
"Well, sir."
I did have a reason beyond his suspicions.
"You see, the gun that killed your wife, sir, had a little piece of thread that got caught on the trigger."
"I'm afraid, sir, that that thread came from this sweater."
A thread from my sweater?
"Yes, sir."
Mohair.
And the lab said navy blue mohair.
And I remembered that was the color of the sweater that you were wearing the first day that I met you.
The morning after she was murdered.
But that's incredible.
"Yes, sir, I agree with you."
But I've always had a good memory for colors.
"That's what you're doing, challenging me?"
I object to you.
I object to intellect without discipline.
I object to power without constructive purpose.
"Oh, Mr. Spock, you do have one saving grace after all."
You're ill-mannered.
"The human half of you, no doubt."
"Ah, come, my little wood nymph."
Won't you dance with your swain?
"Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl."
"Oh, I don't know how to play this."
Of course you do.
"Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?"
Until we can think our way out.
"Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality."
You should taste his food.
"Straw would taste better than his meat, water a hundred times better than his brandy."
Nothing has any taste at all.
"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
There's that magic word again.
"Does your logic find this fascinating, Mr. Spock?"
"No. ""Fascinating"" is a word I use for the unexpected."
"In this case,"
"I should think ""interesting"" would suffice."
"You don't find this unexpected, Mr. Spock?"
"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavor?"
No.
"It simply means that Trelane knows all ofthe Earth forms, but none ofthe substance."
"And if he's fallible, he can't be all-powerful, which means he has something helping him."
Evidently.
A machine?
A device?
"Forgive me, Father for I'm going to file a police report on all my worldly possessions."
"I know it's greedy and wrathful, but there's been a miscommunication."
And since we're discussing it I'm not really belonging here.
Aha.
- I knew you'd lapse.
- You.
You have some crust coming in like that.
How long have you been lurking?
Since you walked through those gates.
I had to make sure you didn't get any ideas in that nubbin of yours about leaving.
It's your fault I'm here.
You and your damn...
"Hail, Mary."
- Secrets.
"I spent so much time praying, I've run out of things to say."
I'm having awkward silences with God.
- I wanna go home.
- Where's home?
Back to slinging pies?
Where you spend every waking minute praying that the man you worship will show you some sign of his love?
You can do that here.
And commiserate.
These nuns aren't my people.
"Unless you're telling me ""flibbertigibbet"" is a title of respect."
You know things about me nobody knows.
This place knows things about me nobody knows.
You holidayed here 30 years ago and found a baby in a cabbage patch?
"And by ""cabbage patch,"" I mean your lady parts."
Vivian can never know about that.
"She thought I was in Paris, apprenticing in a world-class fromagerie."
Why don't you just tell her?
"Charlotte's father, my lover, was Vivian's fiancé."
It seems like if you have four good fingers and a thumb you oughta be able to use all of em.
- lt's very good.
- Very good.
"Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land when these United Nations fellows started worrying me."
Edward was a big noise in the Ministry of Food during the war.
"So we pulled ourselves up at the roots, and here we are, United Nations Relief."
Sounds like interesting work.
I'm preparing a report on soil erosion at the moment.
Parts of this country are not unlike your dustbowl formation.
"A thin layer of topsoil, and underneath, so -"
(Speaking French)
How do you like that?
First he promises to take us to dinner -
Yeah.
"Well, we just met him today, honey."
You can't expect him to change his whole life.
"Ben, what's the matter with you?"
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?
I just don't want to be insulted.
"0h, you're not being insulted."
You can't blame him for turning down an old married couple like us.
- We're not an old married couple!
- Alright.
"Alright, he's a heel."
"I don't understand him, but I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night."
(Clears Throat) I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow.
I do hope it will be fine.
"Well, not too fine."
"I know our English weather is pretty awful, but sometimes, we don't realise when we're lucky."
"All this sunshine day after day, well, it doesn't seem natural somehow."
- l want to get up.
That's the big threat.
Sharks the world over are being killed by the million.
They reckon 150 million sharks are killed every year - every year - just for shark fin soup.
Things like this are a by-product.
"Most of them just get caught and the fins get cut off, and they get thrown overboard, often alive, so most of the shark is wasted, and in these cases they just take the jaws, which they sell to tourists."
And there are so many of them.
'There are other endangered species nearby.
'In amongst the sea gypsy villages that flourish in these margins of sea and land trots one of the most endearing animals of all.
Ouch.
"Good - that's the first stage complete, up to the knees."
"The reason I'm wearing these today, which I didn't yesterday, is cos I've got really bad - it's quite red here - really bad sunburn from the snorkelling."
"Just from lying, you know..."
"Weird.Stephen, are you coming?"
"Yes, sorry, just chatting to the ladies and gentlemen."
Ah...
"Oh, dear..."
Hello.
It'll be dark soon.
"Oi, less of it."
Ouch.
"Oh, I see."
"Oh, dear, excuse me."
Ow!
"For goodness' sake, it's impossible."
"Yeah, exactly!"
Ow!
Have mercy on my poor flesh.
"Say if it starts to hurt.Oh, yeah, that's usually what I mean by ""ow""!"
"That was lovely, really good."
"We were lucky to see one, cos they're so well camouflaged, aren't they?"
"They really are, especially when they stretch themselves out - they become like a caterpillar."
They do.
(JIMMY PANTING)
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan,"
"I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in hisjugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to... (STUTTERS) The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
"Well, I have a confession to make."
"See, I've been surveilling Akan for years."
"So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so magnificently, well, all I saw was my shot at revenge."
"You proved me right with Dimitry, but then in the forest, well, I noticed an implant."
"A memory block, see?"
And I couldn't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else.
So I left it in.
"Not my finest hour, I'm afraid."
"But then, back at my lab while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me, lreahzed"
who you are to me.
Henry.
"It's bloody nice having a friend, Henry."
You'd think all those deaths would've prepared me for this.
"If you haven't already, you'll start to remember bits from your past now, Henry."
"And those memories, they're real."
They're you.
Trust them.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (GUNS FIRING)
(MEN SHOUTING)
Listen carefully.
Just being alive at least makes you a precious person.
The fox family saved the person who tried to kill herself.
"Tomorrow, they're gonna close the circus and start their new life."
Find out who the victim's boyfriend is?
Not yet.
What the hell is that idiot doing?
I told you not to touch my food!
"Well done, everyone."
"Finally, that day is coming tonight."
"As soon as the party starts, we go right into action."
"Since we have only 30 minutes, let's not waste any time and finish it off."
Our dreary days are over.
"Everyone, I'm so sad that we have to suddenly part now."
"You bastards, planning to go to a good place without me?"
Let's have a big farewell party instead.
"Granny, they're sending us to a better place."
A better place?
To heaven?
Are you crying?
You know I made a promise to your mom.
Whatever happens I will be responsible for all of you to be reincarnated as humans.
Your mom said that she would cheer us on from the heavens.
"Gosh, you're such a cry baby."
Having to kill them now after barely keeping them alive makes me feel a bit sad.
Let's kill them as gently as possible.
You're so despicably kind.
"Dad, stop pretending to be nice and stop crying."
# To be human
# There's nothing we can't do to them
# To be human
# We can stand anything
"I'll send his solicitors around to see you, shall I?"
"Here's the confession, the man in the confessional you wanted me to write it down."
"Right, thank you."
"Listening to James last night in the confessional,"
I know it wasn't his voice I heard.
So he didn't drop round to tell you what he was going to do.
"He's not as daft as we thought, is he?"
"Anyway Father, I'm off the case."
I'm under investigation for falsifying evidence.
One confession too many you might say.
"You don't have to uproot yourself, Sergeant, you'll be working in here."
"I've taken what I need, sir."
Then you can bring it back.
"It's an order, not a suggestion."
I'm sorry you've all been moved.
This is now Discipline and Complaints.
Off-limits to Denton CID.
Don't bother.
I've heard it all and I'm not impressed.
"If Inspector Frost's clean, then the quicker we get on, the sooner he'll be back."
And as far as the investigation into the murder of Jeanette Barr is concerned it may be relevant to what we're looking at.
So it's no longer a Denton job.
I'll be taking over.
Sergeant Toolan will be attached to D and C.
"Now hang on a minute, sir."
Order not suggestion.
Superintendent Bailey has cleared it with your chief.
There's no shortage of loose ends to tie up.
Starting with Sheridan.
Sort out whether he saw her ten days before her death at the Bedford Arms.
He still says he didn't.

- How about now?
"- No, still too dark."
- I can barely see you.
"- I know, I'm trying to keep it mysterious."
"Okay, so I can roll around in lingerie, but I don't get to see you jerk it?"
- All right.
"- Well, listen, first of all, baby, you're gonna ruin the whole romantic thing that's happening now, and, believe me, the last thing you wanna do is see me in all my shame."
"Do not be ashamed, okay?"
I am so proud of you.
What you are doing is proactive.
- Okay.
"- Checking to see if you can reproduce even when you have no intention of doing so anytime in the near future, that shows maturity."
"Yeah, listen, honey, I gotta tell you,"
I really appreciate the support.
It means a lot to me.
"Uh, but what would also mean a lot to me is if you take your perfectly round, beautiful ass and hike it in the air."
( chuckles ) Like this?
Just like that.
"Damn, don't move."
"Lou had reached that stage of super consciousness, where, for him, everything was alive, and everything was in the stage of transformation."
"And as I know that you were waiting for him to come back, he has not come back as yet."
"But he's there watching, blessing, and wishing."
So I just feel that... you have to...
"If you go into silence, you will hear him."
"Definitely, you'll hear his voice."
"I am very, very sure."
Doshi was right.
"For a moment, I felt the way I did as a kid, that maybe he just disappeared and that I'd see him again."
"If he was anywhere, he'd be here."
I just want to make my last remark in reverence to the work that has been done
by architects of the past.
"What was, has always been."
"What is, has always been, and what will be has always been."
Such is the nature of beginning.
"I'm making a documentary film about the building,"
- about the architect.
- About the building?
"We are the morning walkers who come all the time here and enjoy the walking, scenic beauty, and atmosphere."
And this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.
- We are proud of it.
- You're proud of it?
"Oh, yes."
The nationality made upon this.
Do you know anything about the architect?
- Architect?
- Mr. Lou Kahn.
I've heard...
I've heard about him.
He's a top-ranking architect.
"Well, actually, I'm here because I'm the architect's son."
He was my father.
He'll give us a hand.
"And hurry it up, please."
We don't want to catch colds.
Ain't nobody escapes bronchitis this time of year.
"Best to have it, and be done with it, I say."
"Not me, thank you."
Right.
"Ah, esteemed brother, I bring you diverse wonders-- powders to banish the worm, pills to unrumble the canine tummy."
"Just what the faithful messenger ordered, yes?"
Nope.
- Don't be a rotter.
This ghastly weather's about done me in.
"First, we do not drink during working hours."
You are!
"- Quite, but my working day is over, yours is not."
In the second place-- - wait a minute.
I'm still disputing your assumption of the first place.
I'm extremely annoyed with you for upsetting Mrs. hall.
- Me?
"Yes, you refused to mend that hole in the fence, didn't you?"
I thought that particular nasty might surface again.
Mrs. hall told you that I'd said you were to do it?
"And I told her what I tell you-- it's your fence, you mend it."
I see.
Rebellion.
"No, it's called making a stand, stiffening the backbone."
"In fact, I'm no longer prepared to accept your tyranny, at least, not all the time."
- T-tyranny?
"Consider, here I am, an adult human being, almost qualified, and what happens?"
"I run and fetch, I stand to, I hold the fort."
The original dogsbody.
"It won't do, siegfried, it's just not on."
He'll talk to us.
Right?
You will not go within 50 feet of Jackson Whittemore.
You will not speak to him.
You will not approach him.
You will not assault or harass him physically or psychologically.
What about school?
You can attend classes while attempting to maintain a 50-foot distance.
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"-Come on, it was just a joke."
-A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken that seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
-We filled the tank!
-Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Where Preservation Hall is.
"When you become a member of the Preservation Hall band, you come up through the ranks."
"Our clarinet player, Charlie Gabriel, he's 82."
"So what we were thinking for an intro was to do a variation of that riff,"
- but swing it a little more.
"- Okay, do the riff."
He's a fourth-generation musician.
And then you play around it.
His great-great-grandfather was a musician in New Orleans in the 1840s.
"Our trumpet player, fourth-generation."
"And our drummer, you know, fourth-generation."
"Yeah, I think we should just go round everyone up and just start playing, and then we'll hit ""record."""
"- All right, that sounds like a winner."
- Sounds fun?
"You can't create that, you know."
And we wouldn't exist if that didn't exist.
It's just wonderful how it gets passed along and passed along here.
What's it like to play in that room?
It's great.
"No microphones, no nothing."
"Only about, I think, a hundred people can fit in there at the most... and they're right on you."
So whenever I play my trombone solo
I got to stand all the way in back.
I might hit somebody.
That's how close they are.
"This is, like, the last place."
It really is.
"I mean, now the name of the joint's becoming literal, you know, because it's..."
"It's, like, the last place."
New Orleans has been my biggest inspiration in music in my adult life.
"I mean, I really got into Dr. John and Professor Longhair."
Not that I can play like 'Fess or Dr. John.
My son gives up everything for you.
As I for him.
You truly love him?
With all my heart.
He is never happier than when he is by your side.
Tell me I have been mistaken about you.
Tell me you are not the serpent I have thought you to be.
I am not.
I'm far worse.
I never cared what you thought of me.
"My lack of breeding, my absence of family or name of worth."
These things I cannot deny.
"But how low you considered your son, a man I love more than life itself,"
that could not be tolerated.
So I began poisoning your beloved honey wine.
"My intent not to rob you of life, only to mimic illness."
"A cough, increasing in its discomfort, easily blamed on Capua's dust and heat."
It brought much joy when you departed for the wet shores of Sicilia.
"And Quintus, how he flourished when removed from overbearing shadow."
"And then you returned to torture him, as you did all those years."
"So I began bringing you your honeyed wine again, to force you back to Sicilia."
Yet it was not enough.
"You were not moved, despite ailing health."
No.
"A more permanent solution was required between us, one that I added to Tullius' gift."
Quintus will not forgive Tullius this.
He will strike in your name and Gaia's death will be avenged.
"Breathe, breathe."
Breathe!
You curse this house.
"No, Father."
I elevate it.
So are deadbolts and a rottweiler.
Hopefully some of this blood's the unsub's and we can pull DNA.
Lyla Brewer's body was found in the hallway.
Her husband never made it out of bed.
He must have been killed first.
"Well, it makes sense."
Eliminate the primary threat before moving on to mother and child.
Mrs. Brewer spent some time stumbling around out here.
And in the child's bedroom and in the bathroom and in the study.
She covered a lot of ground before dying.
"There are, uh, fresh scratches on the floor here."
Too heavy for her to have moved.
What if the unsub did it to block the top of the stairs?
"Seal off the child's escape, maybe?"
Or prevent a blinded Mrs. Brewer from taking a fall?
Strange that he'd be concerned for her safety right before crushing her skull.
I don't get it.
"If the goal was the child and Jim Brewer's attack was quick and lethal, why did the unsub let Lyla stumble around for so long before finally killing her?"
"Good to see you again, Dr. Reid."
Nice to see you.
Again?
Yeah.
We had a case here 4 years ago.
The tornado guy.
That was one for the books.
So do we have a C.O.D. on the victims?
"Mr. Brewer's was massive blood loss from a severed trachea, most likely a thin-bladed serrated knife."
And Mrs. Brewer?
Her skull was fractured.
Some type of blunt-force trauma.
It's highly unusual for a killer to use different weapons on different victims.
"Speaking of unusual, take a look."
"How much do you pay a foreman, $200 a week?"
This is business.
These men manufacture a product that makes money.

"To people like you, education is a necessary evil."
"You can't see it, so it's worth nothing."
"Let me tell you this, the things we can't see are the most important things on this earth."
They're called ideas.
Thank you for the interview.
"If we offer you 5000, would you coach the basketball and football team?"
"No, I would not."

"Leslie, I'm afraid you're fighting a losing battle."
"Now, Mr. Rossi, frankly... ."
"In other words, the life history of the race repeats itself in the individual."
- A notice from the school board.
- Thank you.
"""Effective immediately the school board of Peyton Place is happy to announce the appointment of a new school principal:"
"Mr. Michael Rossi. """
Who?
"""We trust that you will show him the same loyalty and devotion you displayed to the late Mr. Firth. """
Class dismissed.
"I'm sorry, Ms. Thornton."
I don't know how they could do such a thing.
You deserve to be principal.
"Allison, a person doesn't always get what she deserves."
Remember it.
"If there's anything in life you want, go and get it."
Don't wait for anybody to give it to you.
"Now, I have some work to do."
"See you later, Al."
I feel very strongly... the Institute should stay open.
So that's how I would've voted.
"That's all very well, Miss Hillman."
But I'm afraid the vote is closed.
A president's casting vote should only be used when there is a genuine deadlock.
"If Miss Hillman hadn't been waylaid, then she would have been present to vote."
"Yes, but she was waylaid."
And the vote was taken.
And it was a tie.
"And, consequently, I had the deciding vote."
"If you don't allow her vote to count, I shall have little choice but to call a vote of no confidence in the president."
"This could have far-reaching consequences, Mrs Barden."
"The president is, after all, elected by the members, and I urge you to think very carefully -"
I demand a vote of no confidence in the president!
I have served this branch to the best of my ability for six long years...
"I'm sorry, but I absolutely demand it."
"...and I categorically refuse to be subjected to this indignity, and hereby... offer my immediate resignation."
They'll come back.
- I don't think they will.
"Well done, Frances."
"Well, one way or another you've handed Joyce exactly what she wanted."
What's up with your arm?
- Shh.
It's fine.
Steph.
Show me.
Agh!
"- Bloody hell, love."
It's nothing.
- That's a cow-kick.
- It's my own fault.
I was in a hurry to finish milking so I could get in and dry off.
Afraid I have a confession to make.
"See, I've been surveilling Akan for years."
"So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so magnificently, well, all I saw was my shot at revenge."
"You proved me right with Dimitry, but then in the forest, well, I noticed an implant."
"A memory block, see?"
And I couldn't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else.
So I left it in.
"Not my finest hour, I'm afraid."
But then back at my lab... while I was trying to analyze... what you could do for me...
"I realized who you are... to me, Henry."
"It's bloody nice having a friend, Henry."
You'd think all those deaths would've prepared me for this.
"If you haven't already, you'll start to remember bits from your past now, Henry."
"And those memories, they're real."
They're you.
Trust them.
"Memories, memories, memories."
My first batch of cyber soldiers.
"With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on."
"I love you, Charlie."
"I love you, Edward."
"I love you, Thomas."
You recognize these?
No?
That's odd.
They're your wife's.
"Mm, I smell what you like about her."
This one is almost ready for you.
"But I'm warning you, their boosters make the one you have..."
You look like a fucking 9 volt.
Go ahead and fuck him up.
Get up.
See that rock directly ahead of you?
Does that look placed or is that just part of the bedrock?
This looks like bedrock for sure.
This isn't laid rock;
"It's been, you know, chiseled away."
It sure looks like it's been chopped away.
"It was kind of an ""aha"" moment, you know?"
Here-here's an opening in the ground.
Is this the back door?
That's pretty solid there.
It doesn't sound like rock though.
"No, it sounds sandy or something."
That almost sounded hollow.
Almost sounds like wood.
Holy smokes.
A hollow wooden surface?
In a square hole cut through bedrock?
"Could Jack be standing on a secret doorway, perhaps one that leads directly to the Money Pit?"
Does it seem to be solidifying at all?
Are you hitting a bottom or is it just bottomless there?
"I'm standing on something solid, but I-I honestly can't tell until we dig up the rest."
"It's just mud in this top part, and could be anything."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- Keep going, Jack."
"As you look around the sides, does it appear that they're nice and solid anywhere?"
"Well, besides breaking off."
Besides knocking the rock out.
"But no, no large holes or anything that you can see?"
"Yeah, that's solid."
"Yeah, pretty much."
The middle part kind of seems to go further.
It's too muddy to be able to tell if this is the bottom.
and now is the moment to make it.

"Apparently, the Dutch are attacking Utrecht."
I want to send someone I trust.
"It will be an honor, Sire."
Heavens above!
The forest warden tells me he returns here every day to pay his respects at Madamoiselle Masson's grave.
She was murdered shortly after leaving His Majesty's service.
I will speak with him alone.
Why did you bury her here?
"She used to walk here, as a child, studying the plants and flowers."
I'm sorry for her death.
I wish I could have done something.
You could have.
Who killed her?
She was investigating the poisons being used at the palace.
She must have discovered something she was not meant to.
I need you.
I wish you to return to my service.
This is not an order.
"Tell me honestly, what do you want?"
"Shiny bumpers, £2,500 to spend on beer and a holiday?"
I'll take the money!
That's insane!
That's pretty much the only visual difference.

You might think that's odd because if you peel away the bodies they're basically the same car.
They're made in the same factory.
I can explain what's going on.
I've got two Armani jackets.
"Open it up, you see?"
Says Armani in there.
"Now in this one, I've changed the label so it says Millets."
Which one are you gonna buy?
Hm?
Exactly.
Armani.
Vauxhall have realised it's no good making their car the same as the Lotus.
"It has to be much, much better."
"This, then, is the new VX."
You'll note the new spoiler on the back and its smart new wheels.
"Inside, you'll take in the leather seats and if you snout around, you'll clock the extra soundproofing to make it even more refined."
"You'll notice these things and think, ""That is a really, really pretty car. """
"Well done, Vauxhall."
I'll have the Lotus.
"I mean, it's not like the Vauxhall is any easier to get into."
"If you're taller than six inches or have any extraneous body parts, realistically, you need to take the roof off before you can get behind the wheel."
No problems there.
"It has the same simple roof as the Elise, same basic chassis and with a price of £25,000 it costs about the same, too."
Maybe some Contra went nuts.
"Today was a shitty day, with my shitty kids and my shitty husband."
I love them.
"I do, but damn, they get on my nerves."
I wanted to --
Everyone knows what I want to do -- what I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But... then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess to have this place."
And that's all.
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested --"
"Alexandria, Virginia, the week of January 23rd."
There's a list of every person at the meeting and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
"I included the local police reports from that area, as well, as the DOD meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder."
"There was a ton of extra police around, so maybe someone saw something useful to you."
You mean that... couple and their -- and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
"I thought it was a Charles Manson thing, but I think they've ruled that out."
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
"I thought we were through the hard times, you know?"
Mm-hmm.
"I'd been sick for about three months, uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and... this is gonna sound weird."
Please.
My life?
No judgment.
You will leave this house when you agree to return to New York to become the extraordinary pianist you're meant to be.
"Mom, I'm not seven years old anymore."
You think I don't get that this is a great opportunity for me?
Then why would you throw it away?
Because it's not right for me now.
It's not what I want.
You don't know what you want.
"Dude... the crispity, crunchity goodness in that bowl is long gone."
I'm not really hungry.
My essay sucks.
Speaking of sucks-
What?
I meant Shakespeare.
Extra credit.
Impressive.
Impressive would be figuring out what language this was written in.
"I thought Kyle might be able to translate, but..."
"Well, what part are you at?"
"The part that says it's about two families and it's set in ""fair Verona. """
That's the first two lines.
"She lives exactly 38 feet 9 inches away, and I can't even tell her I'm sorry."
You could if she wasn't locked in her own house.
Who else but Mrs. Bloom actually changes the alarm code to keep someone in?
I just hope Amanda doesn't feel as bad as I do.
Looks like we have our own resident pair of star-crossed lovers.
The balcony scene's her favorite part of the play.
"Of course, it didn't end well for them."
So Romeo and Juliet did everything in their power to be together.
You guys know how this ends?
Why didn't you say so?
This all began when Amanda said we needed to talk.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
You think what Avatar wan did was good?
Driving almost all the spirits from this world?
"The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos."
"You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge."
We should live together as one.
"Even if Vaatu escapes,"
"I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did."
"It's true that, when Wan fused with Raava, he tipped the scales in her favor."
"But this time, I'll be here to level the playing field."
"When harmonic convergence comes,"
I will fuse with Vaatu.
"And together, we will become the new Avatar."
A dark Avatar.
Your era is over.
Think about what you're doing.
"I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man."
You're still my brother.
You're Eska and Desna's father.
Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?
I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter.
"The only difference is that, while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power,"
I will be in complete alignment with mine.
Vaatu and I will be as one.
No one will be able to stand against us.
Keep them locked up.
"After the harmonic convergence,"
I will come for Korra.
"Yes, father."
I failed in every way.
We've lost Jinora forever.
There's still a chance.
They didn't get Bumi.
As you can see I don't know how we might help you.
"We investigate serious crimes, but your case does not seem to be in our department."
What do you mean?
I mean that your story resembles a case history to me.
I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Isn't it too short?
Igor Alexandrovich?
I knew we would meet again!
It's a miracle!
God heard my prayers!
Here is a release certificate with signatures and stamps.
I'm a victim of arbitrariness!
That head doctor quarrelled with somebody.
Criminal proceedings were instigated against him and he got fired.
"Not only was I released,"
I was restored to my work place.
They'll even pay me my wages for the entire period of my absence.
I got so lucky!
So we were in the prison of the neighbouring region!
Let's go to the prosecutor!
I'll prove them that I'm not crazy!
What are you doing?
You won't prove anything to them.
You'll only create more problems for yourself and for me.
The man who ordered you locked up is very influential.
Illegal detention means nothing to them.
Do you exist in reality or not?
Don't surrender!
Don't surrender!
Despair and fear are the illness itself.
It's the madness!
"Would you know, sir, whether or not she was seeing somebody?"
"I don't mean to get personal, but somebody whom she might be emotionally involved with?"
"Claire was devoted to her work, Lieutenant."
She wasrt any more interested in lovers than she was in her husband.
It made for a pretty miserable marriage.
"Well, still, you must've gotten along pretty good."
"I mean, you were partners in business."
Partners?
"That was on paper, Lieutenant."
Claire fought me on everything.
She had to have things done her way.
"If I said white, she'd say black."
All you have to do is take a look at this new Ward Fowler contract.
Paying an actor that kind of money is insanity.
"Now, wait a minute."
Let me get this straight.
Are you saying that you didn't wanna pay him that money?
I think they should have turned him down.
I think he would have folded.
But Claire argued me right under the table.
I was an idiot for giving in.
"Now, if this show takes a dip they'll drop it."
I still don't understand.
You and your wife were partners.
"Now, isn't it to her best interest not to give him all that money?"
"In anything involving Ward, she always took his side."
"Forgive me for asking this, sir."
I seem to remember stories that at one time they were pretty close.
Are you suggesting that their relationship was still pretty close?
Yeah.
"But not the way you mean it, Lieutenant."
"Oh, sure, they'd had a big romance, but by the time I came into the picture, it was dead."
Lionel deserves better.
At least we know how Lionel truly felt about you.
He thought of you as his second son.
Another person who treated me like a son and died because of it.
Jor-El died getting me on that ship.
My dad died of a heart attack from the powers he took on protecting me.
And now Lionel's been murdered for protecting my secret.
They did die for you.
"But ultimately, they died for all of us."
There was a reason those men were in your life.
Each of them added something to the man that you are today.
How can Lex have done it?
How does a son... murder his own father?
Total absence of love.
Some say that's the definition of evil.
"You have to get those keys away from Lex, before he kills anyone else."
He's not gonna have the chance.
I won't let him.
when king arthur regretted pulling the sword from the stone.
But he never gave up his quest.
So why did you?
Or have you already found the traveler that you and the less fortunate members of veritas were looking for?
The traveler.
Why doesn't it surprise me that you've fallen for patricia swann's vid imagings?
I didn't imagine the deaths of virgil swann or oliver queen's parents.
You think I can control the fate of individuals?
"Oh, god."
You give me too much credit.
You certainly controlled mine.
"It wasn't an accident we were in smallville the day of the meteor shower, was it?"
The factory was just a cover.
Not if he was poisoned.
We found this stuff in Dawkins' cell.
Nutmeg.
"Oh, yeah, they got the prison bake sale coming up."
Hang on a second.
You can extract myristicin from nutmeg.
"It's an organic compound, has psychoactive properties, it works like a drug, and in large enough doses, it's lethal and fast-acting."
"So Dawkins poisons an inmate as a distraction, shoots a few guards, then walks out the door wearing one of their uniforms."
"Yeah, in broad daylight?"
"I mean, it feels like a lot of unnecessary exposure for someone trying to sneak out the door."
Price of freedom?
Or maybe he didn't think he had time to dig a tunnel.
What else we got?
One of the maintenance guys reported his car stolen from the parking lot.
We got HPD a description.
"Well, let's assume Dawkins knows that, too, so he's going to abandon that car."
We'll find it.
Maybe it'll tell us where he's going.
"Hey, watch this."
Keep your eyes on the guard.
Look at his holster.
Safety strap's unfastened.
Wait a minute.
"What the hell's he doing with a gun, anyway?"
"Weapons are for towers, gates, and transports only."
Maybe it was a rookie mistake.
"No, not a rookie mistake."
"He's in on it, he wanted Dawkins to have that gun."
So what's in it for the guard?
"Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets."
Hey!
"Billy Omana, right?"
"- Not ""La Fleur"" anymore."
Juliette.
- Excuse me.
"if you'd told me this was a certified virgin, chaste and pure I would've said..."

"But in this case, knowing her as I do, I can happily say... ""Marry her, my boy!"
Discouraged by their expensive life... their work devalued by The Pill... defecting streetwalkers... are the last refuge of virtue and fidelity.
These women aspire only to a single social position... having exhausted all the others.
You'll never be a deceived husband.
I'm liking being married already.
I've no illusions about myself.
How many children do you want?
"I'll have to ask Juliette... if she has something planned, but I don't think so."
If our girl takes after mummy... and our boy after daddy... we'll have a steel-drum parade... and the house will be too small.
"There is only one true house, Goubi..."
Welfare!
I have 2 boys.
When they were babies I put them on welfare.
The best college in France.
"Our Oxford, our Harvard."
"After 18 years on welfare, they're ready for life's challenges."
"Now they're total welfare-abusers, like their father!"
What a shame your bride-to-be had not been raised by me!
She'd regret it.
But think about it...
It's not only her...

Don't worry...
They'll be paying for us.

Gallstones.
"It is inserted until it reaches the bladder, and then upon reaching the bladder it is flipped over..."
"To lie against the base of the bladder, and we then take a suitable knife and cut you."
The best practitioners could have a stone out in a minute.
You have to operate quickly.
Because of the pain?
That's right.
I have some gallstones.
Have you indeed?
"Yeah, I mean, if you want to..."
Would any of you be bled?
"Bad blood was believed to be the root of all ills, so bloodletting became a common remedy."
The leeches will attend to any bruises.
Leeches were applied for everything... fever or a hangover or even to freshen the body for spring.
Now we'll see whether he wants to play.
"Oh, something's happening."
Do you feel a bite?
"Mmm, it's sort of a tickling bite."
Feeling it a bit?
Fluffy.
"Oh, that's it, yeah, he's engaged."
Has he bitten?
"Yeah, no, I feel that, definitely."
Is he heading for the kill?
Can someone hold this?
It does make you more attractive.
"Definitely makes you... a man with a leech on his arm is, you know, irresistible."
"I thought it would be nice if, um, we could all see each other properly."
"God, I can see you all for the first time."
"You're all rather beautiful, aren't you?"
Gas.
Joining the party is Regency House physician Dr. Kevin Ilsley.
Is that why you came down here?
"No, I came to see what you were doing."
You mean you came to gloat.
"Oh, come on, Gibbs, don't make me do it for you."
"You thought Wickes was innocent the minute you left that first interview, and based on the lack of evidence we have against him and the indicators in the room with Jarvis, you were right."
We need to focus on Baylor.
"No, no, you need to say it."
We all thought he might be clean; none of us knew for sure.
I knew for sure.
That's why you need to say it.
Say what?
"That I was wrong, Gibbs, and I'm never wrong."
"And today of all days, I was wrong."
"Today, Doc, is as good a day as any."
(chuckles)
"No, it's not."
I keep telling myself
"Wickes looked at this picture for a reason, but he didn't."
Not once have I thought this man anything but guilty.
(scoffs) What kind of person does that make me?
Human.
ELLIOTT:
"Hey, Doc, your black belt in badgering people pays off once again."
Ridgeway's AUTEC report sans redactions.
You find anything?
"In the late '70s,"
Ridgeway was paid to keep quiet about a classified technology he inadvertently saw while at AUTEC.
The report says the government paid dozens of people off.
Cash makes people forget.
"Yeah, well, for 500K, I'd keep quiet, too, even if I did see little green men on a destroyer."
"Anyway, Ridgeway knew the money came from a pool of government funds used for AUTEC payoffs."
It's a off-books account that hasn't been touched in decades.
Here I thought he was supposed to be kissing my ass.

"Right, okay, fine, if you don't believe in believing, then it's your loss."
Hm.
"No explanation, no closure, just an abrupt halt and recall."
All I have to do is understand it myself.
"""You were just doing your job."""
"""Kim Seo Ahn was simply fulfilling her duties as a diligent agent."""
Do you really think I did what I did because I was ordered to?
Lots of people were looking for that memoir.
That memoir... had to leave yours hands in order for you to be safe.
I couldn't just sit back.
"Nonetheless, you tricked me, Seo Ahn."
And I...
"I trusted you, more than anyone."
You and I... have always lied in order to do the right things.
"All of the missions we worked on together, until three years ago..."
Weren't they all like that?
But we never tricked the ones closest to us.
Coming to find you here...
And talking about things like this...
It's all against the rules.
But I really wanted to talk to you.
If you...
will be understanding of everything...
"Even if it's not right away, but if you will understand eventually..."
Then I will continue to stay by your side.
Seo Ahn.
I don't know...
Whether these are real tears... or if they are part of a mission.
What do I have to do to get your trust back?
Should I quit my job?
Or should I find the information that you need from them?
Seo Ahn.
"Didn't you think, at least once, that you were being used by Chief Jung?"
In order to hide what he has been creating...
I must go to the Mujinju base.
- Get ready.
"- Yes, sir."
You think the governor has time for the likes of you?
Get out of here right now!
Do you know who this is?
That's none of my business.
You can't set foot inside the base.
Leave at once!
What's the ruckus?
These men insist on meeting you.
What do you want?
"I am Kim Yang, the new governor of Mujinju."
New governor?
I haven't received any word from the imperial city.
The new governor has arrived?
"Yes, he has already inspected the troops, and is now taking over all official business."
Who is the new governor?
His name is Kim Yang.
Kim Yang...
Find out every detail about him.
"Yes, madam."
How could you have managed the finances so poorly?
The governor has been serving without pay.
You can't cover your incompetence with integrity.
"He has stepped down from his post, but he is still the former governor."
- Please show your respect.
- Stay out of this.
It is not easy to govern Mujinju.
We've been suffering from famine year after year.

Anything that proves stein attacked her.
"It'll help at trial, and i don't want to rely"
On the cops to get photos of them.
Our whole case is gonna be her testimony.
"Whatever we can do to bolster it,the better."
We start putting her story together now.
"Thanks,ron."
I didn't think you'd spend money on a pro bono case.
"It isn't going to be pro bono by the time we're done,believe me."
"If she dated stein, you'd better believe"
She dated other guys like stein--

Allen Toussaint.
"He's like, the guru, man."
It's been a long time since I didn't know who Allen Toussaint was.
He's written every famous song that is known for being New Orleans.
"Everybody that I grew up listening to,"
"Allen had something to do with it, you know?"
"I mean, everything from all of Irma Thomas' stuff, all of my brother Aaron's stuff."
Lee Dorsey.
He wasn't just the cat writing the songs.
He actually was the cat in the studio that was making that stuff sound like that.
"Please stop it, now."
That's what I wanted to know how to do...
Write the songs and then make people love 'em and go buy 'em.
And he was a master at it.
"Okay, ladies."
I don't think you ought to make that in the middle of that.
I think you should wait till the verse comes up.
"There's certain things you could tell that's an ""Allen thing."""
One of my favorite songs is a song called
"""Street Parade"" by Earl King, with the Meters playing, Earl King is singing."
Allen wrote the horn parts.
I don't think they repeat themselves the whole time.
These horn parts never repeat.
"Why would you do that, you know?"
It's the only song like that I've ever heard.
I remember one time writing a song.

I'm afraid I can't quite concur with you.
I agree with Doc Swain.
You would.
Ms. Thornton's practically senile.

"No, he ripped off donated bodies from his employer and then sold them."
"And when he couldn't fill his orders, he bought a few stiffs from the city morgue."
"Yeah, where was he keeping them?"
St. Mark's would've noticed the extra inventory.
So he can't be storing his bodies there.
Just got Bianco's financials.
He makes a hefty payment every month to Randy's wine locker.
Maybe he's an oenophile.
"I don't know what that is, but I can tell you he doesn't spend anything on wine."
Those storage places are climate-controlled.

"Here you are, dear."
It's been a while since all four of us sat down to eat dinner together.
"You know, the next time there's something to celebrate, I have a plan."
"I'll get myself some good medicine and I was thinking about getting Takao a charcoal grill for trips to the mountains, and Shinako a steel handrail."
What about me?
"Oh, yes."
Looks like I forgot about someone.
How about a mirror to go with Shinako's handrail?
"But maybe you need a handrail, too."
You probably don't need a mirror.
must have one.
Why do you say such things in front of the children?
"You say they're children, but it's been twenty years since Shinako was born."
We four have known each other for a long time.
I'd like to think that we'd all take care of each other.
"If you'd just take care of Mother, everyone would be taking care of each other."
"I thought you'd say that, Shinako, but there are some things you don't understand."
You probably think that Mother has sacrificed for me.
But it's not like that.
A couple who has been married for a long time usually doesn't make little sacrifices for each other here and there throughout their marriage.
Usually they both collapse.
Isn't there anything left after she collapses?
I thought this would brighten up your new place.
Read the inscription.
"""Dear Mako, Nuktuk says, 'keep smiling.'"""
did you come by just to give me a poster?
"No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement."
"I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you."
"We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal."
I am not a criminal!
"Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one, 'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live."
I was set up!
Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war.
That's why he had me arrested.
"Ah, I see what you're doing."
You're going for the insanity defense.
Smart.
No!
I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems.
Where's Asami?
She'll listen to me.
"I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her."
You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad.
"Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow."
And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy.
"Bolin, wait."
"If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere."
Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.
"Yeah, okay, big brother."
I promise.
Whew!
That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.
Should we wait another day?
Korra still might come with reinforcements.
"Then it was a punishment for him, if he did something wrong, he had to sit next to a girl."
Marcel's not the same age now.
"He was born in fifty-two, so he's quite old now."
But is he old enough to go out with a girl and show her the sights?
"Then tell me, what can he show her?"
"This hand shouldn't be like this, put it here, but..."
"You have your little finger here, like this and now..."
- Like this?
- More or less.
But stretch your hand a bit.
"Wait, we'll call Marcel."
"Marcel, come here!"
"Good evening, Marcel."
Have you got your trousers on...
"Glad to meet you, I'm Katka's mother."
I'm glad she's found a good friend.
"Then tell me what you've read, how you're going to tell him?"
I'm reading interesting things...
But how are you going to tell him?
How?
Look!
How did you find out?
"There are such lovely things here, that make sex beautiful and noble, but it can be a disaster for anyone who starts too early."
Isn't that beautiful?
Or this:
The standard of sexual...
Listen when I'm reading!
The standard of sexual life partly depends on that of cultural life.
A higher standard creates conditions for a higher form of sexual life.
"All right, but tell me... I'll tell him now and explain."
"Dr. Strn¨¢d wrote it nicely, but I'd like some advice from him that..."
"How to say it, do you think it would be useful... lt'd be simplest to tell him to buy a book like this and study it!"
Nadine Krawchuck.
I like the sound of that.
"But I gotta tell you,"
I got a bunch of cats.
Don't touch anything.
Police stations are a breeding ground for disease.
It's this kind of attitude that keeps us off The Amazing Race.
Abby!
Ow!
"Hi, Officer Ravitz, I'm Abby."
"And that adorable man handcuffed over there-- uh, not the bald guy or the lady dude-- is my kind of, sort of brother-in-law, so I'm here to bust him out."
"Oh, legally."
"So I would like to post his bail, preferably using a combination of credit cards and gift certificates."
Bail won't be set for at least another four to six hours.
"You're being a tad unreasonable, Officer Ravitz."
"And you do not want to be known as ""Unreasonable Ravitz."""
I have known the pain of a hurtful nickname.
"Don't worry, buddy, we'll keep you out of jail."
"But if we don't, the first thing you do when you get in there is kick someone's ass."
That's how I survived space camp.
"Look, lady,"
"I hear a million sob stories a day, and most of them aren't in English, so I don't know what the hell they're talking about."
And none of that really matters because I don't like him.
And I'm beginning to not like you.
"This is a power trip, huh?"
They give you a badge and a gun and you get to play God?
"Well, my sister is counting on me to get her baby daddy to the hospital."
"Now you're holding on to something of mine, so I'm gonna hold on to something of yours."
"Ma'am, give that back."
Why?
"Why, what are you gonna do about it?"
"""Abby's been arrested""?"
"But I love the idea of, like, authors having feuds."
"That, like, she's driving by Joanna Trollope's house in her Beamer, going ""What's up, Joanna Trollope?"
"""Bitches writing witches!"""
Why is she wasting her time arguing with people on Twitter when she's a billionaire?
"If I was a billionaire,"
I'd go in Argos and buy one of everything.
"I mean, that, that's literally everything we need to know about you in one sentence."
"Rich, have you read these books, the Harry Potters?"
I haven't.
"You know what, I do, I think, you know, she's made it OK for a whole generation of children to read again, which I genuinely think is a real shame."
"Because when I was growing up, you were allowed to just watch television."
Kids these days have to read.
"My daughter read all the Harry Potter books,"
I had to read some of them.
They...
It's fine.
"But I say to my son, ""Why don't you read this thing?"
"""It's good, it's got wizards, and there's like lots of deaths."""
"And he honestly goes, ""You know there are video games, right?"
"""Why on earth would you be reading a book when there's a video game?"""
Quite a positive message there for the future of Britain.
I quite like it.
You can't help the truth!
"Computer games are better than books, and so are films."
"Because you don't have to do the thinking, it's there."
You know what I mean?
"And you know what,"
I think Steven Spielberg's got a better idea of what I want to watch than what I do.
I've got a pretty good idea of what you want to watch.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Are you flirting with me?
"Well, that's the whole point, isn't it?"
"I am, sir."
"Mr. Webster, I'm asking you to lay off... as a personal favor."
"It's one thing to break ranks and vote against my candidate... but to actively attack her from the bench, that's another."
"Mr. President, I just don't believe in Laine Hanson... especially when we have at our disposal Governor Hathaway."
He's a party loyalist and genuine hero.
And I cannot and shall not vote for a candidate simply because she's a woman.
"I am nothing if I do not follow my heart, sir."
I envy you.
I do.
You know why?
"Because someday, years from now, you're gonna come in here with your family... and you're gonna look up at my painting... and you'll be able to say to them, your kids and grandkids..."
"""Way back then I defied my president."
"It cost me my reelection, kept me out of politics forever."
"I was on the track to maybe one day end up here... destined to make the kind of changes in this country... that only great men, given the right time and place, can make... and I have none of that now, but that's okay... because I did what was in my heart."""
"The heart, it can never be wrong, can it, Mr. Webster?"
Mmm.
Delicious.
You got a little...
Hi.
I'm Jack Hathaway.
How are you?
"Hi, sir."
Um...
Ow.
I'm Special Agent Willomina.
Sure is good of you to meet me.
It's a pleasure.
How can I help you?
"I know you're busy, so this will be as routine as it gets."
- Did my girl offer you coffee or something to drink?
"- Oh, yes, she did."
"But even if I did, then I couldn't -- um, I mean, I wouldn't want to -- The stairs."
What about the stairs?
They're right behind you.
Ooh!
"Without the Time Lord knowledge, our Doctor is very insecure and Joan Redfern kind of coaxes it out of him."
"And you can see that, for the first time, the Doctor is falling in love as a human being and he falls in love with her."
"But when the Doctor became the Doctor again,"
"Joan was like ""I don't want any of that"""
because it wasn't the same person.
I can't.
Please come with me.
I can't.
Why not?
"John Smith is dead, and you look like him."
"But he's here, inside, if you look in my eyes."
"Answer me this -- just one question, that's all -- if the Doctor had never visited us, if he'd never chosen this place, on a whim... would anyone here have died?"
Why can't she come with him?
"Well, because she doesn't want to marry an alien being, she wants this nice teacher guy."
All right.
"Yeah, he can't have everything."
"Sorry, Mr. Magic."
She decides not to go with him because she liked the man who he was before.
She says no.
"She's like ""because you're not"
"""the guy I fell in love with."
"""You are someone who selfishly landed here"
"""and got people killed and that is not the man I fell in love with."""
"So, once again, we have a woman refusing the Doctor, which is very rare."
"""The Doctor's Daughter"" is Jenny and she pops up almost literally out of nowhere."
"The Doctor shows up on this planet and they take a tissue sample and, suddenly, there she is, full-grown."
- What's going on?
- Leave him alone!
Something which does these things for him.
"Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair?"
Except for one small detail-- that dress hardly matches this charming scene.
"Ah, yes, that's more what we want-- the dashing warrior and his elegant lady."
"That mirror... it's part of his audience, his ego."
He never wanders from it.
Is it ego... or something else?
Explain.
The mirror.
What?
You noted he never gets far from it.
I suppose it could be vanity.
"No, no, Mr. Spock, that's not the reason."
What kind ofa machine could do these things?
A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves.
It would have a very complex memory bank.
It would be extremely sophisticated.
"Like a computer, only much more."
Could the machine that maintains the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house?
I think not.
A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense.
Good.
I agree.
That leaves me free.
"Free, Captain?"
"If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Spock,"
I think I can turn his lights off at the source.
"Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen."
"After all, his actions are those ofan immature, unbalanced mind."
"I overheard that remark, Captain."
I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with you.
You only heard part of it.
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
- Which was?
- Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
I hate that it had to turn out this way.
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
- England?
- Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
- How long?
- Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
I found the philosophy too dry.
I wanted to get on with life instead of talking about what it means all the time.
So what can you tell me about Paul Fordyce?
"Ah, I didn't know him well."
He was something of a recluse.
He was arrogant.
He saw himself as a proper nihilist.
He was into Nietzsche.
"""That which does not kill us makes us strong"" etc."
I had an argument with him about it once in the pub.
He talked about tying to live by those ideals.
He disliked people - he regarded them as his inferiors.
He saw himself as a great man.
Superior to the rim-ram.
"Oh, the bungled and the botched as Nietzsche would say!"
"Well, that explains his arrogance."
Is he seriously under suspicion for three murders though?
"Really, I can't discuss it."
Take a seat.
Can I get you anything?
I'm fine.
"I've, um, I've completed some microscopic tests on Dawn."
And...they show a very early pregnancy.
Maybe just a few days.
But... the results are irrefutable.
It does give us an explanation of what happened.
I think that she fainted.
So combination of the effects of
IVF hormones and the pregnancy itself and alcohol would be enough.
And when she fell... she struck her head and remained unconscious long enough to drown.
It makes me very angry that such a thing can happen.
But...
Never.
"Ah, well..."
"You're not upset, are you?"
No.
"Being called a ride's... a bit of a compliment, really, isn't it?"
"Jesus, I don't know about that."
"Anyway, he shouldn't be saying things like that."
"Sure, men are always saying things like that about girls."
But not about daughters.
"Don't be thick, Da."
All girls are daughters.
"Well, not my fucking daughters, then."
That's hypocritical.
I don't give a shite what it is.
He has daughters of his own.
"That young one, your friend."
Do you expect us to drink without eating something?
"If you don't immediately bring me mutton, you will get eaten!"
"There's a little imp in you, sometimes you can't live without pranks."
Could it be that it amuses you to play the sorcerer for the little boy?
"My dear Doctor, we all play some type of part:"
"I, a sorcerer, you, a scholar who holds nothing dear."
"Every man, if we are to believe Moses, is only a part played by God."
"I would like to know what you know, apart from a few such portrayals?"
Move aside!
I'm so bored with your grimacing face!
"Man is created in the image of the Creator himself, and therefore he has characteristics incomprehensible both to angels and to demons."
Wine!
"Ah, scoundrel!"
No mutton for us again?
A good glass of wine demands also something good to eat.
Wait!
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents."
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We...
Can't!
There was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid... at all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
It's everything Lydia could translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
"Yeah, what'd you tell her?"
That we were part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
I am part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
O-oh.
Great.
"Okay, does it say how to find out who's controlling him?"
Not really.
But Stiles was right about the murderers.
Yes!
It calls the Kanima a weapon of vengeance.
"There's a story in there about this South American priest who uses the Kanima to execute murderers in his village... all right, see?"
So maybe it's not all that bad.
Until the bond grew strong enough that it killed whoever he wanted it to.
"All bad, all very, very bad."
"Here's the thing, though."
The Kanima's actually supposed to be a werewolf.
"But it can't be... ""Until it resolves that in its past which manifested it."""
We've already decided to head back to BuYeo.
You'd better pack your stuff fast.
"It's a pity I know, but there's no other way."
"I'll abide by Miss's orders, but before I get my belongings, could you hear me out first?"
Please speak.
"Though I haven't been here for long,"
I realize that sometimes sacrifices have to be made if we want profit.
"If we give up, expecting to lose,"
Then we won't have a chance of winning.
"If we give up this opportunity,"
"Next time and following that,"
Paving a trade route to Go-San will become a lost cause.
It's not as if we don't know!
Please give me two days.
I'll get rid of every threat between us and Go-San.
Threat?
Are you going to take on the bandits?
"As for the details,"
I've not made up my mind yet.
"Taking a detour around the bandits, is another possibility."
"One thing's for sure,"
I won't drag the fleet into this.
Two days then.
"If you can't find a solution by then, then we'll withdraw."
How are we going to come up with something in two days?
Didn't you see it for yourself?
"They may be bandits, but they're no different from Imperial Guards."
"It's already hard enough to get close, how are we going to kill the leader?"
I must go alone to the bandit's hideout.
What?
What?
Spare me!
About being attacked to avoid getting convicted.
I think ann may have lied about a lot of things.
Alden's at her dorm room to see what she's hiding.
You're on student loans.
Your clothes are knockoffs.
"But you have a $15,000 birkin bag in your dorm closet."
How does a nice girl manage that?
"Look,i know it seems like i'm prying,because i am."
"So if you have another source of income, i don't."
"Or if you're hiding something else,just tell me."
We just have to know before we put you on the stand.
We can't win your case unless we know who you are.
"In a self-Defense case, if we can show that stein"
"Was violent in the past, we can argue that"
"He was violent this time,"
And that's why ann had to defend herself.
That'll be easy.
"Everyone in hollywood knew stein beat up women,"
Especially young women.
We've been looking for women
To testify that stein was violent with them.
"The problem is, we can't find any."
Can't find any?
Nobody in hollywood will go near this case.
Stein was powerful.
It looks like he paid women off not to file complaints.
"Now we will keep looking, but so far,nothing."
Ann dated al stirling.
The pornography guy?
"Publisher,tom, not pornographer."
"Well,the guy's scum."
We refused to defend him a couple of times.
"Oh, I'm fine."
That's good because I brought a friend over.
"What's good, nigga?"
!
You thought you got rid of me?
!
♪ Still here.
And you's still a bitch ♪
I love this guy... so entertaining!
But he's supposed to be in jail!
"I know, yes."
"I took it upon myself to bail him out, as well as bribe the district attorney to drop the case."
"You really should stop snitching, Robert."
What happened to this country when two grown men can't settle their differences in a bloody street fight?
I thought maybe we could come in and have a chat.
"No, absolutely not!"
That monster is not stepping one foot in my house!
"Well, technically speaking, it's my house, remember?"
"The one that's underwater, the one you and your children live in out of the little warmth in my cold, hard heart!"
What the fuck kind of lemonade is this bullshit?
"So, as you know, we're still not where we need to be with this house."
"You owe me a lot of money, and I started thinking this hilarious thing you guys do together could be the answer!"
"This man is a psychopathic stalker, and we don't do anything funny together!"
"The people feel differently, Robert... 40 million views."
The fights are a hit!
It would be good business to do one more.
"No, absolutely not!"
Out of the question!
Just one more.
Everything will be legal.
"If one of you accidently gets killed, no problem."
"We can do pay per view, a little mini doc to go with it, maybe even go to different cities."
But it doesn't.
Jai's murderer is still out there.
And the investigation will continue without you.
"Arthur, at some point, you're going to leave the Agency, and you're going to have to leave something unfinished."
- Not this.
- Why?
"I mean, why now?"
"Why agree to be vetted, get this far down the line, and then change your mind?"
I can't leave yet.
Gottfried was right.
"To a military man, desertion is the single worst accusation you can make."
Since when do you care about what some senator thinks?
What's going on here?
We better hit the road if we're gonna miss the construction traffic on 66.
And Serrano didn't physically threaten Simon?
It wasn't self-defense?
Not at all.
So he killed his handler.
"That is the most transgressive thing a spy can do, and he did it to protect you."
"That explains why he took you on a mission, ignored the red flags."
He's in love with you.
"The question is, what do I do about it?"
You're already doing it.
You're forcing Simon to act irrationally.
Now we can manipulate him.
- Manipulate him to do what?
- Whatever we want...
Whatever we need.
What else did you think we were doing here--playing house?
This is what we set out to do.
This is why we inserted you with Simon in the first place-- to build his trust.
And there is no greater form of trust than love.
"I need to make time for Paige and Cooper, and Joe."
"Then, why do you seem more stressed out now than ever?"
"I mean, at least before, you weren't in it alone."
"Noah,"
"Tell me something, how can you feel so guilty... when nothing happened between us?"
Because being in sync with a man who is not your husband is almost as painful as not being in sync with your husband.
Don't you ever miss looking forward to something?
"You know, picking out your shoes, your shirt for somebody...everyday."
Don't you miss that?
"Sarah, is your hand bleeding?"
Oh God!
Oh!
I suck!
- What?
- Hawaii...my daughter is Hawaii.
"Noah, I'll call, OK?"
He needs to go into a treatment program again.
"I agree, even if it's outpatient."
"You know, a partner of mine just came back from Hazleton, Minnesota."
I'm not sending my son to Minnesota.
Very cold there this time of year.
"He needs some kind of professional help, Mom."
"I'm not saying he doesn't need help, Kevin,"
I'm just saying now's not the time to theorize about your poor brother as if he was some sort of case study.
"What needs to happen is we need to get down to this Oceanside place and get him out of jail, and take him home."
Why didn't you tell me your father was going to insult him like that?
"Oh, what would you have done if you'd known?"
"I don't know, we could've prepared him, we could've come up with a plan."
"As it is, you dropped it on him like a bomb."
No wonder he's gone off and done something to himself.
Are you serious?
Yes!
"When she got promoted to the Spy Service, I took over."
"Here she is, now."
Good evening.
"Director Spalding, Rick Cruikshank."
Good to meet you.
- Why don't we go into my office.
"- Good to meet you, Ted."
"You, too."
"If you're in town for a while, let's hook up."
- What's it about?
- I got no fucking idea.
"So, what brings you to this end of the Earth?"
What can I do for you?
"We received your report, on the Blackmire Group investigations from the FBI."
I was hoping to persuade you not to pursue that any further.
I wasn't aware the FBI was sharing with the CIA.
I apologise on their behalf.
They should have informed you.
That would have been good.
Can I ask why you want us to stop?
I can't say any more than we have a parallel investigation underway.
We don't to risk your operation endangering our own.
- What's the nature?
- I'm not at liberty to say.
"Well, as you probably already know, as the FBI may have informed you, we've got direction from our Financial Investigations arm to conduct our own investigation."
Fair enough.
"Perhaps you could call them, make them aware of our request."
It's gonna have to wait until tomorrow.
But you could call off an operators you have on the case.
I can't do anything until I speak to someone from Financial.
"In order to gain access to materials you shared with the FBI, you've obviously got someone on the case."
I can't tell you how we receive that intel.
"Look, better than wearing nothing at all."
"In my half season as player and one day as announcer, no, I've never seen anything like this."
"Even though your playing career was cut short by an irrational fear of having your throat stuffed with vulcanized rubber,"
"I'm proud of you all the same, Son."
- Welcome to the booth.
- Glad to be here.
"And here they are now, the three-time defending champ Ice Hounds, led by their MVP Kain ""Stonewall"" Frazier."
"Yes, his Hounds look to easily devour these Zenovators today, much in the same way his mother hopes to destroy their home."
"No one stands in the way of Binghamton folks, on the ice or otherwise."
And the Ice Hounds look every bit the monstrous machine that has dominated the region for many seasons.
"Mon Dieu, those guys are bigger than you are?"
Maybe they'll win.
It'll be like a miracle on ice.
It'll be a miracle if they make it off the ice.
"We keep it loose, we have fun, we play it Newman style, all right?"
"We're gonna win this one for the home, guys."
Let's do it.
- You guys shouldn't be out here.
- You guys shouldn't be on steroids.
And we're underway.
"Binghamton's star scorer,"
"Janislav, controls the puck."
Here he comes up the aisle.
He did not make the Zen defender.
He's driving on goal all by himself.
He shoots.
The Hounds have scored at five seconds in.
That must be some kind of a record.
The orphans need a fatter goalie.
"Now, some crisp passing by the Zenovators."
Gorrall shoots and denied by Frazier.
Who's your daddy?
"And if so, Dana could already be dead."
PATTON:
Maybe not.
I hit Dana's e-mails and text messages with some Triple P-grade hacking of my own.
"Turns out, she's not just the advance coordinator for the races, she's the advance planner for the robberies."
"Well, it makes sense."
Advance coordinators go to the next town a week ahead of each race.
"That's plenty of time to prep for the next heist, and it's a perfect cover, too."
PATTON:
"And that text indicates that they're planning a hit today, in our town."
You know where?
She left the location out of the digiverse.
You think they took Dana to pull off one more heist?
LASALLE:
"If they did, then they did it by force."
Means figuring out where the heist is gonna go down might be our only chance to save her.
"Oh, we'll narrow down possible targets in the area."
No.
Percy and Patton can do that.
Have Sebastian see if he can figure out what those schematics and blueprints go to.
"Well, what does that leave me?"
Let's talk.
"I know, King, I messed up."
"You did more than that, Christopher."
"Bad enough you went M.I.A. in the middle of a case... and that can't ever happen again, understand?"
"It won't, but..."
"NOPD called, said Darrell filed assault charges against you."
What?
He swung at me first.
"Yeah, well, lucky they found a witness who said the same thing, but that doesn't explain what you were doing there in the first place."
"Look, Melody tried to get a restraining order on him, all right?"
Said she was worried for both her and Tucker.
Give me a light.
Colonel... does that box really look like standard espionage gear?
A clever prop to lend authenticity to your cover.
A prop?
"That Ark is a priceless relic, you buffoon."
"In time of war, the penalty for spying is immediate execution."
What war?
This area is supposed to be protected by the U.N.
You are remarkably well-informed for one who claims not to be a spy.
I watch the news.
Then you will know that this region belongs to my people and we will take it.
Even if it means killing innocent people who happen to live here?
We must cleanse the area.
You're talking ethnic cleansing.
That's racial genocide.
"Look, pal, the whole world has been watching what's been going on around here."
"Now, you can call it whatever you want."
But it's murder.
Pure and simple.
"Exactly, now for the last time, we were sent by the Royal Academy of Archaeological Science in London, England."
You are already dead.
It is only a question of how you will die.
"Like men, with dignity, or screaming in agony."
"Either way, you will tell me who you are spying for."
Hey.
"Stop that, MacGyver."
Ah!
Leave him.
Leave him alone.
No.
Thank you for your knife.
This will make a great cigar box.
I can see my last breaths!
"He's so scared and vulnerable, and it's hilarious."
This is how it's gonna end for me... in an icy igloo with you two morons.
- He's freaking out.
- Shut up and help me!
"You got it, pal."
You're not trying to help me.
You're just playing with my face to mess with me.
"Dude, you push like this."
Stop!
"As we continued to mess with my dad, my mom was cleaning Erica's room."
"Okay, she was ransacking it like an FBI agent."
It was a desperate attempt to uncover the person Erica chose as her hero.
And then she found it...
"hidden in plain view behind the circuit board of a Lite-Brite, the piece of paper that would change my mom's life forever."
"Dad, I stumbled upon something incredible hidden in Erica's room, and I need to tell someone, but I can't because she'll never forgive me."
"Okay, you twisted my arm, so here it is."
I'm Erica's hero.
"Me, baby, me!"
"Well, I'm glad this worked out for you."
"You know what this means, right?"
I have succeeded as a mother.
"Now, I know there were times when I quietly wondered if I had failed as a mother, but now I know the truth."
Success!
Did it ever occur to you that Erica hid that essay so you wouldn't overreact like you are right now?
Did it occur to you that none of this matters because I'm her hero?
"Bevy, you snooped."
You broke her trust.
"If I were you, I wouldn't speak a word of this."
Obviously.
"Erica will never, ever know."
And she wouldn't... for 10 minutes.
I hear it's possible to leave a fraternity and survive.
Yeah. I know guys that have done it.
"Why are you doing this, Eric?"
Why are you helping me?
Because you helped me.
I wanna give you something before you go.
Your thesis film?
"If this were the third act of a movie, that's what this would be."
"-You'd watch it, it would be great- l'd give it to a professor who would give it to a student who now runs a studio."
And I'd see my name up on the big screen just a few months later.
I would have liked that.
Seeing my name on the screen just once.
You get to see your name in print a lot.
Yes. I sure do.
It's What's Up Tiger Lily?
-Woody Allen.
-His first.
Do you know it?
-No.
-He took this old Japanese movie and he just replaced the dialogue.
It's literally a remake of someone else's picture.
"Obviously, it's derivative and imitative and--"
Full of unexplored potential.
"But if you look at it closely, you can see a glimmer of Annie Hall a twinkle of Manhattan and the promise of Hannah."
Thank you.
"I'll call you when I'm done, and-- lt's a gift."
"We're both in very different places in our lives, Dawson."
Mine is much more predictable and defined than yours and I think we both know I'm probably not the person you need to be spending your precious time with right now.
I don't think your life is nearly as predictable and defined as you think it is.
Why is that?
Would you have predicted a night like this?
I would like to keep in touch with you.
Which is why I never said anything.
"He invited me down there, didn't he, one day."
Took his plane up in the air....
CLEO:
"At which point, fate suddenly threw temptation in your way."
"And so then, of course, I started seeing this mate of his, who was really great, you know."
"Except, our first night together, we're in his bedroom and it's all, you know, and suddenly he asks me what are my feelings about capital punishment."
You're joking.
"What, where you stand on the issue ethically?"
"Wow, that's a first."
I think she means corporal punishment.
"Yeah, well, whatever."
"Spanking basically, right."
"Over the knee, bare bottom, all that caper."
"To which at first, obviously, I was like, yuck, you know."
"But I don't know, I just thought if you really care about someone and what gives them pleasure..."
so I just closed my eyes and went for it.
"God, you star."
-And did it hurt?
"-Well, that's the thing."
"At first, not that much, but then gradually I could feel it really starting to sting."
"And after about half an hour, my God!"
"Oh, why do I know what you're going to say?"
"Your hands just went completely numb, right?"
It really did.
I'm not joking.
"I said, ""Look, do you mind if we stop now, Terry,"
"""'cause you're not going to be able to sit down tomorrow at this rate."""
And after that he was so turned on.
"I tell you what, it made such a difference."
"You see, Ali, this is all vital stress management you're missing out on."
"That every woman needs on a regular basis, even when you're on your own."
"Just remember though, that if you will drink - and personally I have a bitter lemon..."
"But if you do, just don't over-do it, or you won't be able to get up in the morning for your lectures!"
"So, any more questions before group sessions?"
Are you two shagging or what?
"No, we're not."
I adore Derek to bits.
But he's more like a brother.
But you'll make friends like that here too.
"Friends who appreciate that you never, never, never want that to happen."
So...
No.
We're certainly not doing that.
No.
We're not...
We're... truly not.
Any more questions before...
Thank you.
"You know, if you don't work together, then you'll..."
You're late.
Sorry...
I couldn't find the room.
"And yet everybody else seems to have managed, which I find kind of spooky, really."
Sorry.
Please...
So.
"Whilst you were meandering around the corridors, we were introducing ourselves."
"Martin, you were telling us what you did on your gap year?"
Yeah...
"As I was saying, I spent most of my time in Central America."
"You know, building bridges of the real, and the symbolic variety."
"You know, just really teaching the people out there out there the value of teamwork."
"So 6,000 years of tribal society, they still hadn't managed to grasp the rudiments of teamwork."
I love them.
I do.
"But damn, they get on my nerves."
I wanted to -- everyone knows what I want to do --
what I want to do every second of every day.
I don't even have to say it.
"But...then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago."
"And I didn't, and..."
"I'm just grateful, I guess... to have this place."
And that's all.
"Um, the surveillance reports that you requested --"
"Alexandria, Virgina, the week of January 23rd."
There's a list of every person at the meeting and the names of all of their security personnel.
"Thank you, Martha."
"I included the local police reports from that area, as well, as the DOD meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder."
"There was a ton of extra police around, so maybe someone saw something useful to you."
You mean that...couple and their -- and their daughter?
That scared the hell out of me.
"I thought it was a Charles Manson thing, but I think they've ruled that out."
You know what?
Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also.
Sure thing.
You think they're related?
I think I can't rule anything out.
"I thought we were through the hard times, you know?"
"I'd been sick for about three months, uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and...this is gonna sound weird."
Please.
My life?
No judgment.
"I-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
"I wanted... the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
"But when a woman says that she's going to collapse, she usually ends up pushing the man over."
That's why I'd like to leave another way out.
I don't think Mother has collapsed.
Is that right?
She must be staggering or having an affair.
"No, she's not."
"And if she were, why don't you help her?"
Mother has been holding up the household all by herself all this time.
"You've just kicked stuff down on her and looked on, without helping her at all."
It's perfectly understandable why she would be straying off the straight and narrow after these twenty years.
You don't know the whole story.
"Since Mother has been living with me, she's been living with Takehara in spirit."
"Dear, are you so sure about that?"
That's because you're so cold to her.
She has no choice but to look for love somewhere else.
"Father, there's something I want to ask you."
Yes?
I've found out that you have a bank account that you keep secret from Mother.
You have someone at the university keep the passbook at school.
What's all that about?
"Dear, is what Takao says true?"
"Yes, it is."
That's terrible.
And we've been selling our kimonos and gnashing our teeth this whole time.
I'm all alone here.
I'm all by myself.
"I've put up with you saying things like that all this time, but..."
But what?
What are you going to do?
Are you going to tell me you're going to live at Takehara's?
"If I could have done that,"
I wouldn't have been trying to be your wife in spirit as well as fact.
But there would be plenty of reason for Merle to do it.
"And the murder weapon was still locked in her bag, so you can't very well say it was planted there."
"She admits putting it there, all right."
She planned to get rid of later.
She'd gone into Olivia's bedroom to get some traveling money from her desk.
She recognized the knife as one belonging to her Uncle Howard.
"You mean she swiped it and ran out with it, just to protect him?"
What else could she have thought?
It was his knife.
She tells me that Olivia was ten times as rough on Howard as she was on her.
"Yeah, but with a kookie kid like that--"
Merle seems about 14 years old only because Olivia deliberately held her back.
How would you have acted in that kind of situation?
All right.
Here's the rest of my report.
One of my men on another case accidentally stumbled on a messenger service boy who made a pickup at the house next door while the party was going on.
What time?
Late enough so the package could have been the necklace.
But I couldn't see the guy.
"I wouldn't know who it was, in the dark like that."
"He just handed me down this thick envelope from the porch, and I gave him a receipt and that's it."
Then you delivered the envelope here?
"Yes, sir."
The addressee was a dame in room 32 there.
I got it in the book.
Then what happened?
"Well, I knocked on the door, and she answered, and I--"
She answered right away?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
"Anyway, she opens the door, and she sticks an arm out, and I give her the package, and she shuts the door."
Just an arm?
Yeah.
"Think I was five, you were six."
"When you used to come over and stay for the weekend, then Dad would take us out to the Downs for a picnic."
Sit there smoking his pipe while the two of us went off to play together.
Yeah.
"As you said, a moment becomes a memory."
Sorry about that.
"This looks brilliant 'cause, I tell you, I'm absolutely famished."
"Oh, I don't know, that isn't bordering on incest, is it, Ali?"
"-I mean, your own cousin."
"-Oh, probably."
"So, what?"
It will never come to anything.
It's just....
"I don't know, this last week or so,"
I can't remember ever feeling so comfortable with someone.
I suppose because there are no hang-ups there for either of us.
"We're not worrying about where it's going or... trying to judge each other on any level, we're just...."
"Anyway, there's no way it could ever develop into anything, obviously, because, for a start, he's a happily married man."
What are you talking about?
You can't possibly have met someone else.
-You're in prison.
"-Stephen, do we have to have a scene?"
You always have to do this.
You have to overreact and start fulminating in front of everyone.
What do you expect me to do?
Hand out cigars?
"God, Phillipa."
We've been married 1 7 years.
What are you telling me?
"You're in here eight days, you've had some kind of epiphany?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Solo Solo.
What are you doing?
You only have half an hour until you perform.
I'm not a scriptwriter.
I can't come up with any persuasive dialogue.
So that's why I'm doing other things to change my mood.
This is a voodoo doll I made myself.
"Whenever I'm in a bad mood, it works well for venting my feelings."
Do you want me to show you how to make one?
Put that away this instant!
Are you going to admit you've lost to those people?
"I'm not, but I don't know how to act out the scene."
"In that case, you shouldn't have parroted Mary just now and provoked those vicious shrews."
"I wasn't provoking them, but after listening to what Mary said,"
I agree that it's illogical.
Look at this.
"This jie jie* was the recipient of their mother's love, (*big sister) but as a result of her mei mei's birth, (*little sister) all of her happiness was stolen away in one night."
"In my mind, this jie jie should hate this mei mei intensely."
"But, this jie jie who hates her mei mei so much, has to coax her by saying,"
"""Daddy doesn't hate you at all, Mei Mei. """
"In other words, Jie Jie doesn't want Mei Mei to continue to suffer."
That means Jie Jie also loves Mei Mei a lot.
This character is too complex.
I can't figure it out.
"To be honest,"
I don't care at all what your thoughts are on this character.
All I care about is that you don't mess this up and ruin our Love Me Dept's reputation.
Hold on...
What reputation?
What did you just say?
I didn't hear you clearly.
Could you repeat that again?
They want to know what's going on.
Tell them that they chose to leave.
They weren't working properly.
"That may be so, but these men gave our team international validity."
- I can withstand Lacau if I can convince him...
- Lacau is an incompetent meddler.
Whose boss was previously imprisoned by the British.
They will try anything to get rid of us.
I will not have him in my tomb and that's final.
"It's not your tomb, Howard."
It's mine.
"The point is, you're the best excavator in the world."
"Without you, this tomb would never have been discovered."
Your achievement is unique.
"But your public relations skills are somewhat lacking, if I may say so."
"And unless we're very careful, I shall lose this tomb."
- Are you questioning my leadership?
- Not at all.
"But I would ask you to be more careful, both with members of our team and with Monsieur Lacau."
I will not grovel to that bloody Frenchman.
Where did that come from?
It comes from the treasury.
Mace asked me to have a look at it.
Ask Evelyn.
She was there.
I don't think this has anything to do with my daughter.
"And frankly, I must tell you, I don't like your intimacy with her."
- My intimacy?
- Your feelings for her are quite inappropriate.
You're old enough to be her father apart from anything else.
What you mean is I'm not a gentleman.
- Don't put words in my mouth.
You know Marbella better than anyone else.
You told Mariá that you were that garrison's chaplain for years.
Nobody would suspect anything if you went to visit them now.
I'm not sure if I can reconcile this with the priesthood.
Can you reconcile the suffering of your people with the priesthood?
No one else can make this decision for you.
"Lord, I hope You will forgive me."
"All right, I'll help you."
Why are you doing it?
Would you have dropped your plan otherwise?
- No.
- I knew that.
These are old photographs of the refinery.
You might know if anything has changed.
We only have a small amount of explosives.
We can't afford any mistakes.
So that's what you studied engineering for.
I might rebuild tomorrow what I destroy today.
- Let's continue.
- The chaplain goes there every Sunday.
- He needs a special permit to get inside.
- How does one get there?
Only by tanker train.
There's a small town with a station near the refinery.
"That's where the chaplain lives, and that's where he takes the train."
"/f you calculated exactly how long the train takes, you could blow up individual wagons wherever you want."
Attaching the explosives is dead easy.
The only problem is getting out of this alive.
/ see.
Wait a minute.
I think it's that way.
Can I help you?
And it...
That chafed.
It was a stony beach.
ALAN GASPS
And it dragged me about 200 yards up the beach and...
Couldn't you let go?
Eventually I got the thing to lose it's power.
I pulled this thing that collapses the kite and I was just sort of lying there.
"My trunks are about 200 yards down the beach and I was there with a badly grazed penis on the beach, and a kite that had disappeared across the South Downs somewhere."
"Um, and..."
Was this three days after you had some crystal meth in a club?
LAUGHTER
But I've always seen things like that and wanted to get involved.
"It never occurs to me that there's a whole bit in between, where you've got to learn how to do that, and it'll take years to get any good at it."
"My new thing, now, is I give up easily."
I just give up.
Surely you can sue someone for that.
"I think I should be able to sue, for not being given the proper information - that, you know, I was unlikely to be any good at it."
LAUGHTER
What about your daughter?
Cos I can just imagine she was professional.
Helpless with laughter.
And fetched my trunks for me and brought them over to me like...
Did you have a go at your penis with TCP?
It was...
There's the voice of experience.
LAUGHTER Yeah.
"I'm just glad I had witnesses, cos it's quite difficult to explain to your other half why you've got a grazed penis, otherwise, you know."
"Yes, we've all been there."
Argh!
I kill you!
How hairy was it when you had to leave Iran for your dad?
Well it was a poor exchange for an empty bed!
"This wretched vow of virginity was your choice, not mine."
This marriage was when?
A year since past.
Was she still in my service when it began?
After she left...when?
In your service.
"It was...for comfort, Bess, it was a diversion."
And when she left my court to marry Walter Devereux did you still partake of her comfort?
How fortuitous for you both he died so suddenly.
"Her son, who bears Devereux's name .."
"he too is called Robert, is it not?"
"Does he have dark eyes, like you?"
"Such a rank insinuation is unworthy of you, Bess."
"The bond we shared was like no other, Robbie."
You have defied it.
"So what's it to be banishment again, Bess?"
Another... mission abroad?
"Henceforth, if I see you, I shall not know you."
You are dead to me.
"Look on her well, Lettice, for there true loyalty lies,"
"It is a pity you did not learn from Kat's example, is it not?"
"I am heart broke,"
"Your Majesty, that.. we have so incurred your displeasure."
and as we can not always choose where loves arrows falls.
"Such sentimental claptrap finds no favor with me, madam."
Get up!
Imported silk?
From France.
The color is too vulgar for my taste.
Gold?
I'm been told you also run a lavish household.
"- Sally, you're back."
- Lenny.
"Oh, yes, Lenny."
"Yes, darling, I'm back, and we are going to set things right."
You can count on me.
Thank you.
- Can I stay with him tonight?
- No.
"But... the hospital keeps apartments across the street... and I can arrange for you to stay in one of those, if you'd like."
- You treated him?
"- I was the admitting surgeon, yes."
"Your husband had a buildup of blood on his brain, a haematoma."
That's what caused his intercranial pressure rise.
"We fixed that, we hope."
He has more surgery ahead of him.
"Tomorrow, he'll be in the OR again, with Dr. Freeman."
Dr. Freeman's an orthopod.
He has multiple fractures of his lower extremities.
"Both his right and his left tibia... his right malleolus, and his pelvis is fractured."
Is he in pain?
"He's receiving medication, which relieves the pain."
Morphine?
I'm afraid that your husband's spine... and skull were also severely damaged.
Will he be able to walk?
Will he be able to use his hands?
Because... my husband is a painter.
His spine was damaged between the fourth and the fifth cervical vertebrae.
The good news is that his ability to breathe seems unimpaired.
"The bad news is that, up to this point, he has shown... no ability to move his arms or his legs, and no response to stimuli... the prick of a pin, for instance."
"But we're still in the first 24 hours, post-accident."
"Dr. Hook, when my husband wakes up, will he be a quadriplegic?"
We're hopeful that the spine is only compressed.
Any thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself?
"Uh, not unless you count wanting to take a carving knife to my hips."
Do you ever think about wanting to hurt your baby?
Of course not.
What did you tell him?
"Judy, you said you were upset and that you couldn't snap out of it."
What are you talking about?
You told me you felt like everything was coming at you and that you wanted it all to stop.
"No, no, I said that I lost control of the car and I couldn't stop."
You're putting words in my mouth.
It's not uncommon for new moms to have bouts of depression.
The first year with your baby can be very stressful.
"I'm not stressed and I'm not depressed, although I will be if I have to spend any more time here."
So stop accusing me of being crazy and let me go.
Nobody's accusing you of anything.
We have to be extra careful whenever there's a child involved.
"Look,"
I appreciate your concern.
Really.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I've had a rough day.
And I just want to take my baby home and get some rest.
"Well, I hope you have a speedy recovery, Mrs. Anderson."
- So are we good to go?
"- Uh, not quite, but you can go back inside now."
I'll be right in.
She's changed her story.
"There are no vegetative symptoms, no anhedonia."
She doesn't have a depressed affect.
- She appears to be in good spirits.
"- Well, something is going on."
She as much as confessed to deliberately crashing her car.
"Then when you respond with ""I guess"" using its patented sigh-activated technology, the app automatically will set up a time and place for you guys to walk past each other on the street."
- What's up?
- What's up?
"Gosh, but ugh, what if even being close to a guy on the street makes me want to open my arms the right way?"
"For just another 49.99 a month, you can stand on a street corner and a guy will pass you in a double decker bus and wave."
What's up?
What's up?
"If you want the premium package, for $75 a month, a guy in his 50s who doesn't want kids will buzz your door and say..."
What's up?
...into the intercom.
How's it-- What's up?
Wow.
What if I just want him to buzz?
"Oh, my God, of course."
Everyone's on so much medication now that nobody wants to have sex anyway.
"Yeah, I guess it's true what they say."
"""It's better to have said a quick what's up and lost than to have never said a quick what's up..."""

Dating apps.
Mark is very familiar.
- Yeah.
"- Mark, what--"
Who have you said no to?
"Like, what was the situation where you said no to sex with a woman?"
"Well, you had sex and it was bad, then I said no to the second one."
- How did you say no?
- I didn't answer the phone.
That's a clear no.
"I gotta tell you this, no story."
"I told this woman no, I couldn't have sex with her because she started telling me about her son,"
- and how sick he was.
"- Ooh, that's hot."
"Kyle, I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom has every right to send Amanda back whether she wants to go or not."
Just as she has the right to ask you to stay away.
And the hard truth is... it's really none of our business.
You know what Amanda means to me.
"If she's struggling with, or confused about something, how could it be none of my business?"
"I know you're bummed, but look at the bright side."
"Which, by the way, is my new M.O."
At least Amanda wasn't planning on dumping you.
How do you know that?
Mrs. Bloom blames you for ruining her life.
"It seems to me like Amanda flying home was a case of ""girl missing boy next door. """
But we don't know that.
We don't know anything Amanda's feeling.
No one's letting her explain.
Even Mom and Dad.
I can't believe they're siding with Mrs. Bloom.
I can't believe we're siding with Carol Bloom.
"She's uptight, narrow-minded-"
"Yeah, and those are her good qualities."
"Well, like it or not, we have to respect what she wants for her daughter."
But Kyle has shown nothing but love and concern for Amanda.
And now we have to keep them apart?
"The funny thing is, knowing Kyle, he'd make the situation a lot better if he were just allowed to talk to her."
You remember being Kyle's age?
When something like this takes over your whole life...
That's half the fun of being in love.
"Now we have to be the buzz kills, the grown-ups."
"Well, if this is what being a grown-up means-"
It sucks.
Why can't Mom and Dad do something?
They can't cross the line with Mrs. Bloom.
They're all about crossing the line when something's not fair.
Meaning is she your girlfriend?
Yes..
- She is so good.
Why are all these dramas?
"You could have introduced all of us, right?"
Main matter should be cleared for introducing to you.
Are you mad?
Should I act as a wife to some stranger?
"If the same was said in Uganda, they would have killed the husband and made a pickle of him."
Do not try all such with my sister.
- Shut up!
"Malini, Vasu got a doubt."
"If that is not cleared, my 20 years plan would be spoiled."
"You always say plan, what is that?"
Harischandra Prasad while dying has put all the major shares on the name of his grandson Rahul.
He has put me just as his guardian till he gets married.
After that the entire property goes onto his name.
Your situation then is like security dog till then and a street dog after that.
"After the marriage of Rahul, I will create an accident and finish the entire family along with Vasundhara."
"If it was a high society match, there would be issues like investigations and inquiries."

Hi brother-in-law!
Is he your brother-in-law?
Your brother in law is inside.
Please do not mistake him.
His errands were never explained.
The dinner table was our battlefield.
"I do think, Charles, you might talk to me."
I've had a very exhausting day.
I was looking forward to a little conversation.
"Of course, father."
What shall we talk about?
Cheer me up.
Take me out of myself.
Tell me about the new plays.
But I haven't been to any.
"You should, you know, you really should."
It isn't natural in a young man to spend all his evenings at home.
"Well, father, as I told you, I haven't much money to spare for theatregoing."
"My dear boy, you must not allow money to become your master in this way."
"Why, at your age, your cousin Melchior was part-owner of a musical piece."
It was one of his few successful ventures.
You should go to the play as part of your education.
I received one letter from Sebastian.
"It was written on, and enveloped in heavy Victorian mourning paper, black-coroneted and black bordered."
"""Dearest Charles."
I found a box of this paper... at the back of a bureau so I must write to you as I am mourning... for my lost innocence.
It never looked like living.
The doctors... despaired of it from the start.
Seems I am off to Venice to stay with Papa in his palace of sin.
I wish you were coming.
I wish you were here.
I am never quite alone.
Members of my family... keep turning up and collecting luggage and going away again... but the white raspberries are ripe.
I have a good mind... not to take Aloysius to Venice.
I don't want him to meet a lot of horrid Italian bears and pick up bad habits.
Love or what you will.
"For your information, this happens to be the 17 th of May."
"The old calendar does whip around, doesn't it?"
I just wanted to get a little practice before the grouse shooting started.
Don't you practice before grouse shooting?
Very tricky birds.
"I feel you won't need these, so I'll take care of them."
"- That is, if you don't mind."
- Not at all.
I'm delighted... that you government fellows would take them for me.
What a nice hat that is.
"Now, if you two gentlemen wouldjust be patient..."
I'm quite sure everything will be straightened out by tomorrow.
- What do you mean?
- I can't take you into my confidence.
You'll just have to trust your old friend Wooster.
"You see, I have decided to take over Miss Lowman's interest permanently."
- Do you mind telling us what you're talking about?
- Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
I have persuaded Miss Lowman that a life of dishonesty never did pay.
I never could bear a thief at any price.
"However, she's an exception."
- We know that.
- Is he pulling our leg?
- He's up to something.
"- I am, but it's a secret."
"However, you may tell your superiors— I take it you have superiors—"
Tell them they need worry no more.
That which they are seeking will be placed... in their hands tomorrow and you may add that Bertram Wooster will see to it.
- Do you know what he's driving at?
- Sounds balmy to me.
"Well, let's go."
"Oh, yes, sir, it did occur to me, but there's something wrong with your thinking."
"If you'll forgive a criticism, sir."
I look at it this way.
"If Ward Fowler's career was ruined, she wouldn't be able to blackmail him anymore, would she?"
He wouldn't have anymore money.
"And on top of that, the show would fold."
And it would be her show.
"Do you understand my point, sir?"
"I mean, does an intelligent woman go and destroy her only means of income?"
I don't know.
Does she?
It's what that character did in the show last August.
"That's the implicit threat of every blackmailer,"
"""Pay me or I'll ruin you."""
"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
Why don't we just ask Ward Fowler if he was being blackmailed or not?
I asked him.
And?
He claims not.
He claims he has what he calls a weakness.
And this weakness has cost him a great deal and Claire Daley was kind enough to lend him enough money to cover his rather extensive losses.
"And do you believe him, sir?"
"Taking your argument for him into account, I think so."
I'm not sure.
Do you?
"Well, it's hard to say, isn't it?"
"I mean, taking your argument against him into account."
"I mean, you know, he had an awful lot to conceal."
Did you know that?
"For example, the Army unit that he deserted from was the artillery."
He was an expert marksman.
"I checked on that, too."
Robert comes to wake me up.
"He says, ""Hey, Ray's home, Ray's home."""
"Well, I'm in bed asleep."
This is about 10 o'clock at night.
"My oldest son came in and woke me up, said, ""Robert's outside"""
"""with Ray,"" which was our neighbour."
Robert was only 15 at that time.
"So when I got up, I go outside to check this dude."
And my dad was struggling then.
"Time I get over there, I've pulled him up off my dad and me and Ray started going at it."
He gets up on top of me.
"My dad, he's coming round the trailer and everything to pull him up off of me."
"But as he pulls him up off of me, stabbing him."
"I don't know where the knife came from, you know."
But my dad had a knife.
It was a steak knife that was laying on the counter.
"When I come out of the house,"
I picked it up and stuck it in my back pocket.
For self-defence!
Ray Yarborough died from multiple stab wounds.
Sam Pruett was sentenced to life in prison for the killing.
Steven Pruett got 40 years.
Robert had turned 16 by the time the case came to trial.
He was sentenced as an adult and given 99 years.
"When somebody's already in prison for murder, it kind of makes your mitigation investigation a bit more difficult, cos you have to counter that."
And it makes it easier for the state to prove their case.
"You know, they think, ""He's killed someone before"","
"""then he definitely deserves the death penalty now."""
So it just makes it harder at every stage.
All of the mitigation evidence has been sent to Professor Dow.
It's time for his verdict.
"I would say that the evidence in Pruett's case was some of the most compelling, strongest evidence that I've seen in more than 20 years of doing this."
"Oh, look, there's Ethan."
- He's yelling something.
"- Oh, hey, Ethan, we found your chocolate."
It's on our faces and in our tummies.
No!
Them!
They did it.
They took the chocolate!
"It was them, they took the chocolate!"
So that's the bridge.
"So, now, if you guys were to do an intro just by yourselves..."
Like we were marching down the street to it.
"Even though it's this, like, that would be like I imagine that's kind of like it."
"We should open the fucking doors, man."
_
You hear about different cultures around the world trying to preserve their history.
Native Americans hand down stories from generation to generation.
And you have museums all over the world preserving art and culture.
I honestly believe that we should be doing the same thing just with music.
That's what this place is all about.
The pace of the city has a lot to do with how we feel about things.
Those paddle wheels make a distinctive rhythm.
A streetcar going down St. Charles Avenue... making this clackety-clackety sound.
We have become complacent with some old-world charm.
"Oh, man, when you get steeped in the history, you get seduced by it."
"You go to sleep with live music, you wake up with live music."
Literally.
It's just like no other place on the earth.
Being from here is in the fabric of what we do.
"No matter what type of music we're playing, you'll hear New Orleans there."
"A city like New Orleans,"
"Trish Gorham, the assistant director from the nursing home that's been caring for Blaire Collins."
I didn't mean that...
It's our policy to check on patients prior to transfer.
I gather she's well enough to return?
"Yeah, she's right over here."
"To be honest with you, all she needs is a course of IV antibiotics and the G-tube could have been changed at her facility."
"We're not staffed as well as the hospital, and the gastro-neurologist doesn't come out to the nursing home."
The earliest I could have gotten anyone to see her was in two weeks.
She have any family?
Apparently her mother died from the crash that did this.
"There was a boyfriend, but he's stopped coming around years ago."
He didn't even try to stop!
- Somebody call my son.
- 47-year-old victim of auto-versus-pedestrian.
I just ran out to get the kids some pizza.
- He didn't even slow down.
- Systolic only 80 after a liter.
"Pulse 140, pale and diaphoretic."
Ecchymosis across the abdomen and pelvis.
Four units of O-neg and prime the rapid infuser.
Am I dying?
"No, but you may have some internal bleeding."
Resps are shallow.
Let's set up for intubation.
How often are you sad?
"Uh, not often."
"And what makes you happy, Judy?"
Being with my baby and my husband.
Why are you asking me all this?
We ask all patients these questions to assess mental status following a head injury.
"Well, my mental status is fine."
Really.
"It was massive in Ireland, though, that song."
I think everyone Irish had the same feeling when Galway Girl came out.
"They were like, ""Oh, my God, I hate this!"
"""Oh, my God, I hate this!"
"""I'm having this played at my wedding, I love this!"""
"He's had a tattoo of that on his arm, but he's had it, it's spelled wrong, so girl is spelt ""gril""."
"But he's been saying to everyone that he meant it to be that way, which is like someone with one of those shit Chinese symbols,"
"""I just love Kung pao chicken."
"""No, really, really!"""
"I'm just sick of people telling me what their tattoos mean, you know?"
"Like that, which is like, ""Oh, that's in honour of my, uh,"
"""Godfather who died three-year."""
"Oh, so you got a skull with flames coming out of the eyes burning a playing card with tits on it?"
"That is a solemn reminder of his life in IT sales, that's what that is."
"Rich, are you a fan of Ed Sheeran, do you like him?"
"Honestly, that's the first time that I think I've consciously ever heard any of his music."
"I'm aware he's had all these hits, and I must have heard..."
"I've rung up call centres, I've been in lifts,"
I must've heard his music sometime in the last five years.
"I'm the same way with Drake,"
I can't honestly tell you what any of his songs actually are.
There was a point where Ed Sheeran and Drake and Stormzy had 50 of the top 100 singles at the same time.
And I hadn't heard a single one.
I don't think you're the demographic.
Do you want to see the best thing you've ever seen in your life?
"No, no."
"I really don't, because, where do I go from here?"
Sorry...
That's a great point.
APPLAUSE
"It's a baby crying, and then they put on some Ed Sheeran."
"Just, just watch."
Isn't he the kind of man that can get everything he wants?
"Not everything, josie."
You can't have everything you want.
Life doesn't work out that way.
You and i know that.
There are some things you want... more than anything else in the world... that you know you can't have.
"Company, halt!"
Pull it in there.
Left face!
Order!
Arms!
"Hello, luke."
"The boys are here, colonel."
What do you got your uniform on for?
"If that wall street crowd want a battle, i'm gonna give 'em a gulletful."
I'm going down to the gold exchange and finish my killing.
Did you read the morning papers?
Sure.
"They got my name plastered all over the place, just like a circus show bill."
This is the greatest day of my life.
Yeah.
They was throwing rocks at you yesterday.
"They're blaming everything on you, jim, and they say that if gold keeps going up that every brokerage firm on the street is going right to the wall."
"That's why they called it ""wall street."""
Get out of my way!
You can't go in there!
"Good morning, commodore."
"Fisk, you're either the smartest man that ever came down the pike or the greatest fool."
I didn't think a cheap jack like you could start a panic.
"Now, i've just telegraphed washington that if they don't open up the treasury and put more gold into circulation today, it'll be the blackest friday in the history of this country."
"That's very friendly of you, commodore, but i think you're too late."
"You can fight me, fisk, but you can't fight 40 million people."
This crew still thinks they're working for John.
"Well, how are we feeling today?"
"If you're implying I'm a split personality, both of us are fine."
"You know, I just came from visiting a dual personality."
Both of them feel terrible.
"You, you're doing very nicely."
Does that mean you're going to let me out of here?
"Well, what's wrong with this place?"
"It's quiet, pleasant."
You have leisure time to paint.
May I look?
It isn't finished yet.
"Oh, it's unusual, certainly."
What do you call it?
I haven't quite decided whether to call it Modern Living or simply Biography.
I see.
"Tell me, John, just what were you trying to interpret here?"
How do I know?
I'm a loony.
"There it is, Mr. Skinner."
Your capital position is badly impaired due to the heavy investment which is frozen in inventory.
Just give it to me in basic English.
"Very well, Mr. Skinner."
"Unless there is a drastic increase in sales, and a liquidation of your past due accounts receivable, the company is going to be insolvent in approximately three months."
Three months?
"Well, I'll need at least a year."
Then I'd suggest you obtaining additional capital.
On what?
The name John Brown and Company has always been sufficient collateral.
Maybe John Brown could get a loan.
The company can't borrow a dime.
These are the debits.
The big day has now arrived.
"In the Kentchurch Bruiser's camp,"
Captain Glover is leaving nothing to chance.
What's the good diet for this morning before the fight?
"With blows to the stomach and the solar plexus, the stomach might rebel, so I think a light breakfast."
"There are bets within the bets that might be, within a round, who goes down first."
And who draws first blood... who might lose a tooth.
"The cook put some special formula into that breakfast, so there's no way you're going to be able to lose."
It's magic stuff.
Squeeze.
"No, don't."
Can you crush an egg?
"I definitely have the advantage on the looks front,"
"Oh, my God, it must be terrible."
"For the time being, so..."
"The master has come to meet the fighter he's backing,"
"Matt ""Killer"" Skelton."
"It's almost like that, but they're all... they're like that for the simple fact that obviously you..."
"you can grab as well, whereas in modern-day boxing, there's no holding."
"In the modern world, the Killer is the heavyweight champion of all England... a title that dates back to Regency times."
How's the... how's the fights been recently?
"I've had seven bouts and seven wins, seven by K.O."
"They used to call me the, um..."
the Grizzly Bear.
How much do you weigh?
"At the minute, I'm 18 stone."
And do you know how much Dean weighs?
I think he's slightly under.
"I think fitness, really, is on my side."
"So, for the sake of our wagers, when do you think you're going to..."
get him?
"Hopefully, I would have exhausted him"
Were you ever a waiter?
My wife and I worked in our own restaurant.
"Perhaps if there were a pretty girl, the restaurant would go better."
In the university you also spoke constantly of girls.
I have had many problems as a widower.
We have time to make a banner for publicity.
Or we could organize a meeting of ex-students who can do publicity for us.
We can do both things.
Papa!
That wasn't your father.
Papa does not do such kind of work.
"I cannot walk very well, could you take my placard?"
"With two placards, I will not be able to walk well."
"You wouldn't be so weak, if while a student you had done more gymnastics."
"HIS WIFE DID NOT WANT HIM TO WORK IN SOMETHING SO HUMBLE, CONSIDERED A SHAME."
This one is my medicine I can't give it to you.
You also went somewhere?
I went to see the father of an old friend of mine to request a job for you.
And how is everything?
I saw a terrible thing.
I saw you.
Never have I asked you to do something like this.
"Although we're in difficulties,you don't need to do something so degrading."
That gentleman is an ex-professor of mine.
Perhaps he can find me a job.
So far I only help him.
You really can trust him?
"When one is in difficulties, one will trust anyone."
I'm slowly losing the force and the vigor of my youth.
From this morning I will also help your professor.
45 DAYS LATER
"Professor, we are all prepared."
"That was our back-story, not yours."
- Get your own.
- Get your own back-story.
- Get your own.
"- We just met this night, earlier this..."
"Ari, what is your feeling about this running gum gag now that you've seen it played to an audience, because you..."
"It's funny, things that you don't think about when you're shooting."
"Like, I was obviously very aware of the fact that we had to always be on top of the gum situation."
"When we were doing press in Toronto all the gum and all the throwing up questions I didn't realize that it was such a thing, kind of."
You know?
But I think it's funny.
"God, I don't know..."
Do you...?
What do you think about it?
"I mean, I love the reaction that it gets in the theater."
And I think it's funny.
I don't think that thing is for every film or every story.
But I think it helps add some levity and lets...
It lets air out of the dramatic balloon when we need to in this movie.
You were a little bit resistant to it at first.
- I was?
- Yeah.
- Was I really?
- To the gum or the vomit?
- What did I say about the gum?
- To the...
I think you weren't sure about how far we were taking it.
"Well, because we've had these debates about, like, the whole kind of bathroom-humor joke."
"Like, Pete always wanted us..."
Do you know that thing where we were all smelling stuff?
- That's out of the movie.
- Every take he wanted us to think that we were smelling something gross.
I thought they just beamed us straight up.
The church has a job retiring us.
"You lose your parish, you lose your family."
They say it happens to you in your late forties.
"What celibacy really means, not sex, but a woman that you love, that you're going to grow old with, kids."
"Yes, well you don't have a monopoly on that."
"Father Clarke, this is Inspector Frost."
"How do you do, Father?"
"You're the policeman, who wants to know what people say in confession."
"Well, I have to tell you, it's none of your business."
Are you a Catholic?
No.
"They that say ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law, it's no excuse in the eyes of the Lord either."
Yes.
"Father, I don't suppose..."
"I gather that what Father Sullivan wants me to talk to you about, is something that was said to him in confession, but it wasn't said to me in confession."
Not that I have any idea what was said to Father Sullivan.
"But if we haven't too much idea what we're talking about, well there can't be any sin in that."
"We'd like some tea, for the whisky."
"About James Barr, Father."
"James was an altar boy, when I could get hold of him, he always had something infinitely more interesting to do."
"His wife said he was a bit, well a bit obsessive about his religion."
You're saying but not when he was a kid thought?
At eleven this world is infinitely more interesting than the next.
What about his brother?
Alec.
Yes.
Alec.
He was the religious one.
That's right.
I put him in the choir.
I had to find something for him to do.
Only vitality guarantees success!
I am a man who knows only one thing!
Strike!
Strike!
And strike again!
"The first time, mein Führer, I heard you speak, you looked at me."
"Your blue eyes met my glance, like a flame."
This was a command.
"At that moment, I was reborn."
I knew which road to take.
At last... an epic worth writing.
"But only you, a failed playwright, to write it."
"And you, a failed artist to act it."
"The grander your grandiosity, the more brutal and grotesque."
The propaganda had to be the height of ruth!
"Because it doesn't matter if an idea is true or false, as long as it serves my purposes."
But members of your family suffered from mental illness.
Didn't you fear insanity?
I wasn't put in a lunatic asylum.
I created a lunatic asylum.
The war would never have started if it wasn't for the Jews... and their puppet
Churchill.
( mimics Churchill ) We will fight them on the landing strips.
We will fight them on the beaches.
We will fight them wherever the enemy invaded us.
I dealt with pain by causing pain.
No!
Cross that out!
"It's a ridiculous notion, that personal pain causes one man to injure another."
"To protect Germany, an act of self-defense."
To guarantee my singular place in history.
To punish the German nation for undermining my charisma.
"Yo, they should put me up in a video on this bitch!"
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Stick me in the ocean I'm gonna make it look real good
"You go, girl."
"Daddy's got to ice his knee, baby, okay?"
"If you just let me recharge my battery,"
"I promise, this'll be more for you later, okay?"
"Technically, I was bit by a shark."
Were you bit or were you nipped?
"I mean, if you had been bit, you probably would have lost a great deal of blood and..."
"What difference does it make to you two, anyway, what you would call it?"
It hurt.
And I had shark teeth penetrate my skin.
"And besides, Jason, it's your fault that it happened."
The only reason I got bit in the first place is because you did the worst thing you could possibly do in that situation.
You panicked and you threw a bucket of chum in my face.
I did the prudent thing and I got the hell out of the water.
"There were sharks in there, David."
What was I supposed to do?
You know what?
Remember it however you want to and I'll remember it how it actually happened.
Dave.
"I mean, really, did they penetrate your skin?"
Do you really need that bandage?
"Lucy, I don't know what to tell you, okay?"
You tell me if I need the bandage.
"It looks like you scraped yourself on the ladder, maybe, on the way out."
I'm sorry?
Did you get out of the water abruptly?
"Hey, I don't know how to explain it to you."
Maybe I have tough skin.
Perhaps lemon sharks don't leave that bad of a mark.
"Every afternoon, her grandson comes from school and she goes to meet him... across the street."
She stays there for an hour and we can relax at that time.
Who is going to sneak into the teachers' room?
It has to be someone that no one would suspect.
Someone who nobody believes would steal questions even if he were caught.
Someone that teachers trust enough to hand him the questions themselves.
Because he's a trustworthy and honest student.
No way!
The fool you are calling cannot reached at the moment.
I've made the plan.
That's all from me.
I'm not interfering with the rest!
This is what we call virtue and ethics.
"Before the lunch break, Kaan and Sinan will hide in the boys' bathroom."
"When the school is empty, Kaan will go to the teachers' room."
Sinan will watch the stairs from the end of the hall.
Gamze will already be on duty at the gate.
Whoever arrives early at school... will call us and inform us if they see any teachers.
What am I doing?
You're a civilian.
You're going to watch out for Professor Fatima outside.
"If, for any reason, she returns early to school, you'll let us know."
"I'll be at my computer at home, ensuring that you can communicate with each other."
You saved the best for yourself.
Sitting safely at a desk and at home.
"Well, suit yourself."
It's okay.
Don't be absurd.
This is a team game.
How are we going to communicate with Uluc?
"A) Since Mert will already be out, he communicate easily."
He'll be on the phone the whole time.
"All right, we've only got outgoing flights so far."
"Basic passenger info's printed on there, along with passport photos."
So our killer's in the mix?
"Likely, under an alias."
"McGee, what is the holdup on those manifests?"
"Well, systems are down everywhere, boss."
Every airline and agency's backed up.
I don't care.
Our killer's target could be on one of those inbound flights.
- I'll keep calling.
"- On the bright side, it looks like the snow's starting to let up."
"Geez, when you're looking for bad guys..."
They all look like bad guys.
"Well, it's letting up out there."
"Oh, finally, some relief."
Yet I don't feel relieved.
What?
What are you doing?
Surveillance gave us nothing.
"Oh, wait, not true-- I got to watch your initial takedown of our fake air marshal."
Very stealthy.
"If you search these people, you risk cornering our killer-- that could end very badly."
"Which is the same fight I just had with Homeland, and lost."
"With three flights low on fuel and coming in for landings, they want this missing gun found right now."
- Three flights landing?
- We didn't know anything about that.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're happy to report some good news."
"Tower confirms one runway has now been cleared to allow landings from incoming flights from London, Athens and Brussels."
What does that do for us?
How much longer do we have to wait?
The first flight should be touching down in about 15 minutes!
Thanks again for your patience.
That's right.
JJ and I assumed it was to prevent her from escaping.
I don't think so.
It wasn't to set her up for the kill.
It was to keep her from falling down the stairs and killing herself.
"So her skull fracture was what, an accident?"
"The victim was blinded, hardwood floors slippery with blood."
She could have fallen and hit her head on a blunt object.
That means the unsub's plan all along was for both mothers to survive.
Exactly.
But why?
That's what we need to figure out.
Josie's fate depends on it.
Found someone.
Who?
"Patrick Sorenson of Oswego, New York."
He was on Garcia's list of potential victims.
"Abducted by a pedophile in 1993 when he was 9, raised by a single mother with substance abuse problems."
A mother who was literally asleep at the wheel when the boy was taken.
She was passed out drunk in her car parked behind their house.
Mommy!
"The boy said he screamed for help, but the mom never came."
"Well, that explains the ritual of blaming the surrogate mother while she sleeps."
And it gets worse.
Listen to this.
"While Patrick was recovering in the hospital, the mother left a good-bye note on the kitchen table and was never heard from again."
She abandoned him.
The guilt must have been too much.
Any idea of the whereabouts of Patrick or the mother?
The mom never surfaced.
"Patrick went into the foster care system and moved back to Oswego, where he lived quietly up until 6 weeks ago, when he vanished without a trace."
"Garcia can't even find a picture of him as an adult, but..."
You don't look like I remember.
"You, neither."
What are you doing here?
I texted you this morning;
I said I'll meet you after school.
They don't let us have our phones during school hours.
"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
"If you're not ready for this, then..."
It's okay.
"The truth is I'm in trouble, and I need your help."
"Yeah, I sent those texts, but I didn't mean anything by them."
"""Back off or I'll destroy you."""
Three exclamation points.
"Well, I admit that was a little over the top."
"Hey, guys, come on, focus."
"Don't worry about this, okay?"
We got a tournament coming up.
Let's go!
"When we came here, we were under the impression that this was your residence."
"Oh, it's a team house;"
that's how we do it in eSports.
"I own the place, and the team lives here so that they can practice together all day."
"Yeah, we give them room and board, salary, coaches, trainers, the works."
"According to O.G.'s calendar app, he had several meetings with you at this location over the last week, all predating your angry texts, and all on the subject of something or someone called Tendu."
"They all go by nicknames, and O.G. was Tendu's agent."
"So he found this kid online, and he flew him down from some nowhere town in northern Canada, and started shopping him to teams."
"And O.G. and I, we got into it."
"'Cause Tendu wanted to sign with us, but O.G. kept trying to steer him to one of our rivals."
"Joey, we're ready."
Sorry.
We're interrupting?
Looks like we're the ones interrupting.
Never heard of it.
"It lives in the forest, it'll be feeding soon."
And it is some kind of an animal?
"It's a creature, that has the appearance of a man."
But it can suck the very life from your bones.
"Leaves only a dead, withered husk behind."
Sounds familiar.

"Look, we know you're not used to deal with strangers, but we may be able to help you with this little problem you're having."
We're used to deal with this kind of thing.
We call them the Wraith.
"These are the creatures from the old stories, from the time of the cullings."
So you have heard of them.
"Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete."
"They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky, but there's no description of the Wraith themselves."
Although there were a few among us who guessed the Daemus might be one of them.
Why?
Because it too came from the sky.
It was about 10 years ago.
A bright light appeared above the village... and crashed in the hills.
"We didn't know what that was, but the people were terrified."
"Hurry, gate in the house."
I went with some of the other men to investigate.
"We found the wreckage,... a few wounded survivors,... we didn't know what they were."
We decided to take no chances.
"We slaughtered them, burned the bodies."
Wise decision.
"Unfortunately, we didn't get them all."
"And although none of us saw, evidently one of them survived."
"It took it's first victim, that very night."
"We tried to hunt it down, we couldn't find it."
-What?
You mean the Parean?
-Yes.
"You wouldn't know where it is, would you?"
-Sure. it's right here.
"-Alright, 300 self-retraining tractor, please."
-Preparing Euthanization.
"-It's time, Jaelen."
-Good.
So...
"-So, it would seem that your drive contains sensitive information that some of you find distressing."
"However, all it can serve is to tell people what they'll find out anyway in four days."
"-I mean, yes... but you're forgetting one thing."
The locations of all your hidden bases and their secret entrances.
What do you think?
I just waltzed in here?
I want you to think of tens of thousands of me storming your underground castles with automatic weapons.
You'll have one hell of a shit storm to contend with.
And don't think for one moment it won't happen.
Vengeance and survival at all costs are two very profound impulses we humans have.
-I see.
"So am I then, to understand that this information has not yet been released?"
"-No, it hasn't."
"But if I don't make a phone call, it will go viral to a few million people."
"By sun down, your phones will be ringing off the hook and in a few days, you'll be running from a shower of bullets."
"Now, I also have the power to keep it from going out at all."
And then you cowards can hide down here in your underground fortress without any worries.
-And why should we trust you?
-Because I'm not so eager to hand out doomsday news to the world.
These last few days of life are all we have left.
Why spoil it?
-Indeed.
They are masters at exploiting weakness.
We all have weaknesses.
We all do.
And they will find yours.
What do you need me to do?
"We're gonna go through your file and go over all the parts of your life that make you the most vulnerable to them -- financially, emotionally, sexually."
"No, no, no."
I-I'm not at all comfortable with this.
"Well, it's not my first choice, either, but I'm going to need you to tell me things -- secrets that you might not have told anyone else."
Because that is where their power lies -- in secrets.
"If they can keep you afraid and ashamed, then they can keep you silent."
"And if they can keep you silent, they can control you."
Have you ever been engaged to be married?
No.
And how many close friends would you say you have?
Few.
Not many.
Could you be more specific?
"Uh, two, I think."
"Um, you never really know enough about people, though."
"So, are you -- are you gonna say that because I'm a loner, I'm more vulnerable?"
"Look, I'm not sure how they will approach you, but I am sure that they will."
All right.
"But let me assure you, Agent Beeman --"
I would never betray my country.
No one ever imagines they will.
Riggs and Dubrow -
- What happened.
Official story --- truck flipped in training.
"But nobody can know about that base, so who knows what really happened?"
Maybe some contra went nuts.
"Today was a shitty day, with my shitty kids and my shitty husband."
"- We all make sacrifices for our country, sir."
"- Yeah, but it's more--"
I have the speaker of the house for you.
I'm sorry.
"Thank you, Mr. President."
Right.
"- Thank you, Margaret."
"- You're welcome, sir."
- Eli.
"- That was quite a speech, Mr. President."
"If you were on board, we'd have a real shot at peace."
You do know that your plan has upset the entire defence industry.
These are powerful people who give money to both parties.
I talked to President Al-Sharif again about the discussion we had and he's assuring me that he has proof.
- And you believe him?
- I do.
Guys that run those corporations have been in bed with radical regimes for years.
All they wanna do is keep the cycle of war going.
Al-Sharif will expose them.
All of that wrongdoing is gonna come out...
- ...as soon as our plan is signed.
"- Sir, if your plan is signed."
Jesus.
Since when do you guys come through here?
My supervisor told me to come this way.
Stop.
Be careful next time.
"I know we've had our differences, but I've never known you to be a man to let politics stand in the way of doing the right thing."
"If you stand with me on this, you can be the man that could take these guys down."
I'd like to drag every one of these CEOs in front of Congress but there's more at stake here.
"I can't support this, not at the risk of leaving us militarily exposed."
"Come on, you know those bases are for show now."
I'll tell you why.
"Because the petrol didn't come from a can, it came from a car, which was parked right here."
It was siphoned.
"There's spilled petrol on the floor here, and it has the distinct aroma of additives used for fueling old cars with modern unleaded."
"Additionally, there are scratches here which could only have come from the three-bladed spinning hubcaps of a classic Mustang."
"So, you said this garage was leased by the agency, right?"
- Yeah.
- And the people who worked here are the ones we think started the fire?
"You want to put the Mustang over the air, or should I?"
"Yo, Ghostface, I got that tuna you like."
SHINWELL:
Your cat took off.
I don't think he liked the look of me.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Shinwell.
I'm Chivonne's father.
"Given the way you've been treating my baby girl, stalking her, making her life hell, by rights, you should be lying in a pool of your own blood right now."
That supposed to scare me?
No.
You hard.
"Hard G's, you either drop or you don't."
"Luckily for you, I'm trying to live a peaceable life."
I come to make you a offer.
What kind of offer?
I been looking into you.
"You got three corners, a decent amount of product."
"If you wasn't so damn stupid when it came to the girls, you would have a good thing going."
"Look, my business is my business."
Maybe it's time for you to put your business first.
SBK got two corners near your territory.
"Now, I can arrange for the dealers to move out."
"Your people can move in, doubling your profit."
Someone can spend too much time and mental effort identifying and treating the problems in their life.
The folly in that is that there's no time left for living.
"No, that's..."
Sometimes I think I have it all wrong.
Sometimes I think that those things that I perceive as problems in my life are actually the component parts of my life itself.
It's the lens through which I see my life that's broken.
Huh.
[Arnie] Previously on I'm Dying Up Here...
I saw you on Carson.
"Your answering service could barely speak, and then she hung up on me."
"[Teddy] I will give you half the door, cash."
He's betting on a junkie.
And you're offering-- what was it again?
You ever think that maybe I'm not that nice a guy?
- [applause] - [Cassie] Not for a second.
We're not friends.
"[Ralph] Uh-oh, you don't think I get respect?"
"[Adam] What you think, you made it?"
Think this sorry-ass bar you made or any of this mean shit to me?
"[Sonja] We like to think of ourselves as courtesans, here to entertain members of nobility."
Can't believe Barton didn't say nothing about this place being a whorehouse.
- [police siren blaring]
"- Don't worry,"
I'm gonna take care of everything.
He did not have anything to do with this.
"If you're released now, it's like it never happened."
This offer doesn't extend to him.
I'm good with that.
"Can't afford to pay you right now, Hoss."
No need.
It's already paid.
Wait now!
Don't you get bored with the same old tricks?
And you're always making those stupid faces!
"Good sirs, don't be angry with this creature."
He suffers from melancholy since birth.
"But tomorrow is a party here, many people are coming."
You must return my serving-boy.
I can't manage it alone!
"Now my friend, for this first time"
I forgive you.
"Over there, in the trash can"
sits your infant.
"Doctor, look, what a long face!"
He can't accept that he has lost his girl.
"And his girl is a treasure, a real treasure!"
"Les do him a good turn, Doctor, and we'll have a laugh as well."
"My dear fellow, we are travellers and are here for the first time."
"This is my friend, doctor of philosophy and medicine,"
"Johann Faust, a name you may perhaps have heard."
And I...
"I am a modest scholar, learning the dark side of things, and am called Mephistopheles."
And thus I ask you to call me.
"Forgive me, my dear fellows, but I am astonished that you are addressing me."
We don't want to hurt you.
We were in Egypt and Palestine.
But I don't much care for that place.
"Having passed through Constantinople, Moscow, and Vienna, we became convinced on the way that wherever you go, wine is heady and men run after women."
- And that nowhere can happiness be bought with money and love be gained by force.
Now we are visiting Cologne and would be very happy if you show us it.
You don't appear very happy at all.
"Well, we're cheerful lads."
"We live for the moment, not thinking of the future."
"Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair."
I had come to Russia when the west banned resuscitation of cadaver tissue.
"Akan's a megalomaniac, but my research was funded."
I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize.
"Who has time for icky ethics when he's rich and his cock works, eh?"
I paid a high price.
I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded.
I grew men made of cyber flesh.
"Really, just fancy pants prostheses, but don't dare tell my..."
My avatars!
"Now, cyborgs, on the other hand, have bits and a brain."
"They think for themselves, in theory at least."
Shall we have a look at you?
"That hippie, always with the ganja."
"You're not baked, are you?"
Hope not.
Right.
"You are the man, Henry."
"There's very little actual man left, of course."
"Enhanced skeletal muscular systems, cardiovascular turbo boosted with a curium 244 atomic battery."
A good night of sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.
"Remarkable technology, is it not?"
Not you.
My boys.
I made the first few for revenge but then I started exploring new aspects of myself.
Can I have a sip?
"I have lived these past years, Henry."
"My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid."
You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.
Hit play.
Over there.
Go on.
"It's more like an antibiotic cycle, all right?"
She should be very happy that she's even here.
You're a good guy.
You brought her to this island.
She shouldn't be running off.
"She should be doing everything that she can, bending over backwards to make you happy."
Don't blame this on Shane.
You brought this on yourself.
"I don't need to hear it from you, okay?"
It's half your fault.
"Half his fault, half Trudy's fault, half your fault."
Me?
"Yeah, with the whole canoe scheme?"
All right?
"You put me and my wife in a very extreme situation, put tension on the relationship."
Your wife left you because you were suffocating her.
And now you're suffocating me!
"And you're suffocating Shane, too!"
"Yeah, don't suffocate me, man."
A grown woman literally jumped into shark-infested waters and did a distance swim that she had no way to train for instead of staying in a dry canoe with you.
Look in the mirror.
"Okay, Joseph Cecil Tanzini, with a monsoon of respect, I don't think you're in a position to be telling anyone to look in the mirror when it comes to relationships."
"You're not Mr. ""'I Try So Hard At My Relationship,"" okay?"
"So let's go, glass house."
"Me, glass house?"
"You, glass house!"
You're the glass house!
Talk to me about relationships.
You got a woman who adores you.
She'd do anything for you.
"You have a real partner in life, and what does she want from you?"
"""Take me to the waterfall."" But, no, you can't take her because you had some over-stimulated snorkeling experience."
"Well, I expect you know how maddeningly pathetic he can be."
"I almost gave in and then I said, surely there must be someone... you can get hold of?"
"And he said everybody was away or busy and anyway, no one else would do."
"But at last he agreed to try you... and I promised I'd stay if you failed him, so you can imagine how popular you are with me."
I must say I think it's noble of you to come all this way at a moment's notice.
How did he do it?
"Believe it or not, playing croquet."
He lost his temper and tripped over a hoop.
Not a very honourable scar.
"She so much resembled Sebastian, that sitting beside her... in the gathering dusk, I was confused by the double illusion of familiarity and strangeness."
I hate driving at this time of the day.
There doesn't seem anyone left at home who can drive a car.
Sebastian and I are practically camping out.
- Cigarette?
"- No, thanks."
"Light one for me, will you?"
It was the first time in my life that anyone had asked this of me and... as I took the cigarette from my lips and put it in hers...
I caught a thin bat's squeak of sexuality inaudible to any but me.
Thanks.
You've been here before.
Nanny reported it.
We both thought it very odd of you not to stay to tea with me.
That was Sebastian.
You seem to let him boss you around a good deal.
You shouldn't.
It's very bad for him.
Here we are.
I wouldn't have put it past Sebastian to have started dinner.
Thank you.
"Hello, darling."
"Thank you, Wilcox."
"Well darling, I've collected your chum."
Wait.
"If these beans create...portals, why not just pick one and go home?"
Why the compass?
HOOK:
Because there aren't any more beans.
"Whatever story you think you know, my dear, is most certainly wrong."
"There was a guy named Jack and a cow, and something about evil giants with a treasure and a golden goose."
Or harp.
Sounds like a lovely tale.
But the truth's a little bit more gruesome.
"The giants grew the beans, but rather than use them for good, they used them to plunder all the lands."
"Jack and his men fought a terrible war, defeating all but one of the evil giants."
The beans were destroyed by the giants as they died.
"If they couldn't have the magic, then nobody could."
Certainly very bad form.
Evil giants who made magic portal beans.
Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?
Because one giant survived.
The strongest and most terrible of them all.
Now we'll have to get past him to...
The magic compass.
Indeed.
"The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass."
Now it will guide us to your land.
"Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass."
"Once we get it, we steal the ashes from her, then we're on our way."
How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
"All I need is a ride back,"
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
EMMA:
Then we better start climbing.
You want a sandwich?
"Oh, I'd love a salami and cheese."
"Too bad, he loved peppers and meatballs."
Incoming!
That'll work!
"Can't talk now, Carl, this is a two-hand job."
Anything look familiar?
"The stop signs do, but I think they use the same ones all over town."
"All right, where is the last place you remember parking it?"
I had a dentist appointment on Wednesday.
"I've driven it since then, but that's the last place I remember parking it."
"Okay, any idea what clubs you went to last night... goth, gay?"
Elks?
There's a couple of stamps on my hand.
"You don't have a black light, do you?"
"No, I don't."
"For crying out loud, Victoria, think."
"Hey, if you're going to bark at me, you can take me home and I will get Mike to help me look."
My fiancé is not your personal lo jack.
"Besides, mom probably has him planting corn by now."
"All I know is, he's a lot more patient and understanding than you."
That's because he hasn't played car-and-seek every Sunday since you got your learner's permit.
Can we at least assume it's still in Illinois?
"You know, when I told Mike about misplacing my car, he was not mean or judgmental."
"Mm-mm, no, he was firm but fair, just like daddy."
"Victoria, focus."
"Anything around here ring a bell... bars, restaurants, maybe one of your shoes laying in the road?"
"Both shoes are accounted for, but keep your eyes peeled for a hair scrunchie and a black laced bra."
"All right, I'm done."
"Okay, we'll just wait for your car to get booted and towed like last time."
"No, last time we drove around,"
I eventually remembered I parked it in the garage.
- Barns?
"- Yes, yes."
Those too.
I want to starve in a garret.
Wear me hair long.
Get egg on a flowing tie.
"In other words, be a genius."
Ah
- But no.
"No, the world sneers at me talent... and instead it gives me... gold."
"Oh, my poor boy."
"You seem to have all the comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-"
"A comfortable cabin, golden evidence of more comforts to come... and a beautiful lady."
You will oblige me greatly if you will assist... in making this incident as painless as possible.
"Come on, get it over with."
What are you going to do?
Do?
"My dear man, nothing at all."
The important thing is-
"We're going back by water, Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe."
You may destroy our burros.
"As I was saying, the important thing is to prevent you people... from filing claim on this charming site before we do."
And how do you expect to do that?
"Oh, very easily- by leaving you here and destroying all means of transportation."
"- If you can't get back to Dawson to file, why, then..."
"- you can't get back to Dawson to file, now can you?"
So we'll file instead.
"If you want to work the mine while we're gone... you're very welcome to do so, of course."
We'll be glad to recompense you for your trouble when we get back.
"Meanwhile we'll take with us your gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera."
"It would be a grave error to leave behind... the implements for building another canoe, wouldn't it?"
Kali!
I respond to anything beginning with R.
"When I was at school, we had this teacher called Mr Archer, he was a lovely man, and he just couldn't say my name and my friends just made my name longer for him so that my nickname"
"at school was ""Royconsangonzales"", just to Mr Archer."
"He was like, ""That's not how you say it"", but he wasn't sure."
"And they were like, she's got a fada over the O, that turns it into ""roik""."
"Hang on, there's a what over the O?"
"It's a fada, it's like a hyphen."
It's like a little dash like you get in French like a greve or....
Yeah.
Tell me what the O means?
The O?
Yeah.
In O'Hanlon.
Why do so many Irish names have an O in front of them?
It's just an expression of surprise.
"Roisin, I want to know about when you went on a meditation retreat and you sang an Elton John medley, is that correct?"
Yes.
I'm quite an anxious person and I think I'm always at a sort of low level of panic.
Are you really?
"Yeah, just naturally."
"Cos I would put you down as a happy-go-lucky, smiley, chatty, nice person."
Come off it.
Are you a proper freaker?
"I think I'm quite an anxious, quite..."
SHE JIBBERS
"I think I'm quite an anxious person at heart, like, overall anxiety, and it's fine, it just makes me smoke quite a lot and eat my way through it."
"I went on this retreat, and basically,"
I wanted to go to stop smoking.
"And on the first day I got there, you sort of get introduced to people and this couple said, ""We've been married for ten years"
"""and we're here just to salvage our marriage."
"That's why we're here""."
"And I was like, ""Oh, right, I'm smoking 20 a day"
"No treatment, no cure."
Gillian knows this is what she has to look forward to?
And she also has an uncle who died of it.
So it's hereditary.
"It sometimes runs in families, but we don't know if it's genetic."
Could be the whole family was exposed to the same environmental factor.
How much time does she have?
"She's at the very early stages, but it's a very aggressive disease."
A very aggressive patient.
"- What, she's dying?"
- Her brain's dying.
"By the end of the year, she'll be helpless, and she's terrified of being alone."
So she kills the one person who might have cared for her?
"Oh, you mean Laura?"
Who left her waiting in the hospital because she was too busy playing her violin?
Gillian has no other family?
Closest thing is Reinhardt.
A man she didn't trust enough to call when she was in trouble.
"Now that she's married to him, she must think he has to take care of her."
I can't see an egomaniac like Reinhardt giving her sponge baths.
We need to open her eyes.
We can wait in here.
They'll call us when they have enough guys to fill in the lineup.
Where did you dredge up this eyewitness?
"Um, someone who lives in the apartment next door overlooking the opera house."
"Oh, by the way, congratulations on your marriage. / Thank you."
"Kind of sudden, wasn't it?"
The timing was Gillian's idea.
A testament to her unequivocal belief in my innocence.
I'll see how the others are doing.
"Gillian, she had her eye on you for quite a while."
A testament to her good taste.
"- There is no basis for you doing that, there is no precedent for you doing that, and I'm not gonna get bullied to getting up on the stand."
"And for the record, Your Honor, the court cannot make any inferences based on me choosing not to go up there."
Then how about I put Mike Ross on the stand?
I notice he's sitting right over there.
"I don't have a subpoena for him, but I'm sure we can whip one up."
"And when he gets up there, we'll see if he tells the truth or not."
- Your Honor...
- That's enough.
"Your Honor, I violated the agreement."
Then I have no other choice but to dismiss this case.
♪♪
♪♪
Hey.
You okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why?
"First, the way you were when I walked in last night and then how you were after I told you about the subpoena."
"Well, I was just worried about Louis, Rachel."
"He's being sued, and I feel partially responsible because I'm the one who admitted in front of the associates that he was wrong."
And I've known you long enough to know when you're not being straight with me.
Harvey told me he's involved with somebody last night.
- Is it serious?
- Yes.
And that's the news you should have seen coming.
- Yes.
"- Donna, you're only human, and I know you have this amazing ability to read people, but... some things are gonna slip by even you once in a while."
"This one didn't slip by, Rachel."
I didn't see it coming 'cause I didn't want to see it.
♪♪
"I've always said that I want Harvey to be happy, and I do."
But it bothers you.
And I hate that it does.
Mm-hmm.
"I'm sorry I was all,""Oh, my God, Oh, my God."""
'Cause usually I'm very good in a crisis.
But I just started thinking about if anything happened to you and I don't know what I would do.
"It's okay, we're both okay."
"It's just that grace under fire is a very important quality and I don't want you to think that I'm lacking in it, because we might encounter all sorts of crisis when we're away together, like, at college."
"Oh, my God, is that blood ?"
I faint at the sight of blood.
"Oh, no, no, no, it's just glitter."
Taylor.
I'm okay.
"All that stuff we put on the table just now, let's, uh, let's talk about it later, okay ?"
"Right, yeah."
"That's probably a good idea, when, you know, the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble."
"Um, I'm going to call Kirsten and Sandy."
Where's my jacket ?
"Oh, gross."
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the Apocalypse or whatever."
I got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods and...
A space heater...
I'm not...
Hey... getting good reception here.
I'm going to step out in the hall.
Okay...
"Yes, Orange County, as you probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities, but power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
As more information comes in we'll relay it to you.
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
So we got our marching orders and our staying put orders.
So no one's to leave the plaza unless they have to.
"The desire, the will, and the strength to destroy and dominate."
What are you gonna do with my blood?
"Angel, don't you worry your pretty little head about that."
You keep your end of the deal and I'll keep mine.
Anything you'd like to say about what you've heard so far?
We've reunited you with your daughter.
I only ask that you translate Hunter recordings that we've intercepted.
No.
"I'll start then, shall I?"
Hunters have been sourcing lithium.
Enriched lithium is a fuel source for nuclear warheads.
"And Musa has been working with Viktor Karp, and arm's dealer who has access to long-range missiles."
All right so far?
"Well, you seem to have it all worked out."
What do you need from me?
Cockroaches are extraordinary creatures.
Very hardy.
They're extremely adaptive.
They molt.
They chirp.
They have shells.
And they can survive a nuclear explosion.
Hunters molt.
They click.
They have shells.
And they have nuclear weapons.
"I think that you,"
"Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive."
You have no idea what you're talking about.
"We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?"
By turning her against her own kind?
- No.
There will be four short papers on assigned text.
Be prepared to also discuss these in class.
"Now, some of my students from last term can tell you how important these oral discussions are... in... what, what?"
!
"Yes, I have breasts."
"They CANNOT, however, be the subject of one of your papers."
Now...
Hey!
A double play!
"Of course I'll miss spending time with her, but I feel proud that I..."
"I stood up for what I believe, I still think I was right, it could have worked."
"Obviously not with her, but..."
I think it was an invaluable experience.
"- You're in bad shape, aren't you?"
"- Well, I just told you..."
May I make a suggestion?
"Put all your valuable possessions, things you REALLY care about, in storage."
Why?
"Trust me on this, you don't want anything breakable in your apartment right now."
"Henry, Henry, I just told you, I'm fine."
"Really, I'm actually using all of this in my next book."
Especially glass.
"I miss him, Claire, but I don't think he's ready for me."
"I still can't get used to seeing you like this, it's sort of unnerving."
Thanks.
"Makes you just like the rest of us now, doesn't it?"
You'll see.
"Now you'll spend an extra hour in front of the mirror, every morning and every night, as if it'll make any difference."
Now you'll be the one to walk into a room and scan it for who looks better than you and who doesn't.
"And as the years go by, the numbers change... until, one day, you walk into a room and you're the last woman ANY man notices."
Rose?
My God!
"Sensing their hostility, he's meeting with the chaperones in their inner sanctum."
"Where are you going to put her, Mrs. Rogers?"
Um... who could double up?
The countess has stacks of room.
We can all move in with the countess.
"But... well, I've got..."
"I've got the biggest room, but you can't all move in with me."
I've got the biggest bed as well.
"I presume that she... she would have her own room, being of her wealth and status."
"Yeah, that's what I would have said."
What would you think if we made this into a bedroom?
"I mean, I don't know how often you use it."
About as often as you use the billiard room.
It's quite nice to have this room.
Yeah.
One option is just not having her.
It absolutely stinks that somebody walks in and everybody has to shuffle around like... crabs.
There are eight other summer parties going on;
you'd be honored that she'd chosen ours.
"You'd go, ""Brilliant, wonderful, let's make every effort we can to ensure that she has a nice time."""
I'll leave it in your capable hands.
Yeah.
Okay?
Okay.
She's got birds in there.
"A bit strange, isn't it?"
No one else brought pets with them.
We could let the cat out.
"Right, everyone, um, just to officially announce that Miss Samuel will be joining us, um, to stay for the remainder of our stay."
"And there's been some, um, accommodation rearranging."
And what we've... we're in the process of organizing is for Miss Hopkins and Miss Francesca to move into the countess's bedroom and the countess to move into Miss Hopkins' bedroom.
And then Miss Samuel will have Miss Francesca's bedroom.
But you'll soon find how little that counts for.
"I'm not referring to myself, but there's a lot of assholes out there."
"Less up here than in the city, but it's all relative."
You say it yourself.
You don't see anybody.
You have no friendships.
And you have ruined every relationship in which you ever could have found meaning.
Who?
Huh?
Associates?
Sycophants?
Who the fuck needs pissants like that?
Good riddance.
Me.
Mom.
"You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, as usual."
Why do you assume that she never talked to me?
"Oh, I'm sure she was only too eager to fill your head with some inane, fictitious bullshit."
"But one thing I know for a fact, you only got one version of events told from the perspective of a very sad, very lonely, pathetic woman."
You insult again.
This is my mother you're talking about.
And?
Go on.
You talk about her like she's some leech that sucked you dry.
"Yeah, well, she would have done, given half the chance."
Her and everyone else.
"You know, she is my biggest regret, hmm?"
"The strongest and saddest proof that you cannot change anyone, and that your first instinct about them will always be right."
"Yeah, well, that just proves that you yourself can't be changed, either."
"Yeah, well, much to my chagrin, I prove my own point."
I always try to lead by example...
"To show everyone how I can put aside preconceptions and find new feelings, new ideas."
He's displaying signs of paranoia.
I think you're overstating things just a little.
You can't allow him to use our antimatter.
"What do you suggest I do, start a mutiny?"
You have to speak with Phlox.
Ask him to run a full exam on the Captain.
What good would that do?
"If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical grounds to relieve him of command."
Relieve him?
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened, but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before their reactor's brought on-line?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know that he's endangering this ship and our mission.
What is it?
A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
Tactical alert.
"Captain Archer, report to the bridge."
It's an Insectoid... three bio-signs aboard.
They're firing!
They're moving away at full impulse.
Pursuit course.
Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.
No effect.
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.
"Torpedoes, maximum yield."
Target their impulse manifolds.
Has he talked to you quite a lot about that?
"Oh, no, not really, but he didn't have to, because back then it was really normal, in the '80s, to pick up the phone and someone go, ""I'm going to kill you,"
"""I'm going to cut your throat."" And I went, ""Dad, it's for you."""
Cos the revolution was what - in '79?
The revolution was '79.
We were already in Britain on a bit of a sabbatical.
My dad was a journalist.
"So, we were living in Britain for a bit."
"And then, the revolution happened and my dad went back to Iran and we planned to move back."
"So, you were a little girl now?"
Six or seven or something?
I was six.
"You see, they wanted my dad."
He was on - like many artists - on the list of people to kill.
And then there was an assassination plot that was foiled by Scotland Yard in 1984.
"What it's meant, though, with MY stand-up..."
"Like, I'll get trolled on Twitter and I'll get really upset, and my dad will go, ""How many people wrote you nasty messages?"""
"And I'll say, ""Oh, about 20, and one of them said I've got fat legs."""
"And my dad will go, ""Oh, that's so sad - 20."
"""That means your career isn't going very well."
"""When 5,000 people hate you, then I think you're a success."""
"Then he starts, like, showing off, lauding it over me."
"And he was going, ""You know, in Iran, after the revolution,"
"""tens of thousands of people spilled into the street"
"""chanting for my execution."
"I was so famous."""
"He looks at me like I'm a piece of shit on his shoe and he goes, ""Look at you - nobody even wants to kill you."
LAUGHTER
"""It's embarrassing."
"""My friends, they say to me, 'Is Shappi dead yet?"
'
"""I say, 'No, she's not very ambitious.'"""
Fourteen?
Right.
Where is the storage hold?
What do you want down there?
We need some laser transfer linkage.
I don't know that we have any.
That is what I'm going to find out.
"Can you tell me, please?"
"Don't mind him, he lacks affection."
Blue corridor.
Go down past the filtration plant and it's the next door on the left.
Thank you.
Be back in a moment.
Muffled voices:
"""You are always snooping"""
"""I am not snooping"" ""Yes you are"""
"""I am not!"
"Now I want to know what it is"""
It's Dortmunn.
"Someone among us is determined that this mission should fail, and frankly, I can't even guess at a motive."
Try greed.
It's usually reliable.
"When you set out on your return journey, you were carrying something extremely valuable."
"As he said earlier, if the neutrotope could be sold, it would make a man wealthy beyond imagining."
"Well, it obviously wasn't beyond the imagination of someone here."
I just meant that we were taking an enormous risk by entrusting it to a stranger.
- It never crossed my mind that any of us.
"- But it did cross your mind, didn't it?"
"A temptation, you said, even for those of us with our lives at stake."
The value of the neutrotope is all the motive you need to look for.
"Now I don't pretend to know the whole plan, but parts of it seem fairly clear."
"The damage to the communications centre, that isolated the ship."
They were honking because I forgot to bring the bedroom back in.
"So I'm going down the freeway with the bedroom over the other lane, people are honking."
"The way I discovered this is when the highway patrolman was,"
"""Do you know why I'm writing you this ticket?"""
So I get down to the RV park that day.
All I wanted to do was just get in the shower.
So you go to hook up the sewer for the poo and the pipe burst and poo went everywhere.
No!
"So then they call the fire department, Hazmat gear, they come in, they clean up all the poo, which is spectacular."
"That wouldn't happen in this country, by the way."
"It'd be, ""Get on with it yourself."""
I've come to England three times and you're right - they'd tell me to eff off.
"But in America, they have to put on the Hazmat suits, they clean your poo up for you."
How nice.
What a wonderful country.
"And then afterwards, I do what any good American does -"
I go to Walmart to buy another sewer hose and I hook it back up.
"I go to take another shower and I hear bang, bang, bang on the door."
"I'm just like, ""Leave me alone!"" Bang, bang, bang!"
"I throw a towel on and go out and go,"
"""What's wrong?"
"What's going on?"""
"He goes, ""Your RV, man, it's flooding."""
"And there's, like, water."
"The pipes had burst underneath the RV, flooded all of our clothes, all of our belongings, and I saw red and I just said, ""I will burn this mother-effer to the ground!"""
And it was that day I decided to sell it.
It was poo-inspired.
Surely it should not drive with the bedroom out.
Right!
You would think so.
"If this was a Volkswagen or a Volvo, something would have kicked in with a beep-beep!"
"My car, which is German, beeps at me as soon as I look at it, like I've done something dangerous."
"And each day, it begins anew."
Moments.
"Life is made of them, much the same as a great mosaic."
A thousand little pieces that make one great image.
But the most important thing in life is...
"And today, we open the door to breath with a shared yoga group experience."
"Our instructor, Salvadore, is running late."
So I will touch on tomorrow.
"It is very important that you are here before sunrise, as well as not eat or drink anything too late tonight."
"As you pursue knowledge, as well as your own individual animal spirits, it is very important that you strictly follow your programs."
Failure to do so will definitely take you off your path and lead you away from the answers you seek.
"I'm sorry, monsieur Marcel."
"Why is it so important for us to be on time tomorrow when Pablo, the yoga guy, is running late today?"
"Quiet, please."
The yoga teacher's punctuality is not your concern.
You are to be here before sunrise.
Why is it so important for us to be here on time tomorrow?
I'm not understanding.
Why can't we eat or drink tomorrow?
"What, is he gonna probe us?"
Who is that?
"Oh, my."
Damn!
I guess that's the yoga guy.
This just gets better and better.
"Well, hello."
I am so sorry I'm late.
I just swam from the other side of the island.
"Please, allow me to put on something more proper before we can begin."
Thank God.
There we go.
Much better.
"Dante had Phan's cousin killed in retaliation for Dante's nephew, so I don't know that they're ready to let that go."
Would it work if they wanted it to?
If they got over their differences?
It might.
If they wanted it to happen.
Will you think about that might happen?
How you might influence that outcome?
Maybe broker that for us.
"Yeah, I'll think about it."
Stay in touch.
You're brokering my dope deals for me now?
Don't ask for a fee...
Why are you telling me this?
We're looking at how the future might unfold and... hoping we can avoid any unnecessary violence.
Seriously.
I'm serious.
"I'm not gonna into business with the Vietnamese, I can tell you."
The alternative is a prolonged turf battle with an enemy who's got endless recruits ready to do a cheap hit.
"You'll be so busy watching your back, you won't be able to do any business."
You just don't have the numbers to stay on top.
- And neither do you.
"- Exactly the point, my friend."
I'm gonna be fine.
"It's not just the Vietnamese you've got to worry about, it's every other small-time wannabe who's been waiting for a vacuum like this."
"Plus, you've got the Americans, now."
- You're gonna be surrounded.
- What do you know about them?
"They're moving in, buying up all the product they can find."
They're out to steal business from you.
"Yeah, that's not news."
I also know they're talking to the Viets.
"If they decide to partner up, you're suddenly the odd man out."
Aglaé?
- Coming!
- Monsieur Simon has arrived.
There are those who'd rather be dead than red.
And those who'd rather be red than dead.
"At that very moment, Glucksmann shakes his ritzy coiffured mane, and shouts his message:"
"""No neutron gale in Bloomingsdale!"""
"In the end, we arrive at the same point:"
"Order, discipline, social progress."
The gap between your theorists and ours is smaller than you think.
"Wait and see, look at Italy..."
"To each their own theories, that works best in practice."
"I'm not being critical, it must feel delicious bankrolling stage productions to, on one hand, entrap the bourgeoisie, and on the other, plant bombs under their living room floors."
But let's be fair - everyone is entitled to a slice of the cake.
We are the guests of a lady.
This is a first class lounge.
Your bladder's not big enough to pee in all four corners.
Let the little children come to me.
"Simon, you destroyed my table plan again."
You're a real ruffian.
You can't even hold a conversation with a fascist.
Simon!
"Only a man of your stature knows that there is revolution in ""The Seagull""!"
In a seagull there is truth.
We need a real lake on stage.
Give me the means.
"At the end of the show, we open the flood-gates, and enjoy the bourgeois taking the plunge!"
I'm getting nothing out of it.
It's some hard row to hoe.
I'm hoeing.
I grease their cogs.
I oil my piston.
"What are your orders, colonel?"
"Well, my orders are that corporal mansfield stops rehearsal to take a drive in the park with colonel fisk."
"You know, you're losing some of the color out of those cheeks of yours."
Jim!
Yeah?
Jim!
Listen-vanderbilt's got the supreme court to declare our erie deal a fraud!
He's got warrants out for the arrest of you and dan drew!
What's the matter with our lawyers?
Have they turned on us?
"We had our whole firm there, mr."
"Fisk, but we were overruled."
The only time you're overruled is when you're outsmarted!
"Well, if vanderbilt's gonna raid the office with a bunch of deputy sheriffs, he'll get that $10 million and the erie books!"
You get back to that courthouse as quick as you can!
"Nick, you come along with me."
"Luke, round up all our soldier boys and march them double-quick time down to the chambers street ferry."
Tell them not to shoot until they see the red in vanderbilt's eyes.
"What are you gonna do, jim?"
"Washington crossed the delaware, we're going to cross the hudson."
"Once we get over to jersey city, we're in another state, and we can laugh at the new york courts."
Uncle daniel- open up the pantry right away.
Vanderbilt's got a warrant out for both of us.
We've got to hustle this money out of here.
I'll get a wagon you can hide the money in.
I'll have it waiting in the alley.
Fine.
"Arthur, go down to the cellar, get some gunnysacks."
"Listen, son, keep a sharp lookout for the enemy."
Let me know as soon as they start to charge.
"Yes, sir."
"Please, mister, what are you going to do with my wagon?"
OK.
Would you like the sequel?
"Yes, please."
Does it have a happy ending?
This is getting quite dark.
"Well, you have to fast-forward a bit to..."
To now.
"Well, no... ..about five years ago, where I'd cleaned myself up."
"I don't take drugs any more, I don't drink, I don't smoke,"
I very rarely breath.
"And I live in Kent, in the country now, where nothing much happens."
And I was writing one of my lovely books and I had terrible writer's block.
"And then I heard this car screech to halt, just down the lane where I live, where nothing ever happens."
"And then police sirens, and this is very exciting."
"So, the next day, I walked the dogs down the lane, and I could see the tyre marks there, into the ditch, where this car had turned over."
"And as I walked past, a little bit of white folded paper caught my eye in the ditch."
It was a little bit of paper in one of those little mini cellophane envelopes.
"So, I picked it up and went for a walk in the woods with the dogs."
"The neighbours had told me that noise was some ne'er-do-well youths from Ashford who'd been joy-riding and crashed the car into a ditch, and then the police had come and I thought, obviously, they ditched their stash,"
"when they heard the police, in this ditch."
Right.
"They, literally, ditched it."
Yeah.
I then picked it up and had it in my hand.
"And I thought, ""Well, because I've got writer's block,"
"""maybe this is God's way of helping me through it."
"""This is a gift from God."""
LAUGHTER
"So, I did what anyone would do - I took it home and I dried it out in the Aga..."
LAUGHTER
..and snorted the lot.
Did you?
But we're gonna get you all prepped now.
So that we can put them in as soon as they get here.
"When you wake up, you're gonna be a brand-new boy with brand-new parts."
I can't believe this is it.
The thought of us getting to live our lives outside of this hospital...
"Don't get me wrong, Miranda, I love our chats."
But it'll be nice not to see my face every day?
So freakin' nice.
He's just a kid.
Yep.
Let's go get his organs.
"Am I hallucinating, or is that a really high ponytail?"
You're not hallucinating.
"But once your brain starts to herniate, I can't promise anything."
So I'm really circling the drain here?
"You should just take my organs right now, help that poor kid."
"Oh, they found him organs."
They're flying them over right now.
He's gonna be fine.
Did you know that they let you choose?
Hanging or lethal.
"You get to pick your poison, literally."
Which one would you choose?
"Medically speaking, which one's..."
Better?
"Well, with hanging, your neck breaks, which severs your spinal cord, which causes your blood pressure to drop to nothing, and you lose consciousness."
You don't actually die for several minutes.
"And with lethal injection, they inject an anesthetic first, which puts you to sleep, and then a paralytic, which stops your diaphragm and your lungs, and then potassium, which stops your heart."
"Was, um..."
Was I a match?
"Yes, you were."
Can I help you with something?
"And Charles and I said, ""No way."
"""We don't want to have anything to do with that."
"""That's such a travesty of marriage."
"""Just go ahead with it and have this baby."
"""It's going to be all right."
"""Let him keep his name if you want,"
"""or have him take your name."
"Don't worry about that."""
"And I also have to say that you had to recognize it right at the beginning from Harriet's point of view as a very true love, an immense love... and that it would be a lifelong love,"
which I think it has been.
"And you can't judge that, because that kind of love is on the side of life and is a good thing."
"My uncles, Abbot and Willie, never bought that romantic love affair idea."
They hated my father and refused to ever even mention his name.
"Maybe if he'd married my mother, it would have been different."
"But even as her husband,"
Lou would not exactly have been their idea of an Episcopalian gentleman.
"My mothers' sisters, however, would talk with me about him."
Did the family feel that she needed to get away from... from everybody for a while?
I don't think our family had anything to do with it.
"I mean, I think it was your father who determined that Harriet should go."
- Ask her sometime.
- Really?
But she... but you didn't think she should come to the vineyard with you to live?
I couldn't at the time.
I wasn't in a position to have her.
"And she didn't want to come to New York with me, 'cause I told her that she could come to New York with me."
"And she chose not to, which was fine."
I don't...
"And Abbot came to me, and he said,"
"""I think she should have an abortion""."
I said abs...
I said no.
"Socrates was right, the noble cause is to resist no more."
What do you mean?
We've been pretending for too long.
"Pretending that we don't care about life, and yet we cling to it."
We try and preserve it at the expense of others.
"If we're so nihilistic, why do we cling to life with such desperation like everyone else?"
But we're not like everyone else.
No.
Let's deprive them of the explanations they so crave.
Let's prove how little this life means.
Why are you talking like this?
To take your own life is the only true response to the universe.
Why don't you join me?
Let's do the one pure thing we can.
Let's stay free.
"Cause of death 1A, stab wounds to the back."

"Sin is sin, even if committed by kings."
Even they can not do everything with impunity.
Years and decades passed.
The country's life got dynamic again.
"The king, as if he wanted to make amends for his sins, the deceit, the destruction, has devoted his life, to clean the dust of the old-fashioned ideals out of the country."
But I did not find ...
I could not find my place in this new world.
"Like the ghost of past time, I wandered on strange streets and squares."
"And strangers, kept out of my way, as if I was a ghost."
A past era's images floated in front of me.
Sword against sword.
Lance againt lance.
What need is for that now?
When a single miserable scrub can sweep away entire armies with his gunpowder?
What do we need the old virtues for?
What do we need me for?
Then one last time a satanic fury rose up in me.
"I just remember a Black Knight, who beat everyone."
Blood punded in my head.
"To hell with you, vile!"
"To hell with you all, who smear with dirt the holy ideal, the pure faith of people!"
To hell with the whole world!
Let all perish!
Down with this flashy comedy world!
"Oh, my Lord."
We yearn for brightness and purity.
But our vile passions yet so often smear with mud our once clear goals.

So give me your account number.
"Although I cannot return the full amount to you at once,"
I will slowly repay you.
"You'll never be able to, so just forget it!"
I will just search for a side job so that I can earn more.
Side jobs are prohibited here.
"Then you must keep this a secret, okay?"
I see you are trying to use this as an excuse to get close to me.
But you are not my type.
Do you want me to buy you a mirror as well?

I've never met such a person before.

It's composed of people with international Master and Doctoral degrees.
Don't even think of underestimating the importance of martial arts simply because you don't understand it as well as we do.
Ah... really...

I can't let you continue teasing me.
I will not allow you do things that only pleases you.
Your physical condition is similar to the one of dark horse.
Looks like the dark horse is going to fall.
"Just tell me your account, okay?"
I already said there's no need to.
"No, I definitely must pay you back."
Why are you so stubborn?
Because that is the price that saved my father.
"To me, he is the most precious person."
That is why I can't just accept it.
"Even if I may suffer and feel tired, it is something that I must do."
"Quickly tell me your account, so that I can pay you back."
Still being stubborn.
What do you think I should do?
My wife.
"All right, sit by the phone."
I'll call you if I need you.
"Now that I've seen your company in operation, Mr Moravia,"
I do not think much of the men you hire.
"I can see why you might think that, Mr Hansen."

"Oh, man, my head is going round and round."
Phew.
Everyone was e-mailing and everyone was so excited.
We're all going to go up on Monday and tell Robert.
"We think he might already know, but he might not, so we'll at least be able to break the news to him ourselves on Monday."
- That'll make him feel better too.
- Yeah.
"Oh, I can sleep better."
Finally!
Wow.
That is so awesome.
That was the best feeling in the world.
It was...
"I don't know, I don't think there's a word for how good it felt to deliver that news."
"You know, in this line of work, even the small relationship I've had with it, it's just all bad all the time, like fighting with courts and prosecutors and fighting to get information you need and to get results."
And it's just such an amazing feeling to finally have some good news to tell somebody for once.
"The moment that I heard that I got a stay,"

"In the past, I've encouraged them to ask questions, but we don't have time for that now."
I need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders.
"It won't be a problem, sir."
"I thought what happened with T'Pol might have been a isolated incident, but I'm not so sure now."
Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship that could've helped us.
I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission.
You're in command while I'm on the surface.
You answer to me and me alone.
"is that understood, Major?"
"Perfectly, sir."
That'll be all.
"Can we talk to you for a minute, sir?"
What is it?
I'd like you to go to Sick Bay with Phlox.
Do I look sick to you?
Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
That's right.
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?
We'll be light years from here before the Xindi respond to it.
We don't know how far away their ships are.
"If we send that message, we'll be taking a hell of a risk."
We can't afford to play it safe anymore.
This mission is too important.
"This mission is to save Earth, not an alien hatchery."
"Captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days."
You've shown signs of obsessional behavior and paranoia.
"If it'll make the two of you feel better, I'll go to Sick Bay for a complete physical... as soon as that reactor's on-line."
"That's not good enough, sir."
Phlox has the authority to order you to Sick Bay.
"T'Pol's manipulating you, isn't she?"
The position requires a maturity which is beyond Laura.
I sensed she wasn't ready.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Where did you sense that, maestro?"
Behind the racks in the costume department?
Some of the wardrobe people saw you hiding there.
They thought you were arguing.
And you take the word of drug addicts?
Are you denying that you were there?
I'm saying I wasn't hiding.
I ran into Laura.
"We were both looking for our concert clothes, and she started pestering me again about being first violin."
Are you sure that you weren't pestering her?
- She was very attractive.
"- Good lord, she was a child."
"Yeah, all the more reason for you to get angry at her when she wouldn't give in to you even when you were dangling a promotion."
You think I need inducements to get what I want?
"On any night, I can point my baton at any woman in the audience, and she's mine."
"Well, whatever little stick that you pointed at her..."
We think that she swatted it down with the threat of a lawsuit.
You accuse me of murder?
"You come here, you imbeciles, and distract me from my art!"
And subject me to your slander!
"Well, well, well, there's that famous temper we heard about."
Punks.
Get out.
"Yeah, we don't want to be in the way when your lady friend gets back."
What are you talking about?
I told you I don't want any more distractions.
I guess those are your makeup sponges then.
I don't require makeup.
"When I look up, you'll be gone."
I'm going to attack Jolbon.
The King has already consented.
He has delegated me his full authority.
Don't you know the state we're in right now?
The starving people are leaving Puyo.
You can't start a war.
Jolbon will collapse in due time.
We should just sit back and watch.
I agree.
Jolbon is in a crisis but they're still very strong.
"Now that Jumong is dead, they're powerless."
My assassin has killed Jumong.
Jolbon won't admit to it yet... but Jumong didn't attend any of the meetings.
He's dead for sure.
"If we attack right now, we can win."
We haven't even paid our soldiers.
We can't expect them to fight.
We can't guarantee victory unless the men are motivated.
You're right.
I'll pay their outstanding salary and distribute food to the people.
How will you do that when our finances are depleted?
"We can, if the nobles, ministers and the Jega pay for it."
"Your Highness, we haven't acquired much wealth."
How can we pay for the war?
We barely have enough to feed our families.
Forcing the nobles to pay will only make them angry.
Why go against the very foundation of Puyo?
"Our foundation is the people, not the nobles!"
The Foreign Minister and Tax Minister forced the people to pay their taxes... and the Court Minister conspired with merchants to gain great wealth.
You've been acquiring wealth while we were faced with a crisis.
"Your Majesty, I'm offended."
I never acquired wealth for my own self.
Good morning.
I seem to have lost my hat.
Is about this...this big.
Have you seen my hat?
"Run along, old man."
Without my hat?
There you go.
There...is...
is all right now.
They've gone.
The prison is in the northeast corner of the city.
My sources tell me is surrounded by metaphasic shields.
Can we find a way to beam through them?
The Mokra aren't familiar with transporter technology.
There is a periodic fluctuation in the shielïs energy pattern.
I'm working on a way to take advantage of it.
There's only one problem with that.
"If the Mokra detect us breaking through their shields, we'll be surrounded by soldiers in seconds."
"If we could beam in close enough to where the away team is being held, we might be able to get in and out of there before the Mokra had a chance to react."
We can't locate the away team from here.
The detention level is subterranean and the rock is too dense for our sensors to penetrate.
You'll have to look for them after you beam into the prison.
Too dangerous.
We can't risk beaming in.
We'll have to find another way that the Mokra won't detect.
"Sounds like a challenge for you, Mr. Kim."
You'd be welcome to use our transmitter if we still had one.
The Mokra confiscated it this morning.
Then I'll have to find my crew members myself.
I know two of them were arrested.
What about Neelix?
"He stayed inside with me, then got transported up to your ship."
"It's extraordinary, isn't it?"
It's another example of how the act of conservation is almost exactly the same as the act of poaching.
That what we're doing here for good used to be done by people to take the eggs to steal them for food.Absolutely.
Do you want to try and reach in and grab some?
"So what do I do, just lean?"
Just put one hand down behind her flipper there.
Now you can reach in - try not to touch her tail.
"Oops, got one."
"Try and grab them all out before she finishes laying, so..."
There's another one there.
It's hard.
Can I feel it?
"Yeah, look at that."
"Oh, it's warm and heavy."
"What's interesting is that you can make a little dimple in it - it's a little bit flexible, and that gives it a little bit of play when it falls into the nest."
"I can't see anything through the light, I can't see a shape."
You don't get any fresher than these.
How many was that?
95 total.
That's a good number.
She's starting to cover it up.
"She thinks the eggs are still there, so she's going to cover this up just like it was any other nest."
She's being extremely careful about how she puts her weight down.
"All the eggs are being kept in a sort of inner dome as it were, and then the looser sand will get..."
It is more sophisticated than just filling the hole.
"It is, she's building a whole shape around it."
"The other thing that's interesting is she's using her front flippers, throwing sand to backfill."
"Oh, we're getting showered in sand, straight in your face."
"Yes, it was."
Extraordinary - there's a lot of power in those flippers.
I'm gradually disappearing.
There you go!
That's about the size of it.
You and Alec Barr.
You really believe he did it?
"Twice, Charlie, twice."
This is where we found Jeanette Barr's body.
"You used to return to the scene of the murder, remember."
I often do it.
"You know, these investigations they can drag on for months, years sometimes."
"You tend to loose sight of what it's all about, how it all started."
"It started with a real man or woman, a body whose life has been beaten out of it."
"That's why we're here, for that man, or that woman."
"I know you've been talking to a priest, Jack, but sermons are not your style."
"If I don't get back on the case,"
Alec Barr is going to walk.
It's down to Bailey now.
She's not close enough.
"We've got one final crack at him, that's all."
And I need to take it.
So you want me to go and get you off the hook tell Bailey it was all down to me.
"Well, it was all down to you Charlie."
That woman's body wouldn't have been down there if you hadn't screwed up the first time around.
If you hadn't wanted to fit someone up instead of carrying out a proper investigation.
You might not think that you owe
"Michael King anything for those ten years, but you think about those two dead women."
"This is unfinished business, Charlie."
Let me finish it.
I have to point out that you are entitled to legal representation.
"Next time round, Superintendent."
"You, stand over there."
As far as this session is concerned
I am prepared to make a brief statement which you can consider on or off the record.
There's nothing 'off the record' in any investigation of mine.
"The people that actually did the crime that I was imprisoned for, they're still out there."
"Superintendent, you uphold the integrity of the police service."
"If you held one iota of doubt about my conviction, no officer would be more troubled by that than you, no officer would do more to right that wrong."
I plan to move on with my life.
"You won't move on, Steve, until you stop chasing me, and you start chasing your real enemies."
"For Christ's sake, son!"
What was in that phone'?
"We've got to take that crap from her, sir'?"
"You lied in court, you lied to your partner and you lied to me!"
"I didn't lie, sir."
It's just not appropriate to discuss an officer's private life.
I don't quiz you on yours.
What do you mean by that'?
I'm a married man.
"I know, sir, I just..."
"It isn't ""private"" when it's bandied about in a court of law!"
"What matters, sir, is whether I planted evidence."
Are there any forensic anomalies in respect of the money found at Demon's address?
No.
Are the Exhibit Officer's records inaccurate?
That is not the issue!
It's completely the issue.
I did not plant evidence.
If...
"- Hey, shut up."
Unless you want to get the fuck out yourself.
- You gonna kick me out just for asking the man a question?
"- Yeah, Pete, it's all right, it's a legitimate question."
Why would I drink coffee in a bar?
"- Because he fucking likes it, okay?"
Because it's his fucking business and not yours.
"Anyway, you're a degenerate lesbian."
Go pick on them.
"I could have you deported, you know that?"
I lied.
You look like Sal Mineo.
"Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all, except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded by some alien intelligence:"
"A spirit, if you will."
"Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum !"
And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away!
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Jesus Christ!
"88 doctors and all you can tell me, with all your bullshit is...."
"Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure."
I think of it as a shock treatment.
"As I said, it's a very outside chance."
"Would you just name it, for God's sake?"
What is it?
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
-No.
What about your daughter?
No.
Why?
Have you ever heard of exorcism?
"Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit."
"It's been discarded these days except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment."
"But it has worked in fact, although, not for the reasons they think."
It's purely force of suggestion.
"The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it, so in that same way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear."
You're telling me I should take my daughter to a witch doctor.
Is that it?
"Might your daughter remember, perhaps if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night?"
You are going to die.
"You, the person listening to me"
You are going to die.
"You, the person listening to me right now, are going to die."
"It's difficult even to imagine, isn't it?"
Take a moment and try to picture isn't it?
Take a moment and try to picture what it's like to not exist.
Take a moment and try to picture what it's like to not exist.
You can't do it.
what it's like to not exist.
You can't do it.
You're imagining darkness.
You can't do it.
You're imagining darkness.
Black.
You're imagining darkness.
Black.
But there will be no black.
Black.
But there will be no black.
"There will be no color,"
But there will be no black.
"There will be no color, because there will be no you"
"There will be no color, because there will be no you to perceive it."
because there will be no you to perceive it.
And your mind recoils to perceive it.
And your mind recoils from that idea.
And your mind recoils from that idea.
It's simply unable to conceive from that idea.
"It's simply unable to conceive of its own nonexistence,"
"It's simply unable to conceive of its own nonexistence, and so it concludes of its own nonexistence, and so it concludes that it's impossible, and so it concludes that it's impossible, that you'll live forever."
"that it's impossible, that you'll live forever."
There's nothing wrong with any of them.
"Well, we can't do anything about it."
"And I don't think that would help you, but we can..."
"Then, uh... jump over the..."
Then I'll continue my search for somebody who I can get married to and have children.
"In the meantime, I'll continue my bachelor monk-like existence."
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just keep it safe.
And you will use it.
"Ladies, thank you very much."
"Thank you, Mr. Foxsmith."
All right?
Next.
"It's her grandmother's wedding ring for a great number of years while she was happily married, so there's a huge amount of sentiment in this ring."
I think it must be the most precious thing I own.
"Oh, there she goes."
"All right, Lady D.?"
"We're very, very passionate friends and there has been a sexual tension between us."
"Practically, we can't go to the next step and so what we've done is we've sort of sacrificed all of that for each other's long-term happiness."
"Um, it would otherwise be a May-to-September, doomed-to-failure relationship."
Final preparations for the servants' dinner are underway.
The gentlemen are catching on fast.
"Sir, if you do get to serve the soup you have to be quite careful about how much to offer the guests because it can run out."
"So if it looks like everybody wants some of the soup, then it's usually just a ladle and a bit."
"Like a swan, Everett."
Like a swan?
"Upstairs, the ladies are dressing their maids for dinner."
"When serving drinks, is it to the right or the left shoulder?"
"Drinks are to the left, food is to the right."
Move.
"Here, you tie him up."
Take this thing off my back.
When I'm done.
"Sit down, sit down."
You keep doing what I say and you'll walk away from this.
Sit down.
Make transcripts available to the press and if anyone asks about Rebecca Ingram's absence just refer them to me.
Nilaa.
Can you excuse us for a moment?
Gage's campaign is releasing an attack ad tomorrow... about you.
About you attending the parkland mosque.
The parkland mosque?
I didn't go there to pray.
It made me sick that some crackpot imam was spewing that kind of hatred and violence in the name of Islam.
I went to tell everyone there he was distorting our religion.
And you can prove that?
"Even if I could, the damage is done, but it's the truth."
"I wanted to tell you, I did."
I guess I just convinced myself it happened so long ago no one would ever find out.
I'm sorry.
"I will, uh, I'll draft my letter of resignation and explain how I kept..."
I won't accept your resignation.
It's true you should have told me but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
"As much as I appreciate your loyalty,"
I can't let you do this.
"If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage."
Who knows?
Maybe even turn it into an advantage.
Gage will just keep playing the national security card.
"Oh, Rebecca could help us out there."
You'll still take a hit.
"That is, indeed, the most likely possibility."
"I've seen a lot of things, but this?"
"For the rats to get inside the ribs like that, it's... truly horrifying."
There's no better word for it.
Note... the contusions on the anterior sternal seventh and tenth ribs.
I catalogued those as defensive wounds.
That is understandable.
The pattern is also consistent with a cage being pressed up against that section of the torso.
It originated in the Middle Ages.
The cage would be filled with rats
"One end of it is heated, so the animals are forced to burrow into the body of the still-living victim."
There must be hundreds of bites.
Which indicates that Aldo Clemens was tortured for an extended period of time.
BOOTH:
McKinney said that Aldo went to buy heroin in Bellevue.
And if he's telling the truth...
He's telling the truth.
...then he wouldn't have any trouble finding product.
"It's low quality, but there's plenty of it and the dealers aren't too picky."
Has no one here read the report?
"Yeah, we read it."
Your close friend was tortured with rats.
That is something we need to discuss.
"Look, what do you say?"
I was hoping you would have the words.
"For something like this, there's not much you really can say."
We just... we move on.
"And we keep looking till we find this guy, and we don't stop."
"That was just right, Seeley, I knew you would have it."
I've been reading about this kind of torture.
They say it still exists in the Balkans and parts of the Middle East.
"Yeah, I heard of it."
-Mmm.
Hm?
"Gotta be a good book that, Ali."
You can't seem to put it down.
"Yes, it is."
"Erm...no, I was just thinking about this party I'm supposed to be going to tomorrow."
"What I'm going to wear, what everyone else will be wearing, whether I'll end up looking like a transvestite again."
-Don't know.
Did you tell us about this?
-Didn't I?
"Yeah, my dopey cousin Janice in Hove, who can barely string a sentence together at the best of times, rang me up the other day."
"I'm sure you met her once, she came in the store with her husband."
"They're one of these couples, whatever they've got on, they always clash."
He'll be in this shirt or something that's lime green and she'll be in turquoise.
The whole principle of tonal harmony is lost on them.
"And she said I've got to come to Brian's birthday bash 'cause this year it's the ""big four""."
She's not having any excuses.
"Actually, I wonder if I'm getting tonsillitis."
"Ali, will you get your arse out of the comfort zone for once and just make the effort?"
"You see, this is why you never meet anyone."
"And, I mean, it's not as if you're not good-looking."
"Yeah, you've got loads of great qualities that would be really attractive to a man."
You know....
"Well, you seem to have backed yourselves into a corner on that one, don't you?"
-Thank you very much.
"-No, it's just...."
I don't know.
"It wouldn't hurt you to be a bit more flexible sometimes, that's all."
"I mean, it's like this bloke Milly's seeing at the moment."
"Right, the one who works at the airfield."
You said you thought was getting really serious.
"Well, that all went a bit pear-shaped in the end as it happened."
"But, you know, he was a real nomad."
"And, you know, when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely."
And he would pack up and go.
And there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
"I mean, you know, as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life."
"You know, I mean, I often think I'm going to die in a plane or I'm going to die in an airport or, you know, die jogging without an identification on me."
"I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of his, the way he died."
But he was sort of a nomad at heart.
I remember now that Lou had a little carpet in the office that he'd roll out in the floor and sleep on when he was too tired to keep working.
Maybe he never felt settled anywhere.
He was a wanderer from the beginning.
His family moved 17 times in their first two years in America.
And it turns out Kahn wasn't even his real name.
It was Shmalowsky.
His father changed it in 1915.
"The only constant in Lou's life, was his wife Esther."
They were together from when he was 28 until he died.
"I don't know if he thought of her house as home, but it was certainly his base."
"I used to say to Lou,"
"""You know, Lou, if you would put some of your energy into making money, you'd be a billionaire."""
Money was something that was there.
"He would... he kept saying... and unfortunately, my daughter, who's also an artist, says the same thing."
"""But, Mother, it's only money."""
And he owned nothing.
He owned nothing.
He didn't believe in owning anything.
Books and neckties.
"Other than that, nothing."
He would not own...
I only saw Esther once.
It was at Lou's funeral.
She looked right through me.
That is to be determined by the Royal Repository?
"What happened, sir?"
What do you mean?
"Like you told me, they've been toying with the grading of the salt and making a profit on the tributary goods."
But they were following your orders!
"I've assigned them to collect the tributary foods, but I didn't tell them to lie about its quality and pocket the difference."
Have you no fear for he gods?
"I don't know why you are angry with me, but I'm victim as well."
Those men have caused terrible injury to the reputation of my business!
Do you think you can place the blame on them and get away with this?
I will not let you.
I will reveal the truth no matter what!
"Sure, do whatever you wish."
Stop!
Speak the truth!
This is injustice.
We were just following the baron's orders.
Where do you think you are to utter such a blatant lie!
Do you wish to die?
"No, sir."
It's the truth!
You still refuse to confess?
What are you waiting for?
Continue the torture until they speak!
Ju Tae-moon knows no bounds.
He bypassed the Court of Equity and made an arrest!
I'm not surprised.
"They made their move, an we cannot idly stand by."
"They think they're off the hook if they can cover up the crime involving tributary goods, but we have evidence of other crimes."
Do we really have a chance against them?
"I feel bad for the two men who are unjustly suffering, but this may give us a chance to make a forceful counterstrike."
All right.
Yeah.
"It's important they click in a specific way, an eccentric way."
"We didn't want them to get too ""pals-y"" with each other."
How did they work with each other?
I'm not sure they did.
"Hugh is frightened of children, and children are frightened of Hugh."
I don't know.
Kids acting.
I've never really done it before.
I didn't know what to expect.
I'm not a natural kid person.
Some people are.
They love them.
"They see a kid, and run over."
"Twirl them around their head, play with their train set or whatever."
I'm not that guy but we just took great trouble to find a kid that wouldn't annoy me.
"We found Nicholas, who had only done a couple of little TV things."
It was really kind of a gut-churning risk to take  because you knew that you're placing the responsibility of half of the movie  on the shoulders of someone who is not only 11 years old  but hadn't done this before.
This is for my mum.
Nicholas is a freak.
He's so focused  and grown-up about it.
He knows his lines and has immaculate instincts which is lovely.
It's not something you always find in grown-up actors.
I felt like I learned a lot from working with him  because he hadn't learned all the kind of acting tricks that grown-ups do.
"He's a pure, instinctive performer."
There's nothing better than that.
I love working with kids because I think they have what every actor wants  which is an ability to be in the moment.
They haven't developed  this brick wall of neuroses that most actors  find so difficult to jump over.
"It's nice to be around that sense of freedom, in terms of acting."
I'm not talking about this with you.
Just go.
Okay.
It's normal.
I'd be the same.
"You and I hadn't agreed on that camera, it was unexpected."
I don't like being in front of a camera myself.
I say the same as her when someone points a camera at me.
"I said: ""Please don't"""
but you filmed me anyway!
We all have our own thing...
"I feel best behind a camera, not in front of one,"
I don't feel natural or safe in front of a camera.
I am only myself when...
The village
"Chance is a wonderful thing, so I don't change a place too much because it would become a studio set."
"I do use decors, we modified the stairs a little, painted the walls, rebuilt the bridge."
But the advantage of a natural set is that you can't change it too much.
That labyrinth already existed.
"I find this house so strange, with the room in the corner."
"It's difficult to access, the man has difficulty."
Obviously the house was built when he was younger.
When he had no problem going up the step to get into the room.
"Today, he has a problem with that step."
"But it's his house, he's this woman's son."
I change or modify as little as possible when I work.
I paint things and I clean up.
"The lower level here was where the animals lived, the cows and sheep."
It was full of flies and mosquitoes.
We spent a fortune on disinfectant and insecticides.
We had to really clean it up before we could stand to work there.
I don't think it's a film about poverty.
That's not the subject.
I can't bear films where the poverty is so overwhelming that it blots out the real subject.
"In any case,"
What's up with the coat?
And where did you get that pie?
It's a Varrick ship.
You never know what you're gonna find.
There's a whole level filled with funhouse mirrors.
"Of course, there's also the cat-gator deck."
I miss that guy.
He really knew how to make a long trip interesting.
So have you told Korra yet about how you guys broke up and then you kind of started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?
You wanna keep it down?
I'm waiting for the right moment.
"Oh, Mako."
"You know, a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech."
You just have to do it fast and get it over with.
I hate it when you listen to me.
Fine.
Unalaq will be waiting for you.
You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.
"I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another 10,000 years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born!"
"Thanks, Mako."
Uh...
Um...
Did you want something?
"Uh, no, no, nothing."
"As soon as we reach the Southern water tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main port."
"Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the spirit world."
"Whoa, since when does my little brother want to crash or blast through anything?"
I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.
"We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad overaggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship."
Really?
And what do you suggest?
An attack like this calls for strategy.
"I was the one who sort of drove them to go off to Hawaii... for my own joy of having the four of you here, all to myself, while they're gone."
"Anyway, I want all of you to stay here during summer vacation."
The rich man in Hawaii means nothing to me.
I'm just grateful to be able to live with you like this... because of him.
"Now, go on, eat."
Grandma's watermelon is real tasty.
Thank you!
Grandpa used to play this so often...
I know I got old... and so did this organ.
I'll fix it.
I sure will.
Absolutely.
"You're saying ""absolutely"" again."
There were so many of them.
But they all died.
All of them died because of the atomic bomb?
No.
"Some of them died because of that, but there were some who died young... and some who died in places far away."
"This one, Natakichi... he was my seventh or eighth brother, I think."
He left home and became a shoemaker in Nagasaki.
After five years of apprenticeship... just as he was ready to open his own shop... he made a gross mistake.
What did he do?
Big Bro' Natakichi... eloped with the shoemaker's wife.
"Hey, why don't you go to bed?"
I'm not sleepy.
Then what happened to Natakichi?
My father was furious... and refused to let him come back home.
So Natakichi was obliged to build a small hut... far up in the mountain behind here... and make a scanty living by making shoes there.
They lived in a place... where two charred cedar trees... that had been struck by lightning... stood along the path they used in their escape.
But why live in a place like that?
While they were running away... the woman who was holding Natakichi's hand... saw those two trees... and said they looked like... they had committed a double suicide.
And that's why they built a hut at that place.
Her attention and affection?
"Would you like me to say it, Harvey?"
She loves you.
"At least part of her does, and maybe part of you likes it and doesn't want it to stop."
And we wouldn't even be discussing this if you had the courage to tell Donna the truth and let her move on.
"You know, for someone who didn't want to be involved in this anymore, you sure have a hell of a lot to say."
Then I'll say one more thing.
"If what I'm saying is wrong, then you won't have any trouble telling Donna in the morning."

"Mike, where the hell have you been?"
The motion to dismiss is tomorrow.
- I need to go over everything...
"- Oliver, I can't help you anymore."
What?
I said I can't work the case anymore.
Why the hell not?
'Cause Harvey found out.
"Shit, are you..."
"He's not gonna hand us in, but he did make it clear that if I spent another second on this case that he'll pull the plug on the whole damn thing."
I don't believe this.
"I mean, you come here and you drop this bomb on me the night before we go to court."
"Oliver, it's not a bomb."
You knew all along you were gonna have to do this on your own.
"I knew you wouldn't be up there next to me, but I was counting on you helping me to prepare."
- Oliver...
"- Son of a bitch, Mike!"
You know what happens to me!
"It happened last time, and now it's gonna happen tomorrow because you're goddamn hanging me out to dry!"
"You know what, Oliver?"
I have had it up to here with you blaming me for every choice that you make.
You knew there would come a time when you'd be up there by yourself when you agreed to take this case.
"Now, last time we were in this situation,"
"Look, much as I appreciate, you know, her very generous gesture, this is all a bit embarrassing."
"I mean, obviously, there's no way I could accept, or dream of keeping this money, so...."
"Well, you know, of course that's exactly what we thought you'd say."
Didn't I say we can absolutely trust Gil to do the right thing whatever happens?
"Oh, God."
"No, no, you can put your minds at rest on that one."
"I mean, please."
Have faith in our love for each other?
But how can I rest when I know in my heart something troubles you?
"Jack, there is no burden in the world you should bear alone."
Tell me.
"Just over a week ago, it all became clear to me."
"Call it sixth sense, call it intuition, or some strange metaphysic but suddenly I realised... that perfect as our lives appear to be, the pair of us together... there is one wretched, brutal fact that will forever stand in the way of our true happiness."
My darling... we don't exist.
"The two of us, you and I, are merely characters in a work of fiction."
"Everything about us, our minds, our bodies, everything we do and say, the product of a writer's imagination."
"And our world of consummate bliss is no more than a hopeless romantic idyll that in real life, I fear could never be."
"My God, say it isn't so!"
MAN:
"Sorry, Jeff, we've got another one."
We're gonna have to stop it.
"Oh, my God."
It's so hot!
"Thank you, Virgin Atlantic."
I'm bloody melting here today.
Great tag.
I love that.
The way you subvert the whole reality to question your whole premise.
"Martin, are you well?"
How was New Zealand?
"Very wet, I hear."
I mean echoes of NF Simpson and all that.
"""How did you make the creamed spinach?"""
"And I was just like, ""Oh, my God!"
"This is..."""
"And then without looking at me, she went, ""Cream, black pepper..."""
"And she'd done it, she'd googled it and wanted me to sweat it out and answered it, yeah, so she'd saved me."
She really made me...
"It was one of those things that afterwards, she was like, ""I can't understand why this happened!"
"""I can't understand..."
"You don't look good, I don't look good,"
"""it's an insane lie!"""
"Don't get me started on creamed spinach, I just love that stuff."
Can you actually make it?
Yeah.
"Don't pretend, there's no pretending on here."
How do you make it?
"Cream, black pepper..."
"I mean, I've got very high cholesterol but I have a great life."
I actually...
I actually do have high cholesterol.
Has anyone else got high cholesterol?
I've got high cholesterol.
"I don't even want to tell you this, this is so embarrassing."
I was diagnosed with gout last week.
Last week?
"Yeah, not last century, last week, which is incredible."
I was...
"I'm in the whole of my health,"
"I'm active, I'm active in the community."
"No, no, no, I mean I go to the wine shop and... ..and I come back, but I woke up in the middle of night with this excruciating pain in my ankle, and I really thought I'd broken"
"my ankle but you don't normally break your ankle in bed when you're asleep, so I got up in the morning and it was like excruciating and I know no-one believes you when you talk about your own pain."
"Nobody cares, but I think you're nice people."
"And so I tried to walk on it next morning and I couldn't so I hobbled a little bit for the day and I had some stuff to do and that evening, I went to a clinic, the nurse took one look at it,"
I know exactly how they talk.
"But gossip doesn't mean anything, sir, does it?"
One way or another.
"I mean, we still don't have anything to go on except the fact that the killer hit the bull's-eye from 30 feet."
"If he hit the bull's-eye, Lieutenant."
"What do you mean, sir?"
I mean that there's as good a chance of a man hitting the shoulder as there is of his hitting the heart.
Which leads us to another theory.
"We're going to assume that our man is a robber, with no prior intent to kill anyone."
And we're also going to take into account the fact that a bullet aimed high at the back has a better than 28% chance of killing the victim by hitting a vital organ in a crime that is not premeditated
by a robber who is not an expert marksman.
"Now, what do you think the odds rise to if the man is an expert marksman."
"Do you think an ex-mercenary, a kid hung-up on guns, excuse me, a former policeman, shoots still targets?"
No.
Part of being an expert marksman is hitting a moving target.
And a man who is accustomed to firearms enough to be an expert marksman is often in a situation of panic.
"That's brilliant, sir."
That's very impressive.
"No wonder you solve more crimes than I do, sir."
"Oh, wait a minute."
"Wait a minute, sir."
I forgot.
Forgot what?
The dress.
The what?
"I think I can show you what I mean, sir."
"Excuse me, sir."
Would you draw a circle back there right around the area of the heart?
"Don't press too hard, sir."
I don't wanna ruin the coat.
Now what?
Now I drop my hands.
Not willingly.
"Well, not willingly, but this is how I see it."
What I would like to do is if you two can sort out your differences between you in a...
"I'm not going to be spoken to like that in public, I'm afraid."
"Okay, well, fair enough."
"I'm not taking sides with anybody here because I just would like you to sort it out, okay?"
And I think that if you can't both...
It is not my job.
"Can I finish, can I finish?"
"If you can't both be adult about this if you don't get on with each other, avoid each other."
"I'm willing to do that, absolutely."
I am willing to avoid Mrs. Rogers 100%.
"But if you are going to avoid Mrs. Rogers 100%,"
"Mrs. Enright, then you may as well not be here."
Would you like me to volunteer to leave?
Is that what you'd like?
That's not what I'm saying.
It's not a question of volunteering.
But it's a question of whether or not we can just try and get on with each other and perhaps work out the differences.
But we can only do that if Mrs. Rogers and I talk together.
"Well, that's what I'd like you to do."
I'm willing to make that attempt.
I'll go for a walk now with Mrs. Rogers to put our cards on the table and sort it out.
"Well, I'd quite like an apology, I'm afraid."
I've never been spoken to like that in my life and I think I deserve an apology.
Do you feel that you were outspoken to Mrs. Rogers and perhaps slightly too harsh?
I feel I need time to consider that and I feel that apologies may be due on both sides.
Okay.
"The chaperones were here to do a job, to get their charges married, yeah, that's what they've come here for."
If they're not going to do their job properly then I might as well ask them to leave.
They've given up on what they're here to do.
"So, quite frankly, , they're useless."
Tomorrow's Thursday.
"Now tonight, make sure you sleep alone."
And send your prying nurse out of the room.
"Lie down upon your bed, then take this phial... and drink the clouded juice to the last drop."
"Soon, soft drowsiness will close your eyes."
"Your pulse will cease, and there will be no sign of life within you."
"Neither warmth, nor breath, nor roses in your cheeks nor on your lips, but stiff and stark and every sign of death."
"And in this borrowed likeness of a corpse, you will continue for six and 20 hours, and then awake as from a pleasant dream."
"So Paris, on his wedding morn, will come to find his bride is dead and ripe for burial in the great vault where Capulets do lie."
While I will write with news to Romeo.
He and I will be there when he will wake you with a kiss.
"And he will carry you to some far distant place, where all your anguish shall become pure joy."
Give me the phial and talk no more of fear.
Then go.
"At dawn tomorrow, a novice will set out for Mantua with letters for your lord."
"Farewell, dear Friar."
"And now, love... give me strength."
You said it was a modest group of friends.
And so it will be.
"Peter, what's the news?"
"Well, we've hired ten cooks and 20 serving men."
A quiet marriage leads to speculation.
"My daughter has the virtue of a saint, and I would rather none had leave to doubt."
"Come here, Nurse."
My lord?
Is Juliet gone to Friar Laurence's cell?
"She is, to make confession of her sins."
"Well, let's hope he may have found some good in her."
She's here.
And merrier than when she left.
"And where have you been, my headstrong gadabout?"
The holy friar sends me home to kneel and ask forgiveness for my mutiny.
"Oh, Nurse, how shall this be prevented?"
I have a living husband here on earth.
"What, should I take a second in a lie and cast myself forever into hell?"
"Well, here it is."
"Romeo is... gone, and cannot come back, except in stealth at risk to life and limb."
"Given that case, which will not alter soon..."
I think it best you marry with the count.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul.
Or the devil take us all.
Amen.
"Oh, Juliet, I understand your grief."
I strive and strain to think howl may help.
I know your father's will is absolute that Thursday next you marry with the count.
Why talk of what must be which cannot be?
"If you have no solution to my plight, then this knife shall be my deliverer."
"Ah, Jesu Maria."
"God joined our hearts in bliss, you joined our hands, and death is better than the ruin of all."
"So bless this blade, unless you have a remedy, and I'll exchange my honor for my life."
Daughter...
"I do spy a kind of hope, but it requires a desperate execution."
You have the strength of will to kill yourself rather than marry Paris.
Very well.
"You'll need that strength, and I do know a way."
"Rather then marry Paris, I would jump from off the battlements of yonder tower."
"Spend the long, dark night walled in a tomb, with rotting limbs and hollow, grinning skulls."
"Or order me to lie in a fresh grave, and hide myself inside the corpse's shroud."
Things most hideous will I gladly do to keep myself unscarred for Romeo's love.
"Then go home, be merry... and agree to marry Paris."
"Oh, I am in earnest, Juliet."
For I have knowledge to concoct a mix that will unlock you from your present cell.
If you but find the nerve to swallow it.
SHE MOUTHS
"..and I'm like, ""Sorry?"", and he was like, ""No, I didn't say anything"", and you're getting really angry and it just makes you look mad cos they can't see it."
"I was in the Comedy Store when I started out and I wasn't getting any laughs, I can't remember why, and right in the front row, this girl turned to her mate and said, ""He's lost it""."
That's horrible.
And I let that hold me below the waterline.
"Can you tell me, Rob, about going to Slovakia by mistake?"
"Yeah, I was in Poland and I'd climbed a mountain, as you do, and I was up there at the top, just kind of rummaging around and I actually drank my first Red Bull, this was in, like 1999,"
"and I was just up there and some Polish guy handed me a Red Bull and I drank it and I said, ""This is disgusting"", and I wanted to throw it off the mountain but I don't litter."
"So I put it in my bag and I kept walking and I found this rock in the ground, in the snow with a big S on it and I was just looking at it and some other people came from the other side and I said,"
"""What's this S about?"""
"And they said, ""Oh you're in Slovakia now""."
"And I said, ""Well, how about that?"""
And then I walked down the mountain.
"I'm sure it's a fantastic country, I didn't go further than that."
Does it border Poland?
"It doesn't, which is the weird part."
"No, it does."
That is odd.
It is right there.
It gives you wings.
It's a shock when you wind up there and you didn't plan to.
My mum nearly ended up in Gdansk once.
Ryanair.
"She was on the flight and they were taxiing down the runway in Ireland and then she started speaking to people and they were like, ""What?"""
Where did she think she was going?
London.
"It's a holiday in Ireland and then she started speaking to people and she goes, ""There's a lot of Polish people in here!"""
"She spoke to someone and they said, ""we're going to Gdansk,"""
"and she was like, ""But we're going to London first."""
"Luckily they hadn't taken off, but they'd literally taxied..."
I used to work as a check-in person.
Did you?
"it was quite swollen and very, very shiny and she just kind of looked at me with that kind of like, ""Hmmm, is there any gout in your family?"""
"And I went... and then it just struck me, ""Oh, my God, yeah""."
"So, apparently, that's what it is."
What can you do about that?
Don't know.
They didn't give you any help with it at all?
"They didn't, really, it's just like one of those things they just kind of go, ""Sorry, you know, bye-bye."""
Do you have to just change your lifestyle?
I just have to live with gout.
"I mean, you don't eat a lot of red meat, you're not supposed to drink a lot of alcohol, I thought it was wine but it's beer, actually that's worse than wine and you don't..."
You're next.
"Even things like mushrooms and asparagus as well, so all the good stuff."
"It is a bit 16th century, Henry VIII, isn't it?"
"It is a little, yeah."
"I know someone else who's got gout, maybe it's coming back."
"I think it is, I think it's a first world problem but it's hereditary as well, so it's not my fault."
"Any gout, Rob, in the Delaneys?"
"Not that I'm aware of, no."
"But I had, in my vision recently, I saw some black spots and I went to the opthamologist and I said, ""So, I'm sure this is"
"""an easy fix, but I now see these black spots in my vision,"
"""what can we do to knock these out?"""
"And he's like, ""Nothing, you just..."
"""You're going to have them until you die""."
"So they're just like, floaters and I see things now that aren't there."
I see them right now.
Do you really?
"Yeah, I don't like 'em but they're here so, you know..."
Are they peripheral?
"What'll happen is if I come over here to look at you they'll be like, ""Whoo!"" They'll get there a second later."
Shut up.
"Yeah, I can still drive cos"
I haven't told the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
"And then when you woke up, was he next to you?"
He was very attentive.
"Oh, my gosh."
"Yeah,"
You say that was a lovely BB but that BB was famous for the bloke not wanting....
"First of all, you weren't supposed to come home drunk which is virtually impossible after a gig in Derry."
Yeah.
And he didn't want you to bring anyone back to his BB.
"Yeah, that's right."
So he waited up.
He waited up.
You didn't have keys.
"No, he had to let you in."
He only wanted to tuck one person in at a time
"That's so charming and lovely, though."
"Well, it is a bit strange as well."
"And he used to get up in the morning to do your breakfast so he never went to sleep himself, he was....he was a really strange guy."
"So did you think, ""I was tired and I nodded off"""
"or did you think you'd had an out-of-body experience, whatever that is?"
"You know, I'm pretty sure I was asleep but my eyes were probably open and my mouth was still talking and it kind of..."
It knew the set that I was doing.
"Cos it is like that when you're doing a gig, isn't it?"
"Sometimes, you're talking but you're thinking about completely other things."
"Or the second gig in a night, you can be saying something and you're like, ""Wait, did I say that in the first gig or did I say it earlier in this gig to right now and people are going to think I'm an idiot?"""
"You do something that you think is a call-back to something earlier and there's this horrible silence and you realise you said it in the 8 o'clock show. ""Oh, if only that crowd were still here!"""
It's like if you get heckled from someone on the front row and the rest of the audience can't hear it.
Have you ever had that?
That kills.
"Cos the audience is like, ""Why is she really angry?"""
It's like you're having a breakdown.
"I did a tour show, and this guy..."
"It wasn't even heckling, he was just being really crude, so he was on the front row and he was like..."

But you shot it!
"Yes I did, but it bounced back from you!"
"Oh, Coward, coward!"
"Coward, are you afraid of dogs?!"
Why are you sitting at home?
On your own ...
Well ...
"Mind you Mitya, don't touch these pills!"
They are magical.
"Wow, That's great!"
Yeah-yeh.
If you'd eat one you'd immediately turn to stone.
Why didn't YOU turn to stone?
Only children turn to stone For grown-up it's just a cure for the common cold.
Will it turn dogs to stone too?
"Yes, Mitya, It will, very much so."
What do you want?
The coffee will always be black with that bitter taste
"O nation, flutter away"
And clutter the hill of coffee
Melt the dead hearts and make it soulful again
Because they have dreams like young beautiful girls
"O nation, it's enough black coffee for our hope"
I long to see the coffee defeated by your sugar

After many travels
I met someone called (Gehad)
He was Lebanese
Who adores Egypt
He visited many places in Egypt
And camping there with my knowledge
I told him that people stop asking
"People used to ask before, but now, no one cares!"
"Then he told me:"" in order to be a good traveling"
You have to lose your feelings
So that you can feel the other things that surround you carefully
"Like mountains, sands, and the signer girl from Nubba"""
"Then I wrote (El Ghorba) ""the exile"""
"That exile, which mourn on that stranger"
Its call spreads between the wind &amp;amp; echo
"Crying,"
"Stray, and the wheel of sadness loss its scope"
"O exile, why your call lose its kindness?"
Why it doesn't have any kindness?
Or being loved ?
This is SlSTAR
The title song is more  mass oriented song
"In one words, it's like intensity"
"I think it's wanting love, so I think it's loneliness"
I thought it had a lot  of colors to it
Every one of us has  our own part in it
It's a little bit different from the old songs
There are a lot of point  choreography on stage
"For me, I have dance with  a male dancer"
"When Bora is dancing, magic powder comes down"
"For Dasom, she uses  stick and hat to show"
Musical side of the song
We are together again after  a bit of Unit activities
And it's really great to  come back with regular album
We all have very different  colors of our own
You will get to know each members better with the song
Please love us
"This was SlSTAR, thank you!"
Would I get  married before 30
My heat is already tired  from giving love oh
Even from the raindrop sound  My heart hurts
I'm still young and delicate  Naïve and delicate
Have a lot of tears
I cry and ask for it
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
Would you come  before morning
"I only have you,  like a fool Oh"
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
I cry and ask for it
It's rendered to the point of being dry.
"Yeah, you may have some crisp on the skin, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but bananas?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, it's like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is this a joke?"
"It looks like you plated it and then stepped on it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sadly, the cook&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is better than the cook on the duck."
Bananas with duck...
You've gone bananas!
That's what's happened.
You've gone [Bleep] bananas.
"The hero of the dish, in my mind, should have been the duck."
You have managed to cook the duck.
Everything else around that is dreadful.
"Samantha, the dish please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Samantha) Um, it's pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree, served with a eggplant Napoleon."
You know that that's not cooked.
- Right?
"- I do, sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you put it&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on a plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Raw duck and, like, the leaning tower of dryness."
This is not what we're looking for.
"This is bad on so many levels, it's kind of hard to explain. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Scott, let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, what is that?"
It's a profitol... profiterole with a mashed-up sweet potato and a slice of the duck.
Two whole duck breasts equates to three miniature slices of duck.
- Where's the rest of it?
- I honestly got scared.
"It's embarrassing, Scott."
"Well, at least after the raw duck, we have a duck that has actually seen the frying pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You thought&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it would impress us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that you could put a slice of duck breast"
- in a profiterole?
- A little over-creative.
Over-creative?
Delusional.
Three embarrassing dishes.
I'm scared.

"The workflow for building a metaSL shader tree in 3ds Max is a little  like building one in Mental Mill, only easier."
Here you will be creating a metaSL shader tree to apply  to this human head.
"The model is low-poly based, but will look like it has more detail  with proper mapping and metaSL shaders."
Open the Slate Material Editor.
"Ensure that 3ds Max is set up to use the Mental Ray renderer,  otherwise you won't have access to metaSL shaders."
Expand the metaSL rollout under Maps.
There you will find about  a dozen shaders ready for use.
"You typically start with an illumination Phong shader, which provides  the basis for the metaSL tree."
"To start populating the tree, you drag in other metaSL shaders  and wire them to the proper channels."
The Texture Lookup 2d shader is useful for defining bitmaps as textures.
Start by defining a Diffuse texture; use the Head-diffuse.jpg bitmap  and wire it to the Diffuse Color channel.
Use a Normals Bumpmap shader in the Normal channel.
Use the image file:
Head-normal.jpg.
Add another Texture Lookup 2d shader and use the file Head-specular.jpg  and wire it to the Specular Color channel.
"At this time, notice that if you tried to apply the Phong illumination  node to the object in the scene, it doesn't work."
"You first need to convert the Phong illumination node into  a single-output ""material""."
"Luckily, you can use the Map to Material Conversion node to that end."
Now you can apply the shader tree to the object in the scene.

NARRATOR:
Are you a survivor?
In the world's harshest environments... we're wimps compared to the toughest creatures on the planet.
We're counting down the ultimate top ten survivors in the natural world to find the animal with the most extraordinary endurance.
"When the going gets tough, the tough really get going on the Ultimate Animal Countdown."
[engine sputtering]
MAN:
"Mayday, mayday!"
[alarm beeping]
NARRATOR:
"Could you cope with nature's worst crashes, cataclysms, and catastrophes?"
We're counting down the world's toughest animals--
Surviving against the odds for days... months... or years.
"A hurricane unleashes the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs."
"In Florida, it wreaks havoc on land... and sea..."
The storm surge sweeps fish onto shore--
leaving them stranded.
Including the animal swimming into number 10:
Reef sharks.
Shallow water is their nursery.
But sharks are survivors.
They avoid bad weather... tipped off by their super-sensitive ears.
The shark's inner ear is similar to ours and can detect changes in pressure.
Useful when it dives deep... or when a hurricane approaches-- but we only discovered by accident.
"Look at me here, here on my own again, and up straight in the sunshine."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
Wonderful life.
It's a wonderful life.

"From Pacifica, this is Democracy Now!"
AARON FORD:
"I'm honoured to stand here today alongside the New Jersey State Police, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, and United States Marshall for the District of New Jersey, to announce the addition of Joanne Chesimard to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
AMY GOODMAN:
"Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army, becomes the first woman named to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorist list."
"Convicted of murdering a New Jersey trooper in 1973, she's always proclaimed her innocence."
She's lived in Cuba since the early 1980's after she received political asylum.
We'll speak with scholar Angela Davis and Assata's long time attorney Lennox Hinds.
And we'll hear Assata Shakur in her own words.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
"Well the government just perceived us as a threat because they understood that we were serious, they understood we were telling the truth, and they understood also that we were becoming a much more sophisticated opposition, we were not just the piece of pie opposition, but that we wanted a real, structural change in the United States"""
[ *please skip to 11:28 to continue with Assata Shakur piece *]
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"And I'm Juan Gonzalez, welcome to all of our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world."
"We begin today's show looking at the case of Assata Shakur, a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army."
"On Thursday, she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
"Shakur was convicted in the May 2nd, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead."
She was shot twice by police during the incident.
"In 1979, she managed to escape from jail, and she later fled to Cuba where she received political asylum."
If there is a need of timely vaccination then that's going to be picked up and provided by the respective government programs.
According to IGAD the experiences will serve as a model for other countries with pastoralist communities. being
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
"Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won"
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care
"You touched my heart, you touched my soul"
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
"I know you well, I know your smell"
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer but when I wake
You can't break my spirit
It's my dreams you take
"And as you move on, remember me"
Remember us and all we used to be
"I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile"
Next question says to his agent: did you explain this to her before?
But can you...
Gracias (thank you)

ANTHONY:
I was President of one of the fraternities at Cal State Northridge.
"I used to get calls from Dean Peckham on Saturday and Sunday morning at 8:30, because one or more of the fraternities had had some kind of indiscretion, and I was being called on the carpet to explain our misbehavior."
"Of course, I never told my parents that the Dean was calling me for that."
"They were under the impression that I was a very important person to the management of the college, because a dean would call me almost every weekend and ask me to come down to college to help him."
"So, it worked for me."
I hope I helped the dean get the things done that he wanted to do.
It seems he went from there to a tremendous amount of success with the university.
(Music Plays)
NARRATOR:
Few individuals affiliated with Cal State Northridge are as beloved as Dr. Edmund Peckham.
"The son of two teachers, Ed learned the value of education and mentoring at an early age."
"With a bachelor's from Brown and a master's and Ph.D from Harvard,"
Ed began his service to San Fernando Valley State College in 1967 as Dean of Student Activities and Housing.
Ed was faced with the difficult task of initiating from the ground up a comprehensive program to improve student life on campus.
ANTHONY:
I think Ed's ability to get along with almost everybody was probably his main tremendous strength.
He was able to deal with people in almost any venue and come out looking like everybody's friend.
NARRATOR:
"By 1969, he was named Dean of Students and in 1985 he was named Vice President of Student Affairs."
"Ed was an active administrator, attending Associated Student government meetings, emceeing campus events, and advising many, many student clubs and organizations."
WlLLlAM:
"When we think about campus spirit, we think of Ed Peckham."
He was a colorful person.
He drove a yellow convertible vehicle.
I think it was a Pontiac.
And he'd ride this thing in the Homecoming parades.
He just had a lot of color about him and about his involvement with students.
The embarrassing thing here was that I was prepped to answer this question.
"Well I think just to, I'm sure there are bigger ideas than this, just to stick with the subject I would hope that even though I don't see this in purely generational terms, I would hope that parents begin to realize that handing your kids constantly inundating them with new technologies and giving them motivation to be interrupted all the time and to inundate themselves with information has to be balanced by encouraging them to be attentive, to read, to back away from the technology and to back away from there friends sometimes, and like you said collaboration and conversation is great, but there is a role in the world for solitude and I think that we should encourage our kids and ourselves to practice that as well."
Peter Norvig:
Ok (People Clapping)
So thank you to Nicholas Carr for sharing your incite and vision with us tonight.
This meeting from the common
"Perez, thank you for your kind words as well as sharing my latest Old Spice commercial with your readers"
Receiving accolades from you was truly an honour
"If I were to create a metaphor of blogs using mountains, your blog would be the mighty Everest, sitting on top of a skyscraper"
"And that skyscraper would be sitting on top of one of those rolling library ladders used to reach really, really high shelves"
"And on top of that wildly high ladder mountain, would be the mightiest of falcons, wearing an oxygen mask and flying at an impossibly high altitude"
And this falcon would represent your generous and flattering comments about me and on that falcon's head would be a top hat because top hats are for gentlemen
"Gentlemen like you, Perez."
I thank you.

"Hi, I'm Robbie Shoepepper, and I am a student assistant here at the Alden Library Learning Commons."
"I provide services such as renting out laptops, renting out peripherals for your computer, and giving you you're key for your study room."
This is also a great place for your technology questions and troubleshooting.
I hope you come to the desk and have a nice day.
So far i have made a number of videos discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their anti-blood doctrine.
And inevitably whenever i make one of these videos about blood Jehovah's Witness will challenge me and say something along the lines of
"Look Brian, we're just doing what the Bible plainly and clearly teaches."
It plainly says don't take blood.
"And if the Bible says don't take blood, we're not going to take blood."
It's as simple as that.
Now... what i like to do to challenge this overly simplistic reading of the scriptures.
"And i would like to start in Matthew chapter 5, starting in verse 27."
"We're Jesus says ""you have heard it said, do not commit adultery,"
"but i'll tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfuly has already committed adultery with her in his heart."""
"Jesus goes on and say ""if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and trow it away."""
So do you apply that overly simplistic reading of the scriptures to this verse in Mathew chapter 25?
if you would look at a woman lustfuly would you gauge your eye out and then you throw away? well i'm guessing that you as a Jehovah's Witness wouldn't do that because
i know a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses and i never met a single one who has only one eye.
"Now, it's interestant to me that you properly apply the rules of scripture interpretation"
"to this in Matthew chapter 5, but you offer this overly simplistic view"
"Twenty-two, (dancing like),"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah)!"
"Twenty-two, (yeah, yeah, yeah)!"
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping."
It feels like one of those nights!
"(Twenty-two), you look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
How far does this sky continue?
The world we know is so narrow
"When we hear somebody's voice asking for help, we decide to pretend we didn't hear it"
By fighting we reaffirm the worth of our existence and then find doubt in our hearts
"Finding differences to not be ""individualities"" but ""enemies"", we become stubborn and push others away"
Our relationships with people became dominating and not something that ties together
Hold my hands and listen to my voice
"The world becomes colorful, you don't have to hate since you can bond beautifully"
"There are no useless lives, let's accept each other"
The infinitely extending canvas becomes dyed in hope
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""
"Look, with just a little bravery you can change it into any color"
Let's draw our hopes
[music begins]
"Empty spaces, what are we living for"
"Abandoned places, I guess we know the score"
"On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for"
"Another hero, another mindless crime"
"Behind the curtain, in the pantomime"
So it's an open invitation.
"And, you know, when we—Cuba is accused of harboring terrorists."
"And when we look at the role of the United States and the United States government vis-à-vis Cuba, the United States government and the ClA have encouraged, trained, sent individuals to not only disrupt the Cuban economy by killing tourists, placing bombs in restaurants and hotels, but to assassinate Fidel Castro, and individuals who admitted that they were involved in the downing of a Cuban airliner in 1973."
I'm talking about Posada Carriles.
"Here was a man who made the open admission, trained by the ClA, harbored by the United States."
"When he was found in the United States, did the United States prosecute him for those crimes?"
No.
"They, on a pretext, prosecuted him for lying to the FBl, all right? and acquitted him of that."
AG:
"I wanted to go back to Assata Shakur when she was here, when she was imprisoned."
"This is a clip of a documentary, Eyes On the Rainbow:"
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"In this, Assata Shakur talks about her experience in prison."
AS:
"*Prisons are big business in the United States,*"
"*and the building, running and supplying of prisons has become the fastest-growing industry in the country.*"
"*Factories are moving into the prisons, and prisoners are forced to work for slave wages.*"
*This super-exploitation of human beings has meant the institutionalization of a new form of slavery.*
"*Those who cannot find work on the streets are forced to work in prison.*"""
AG:
That was Assata Shakur in the film Eyes On the Rainbow:
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"Lennox Hinds, you went to court to change the prison conditions that Assata Shakur was in after she was arrested."
Describe what happened to her after she was arrested.
"I mean, she was near death."
LH:
She was near death.
She was chained to her hospital bed.
"After she recovered, she was placed in an all-male prison."
She was under 24-hour surveillance by male prison guards who were watching and monitoring her very personal needs during that time period.
"We went into federal court and challenged the conditions of her confinement, where she was kept in solitary confinement for two years."
We won that case.
So we wanted to also widen the track width of this car.
This car's eight inches wider than a C6 Corvette.
So the track width and the turn-in and everything is so much better.

"Removing the complete carbon and fiberglass body work takes two men only six minutes, revealing a skeleton that is more NASCAR than Woodward Avenue."
A tube frame chassis with every bit of racing technology you would ever need lurks underneath.
There's an adjustable brake bias with two master cylinders powering 14-inch Brembo brakes.
"There's a 28-gallon fuel cell, beefed-up [INAUDlBLE] suspension, and a triple-disc clutch."
"It has modular front and rear frame components, which means if you crash, you can replace the entire front or rear section for less than five figures in your own garage."
"Thanks to the ease of access, one man can change a clutch or transmission in under an hour."
"There's ducting, cooling, tons of down force, and massive square-stance 305 section slick tires."
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"Most people think of a race car as a Rolex or a World Challenge 253 $100,000 race car."
"We wanted to develop a track day car for $60,000-- a fraction of the money-- that will compete with those."
MATT FARAH:
And Wayne should know-- he benchmarked the GT1 against his LG Motorspots World Challenge car.
"And without the restrictions World Challenge cars face, the"
GT1 is faster-- much faster.
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"We've taken our years of race car experience and developed an extremely fast, reliable, affordable race car that will compete with the top cars out in a track day."
"It's extremely nimble, it tracks really well, corners extremely well."
It's so stiff that it corners like no other car.

"Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips or events, in general, becomes a very large number."
Check all that apply.
The probability of every individual sequence becomes small
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.
"So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads, any specific number does that becomes small."
"Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips, 10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small."
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.
Check all that apply.
"Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1."
"That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin."

How to make giant soap bubbles
"We prepare a mixture of water, Marseilles soap, paper glue, sugar and a little of glycerine."
"This mixture is poured into a flat bottom container, where we dip a hoop and then lift it."
"Better than any comment, the video shows the successful development of the experiment in front of a young audience."
"The soap and sugar in the mixture has reduced the surface tension of water, which allows to create thin films of a huge surface and that can last long."

Mini-Mobile Concerts project entails musicians who play on the streets
"We play not in a cafe or a certain space but on a street corner, next to a bus station, a train station..."
"The musicians in Egypt, or in Alexandria, are very talented and people would like to listen to them"
"However, the market does not give them the opportunity, people do not have access to them"
At the end there is a miss-communication happening
"What is happening on our streets is that they are full of noise full of headache, and full of harmful sights this makes us all agitated and impatient with each other we get angry at each other too we think we need music on the streets good music that can really reach our hearts to calm us"
"The project's idea began in 2011, and the first concert was hosted in April 2012"
"And we had 15 concerts during three months and we started again since January 2013 and the first concert was at the end of March and here we are now, and we plan to host 50 concerts"
"Independent musicians, or the musicians presenting an art that is not necessarily targeted but is unique and original to be known more because people like them and the idea is not that people don't like them but it is that people do not know this art exists we made a website www.eventsrun.com so that when people on the streets like this music they have a way to reach those musicians again because they don't know where these concerts take place or when they are hosted the idea from this website is to present the different events happening in each city so you can go on the site and see what is happening in Cairo on any giving day as an example and you can know the different spaces that have music so you can attend something similar to what you saw on the streets"

I tell it every time
"Now you're all here for eternity which I hardly need to tell you is a heck of a long time, so you'll all know each other pretty well by the end"
"But for now I'll have to split you up into groups, will you stop screaming? thank you"
"Now murderers? murderers over here please, thank you"
"Looters and pillagers over here, thieves if you could join them, and lawyers, you're in that one"
"Fornecators, if you step forward, by god there are a lot of you"
Can I just split you up into adulterers and the rest male adulterers if you could just form a line in front of that small gillotine in the corner

If you'd just like to come here with the germans
I'm sure you'll have plenty to talk about
Ateists

I'm afraid the jews were right

"This is my uncle, Charlie Rodriguez and that's his horse, Lucky."
My Uncle Charlie has won all-around cowboy at the Fortuna Rodeo more times than he can remember.
"In fact, he won three consecutive years in the 1990s."
"Charlie's won buckles for calf roping, calf branding, team roping, team penning, wild cow milking, and steer wrestling."
(music)
"Charlie was born into the vaquero tradition in Fort Davis, Texas."
This is a style of horsemanship based on respect and communication between horse and rider.
Now everyone knows that cattle were not indigenous to America.
"It is rumored that in 1521, a Spanish sea captain, Gregorio Villa Lobos, set sail for"
"Vera Cruz, Mexico, with six cows and a bull."
"Along with the introduction of the cow the Spanish also introduced Vaquero working skills, which were further developed in Mexico and became the foundation for the cattle ranching culture in Texas, which brings us to the place where Charlie got his start: the Kokernot 06 Ranch."
My grandfather worked for the 06 for 45 years.
He was the main boss.
So we would be having the linear combinations of nine vectors in
"nine-dimensional space, and we would be trying to find the"
combination that hit the correct right-hand side b.
And we might also ask the question can we always do it?
Can we get every right-hand side b?
And certainly it will depend on
those nine columns.
Sometimes the answer will be yes --
"if I picked a random matrix, it would be yes, actually."
"If I used MatLab and just used the random command,"
"picked out a nine by nine matrix, I guarantee it would be good."
It
"would be non-singular, it would be invertible,"
all beautiful.
But if I choose those columns so
"that they're not independent, so that the ninth column is the same"
"as the eighth column, then it contributes nothing new and"
there would be right-hand sides b that I couldn't get.
Can you sort of think about nine vectors in nine-dimensional space an
take their combinations?
That's really the central thought --
that you get kind of used to in linear algebra.
"Even though you can't really visualize it, you sort of think you"
can after a while.
Those nine columns and all their
combinations may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space.
But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth column and
"gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out"
would be -- I hesitate even to say this --
it would be a sort of a plane -- an eight dimensional plane inside
nine-dimensional space.
And it's those eight dimensional
"Nomads don't generally produce manufactured goods, which means they need to trade, so they almost always live near settled people."
And 3.
"Because they generally live close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential calculus."
"Think of the Huns, or the Xiongnu, or the Mongols."
(wild galloping music) Okay.
"Stan, that's enough."
Back to me.
Come.
STAN!
"I AM THE STAR OF THE SHOW, NOT THE MONGOLS!"
Hi.
Sorry about that.
So one last thing.
"Pastoral people also tend to be more egalitarian, especially where women are concerned."
"Paradoxically, when there's less to go around, humans tend to share more, and when both men and women must work, for the social order to survive, there tends to be"
"less patriarchal domination of women, although Mongol women rarely went to war."
I can't tell your gender.
"I mean you've got the pants, but then you also have the [floopity] flop, so that's the technical term, by the way."
I'm [an] historian.
"If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group to come out of central Asia and dominate the world, you probably wouldn't have chosen the Mongols, because, for most of the history we've been discussing, they just hung out in the foothills, bordering the Siberian forest, mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting really good at archery and riding horses."
"Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other pastoral groups,"
like the Tatars or the Uighurs.
"And, not to get all great man history on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols came to dominate the world really started with one guy, Genghis Khan."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"The story goes that Genghis, or Chinggis, Khan was born around 1162, with the name Temujin, to a lowly clan."
"His father was poisoned to death,"
"leaving Temujin under the control of his older brothers, one of whom he soon killed during an argument."
"By 19, he was married to his first, and most important, wife, Börte, who was later kidnapped."
This was pretty common among the Mongols;
Temujin's mom had also been kidnapped.
"In rescuing his wife, Temujin proved his military mettle and he soon became a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol confederations required a civil war, which he won,"
largely thanks to two innovations.
After the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the UK government said it hoped to see Chinese people come to the 2012 Olympic Games
I wanted to go.
"People have travelled from China to London by motorcycle and car before but I thought going by rickshaw is more unique, and, of course, it's a traditional mode of transport in my country."
I really loved France.
"It had beautiful beaches, and really friendly people."
"After the Olympics is over I will go to the US by boat, travel around there, and then cycle to South America for the next Olympic games."
"Canon 6D, Nikon D600.."
We decided to make a battle between these two
"Hello, this is Digital TV and I'm Nadezhda Bakharova."
"These cameras appear to be in the same weight category, but if you like to count gramms and millimeters, you'll notice that Canon is slightly lighter and smaller."
The texture is quite similar on both of the cameras.
The bodies are made of magnesium alloy and polycarbonate.
"When you look at the basic features, Nikon makes a huge leap in front of Canon."
It's slightly faster with the burst rate of 5.5 frames per second compared to Canon's 4.5 fps ...more precise with the full-frame CMOS sensor of 24.3 MPS against Canon's 20.2 MPS... ...more accurate.
It has 39 focus points against Canon's 11... ...and Nikon's viewfinder coverage is 100% compared to Canon'ts 97%...
There's even more pros regarding Nikon - it has 2 SD card slots against 1 in the Canon 6D.
And one built-in flash against zero in the Canon 6D.
And it's a complete knockout.
"Still, Canon makes up with wider ISO range with a maximum at ISO 102400 against Nikon's ISO 25600"
"Also Canon's battery life is longer - it can take up to 1090 shots, while Nikon's battery allows it to take only 900 shots"
But the main advantages of Canon 6D are the built-in Wi-fi and GPS features
You can send photos to social networks and to print queue directly from the camera and also remotely manipulate it.
Travelers might find GPS coordinates quite useful in their journeys.
And that's how Canon can match Nikon's features.
"So, who's winning this battle - Canon or Nikon?"
You decide.
"Write your opinions below, in the comments."
See you soon!
"These cameras both come from the same family, but compared to his elder brother 6D is much more compact and weighs less."
All of the main buttons are placed on the right side of the back panel while 5D Mark ill has them near both sides of the display
There is certainly something strange happening.

A multi pronged strategy will be most effective:
1.
BOYCOTT:
"All corporate products, beginning with Coke, McDonalds, ADM, and Monsanto."
Reduce to eliminate your consumption of gasoline.
You can start this now.
Lawsuits:
"The more of their resources are devoted to circular legal action, which is expensive, the more is taken out of their budget without producing anything."
"File lawsuits of every kind (class action, environmental damage, labor rights)."

STRlKE:
The first week of July 2011.
"Take your vacation time, sick leave, organize your union to strike at this time."
Spend time with family at home!
The main thing is:
DON'T BUY ANYTHlNG FOR ONE WEEK.
"Continue as long as possible, buy the gasoline you will need for a week at least."
"Where legally possible if you rent, organize a rent strike in your building/community."
3.
PREPARE:
"Learn what wild foods are available to you, identify them, and eat them."
"Start a garden, organize within your community to become as food self sufficient as possible."
Store durable food a little at a time so you have a large supply by July.
Plan many crops that will begin to bear by the first week of July.
A permanent boycott will cause price disruption and stock deflation.
"A coordinated strike will cause specific timed disruption of currency movement (ie it's not coming out of your pocket, and you are not causing any more to be moved or produced), and preparedness to become independent permanently from key industries (industrial agriculture)."
"The only way to level the playing field with ""the powers that be"" is to take their money and make it valueless."
Complete abundance causes a market economy to crash!
"When you have everything you need, what do you need money for?"
THEY HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS WE BELlEVE IN THElR MONEY.
Together we can take one more step to bringing the machine to it's knees!
Grow your own food!
"So I'm, I'm limited to what I can show."
So there's certain kinds of regulation over what kinds of information can be shared.
"So, resource dependence varies from a variety of factors."
"There are different types of resources and they can vary in value to their importance and availability, and then certain actors and institutions can control discussion over those resources."
"Now clearly, important rare resources are of greater value."
"More over, actors and institutions that have the greatest disccretion over these resources and the least amount of dependence, will be the most autonomous and capable for forging certain relations with other firms in the environment."
Once we went on vacation
Where the sun always shines and the snow is unheard of
Once we went on vacation
Where there's always a lot of sky and salt water.
"In the morning we went to a wine degustation,"
And the next day we went down with a headache.
Then we drank a lot of stale water
And the next day we went down with stomach ache.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers."
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"We went to a travel agency,"
For an excursion to bars and bistros
We went mountain climbing to the clouds and eagles
The Ministry of Emergency Situations rescued us from there two days later.
"Then gipsies foretold us good fortunes,"
It was so expensive that it nearly made us cry
"Then we picked up with two girls in a bar,"
And the next day we were down with clonidine intoxication.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers"
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"The ribosome is composed of a large and of a small subunit and these are depicted in the film as tumbling, rolling clusters of body amorphous by themselves, but organized and structured when in the act of translating the message."
First the small subunit with the aid of an initiation factor captures the message.
Then the first transfer RNA carrying its quanine amino acid is brought to the ribosome message complex by a second dancing initiation factor.
This requires energy and that is represented by a puff of smoke.
"Next the large ribosomal subunit tumbles into place and then the process of bringing each amino acid to the ribosome message complex is accomplished by the T-factor and its GTP cohert and so in the order prescribed by the balloon colors in the message chain, each amino acid is brought to the assembly site to be added to the growing chain by the peptide synthase."
"Next in an energy requiring step the messenger RNA, tRNA complex is shifted so as to bring the next message unit into the ribosome to allow the process to repeat itself."
At the end the terminator factor seeing the termination signal clears the completed protein from the last tRNA releasing it from the ribosome.
So that the ribosome can do its job again the two subunits are split apart and separated from the messenger by the ribosome releasing factor.
"My diagram is of necessity static, but protein synthesis is a dynamic process."
This movie tries to bring those dynamic interactions to life.

"After the summit with Nehru Prime Minister then, introduced my grandfather to the citizens who gathered."
"He introduced,"
"""We have a special guest form great country called Japan."
Japan once fought with and defeated Russia.
"And that gave India inspiration and hope to strive for independence."""
"At the time, Japan was still recovering from the defeat of the World War Il."
And so I was told from my grandfather that Nehru Prime Minister's speech deeply encouraged Japan and my grandfather.
"I, as a leader, would like to strengthen and develop this long relationship with India."
"I wish India Center further success in the future; with wonderful leaders like Mr. Vibhav and Mr. Yoshimi Ishikawa, I am very confident."
I call upon your support for the cause and I would like to send my best regard to the India Center.
It was a coincident that the MC of today's ceremony gave a campaign speech for me during the election.
It gives me a sense of fate with India Center.
I would like to end my greetings with graces to India Center.
Thank you very much and congratulations once again.
ALEX FAABORG:
"All right, good afternoon."
Thank you coming.
"This is Advanced Design for Engineers, and really glad to have you here."
"Design's often broken into two components, form and function, and this talk is no different."
"We're going to have Christian Robinson presenting on form, and he designed the Roboto typeface."
"And I'm going to present on function, on interactive design."
"And I got to work on Google Now, which launched yesterday."
"So as you can imagine, I'm incredibly tired."
"Being engineers, you guys know how launching software isn't making sure everything's perfect in the end."
"But while I am physically incredibly tired, I am extremely excited to be able to give this talk."
"The thing I love more than actually doing interactive design is teaching it, so it's really exciting to get a room of incredibly smart people and to provide all of this information to you So let's dive into interactive."
"Now this is a room of engineers, I'm assuming?"
Raise your hand if you're an engineer.
"Yep, OK."
"So often engineers don't have a tremendous amount of respect for design, and it's not that they don't think design's important."
"They realize it's critical to the success of their application, but the reason they disrespect it is it's not controllable in the way that software is normally controllable, and hardware, because you're dealing with people, and people can be kind of random."
"To Karen, the only sibling who proudly wears our mom's label of a ""kraut"" just like our Dad."
How tough is my sister?
"In the past two weeks she had the entire nursing shift at the Sherman hospital taking care of my dad replaced, had a senior services cleaning lady fired and ensured one hospice nurse would never step foot in my parents house again."
Karen like my sister Theresa is a registered nurse.
"As we contemplated every angle to maintain a quality of life for our dad,"
Karen illustrated a balance of compassion and professionalism that let me nothing short of proud.
At one point in the hospital Karen paid a visit to the nursing station to rally the troops
"""I realize you're short handed, and have many other patients."" She said"
"""But selfishly the only person I need you to care about right now is my Dad."""
Trust me they understood her message
To Donna
Ding Dong Donny
At times I believe your sole mission in life is to ensure mom and dad are truly enjoying their golden years.
"You helped them to experience so many joyful times culminating perhaps, in their trip to Vail in April for the wedding between Alex - her son - and Ali."
"From baseball games, to Lake Delavan getaways, your generosity was never lost on the man you affectionately called ""Daddio."""
To our mom
An individual who has never had any issue
looking someone directly in the eyes and telling them exactly how she feels.
"We trust, when looking into Dad's eyes, those words were more often than not, endearing because until the day he died, I don't think anyone could've loved an... ...could've loved an individual more than our dad loved our mom."
Which brings us to our Dad.
I think my family is lucky because our parents did raise us to express ourselves and to not hold anything in.
"For this reason, I believe my Dad knew how important and how much he was loved by each of us."
He doesn't need to be here today to hear it.
He already knew.
"Nonetheless, those voices in my head are echoing a few final words of gratitude that I would like to share."
I'm grateful for the love of music Dad instilled in me.
"For those Sunday afternoons when he would play some Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Glen Miller, or one of his old 78 RPM records records on his stereo and often offer a subtle ""SHH SHH, just listen to that."
"Isn't it beautiful?"""
I'm grateful for the love of fishing Dad instilled in me.
"The nights before a fishing trip with my Dad were like Christmas Eve,"
I struggled to get to sleep and I woke before dawn.
"Dad convinced me we had to hit to the lake early to have any success,"
That's been mainly the kind of things that I've been able to see since having children.
"I love to go to carnival, because I'm really involved in that"
I love going to the pictures and I like to go and watch plays
"I have two grandsons and my daughter makes us go everywhere we go to the farm, we go everywhere that's cheap to the Science Museum, wherever we can get in for free."
"Because, she sits down and searches the internet like anthing to find events that are going on in London for free."
"As long as I can be entertained, I'm not really fussed."
I don't go to the pictures as much but I do prefer to watch a play especially young people that are not famous
"I like to go and watch things that I know other people's children are going to be in it, just to see how it is."
"I love sports, so anything to do with sports is for me so I spend most of my time trying to find out where the next football action is on or who is doing what in the parks, in cycling and so on."
"Hackney's great, in the summer time there's no borough in London I believe that can beat them"
"They have old fairs, book fairs, craft fairs, charity do's they're very organic, they have recycling stuff and so on."
"I'm looking forward to Spring, Summer coming on."
"That is one of the main things, free events,"
I went to the Science Museum the other day
I'm going to back through and try and look back at the stuff I went to.
"I did go out of Hackney recently to the fun fairs the old fashioned kind of Gerry Cottle circus, so that's what I've done with the little guy."
SARAH LEE:
"Our next speaker now, which is Jim Tucker."
"Jim is Head of Journalism down at Whitireia Journalism School, down in Wellington, and I had the pleasure of catching up with Jim"
"last week, and being shown around, and it's a very impressive, modern campus."
"So yes, without further ado, welcome, Jim."
[applause]
JlM TUCKER:
"Thanks very much, Sarah."
I've had to put the pencil through some of what I've written after hearing some of the things that Jane has said.
"For instance, I had this very well-founded theory that if you could reenact a suicide on a soap opera on television that that would have much more potential for harm than, my words here are, the second- and third-hand accounts of officials and those known to a suicide victim."
"But she's just proven that wrong, so that's been excised."
"Tēnā koe, George."
Thank you for your welcome.
I now acknowledge some of my colleagues from the media:

"In 1919, ""My Antonia"" had been out for a year."
And Cather was getting a lot of attention.
People loved this book.
She wrote her mother in December of 1919 and you can just feel on the page how excited she is to share with her parents how famous she's beginning to become.
MUSlC
CATHER'S VOlCE:
"In addition to painting the bathroom and doing the house work and trying to write a novel,"
"I have been becoming rather famous lately, and that is an added care."
"In other years, when I was living like a lady, with an impressive French maid, I could have been famous quite conveniently, but then I had only to receive a few high brows."
Now the man in the street seems to have got onto me and it's very inconvenient.
Reporters come running to the house all the time and keep finding me doing housework.
They demand new photographs and I have no new clothes and no time to get any.
"Yesterday, when I was washing dishes at the sink with one of Mother's long gingham aprons tied around my neck, I've never had time to shorten it,"
I heard a knock at the front door and didn't stir.
Then a knock at the kitchen door; such a dapper young man asked if Miss Cather the Author lived here that I hesitated.
"He said, ""Tell her I'm from the New York Sun and want to see her on very important business."""
I told him that miss Cather had gone to Atlantic city for a rest.
I simply couldn't live up to the part you see.
He left saying there was to be a big article about her on Sunday.
That was just the beginning for Cather.
She's still popular to this day.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he's ordered new restrictions on airstrikes targeting Taliban militants hiding in residential homes.
The directive from General John Allen prompted the Afghan government to claim the U.S.-led NATO occupation force has agreed to stop bombing residential areas and homes altogether.
"But U.S. officials say the attacks will continue but now under stricter guidelines for airstrikes, not ground operations."
"The new policy was unveiled amidst widespread anger over the latest NATO attack that killed 18 civilians, including nine children, last week."
"On Friday, Allen emt directly with some of the victims"" families and apologized to the Afghan people."
"This was a joint Afghan and U.S. force, they were taken under fire, a hand grenade was thrown, three of our people were wounded."
We called for the people who were shooting to come out and then the situation became more grave and innocent people were killed.
"On those occasions when our forces accidently kill or harm Afghan people, we are very sad."
These kids are being medicated as routinely as we had our tonsils taken out.
"And on the same whimsical basis, and for the same reason - medical fashion."
Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth.
"They're being besieged with information, and force their attention from every platform, computers, from iPhones, from advertising holdings, from hundreds of television channels."
And we're penalizing them now for getting distracted.
"From what, boring stuff, at school for the most part."
"It seems to me it's not a coincidence, totally, that the instance of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing."
"Now, these kids are being given Ritalin and Adderall, and all manner of things, often quite dangerous drugs, to get them focused and calm them down."
"But according to this,"
Attention Deficit Disorder increases as you travel east across the country.
People start losing interest in Oklahoma
[laughter].
They can hardly think straight in Arkansas
[laughter].
"And by the time they get to Washington, they have lost it completely."
"And there are separate reasons for that, I believe"
[laughter].
It's a fictitious epidemic.
"If you think of it, the arts, and I don't say this exclusively of the arts."
I think it's also true of science and of maths.
"But let me, I say about the arts particularly because they are the victims of this mentality currently, particularly."
The arts especially address the idea of aesthetic experience.
And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak.
When you are present in the current moment.
When you're resonating with the excitement of this thing that you're experiencing.
When you are fully alive.
And anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what's happening.
And a lot of these drugs are that.
We're getting our children through education by anesthetizing them.
And I think we should be doing the exact opposite.
"We shouldn't be putting them asleep, we should be waking them up to what they have inside of themselves."
"But the model we have is this, it's, I believe, we have a system of education that is modeled on the interests of industrialism, and in the image of it."
You had to get back in touch.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Can we get back to the question?
MAN 1:
Yeah how do you see that type of thing growing up in a network connected society changing?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
It's a very good question.
"I think for a lot of people it's an entirely good thing to be able to stay in touch but there are certain people who, as you said, have always throughout history had a possibility to make a clean break and reinvent themselves."
And I head Jaron Lanier recently talk about Bob Dylan when he went from being
"Robert Zimmerman in the town in Minnesota, left, totally reinvented himself and became"
"Bob Dylan in New York City, great artist."
"You know what would happen today, if Facebook was around and there is Robert Zimmerman goofing off in Minnesota and everybody when he goes to Greenwhich Village and says your that guy, you're not Bob Dylan."
"And so for a certain segment of people, it does lock us into an identity, I think, much earlier than we're ever locked in before."
"And, for those people, which might be just, you know, the great majority of people might not mind being locked into an identity and might like having perpetual contact with their co-kindergarteners or whatever, but I think there is a segment of society which is going to find it much much tougher and these might be great artists as well, since they tend to go through this will find it much tougher to reinvent themselves."
PETER NORVlG:
"Okay as a reminder to our audience, this program has been provided by the"
Commonwealth Club's Inforum Division.
"Tonight we are hosting Nicholas Carr, author of the Shallows:"
What the Internet is Doing to our Brians.
"And I'm Peter Norvig, director of research."
Lets go to a question on this side.
MAN 2:
Okay I know from my personal experience that I tend to agree with you.
"My ability to read a book is diminishing every year, whereas I could read one a week, now I'm about one a year."
So I know that its happening.
One thing that I would be interested in is your feelings about the future affect of this.
I think you are underestimating the affect.
"I think that it is actually worse because we have an accelerating rate of change in society so the number of channels that we have to deal with, the number of modes of communications that we have to deal with continue to accelerate and change."
"So I'm wondering if it'll actually become a worse affect over the next 5 years, ten years and so forth?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I'm already kind of pigeonholed as a commergent, so I'm a little nervous about answering that question truthfully, but I think that's right."
I mean I think that we're facing a continuation of this trend.
The story started when Dr.
"Jaggers, who was Jessica's surgeon, received a phone call by the New England"
Organ Bank in the middle of the night.
The New England Organ Bank offered him the organs for another one of Dr. Jaggers' patient.
"Dr. Jaggers felt that the organs were inappropriate for this as a patient, But in part of the phone call, asked if they could use them for Jessica."
The New England Organ Bank somehow assumed that if Dr. Jaggers was asking for the organs for
"Jessica, they would match the blood type."
Vice versa is the work flow at the Duke
Transplant Center and Dr. Jaggers explicitly assumed that if the New
"England Organ Bank were offering the organ for Jessica, they would check the blood type."
"At the end of the day, nobody checked."
"In the aftermath of Jessica's death, a group experts were put together to assess what went wrong in this process."
They estimated that about one dozen caregivers had the opportunity to notice a mismatch.
"Typically, a single mistake in this type of process would have been caught."
"If one person forgets to check the blood type, well, there are eleven others who could have noticed."
"But if twelve people, at the same time, all make a defect at once, the outcome is tragic."
"British psychologist, James Reason, has developed a model to explain accidents and disasters."
This model is referred to as the Swiss cheese model.
The idea of the Swiss Cheese models is as follows.
Think about a slice of Swiss Cheese.
"In the slice, we have a couple of holes and we think of a hole as a defect."
"Now, the Swiss Cheese model, which doesn't look at one slice of cheese in isolation, but asks what happens when you stick multiple slices of cheese on top of each other."
"With a certain small, but positive"
"likelihood, you can stack up the slices of cheese and all the defects line up and the outcome is tragic."
This is the idea of redundancy.
As you add multiple layers of cheese on each other.
"It is less and less likely that you can see though all the slices at once,"
"But, again, the outcome probability is still not zero."
So what's the probability of a defect in a situation like this?
"Now, if we draw this as a process flow diagram, redundant check typically corresponds to a parallel path in the process flow diagram."
I've illustrated this here with these three paths that are all happening on the way of producing this flow unit.
"Now, the orange boxes here are the redundant test point."
I recall the fish biting several hours later.
"But those times alone with him in a boat, on a lake, sharing thoughts, memories and laughter... no Christmas morning could top them."
I'm grateful for my Dad instilling within me the recognition of the value of a family.
"Upon marring my wonderful wife Katie and raising our three children,"
I gravitated to spending as much time as possible with them.
That meant perhaps sacrificing time with my Dad.
"None the less, I know he understood because he did the same with my mom, sisters and I."
He helped build a bond with a strength that was no more evident than our presence during the final days of his life.
"Finally, I'm grateful for my Dad for instilling within me the love of the Chicago Bears."
"As my friends who in attendance today will attest,"
I chose during my adolescent years to spend fall Sundays beside my dad agonizing the Bears losses and celebrating their wins.
"As I grew older, the phone would be our connection to chastise a poor play or simply yell into the phone to each other following a Bears touchdown."
"During my sport writing days I summarized the Bears Superbowl victory with a column confessing simply, that my love of the Chicago Bears was hereditary."
"I wrote at the time, ""As I think about the emotion that swells within me as I watch"
"'Brian's Song' for the umpteenth time,"
I see my father sitting in his easy chair.
Heredity is a difficult facet of life to ignore.
"My love for the Bears, I have come to realize, is all in the genes."
Chicago Bears - Superbowl Champions.
It has the ring of a Christmas wish.
"Well, Dad, here's to our wish finally coming true."""
"Dad, my wish today is that you have a heart-to-heart with the good lord."
To ensure a certain team from Chicago performs to the level that provides us and you with the satisfaction of another Superbowl victory in 2013 in your honor.
"And dad that you also find your peaceful lake, accompanied by Uncle Bob and Kevin, enjoying in the laughter and your limitless catch."
"And that you look down upon us in peace, knowing that your success on this earth has been measured by the love you family shares."
"And from that regard, no one in this room could be considered richer."
"My friends, the information you are about to witness from all of my years of research is the most important."
Its been hidden in plain view the entire time.
This is the ultimate secret and its about to be exposed.
THE ULTlMATE SECRET EXPOSED.
FOOD.
"I have hundred of government document, text books, white papers where for over 80 years the Elite of the western world have talked about adulterating food and water to sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics its all covered in the book "" Ecoscience "" written by the White house science czar John.P.Holdren."
"Urgot's role is really, ""tanky fighter ranged carry who assassinates other carries"" and we didn't want to change that about him."
We just went too far with the last nerf on Acid Hunter.
"Cho'Gath is one of our oldest champions and he needed a tune-up, so we're making three upgrades:"
"We're quickening his cast times, fixing an issue where Rupture's delay before hitting was random, and making his Vorpal Spikes scale in size as Cho'Gath himself grows."
What do these changes mean for Cho'Gath?
"Sometimes we want to give longer cast times for gameplay reasons, like with Karthus's Requiem, but Cho'Gath is not one of those champions."
We found out that his cast times are really long so we're bringing them down to about a half second.
This is going to make Cho'Gath feel a lot better about chaining his abilities together.
"For Rupture, it was basically hitting somewhere in between .5 and .75 seconds randomly."
We fixed that bug and now Rupture's timing is consistent right in the middle of those two values.
Now Cho'Gath players can actually plan for the delay of the ability just like other skill shots in our game.
The Vorpal Spikes change really is more for fun.
"They do get bigger and hit more targets as he grows, and not with just Feast but skills like Lulu's ultimate or the Summoner Spell Surge."
This is going to make him a little bit stronger but mostly it's going to make him feel a lot better.
The Tribunal is about building a more sportsmanlike community.
"If you find hostile players in your game, remember to report them after the match."
"When a player receives enough reports, the Tribunal builds a case against him/her for community review."
"If you're level 20 or higher, head to the Tribunal to vote on cases and help shape the community for the better."
We're experimenting with new ways to reform players more effectively.
"We'll be distributing ""Reform Cards"" to players who receive punishment in the Tribunal."
Players who get punished will get a link in their email that shows them the case that the community reviewed.
This case has full chat logs and stats of the games so they can identify the behaviors they need to improve.

LYLA FlSCHER:
Hi.
Welcome to 6002x.
"I am Lyla Fischer, the head teaching assistant for 6002x."
"As you know, this course is entirely online."
"So before we start learning about circuits, let's learn about the tools that you will use to navigate through the course material."
Let's start with what is on your screen right now.
Yes.
Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?
Mozilla was in those days a technol..
"Sorry, the question was ""Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?"""
Mozilla in those days was seen as a technology development organisation.
And Netscape liked to think that it was building the browser.
[Question]
Did everyone hear Dan?
"The initial theory was like the Linux kernel, where Mozilla would be the technology development asset that builds the kernel and other organisation would build the commercial products from it."
So we had this ongoing tensions and one of them was Mozilla was becoming a product in its own right.
"It turned out that as the Netscape and AOL management began building their product to drive traffic to AOL, more people started using the Mozilla version than the Netscape version."
That was going on in the background and let to some of these tensions.
"So I was fired and the belief at Netscape at the time was that by getting rid of me,"
Netscape management would then have the ability to control the Mozilla open source project and could convert it into a set of people that helped Netscape build the product that they wanted.
"Essentially, to view the community as a free work force that would help build the Netscape product."
"Of course, the competing view is that we're all building an open source project that has to meet the needs of the community and that people who contribute and build the product have some say in what happens to it."
"What happened at that point was that the two groups of people, the small group of people that had been mozilla.org staff and the larger group of people which were all the engineers contributing to Mozilla reunited to form one shared outlook."
What happened was that essentially the engineers working at Netscape were very clear that the leadership that they were following was Mozilla.
And it was me.
And it was not their management.
"So, everyone involved voted to continue to try to build an open source project."
So I remained the General Manager of Mozilla.
"I remained the leader of the Mozilla project and the spokesperson for the development of the Mozilla project, much to the surprise of the Netscape and AOL management."
We learned a lot of lessons out of that.
We learned from that that leadership depends on who will follow you.
You need to lead people.
"My own view is that you have to be leading in the right direction enough of the time, that enough people follow or enough people also lead in that direction."
[Question]
This would be...
I was fired in 2001 and yes...
Yes.
Yeah.
"Both say in unison, ""I certainly do."""
"Marriage is the same from here to Peru, Here, some examples of what it will construe:"
"Megan, baby Bayley when he gets the flu, Sure to feed baby Bayley hot chicken stew,"
"And top notch was his beer home brew, And no you don't smell his smelly old shoe."
"Bayley don't demonstrate your clumsy kung foo,"
Take Megan out when she wants fondoo.
"Here's your biggest marriage advice clue,"
Don't you dare speak of her taboo tattoo!
"And let NO ONE speak of a love that's untrue, From humble beginnings, all of this grew."
"Megan and Bayley, almost time for adieu, Honeymoon awaits, have fun when you scream down the highway at a high rate of speed on the way to your destination."
"All seriousness, you two are a great couple."
"Bayley, you are truly the best man here and"
"Megan, you could not have chosen anybody better to spend the rest of your life with."
Congrats to both of you.
"The answer for the first one is 0.125--that is the half times the half times the half, makes an 8th."
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M* is equal to the probability the message is M* divided by the K.
We've shown these two things.
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.
"We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B, which is 1 over K."
"The ""over Ks"" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability that the message is equal to M*."
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.
You might think the class should be over.
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.
We're not going quite done yet.
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.
One problem is that it's malleable.
"What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob, and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped, it's an eavesdropper with a hammer."
"If our interceptor has control over the network, and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker."
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.

GlRL:
You know how frustrating it is trying to help your kids when they're sick.
I don't feel so good.
GlRL:
A visit to the doctor's office can be a challenge.
[ Blows nose ]
"No, I don't want you to take my temperature."
No!
I wish it would feel better -- my ear.
GlRL:
"Snort, sniffle, sneeze -- no antibiotics, please!"
"As a parent, you want to help make your child feel better as fast as possible."
It's tempting to think that antibiotics are the answer when your child is sick.
But that may not always be the case.
You don't look so good.
"A lot of illnesses can be caused by viruses, and antibiotics don't work on viruses."
"In fact, antibiotics are strong medicines that can have serious side effects."
DR. WHlTNEY:
"I'm a doctor, but also the mother of two kids."
"And if you like big numbers and you like to calculate and look at flow models and compartment models and differential equations and stuff like that, biogeochemistry has a place for you."
"The contact here is with geology, physical chemistry and meteorology."
The connections are important.
They're not all well worked out.
"So there must be important connections between ecosystem ecology and community ecology, but they are still being explored, and this is not an area that's really mature yet."
"The part of ecology that analyses these processes really is the part that deals with the fate of the planetary environment, especially water and air, and that means it has important economic and political implications."
"So it's an area well worth worrying about and learning something about and remembering, because these are the processes that will affect the quality of human life on the planet, for forever basically."
"Okay, next time I'm going to discuss biodiversity, and about whether it matters or not, and about what extinctions mean."
Now we enter Part Two of the Crash Course.
"Here you'll see the very information that led me and my family to make profound changes in our lives - where we live, my line of work, even where we get our food."
"With the background you've received to this point, you are now positioned to understand how the Three ""E""s, the Economy, Energy and the Environment, intersect and seemingly converge on a very narrow window of the future, what I am calling ""The Twenty-Teens""."
It's the data in these next parts
leads me to conclude that the next twenty years are going to be completely unlike the last twenty years.
A small warning:
This material can be shocking.
"So we begin Part Two with ""Debt""."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"Young man, if you are trying to impress me, you are not."
It's not working.
"For him, that was the end of life."
We had to do a little work to get him back.
"To cut the story short, my son went on to graduate with honors from Waterloo, one of Canada's top universities."
(Applause)
"You need to have the bravado, to challenge the odds that life throws against you."
"OK, let's do a show of hands here."
How many of you use Facebook?
"Wow, I'm really in the wrong business."
(Laughter)
"Twitter, Google, I suppose everybody."
"How many of you know Aramex, Fadi Ghandour?"
"Well, if you look at the background of all these people, they are just ordinary people like you and me."
I hope Fadi Ghandour doesn't mind me calling him ordinary.
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
I'm very proud of you.
You did very well on the last exam.
Class average is a little bit above 70.
Congratulations.
There were 22 students who scored 100.
"Many of you are interested in where the dividing line is between C and D. If I take only the three exams into account, forget the quizzes, forget the homework, forget the motor, and you add up the three grades of your three exams, the dividing line between C and D will be somewhere in the region 135 to 138."
So you can use that for your calibration where you stand.
The controversy between Newton and Huygens about the nature of
light was settled in 1801 when Young demonstrated convincingly that light shows all the characteristic of waves.
"Now in the early twentieth century, the particle character of light surfaced again and this mysterious and very fascinating duality of being waves and particles at the same time is now beautifully merged in quantum mechanics."
But today I will focus on the wave character only.
"Very characteristic for waves are interference patterns which are produced by two sources, which simultaneously produce traveling waves at exactly the same frequency."
Let this be source number one and let this be source number two.
"And they each produce waves with the same frequency, therefore the same wavelength, and they go out let's say in all directions."
"They could be spherical, in the case of water surface, going out like rings."
And suppose you were here at position P in space at a distance R1 from source number one and at a distance R2 from source number two.
Then it is possible that at the point P the two waves that arrive are in phase with each other.
"That means the mountain from two arrives at the same time as a mountain from one, and the valley from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
So the mountains become higher and the valleys become lower.
We call that constructive interference.
"It is also possible that the waves as they arrive at point P are exactly 180 degrees out of phase, so that means that the mountain from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
"In which case they can kill each other, and that we call destructive interference."
"The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago, and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits."
This is Riversleigh.
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
We found marsupial lions.
We found carnivorous kangaroos.
"It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo, but these are meat-eating kangaroos."
"We found the biggest bird in the world, bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar, and it too was a flesh eater."
"It was a giant, weird duck."
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
"You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing, sitting in a pool of water."
These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
"We had, in Australia, drop crocs."
They really do exist.
(Laughter)
But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines.
"There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests, and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua."
"Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag, until a drop croc landed on her."
"At any rate, it was a fascinating place, but unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way."
"Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time, and gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out, and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline, until by five million years ago, only one left."
"By 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea, and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog -- into Australia."
"And as you can see, dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines."
That similarity meant they probably competed.
They were eating the same kinds of foods.
"It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets, and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival."
"All we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in, thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland, and after that they only survived in Tasmania."
"Then, unfortunately, the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them the things they valued, and that included sheep."
"They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania, and they thought, hang on, this is not going to work."
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.
"That was not what happened, actually."
"Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap."
"But immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them, and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw."
"By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered."
Call that an understatement.
In a piece for The Washington Post
"Jamila Bey calls Limbaugh's words — ""hate speech."""
"""What Limbaugh did - and does frequently - is ""slut-shaming"" and it's no less hateful and derogatory than racial slurs."""
Democrats are calling on leaders of the GOP to condemn Limbaugh's comments.
But on MSNBC — a political science professor says she hopes they don't so voters can see what the party is actually about.
26% of voters in the election in 2008 were single women.
"So they decided the outcome of the election, and they may well do it again if Republicans keep promoting this hateful dialogue."""
But Limbaugh's point about mandating coverage is one that continues to have support within the GOP.
As Mona Charen writes for the conservative National Review.
"""Democrats come along and force insurance companies to provide for free something that 95 percent of people have been purchasing, and when we object, they scream that we want to ""send women back"""
"It's ludicrous and dishonest and manipulative."""
"House Speaker John Boehner did condemn the comments — calling them ""inappropriate."""
"And Politico reports , Friday President Obama himself called Fluke to thank her for speaking out."
This is by no means Limbaugh's first brush with controversy.
"But this time, The Atlantic Wire reports — advertisers are distancing themselves from the war of words."
"Still others note, Limbaugh's brand of runaway rhetoric can't do much to help the cause."
The Christian Science Monitor's Peter Grier asks — has he gone too far this time?
"""In pouring gasoline on a subject that was already a propane fire, he may have drawn attention to himself. but it's possible he's singeing Republicans who are standing close to the action."""
Fluke herself has responded to Limbaugh's comments — calling them outside the bounds of civil discourse.
"I was convinced as i have been told that I would be protecting civilians against armed gangs, Algerian snipers.."
"And then I saw that these people are from Yefren like us, Libyans, brothers and real men (brave)."
I appeal to stop the bloodshed in all of Libya land and I hope that will come true.
We have been told that these people are not libyans.
And that there are also Algerian snipers.We were attacked and we surrendered to them and told them we are all Libyans.
"They are not Algerians sniper, nor foreigners - only Libyans."
"We didn't find mercenaires as we had been told, only Libyans from Yefren, and frankly we found none of what we been told."
What I hope is that all this bloodshed will stop.
Let's look at some examples of gamification for social good.
"They're in four categories, health and wellness."
Energy and environment.
Education and government.
It came out of Netscape.
Netscape at one time had been the almost monopoly browser vendor.
"It was the first commercial browser, so we had, I don't know, 99% of the market share at one time."
And it was a pretty exciting time.
That was when the Internet and the Web actually really exploded.
Microsoft appeared.
They started building its own browser.
Microsoft did a couple of things that ended up eventually building a good browser.
And it also engaged in a whole range of illegal activities.
And so the combination of that changed the landscape drammatically.
And Netscape management had the foresight to recognise they could not continue and be successful in the way they had been operating.
And they realised with the help of the engineering folk set at Netscape that the best opportunity was to convert their typical proprietary closed commercial product into an open source product.
This was radical in its day.
"Open source is mainstream now, but it was not then."
"Open source was deep in the technical community, it never surfaced in a product, it was all sort of odd and it was a very radical move."
"The second thing that happened is that the management team,"
"I was there at the time, a lot of us were, but I was part of these discussions, realised that an open source project had to be real."
"So, inside Netscape there was created a small group of people who were charged with the job of building a successful open source project."
"And there was a larger group of people, engineering, that was charged with building a successful Netscape product."
"That Netscape product was designed to make money for Netscape and ultimately money for AOL, after AOL bought Netscape."
"So, in the very early days of Mozilla, through '98, '99, 2000, we had these two different groups."
"We had the engineering group, which was a 100-150 people working on building the Netscape navigator product managed by a set of people wanting to use that product to make money for AOL."
"Then we had the small group of people who were charged with building Mozilla as an open source project, building contributors from all sorts of different places and building a technology base that was useful for many different companies."
The open source side.
That was small in name.
There were six or eight of us.
"Of those, Mick was one of them,"
"Gerv was one of them,"
"Dan was one of them,"
"Brendan was one of them,"
"I was one of them,"
Shaver was one of them and there was a few of other folks who aren't here any longer.
5 times F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is the same thing as 5 times m0.
Draw a line here.
So we have a new relationship.
5m0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
"All I did is I substituted this for this, or this for that."
"And I used this relationship, which we got in the beginning to do that."
And now what do we have?
We have 5 m sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
We could subtract m0 from both sides.
You get 4 m0 is equal to m1.
You could divide both sides by m0 and you got 4 is equal to m1 over m0.
And you could invert this relationship and you can get m0 over m sub 1 is equal to 1/4.
So what we learned is the ratio of the old mass to the new mass is 1 to 4.
And that's a problem.
"And actually, I will leave it for you as an exercise to figure out-- to just do the same problem using the numbers."
"I will do that actually, in the next video just to show you that that actually would've been a simpler way to do it."
But it's good to get used to this just so you can solve things in general terms.
I'll see you in the next video.
Brad Penney:
More on Steve and the Race to The Top Initiative that he will be talking about when Steve formally joins the Webinar and is introduced.
"And I'm also very pleased that my colleagues Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations here at NASCSP, and Mark Schmeissing, who is the acting"
"Research Director for CSBG, will be giving presentations, and we are also going to be hearing from Bob Scott and others who are on the line as resources."
Bob is the Energy Services Director and a great resource on all things weatherization.
"So, with that we'll get into the content of the webinar, and as everyone knows, the President did submit the $3.8 Trillion budget last week for FY ""14."
"That represents about a 1% cut adjusted for inflation over the preceding year budget, and it was submitted two months late because of all of the difficulties which we will get into later in the webinar with the Continuing Resolution, the personnel changes at OMB, uncertainty over the debt ceiling and how other changes would factor in, that's the reason that it was two months late."
"The good thing from the standpoint of the Department of Energy, just to begin to deal with weatherization issues first, is the DOE did receive a very healthy increase of 8% over the Fiscal Year ""12 ask, and the increase, if it's enacted, will bring the Department of Energy Budget up to $28.4 billion."
"So that would be a reflection of the President's commitment to clean energy, and we regard that as a very, very positive sign in terms of the President's priorities."
Please go to the next slide.
"So hopefully you're looking at a slide that says ""What Do the Numbers Mean for the Weatherization Program""."
"And as I said there is an 8% increase in the Department of Energy Budget in the 2014 ask and for the energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is where weatherization resides in the budget."
"A 62% proposed increase taking the EERE budget up to $2.8 billion if this is enacted for Fiscal Year ""14, which will start on October 1 of this year."
"Among the big winners: building technologies, advanced manufacturing, and clean vehicles."
"That is this treachery, the hipocracy, we are to avoid."
Imitation side.
Which is not proper and is going in the name of proper.
"That is dangerous, we must, we are to avoid that."
We are to come in connection with the truth.
With the reality.
Unto [dim??] also ready.
"Not any [passinarly??], imitationary."
"Our dealing will be sincere, true, and we must come in touch with the truth."
The thruthful result we may expect.
Truth is independent.
It is not subservient to anything else.
We shall have to come in connection with truth anyhow.

UK Youth Parliament Make Your Mark 2012
Want to have a voice?
Want to have a say?
Want to Make Your Mark?
The UK Youth Parliament is coming together to fight your corner and tackle the biggest issues facing young people today.
But we need your help
Run by young people for young people the UK youth parliament gives opportunities to 11 - 18 year olds to use their voice to have an influence on the decisions which affect them members are elected up and down the country by you to represent you its not about party politics its about campaigning on the issues which matter to you this November members of youth parliament are going to take over the house of commons who chooses the issues to be debated?
Simple.
You
Last year the UK youth parliament carried out a nationwide pole of over 65 thousand young people and you told us what your top 5 issues were across the country.
Too often it seems to me that we are happily accepted as adults
When it comes to parting with our pounds but treated like kids when it comes to having our say in matters that affect us
The cost of public transport is forever rising and it's unreliable
It costs me £16 a week to get to work and twice this week i've been late because of public transport and that is catching two buses that are earlier than i need
If we're expected to use public transport and lower emissions then we should be able to afford it
lowering costs of transport would also make it more accessible to people who are poor
Members of the UK youth parliament have been debating voting on which of these top 5 issues will become a priority campaign for the coming year
Make public transport cheaper better and accessible for all was a national campaign for the previous year
"You need the folks in DC who can advocate from their perspective here in Washington, but you also need everyone on the ground and states making phone calls and sending emails to explain what it actually means for that particular state and for communities in that particular state."
You need both.
If you only have one or the other it doesn't quite work out as well.
You really need to work in tandem.
So I appreciate all of Brad and Arley's efforts and everyone on the ground who is helping us make the case.
"Brad: our greatest Appreciation is Senator Reed because, frankly, it has been a lonely struggle these last couple of years."
I don't know if you were on the call earlier but I referred to the difficulties getting out of the gate on the recovery act issues and some of the bad publicity.
There's an amazing success story now to be told about weatherization for one million homes weatherized.
That's where the briefings held on the Hill are so important to tell that very positive story.
"Talk about things that are not frequently mentioned such as the weatherization supply chain, or in Rhode Island or virtually any other state the vendors, the contractors, the suppliers who participate, the manufacturers."
More 95% of the content of products that go into weatherization are manufactured right here in the US.
"There's a story to be told there, and it's a great privilege to work with Senator Reed and your staff in helping to increase the funding for weatherization."
Let's get this program back to the pre-recovery act level of funding so it can really deliver on its promise to help bring energy efficiency to low-income Americans.
Elyse:
"That's our goal, and again I really appreciate everything that everyone here on this call and all of your other colleagues are doing."
Brad:
"Well let us know on the letter, we will help make the maximum effort."
We will reach out to the 225 people who are listening to this right now as well as everyone in our network and work with the other stake holders.
It sounds like you're going to give us a very short turn around.
Elyse:
Unfortunately that's what it's looking like.
I do appreciate you recognizing that and still helping us nonetheless.
Brad:
"We will do it, and we appreciate, knowing how busy your schedule is, taking the time."
Elyse:
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you for inviting me, and again thank you to everyone."
"Everyone has been so helpful, and I just want to keep encouraging that."
Thank you.
Brad:
"Thank you, Elyse, and have a good rest of the afternoon."
"Ok we're going to be joined here momentarily by Steve Capanna from the White House, but I would like to turn it to my colleague, Arley Johnson"
"However, most system leaks are small."
"While they cannot be detected by the naked eye, small leaks are the"
leading cause of poor A/C performance.
"Fortunately, small leaks can be easily corrected using the Interdynamics R134a UV Leak Detector and"
Sealer Kit.
"The kit contains one can of direct charge leak detector dye, which is good for five applications, along with a can of direct charge"
leak sealer.
Also included in the kit is a UV pen
"light and pair of UV fluorescent safety glasses, allowing even the smallest leaks to be quickly detected."
"Before using the kit, identify the"
low-side service port in the A/C system.
"Depending on the vehicle, the low-side port will be located on the accumulator or mounted on the large diameter line between the compressor and the evaporator."
Remember to always wear safety glasses and a pair of mechanics' gloves before working on the system.
Now remove the service port cap and then start the engine and set the A/C controls to maximum cooling.
"Next, remove the cap from the can of leak detector dye and shake the can vigorously."
"While holding the can upside down, place the direct charge nozzle over the low-side port and hold for five seconds."
This will allow one application of dye to be injected.
Now replace the service port cap and allow the engine to run with the A/C on for at least ten minutes in a well ventilated area.
This will give the dye adequate time to circulate.
Driving the vehicle for at
least five miles is another acceptable method for circulating the dye.
"Before checking for leaks, turn the engine off."
"Now, with your UV safety glasses on, shine the pen light around fittings, along metal lines and hoses, and the connections at the rear of the compressor."
The presence of dye in any of these areas indicates that a leak exists.
"To seal the leak, add the leak sealer through the low-side service port with the engine running and the A/C controls set to maximum cooling."
Continue to inject the sealer until the can is completely empty.
"Ok, i start to record"

"So here is my question to you, what is your favorite music video of all time?"
Leave me a comment of video response letting me know.

"If you're in it for the money and you're publishing short stories in a magazine, and you're getting paid something pitiful like a half a penny a word, or a penny a word, you want to figure out ways to resell those stories."
"You'd, love it if somebody sold the movie rights for you and you got a nice commission but the more obvious thing is to publish stories that somehow can go together and then, put them together into a book."
A. E.
"Van Vogt was one of the most successful at doing this, at publishing stories that then could be drawn together into a book."
"He was one of the key writers of science fiction in the so-called golden age from the very late 1930's most people would say, until perhaps the 1960's."
Different people judge this different ways.
"His weapon shops of Isher, his stories of"
"Null A, all came out in separate pieces, and then he put them all together in what he called fix ups."
And in fact a fix up to Van Vogt was just a way of getting some kind of a thread together that would make a story be salable as part of a book.
Some of the more famous fix ups are things
"like Cities in Flight, by James Blish, where we have cities that are sort of self-contained terraria environments out in space, and they go around and each one has its own story."
And it doesn't really make much of a story all together.
"These fix-ups, if they have the right pieces, give you the pleasure of returning to the same premise again and again, it gives you the same kind of pleasure that you might get in re-reading a Sherlock"
Homes story.
"And so these fix-ups were successful, they were successful for the publishers, and they were successful for the, the writers, that is to say people were making money from them."
You don't have to conquer all these small problems that usually are associated with crops.
This had to be done with soybeans.
And these things had be done with corn.
"I mean, if you think about the effort that goes on in corn and soybeans today, in terms of the breeding effort..."
"I mean, you are looking at the breeding effort going on right here."
Win Phippen:
All right.
"Well, welcome everybody."
It's nice to finally meet Hannah.
And welcome to the mom.
"If you guys don't already know, I'm Dr. Win Phippen."
"And what we're doing today, essentially, is giving an opportunity for the interns to come back from their summer projects and sort of report back on what they did all summer long."
What they did for the money.
And tell us all about what they have learned.
And then hopefully we'll have a chance to talk to some of the advisers and the professors and giving us some feedback.
And we definitely want feedback from the students on how we can improve the program.
The grant that this is all part of is trying to create opportunities for students to get interested in the field of plant breeding.
And so we're going to be offering these internship programs for the next three years.
"And we'll have some opportunities to even create other opportunities in doing summer internships not only at Pioneer, at the University of illinois, Iowa State, and over in Peoria, but also summer work positions here on campus during the summer and during the school semester."
"So, today, really is an informal time for the student -- so don't get too nervous -- to present 15 minutes or so of what you've learned on your particular projects."
"And I think what you'll find is, you all worked in plant breeding, or in plant production areas, but you all worked on very different crops."
From chemistry to corn breeding to Hannah's variety of different things.
And then
"later on, we're going to hear from Victoria, our Iowa State person who is coming in on Amtrak, and they won't be here until 11."
"And then she is going to talk about the George Washington Carver program that she did over at Iowa State with Candice Gardner, with that plant introduction station."
"Billie, Student Intern:"
My research at the lab focused on analyzing the percent of oil and moisture and fatty acid content of pennycress.
[Text on screen:
"Billie, Student Intern, WlU School of Agriculture]"
And several studies were conducted while I was there including a position of the seed location on the plant to determine how much oil it had.
And different herbicides were used on the plants.
And a variety of trials were conducted and some other studies.
"Steven Pinker actually says that we are becoming more peaceful. so we did better in terms of our nature, believing the statistics."
In Toronto the crime rate has gone down.
I am not saying that is because  40 faculties are teaching the world how to meditate.
But Toronto is not the place where the crime rate should be going down.
I am not going to put those 2 statistics together but they certainly are curiosities.
"So imagine the changes you can bring and  you don't have to wait for funding, you don't have to do anything more  than to start the practise yourself."
"And you started it already,  otherwise you would not be here."
"So in closing I am going to say... (Laughter) my five streams that  at University of Toronto are mindfulness and psychotherapy, East and West so that we look at integrating  eastern-western concepts so you don't throw out the baby with the bath water."
Mindfulness in contemplative education.
"Mindfulness and the mind that works, in another word, how we can work more efficiently and effectively, by breathing and being mindful."
I have seen the embracing of that at very  significant NGOs and corporate cultures.
"We also have the embodied mind, which is part of what Thay talks about and Dan Siegel."
Yoga and mindfulness which  is being used in psychiatric facilities in downtown Toronto.
"And the last one is contemplative art, using art to be able  to bring our attention home."
"So, I am going to finish  by saying thank you very much and again much gratitude to the faculties  of University of Toronto, as well as to my masters for their  brilliance, their insight, their courage to be the change that we wish to see."
"(Phap Dung) Dear friends, please listen to one sound of the bell, and enjoy our breathing."
"Just simply breathing, smile to ourselves."
(Half bell) (Bell)
(R. Brady) Thank you Michele.
Our next speaker is actually  one of Michele's teachers.
"And in her program, Theo Koffler,  who besides teaching in the program at University of Toronto, is the founder  of Mindfulness Without Border, which has done very wonderful work in very troubled countries around the world."
And has now come back to Canada.
"- (R. Brady) Theo, - (Theo Koffler) Thank you, Richard."
"I feel so much of my story is part  of the stories that you have heard so far, and I can't wait to hear what happens towards the end."
I just want to start off by telling you  that my heart swells with excitement.
"When I look out to you, 1300 educators, I think, in this room, all interested in bringing mindfulness into your life, taking it into your professional worlds,  into education or health care, wherever you are situated."
"And to know that, in 2005, I was part  of a small group of people that developed the first ever  symposium for contemplation education."
And we were 35 people  around the table.
"And thanks to Thay and  his wonderful community, here you are, being offered the opportunity  explore the mindfulness and discover it by yourself and bring it on home."
"So, I am just so terribly blessed,  pleased and grateful at the same time to be here with you."
"So, as you heard, all of us has been asked a little bit how we got into mindfulness."
So my purpose today  is to tell you that.
So I've seen my share of waiting rooms like this.
She's right.
"If antibiotics are used too often for things they can't treat,"
"like colds, flu, or other viral infections, they can stop working effectively against bacteria when you really need them."
"Antibiotic resistance, when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections, has been a concern for years."
Everyday problems can become much worse if we can't use our first line of defense.
Children can need hospitalization for superbugs that don't respond to common antibiotics.
"As a parent, you can do something."
"For example, understand that many ear infections and sore throats may not need antibiotics."
"Work with your doctor to understand the difference between infections that are viral and don't respond to antibiotics,"
"like the cold or the flu, and infections that are bacterial and do respond to antibiotics, like strep throat."
Always follow the directions on any antibiotic prescription.
"This means taking the prescribed amount of medicine, even if feeling better, and not sharing or saving antibiotics, not even for other family members."
Antibiotics are a powerful tool.
"But you wouldn't slice a tomato with a chain saw, right?"
Antibiotics may not always be the answer.
Learn more by working with your doctor or other healthcare provider to make sure your children always get the best treatment that's exactly right for them.
Let's see how our other doctor is doing with her patients and find out what treatments might help.
GlRL:
"Soothe a sore throat with ice chips, sore-throat spray, or lozenges, but don't give lozenges to young children."
Use a decongestant or saline nasal spray to help relieve nasal symptoms.
"Put a warm, moist cloth over an ear that hurts."
"To help relieve a cough, use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer or try breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water or a shower."
You might need some pain reliever for that ache or fever.
DR. WHlTNEY:
It looks like her patients are in good hands.
"But remember, not all over-the-counter products are recommended for kids of certain ages."

We can all get smart about antibiotics.
BOTH:
I guess moms and doctors can work together.
I guess we haven't done enough generally to allow different ways for people to be able to participate.
Natalie:
"And right now the roles in the community, theres not that many, theres some different ones but its a small subset so we're trying to think how can there be more roles or people can opt in to taking on more of a role."
Because we do see that in these after school programs and also in the online community.
That can be really motivating and helping people develop and want to actually have an authentic role.
Avi:
"I think part of that and it relates to questions that people asked, so how do you work to promote motivation in really constrained environments where for example teachers have to teach for the standardized test or with a very closed curriculum."
And I think that the idea again is 1.
There are no recipes but the principles are the same.
So what you do is you analyze and its all working with tensions.
And the idea is you analyze the tensions in your particular environment with your particular people.
Who are the people around here?
What are their complex motivations?
"The more you know about your context and your constraints, the better you will be able to say how can I apply the principles of motivation in this particular context and then you apply it and then you study it again."
And you see what the effect you had and you read redesign and its an iterative process in a complex environment with a complex process that is unpredicatable really.
"But you can actually, using the principles you can anticipate they will move a particular direction."
Natalie:
"Yes, that great."
Fred Bartels has an example.
Some other people have talked about how they've done some compromises between these two things based on their environment and like you said iterate it.
So its great to look back at that.
Mitch:
"So I think we need to wrap up now, at least for me , the hour flew past."
There were lots of really interesting topics and ideas that came up so maybe just I'll say a few words now about
looking ahead.
"But first of all, I really want to thank Avi for joining us and participating."
It was great to hear your points of view on these ideas and I think it will stir up lots of continuing conversations about these ideas.
Avi:
My pleasure.
Mitch:
"Looking ahead, actually we aren't going to be meeting for the next two weeks because there are various events here at MlT."
"Actually theres a Massachusetts holiday next week, Patriot's Day when the Boston Marathon is run so we won't be holding class next Monday."
Already in the early grades?
Ole:
"Yes, and then let the individual find out for themselves how to formulate the problem and how to answer it"
Martin:
So a careful introduction to existentialism?
"Ole: and identity politics,yes that wouldn't be so bad and then as the next exercise ""Who are you""? that one's not that easy, is it? we live a life with each other based on qualified guesses, right? which in a sense is tragic, right?.. but on the other hand it's very good that we can't look into each other's consciousness"
Martin:
"So the ""Who are you"" project, might start a dialogue and that wouldn't be so bad?"
"No, and dialogue has also been found in Norwegian experiments at different grade levels that dialogue Capacity and the development of it, it promotes a huge amount of skills in other subjects"
"It's like music .. music is a dialogue, right?"
Ole: it's just on another level.
Martin:
Music is the best..
Martin:
"I have an old plan to combine singing, dancing and fighting because it is the oldest culture all expressions and there must be a formation of dealing with that in some abstract synthesis"
"But we can not really get around culture, can we?"
Foundation of culture if we are to be humans.
Ole:
We can not!
Martin:
"And if you look at how the media is today as the cultural subjekts is starved, right?"
To some extend.
Ole:
Yes it is..
Martin:
If you look away from it completely popped
Ole:
"Yes yes and the unified but culture is the participation so that requires the interaction it is not a spectator role that's why I enjoy amateur music and dance so much and in fact also the fight, right because it is integration, integration you have to take part, you should not be excluded, you shouldn't just sit and stare"
You must have all the senses involved and all the bodily
"I also made another word in my doctoral thesis which I called ""Synkinestesi"""
"See, in neurobiologists the senses deputize each other, not."
"""I can taste how you look"" or ""I can hear how the tree is"" but forKinesis you get movement with in and movement embraces everything in psychology it is called proprioception which is the sense of your own body and it is the feeling that, as in a probe moves you through the world and then it's the movement that brings together all your senses and the movement expressed in dance, in battle and in the music, right"
It's right here...
To be precise:
"Right there, in Espalha Brasas, ..."
"Lisbon, of course."
"- I believe, wherever you are in Europe, you're at the centre."
- This is a restaurant that is based on simple and traditional Portuguese cuisine.
- We have had a tradition for centuries:
The codfish... ... dried in the sun with salt.
And some centuries ago that would be the way to keep it all year long.
And that would be the food for most Portuguese who could not afford something else.
- I think Lisbon is the centre of Europe... ...
"With the internet you have no boundaries, we have the weather and the nice people, so we can conquer the world."
"There is a challenge in terms of culture, because we don't have a very entrepreneurial culture."
- The centre of Europe is right where you are.
Our signature is:
'Ideas that happen'.
"So it's not only having the ideas, but also the possibility of making them happen."
I started a house of the entrepreneurs.
"It's a place where entrepreneurs can get the resources they need, the people they need, the support they need."
"- The centre of Europe is split between our heritage, common culture and our hearts."
"Especially with what I call the ""natural dances"","
"like Argentinian tango, salsa... , where you have actually true improvisation, you add another element to the mix."
"And that is that besides the interpretation of the music, you also have the combination with your partner, in a free way, where from simple mechanics you create all these things that you see."
- I think the centre of Europe is where the soul and heart of Europe is.
It took several years to convince Portugal that it was worthwhile to invest in artificial intelligence.
"And also because Portugal did not have a very good image in technology abroad, it was also very difficult for us to convince customers in other countries to go ahead with us."
"Of course it's also very difficult for a computer to have the intelligence to cope with complexity, and that's where artificial intelligence comes in:"
To take better advantage of the resources of the company.
"And that was the main goal for Siscog, our company that develops software for the transportation domain."
"- In internet, you should take advantage of when you have the attention of the customer, to make him perform an action."
"In offline, it's difficult because the media and the action are separate things."
"You see TV, and then you go to the shops."
"And to trust that even though  sometimes circumstances seem to conspire against us for things not to happen  the way we want to, in fact they actually are  a result of how much effort we put in pursuing our passions, and how we use our  sensitivity to understand other people and to  support each other."
"After all, what is ""to trust""?"
To trust is to not get offended.
Trust is when you are able to...
"Trust is to not get offended, and  allow yourself to give your best, because that is the only way  of having no regrets, so that when your time finally comes,  you will be able to leave this world a much better place  than when you arrived in it."
Thank you!
(Applause)
"So, this is my grandfather,"
"Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table."
He never went back to school.
"Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores."
"Salman was the consummate perfectionist, and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture."
"He was also the ultimate self-learner, and like everything else, he did it in grand style."
"He surrounded himself with an entourage of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka, and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace."
"And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming."
"He fled Germany, together with his family,"
leaving everything else behind.
"His department stores confiscated, he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture."
"This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House."
Such is the power of self-study.
And these are my parents.
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
They were too busy building a family and a country.
"And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong, tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked with thousands of books, records and artwork."
"I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set, then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio."
(Laughter)
"And that's me,"
"I was going to say holding my first abacus, but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad."
(Laughter)
So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach.
"Instead, they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own."
"Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment: these are the virtues of a great education."
I have to give something to somebody this is also as much a need as I have to receive something.
"So there is a need, whatever kind of need."
"Needs may be diverse, accordingly relationships could be diverse."
"Now, the moment we form a relationship wanting to fulfill a certain need and if that need is not fulfilled then relationships will go bad."
"For whatever purpose for which we have formed a relationship, if those needs and those expectations are not fulfilled, relationships will go bad."
"We may claim many things, but when your expectations are not fulfilled it does go bad, isnt it?"
"So instead of doing too much wishy-washy about it, its best to look at it straight and see what is it and how we need to handle it?"
The needs within a human being have risen because of a certain sense of incompleteness.
People are forming relationships to experience a certain sense of completeness within themselves.
"When you have a good relationship with someone dear to you, you feel complete."
When you dont have that you feel incomplete.
Why is this so?
"Because this life, this piece of life is a complete entity by itself."
Why is it feeling incomplete?
"And, why is it trying to fulfill itself by making a partnership with another piece of life?"
Fundamental reason is that we have not explored this life in its full depth and dimension.
"Though that is the basis, there is a complex process of relationships as such."
"There are expectations, and expectations and expectations and expectations."
(Laughs)
The expectations that most people are creating are such that there is no human being on the planet who could ever fulfill those expectations.
"If you especially this man-woman relationship, the expectations are so much that even if you marry a god or a goddess, they will fail you."
(Laughs)
"Because the expectations are so unrealistic that nobody, no human being can ever fulfill that."
"And unable to understand the expectations or the source of expectations, nobody can fulfill the expectations."
"But if you understand what is the source of this expectation, you could form a very beautiful partnership."
"Are you ok for, you are getting very serious with relationships"
On a certain day
"Jack and Jill now let me use,"
I am trying to just culturally change the joke.
(Laughs)
"Jack and Jill were going up the hill,"
and
And without that health insurance...[cuts off]
When someone is born with a malformed heart valve there's no question we cover the treatment necessary to care for that person.
"Similarly, there should be no question that when someone is born transgender we provide the care they need."
There are clear Standards of Care for treatment of a legitimate diagnosis.
Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria are recognized medical terms &amp;amp; diagnoses.
"I have read one of these exclusionary insurance statements, and it is just appalling."
"Uh, the idea that, uh, it would be, and it is, it's the equivalent of saying"
"""we will not give insurance to short people."""
"You know, it is how you are born."
This is not about cost and benefit.
"This is about the sanctity of human life, and respect for human dignity."
So we cannot sidestep that as we talk about policy.
"Otherwise, [we entrenching ?] a very fundamental core of our value a value of extending liberty and freedom to all of us."
"What we're talking about is a treatment that is medically necessary, as determined by the American Medical Association."
So I'd like to tell you what I believe this issue is really about.
"It's about the American value of equality, and so I say let's live the values of our Constitution: equal treatment under the law."
And I thank the mayor and the council for your support of this issue.
"The American Medical Association to me, for me, has resolved the question by deeming this a medically necessary procedure."
"Uh, based on the briefings I've received,"
"I've also concluded that surgery is not optional, it is actually an appropriate treatment."
"This is a small price to pay for fundamental,uh, helping people to lead happy lives."
We heard several testimony about suicidal considerations.
And I think it's time to end that and to provide the means necessary for people to become the gender they truly believe they are.
When people present me with facts and figures it doesn't override what my heart tells me is the right thing to do.
"And I could not in good conscience allow this city's police officer's to go without health coverage, and I don't feel any different about this issue today."
What was mentioned in testimony is that the suicide rate for transgender people is 33%.
"It seems to me that $32,000 is pretty, um, cost efficient in saving a life."
"And more than that, it's the right thing to do."
"Well I want to thank, uh, Clay Neale [sp?], uh, Jennifer Yoakum [sp?], and Warren Jimenez [sp?]"
Amy Ries [sp?] and Karen Burkes [sp?] on my staff who have all worked on uh this issue over the past 2 1/2 years.
"Again, to our community partner Basic Rights Oregon, to the trans community of Portland who uh each and every day make this city a better place, and it's really my honour and privilege to serve on a City Council where we can bring an ounce of fairness, uh, in return."
"Um, when I put down this gavel, you can clap and cheer."
And the real idea is that the fun of this is that it reaches as many students as possible.
"So, when I'm on my deathbed, it would be nice... you know in the for-profit realm a big success would have been IPO or you get acquired."
But here the big success is you can reach millions and millions of kids.
It's pretty exciting.
Tom:
What's the appetite for learning that you're finding from this generation?
"Especially in the difficult sciences like Math, because we know that we're behind in this country."
Sal:
"You know, the really surprising thing is... is my cousins were fairly motivated students, they were having trouble but I was helping them."
"And when I made the videos, I assumed that they would be.. that the appeal would be for people like my cousins or maybe people like myself.."
"I was a pretty good student when I was in middle school, and all the rest."
But the really big surprise: the letters I get are from students who a lot of us would have traditionally labeled as the disengaged students.
The students who said:
"""I was about to fail out of Algebra..."
"I was about to drop out of High School... until I found this type of a resource""."
"And the big message to me is that it's actually a much larger group of students who really, really want to learn and you just have to give them an outlet, so they're not frustrated, so they don't feel that they're being talked down to."
"And if you give them that, it's not just the 5-10% students that want to learn, it's the 90-95%."
Tom:
"Sal, in proceeding panels, as you know, we talked a lot about poverty, socio-economic depravation, people not having access to the internet."
"So are you talking affectively to those who are privileged or, if not elite class, than certainly in the middle to upper middle class?"
Sal:
"You know, across the board, we've seen..."
"Clearly I think the main barrier here is that there is some type of internet connectivity that someone needs to do, but people are already taking our videos, they are being translated into 11 languages, they're putting them onto DVDs."
I've gotten pictures of people using them in rural Africa and rural India.
"So even now, it can be accessed by people anywhere."
"And as we go forward, the cost of technology is just getting cheaper and cheaper and I think that there is some healthy skepticism around technology in the classroom or technology for learning."
And I think the reason that I solved these is because it was nothing to do with technology.
And we're hoping that between our videos - we then we have a huge software platform - to give exercises and feedback to students - that that will be a catalyst to really use technology.
Tom:
What's the difference between teaching online and teaching in the classroom?
Sal:
The classroom management is a little bit easier.
"And since so many communities made this choice independently, it must have been a good choice."
Right?
Even though it meant less music and skoodlypooping.
Thanks Thought Bubble.
"All right, to answer that question,"
let's take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.
Advantage: controllable food supply.
"You might have droughts or floods, but if you are growing the crops and breeding them to be heartier, you have a better chance of not starving."
"Disadvantage: in other to keep feeding people as the population grows, you have to radically change the environment of the planet."
"Advantage: specially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities possible and also the specialization of labor."
"Like, in the days before agriculture, everybody's job was foraging."
And it took about a 1000 calories of work to create a 1000 calories of food.
And it was impossible to create large population centers.
"But if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food."
"Like for instance, trade's people, who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which in turn makes it easier to produce more food more efficiently, which in time makes it possible for a corporation to turn profit on this 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"This is delicious, by the way."
"It's actually terrible, it's very cold."
"And I wish, I had not eaten it."
"I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered?"
"Yeah, thank you."
This is not that.
"Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily beneficial to the planet, or even to its human inhabitants."
"Although, that it is a little of a bit tough argument to make, coming to you as a"
"I am, in a series of ones and zeros."
Advantage: agriculture can be practiced all over the world.
"Although, in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment, like, you know, irrigation, controlled flooding, that kind of thing."
Disadvantage: farming is hard.
"So hard in fact that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans and have to till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities."
So why did agriculture happen?
Wait!
I haven't talked about herders.
"Herders, man!"
That's similar to the bilexical dependencies of our earlier lexicalized
PCFGs.
But we don't want to use that as our only source of information partly because lexical information is so sparse.
And there are several other good sources of information.
So let's just go through those.
"So one is the distance between the head and the dependent, And if you look at this picture, what you'll see is that most dependencies are short."
They're with nearby words.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"So, this dependency here is a pretty long one."
But most of them are pretty short.
"Other sources of information are, what is the intervening material?"
"So, in general, dependencies don't cross over verbs, and commonly they don't cross over punctuation."
"Some exceptions, commas are quite often crossed over."
"So, looking at the words in between can give information about whether a dependency is likely or not."
A final source of information is looking at the valency of heads.
"And that's saying, for a particular word, what kind of dependents does it typically take?"
"So a word like the typically takes no dependents on the left and no dependents on the right, as in this case here."
"On the other hand, if you have a word that is, say, a noun, it will take dependents like adjectives and articles on the left."
"But it won't take those kind of dependents on the right, though can take other kinds of words as dependents on the right."
"For example, take prepositional phrase modifiers or relative clauses as dependents on the right."
So you can develop a quite rich typology of what kind of dependents words take.
Okay that should give you a better sense of what dependency representations look like and it's the big picture of how we go about parsing with them.
In the next segment we'll introduce a concrete algorithm for dependency parsing.
[Chinese song]
"Happy Birthday, Hessian Theater academy,"
We wish you all the best for the next 10 years!
This is a ground plan of the building in which we are.
"We entered here, at number 15,"
"Then straight ahead through the corridor,"
"At the left, the foyer with the works from the design school,"
"Then in the corridor, the durational performance of María Fernández Aragón, ""Voice over"""
"And the door which you see here, this is the door through which you've just entered the room,"
It's going up when we know about health care prices.
"They got faster than regular prices, okay?"
"Healthcare inflation is two percent or more above underlying inflation in the economy, that's why healthcare gets more and more and more guinea pig, right?"
"So, if you keep this rational rising with inflation but healthcare cost are rising faster than inflation, what is that mean?"
More people are in the [inaudible] bracket unless.
Down evermore.
This is a way of either capturing more people in there or putting even more downward pressure on the premiums going forward.
Section 3403 is the famous IPAB.
"For those who actually read the New York Times cover to cover, the IPAB is in the news these days because the Republicans are trying and they actually had a lot of Democrats trying to get rid of the IPAB."
This is an independent fifteen member payment.
Board.
Tax with presenting Congress with the comprehensive of proposal to reduce excess cost growth and improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.
"So, my former boss, Peter Orsack said, we need a process to make sure that is [inaudible] is going up, we have a process to keep it down regardless to what kind of course it does, there is a full proof method that will get us cost controlled."
We have an existing thing called the MedPAC.
The
Medical Payment Advisory Commission.
"And the problem with that is it makes great recommendations, it got these beautiful nice reports and what does Congress do with them?"
"Either grind them up for, you know, landfill or just collect dust."
"That was never implement, well-starting p roposals."
"This is [inaudible] we're just going to take those basically, take those proposals and make that binding [inaudible] in healthcare inflation or Medicare has exceeds some, fixed them up."
"That way, we can be sure that we'll control cost."
"So, basically it's a."
Of the
Medpak which advise the Congress.
Medpak doesn't have the power [inaudible] so
"Peter said, well, let's get basically a Medpak like organizations."
The power to act even if Congress doesn't act.
Kind of like the base causing commission so if
"Congress is paralyzed like it does or does it want to actually put in some of these control, we happen go in automatically."
So members are appointed by the President and subject to send the confirmation.
"This issue with sending confirmation, it's"
lunacy.

The Urban Design master studies (prototypically) fulfills and complies with the promise of interdisciplinary
After studying urban planning and architecture it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg
One of them was... or is... the theoretical background that is applied in our practical work.... that they are really used... also the existent interdisciplinary work that practically occurs with an open source way of thinking that one wouldn't find in any other university.
"What makes this master program for me really very special is ... that we don't only work with students but we also work with the professors, we don't learn something with an top-down approach but we actually are on their same level and we can to a certain point shape the whole master program."
Hello!
My name is Sarah.
I come from Cairo.
I learned German last year because I wanted to study UD in HCU.
Mainly because for me as an architect it was a super chance to work with sociologists and ethnologists together.
And in reality I was never disappointed from such a decision.
My name is Tabea and I worked for the last 5 years as a landscape architect in Switzerland.
"I decided to study Urban Design here in Hamburg since it was important for me to develop my own methods, techniques and tools that could later get incorporated in my professional life."
"What we have been learning here has been also causing a wave of interest to the extent that we have been invited to take part in international workshops, give lectures and to write articles."
Our theme is recycling systems in Hamburg.
We are trying to understand the city as a resource.
As a resource for materials for example.
Materials that today would most probably enter a degradable procedure rather than a revaluation or reassessment procedure.
Our goal is to use those materials to give them value and through that creating new conceptions.
"To be able to work on such a project we were supported by the professors, the economists, the architects, and the sociologists in HCU."
"Even beyond HCU we have asked other experts about topics such as REcycling, waste and UPcycling."
The lamellas are coming straight from a garbage container.
The garbage container is standing right beside my apartment building.
And all the time... when I walk pass it...
"I come by new items thrown by people, and when something interesting appears I would take it with me and in this case it was the lamellas, and this is now the 5th lamp that we've brought together."
(Jon K. Salunga) I will read a little something for all of us here.
"I wanted to read that and have some other notes too, but I'll be talking instead."
"Dear beloved educators,  I am writing just to say I see you."
"I see you and recognise the fullness  of your life of service, your expertise, your care and hard work, your wakefulness,  your sacrifice, your great offerings found day in  and day out of your classroom, in your lecture halls,  in your offices."
"I see you here,  I see you breathing in and out, connecting with the source of innate wisdom and peace, and power of inner source called mindfulness, our inner curriculum."
"I see you breathing in and out  to give birth to the change, to be the teachers you wish  to see in the world,"
I see you here.
"Breathing in, I am aware  of the daily acts of compassion you contribute in the world through your classroom."
"All the seen and unseen things that you hold, you endure, you balance, you tolerate,  you skillfully negotiate, to keep open the paths of possibility, promise and potential for all our youth."
"Breathing in, I bow deeply  to your immeasurable generosity, fortitude and creativity."
"I see you, I know you are here, and I am happy."
"May we be fully present to engage the collective shift and transformation taking place during this time, this right time on our planet and may we courageously  and creatively participate in bringing the heart back  to the art of teaching."
"May we breathe this new life in ourselves and our work, in the most creative, affirmative, expressive or subtle of ways in countless places for the benefit of our students,  our communities and the planet."
"I offer a lotus to you,  the Bodhisattva Educator in you."
Thank you for being here.
"I work at a high school in San Diego,"
I just want to share my experience  of practicing and bringing in the mindfulness practice more to myself and my work.
"Not necessarily to share with the students, but bringing the field of my own work into my scope of view from mindfulness."
"So, I am going to share something that  I learn from that, maybe might be helpful."
"I am working, in what we call an inner city school, with 95% of the students of color,  African-American students,Latino students,"
"Filipinos, South-East Asian,  Somalian students."
I am just sharing that because that is the context from where I teach.
That is my cushion.
(Laughter)
And I am just sharing today - I have 10 years of teaching so I know there is a lot of other  experienced educators here.
It is just to share my process  and to enter into a dialog.
I guess I use a little of teacher-talk.
"I'll start with an essential question, that's kind of thing that  we say in our role, right?"
"So, what shows up  when I bring my work life into the field of view of my mindfulness practice?"
"And actually one of the things  that I have been experiencing is that actually there is a lot  of unlearning like I am doing, a lot of the habit energy that are part  of school, part of our work."
I am unlearning that.
"The way that we are unlearning maybe, our relationship to eating very fast."
"But they can be very substantial victims, I mean, in this case in Afghanistan, individual soldiers who have lost their lives, have lost all their life."
However it is true that the kill ratios for this war are disturbing.
"So, the event that I just showed you before, of 181 people being killed,"
There was one US soldier who died versus 181 people who were claimed to be Taliban.
When you have kill ratios like that war becomes indiscriminate.
And when the vehicles for killing are aerial
"AC130 Gunships or Apaches, you really have a video game."
Because you press the button and you see an explosion and there's very little effect on you.
Everyday people walk down the street and step on ants and no one pays too much attention because ants can't defend themselves.
"So we, I think, should actually never be in a position where militaries are so unequal in their relationship because that leads inevitably to abuse."
Ann please.
Thank you.
My name is Ann Linda.
I'm from the Social Democratic Party and I have two questions.
"One is the most attention has been given to those leaks that have been about war, in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Are you intentionally trying to get [your] most attention to these or are you also trying to get attention, for example, on exploitation, child work, or forced labor, or things like that."
Or is it peace and war that are
Wikileaks' main area of concentration?
"And the second question is do you care how the material you get is gotten, in a way?"
"And the question is because in Sweden, to simplify it, if you are in authority and say something to journalists, the authorities cannot see from where the leak is."
That's forbidden.
"But if someone is trying to break in to get the same material, then it's forbidden."
And they could be taken to court.
Do you care if somebody breaks in to get the material or do you only take material that someone on the inside has given to you?
Yea.
"For focus, we are very clear to prospective whistleblowers and journalists or other people who have been censored what we do and do not do."
I think that is one of our strengths as a media organization is that we do not see ouselves as merely representing an opinion and then looking for news that backs up that opinion.
Rather we see our role as representatives of people who have information to provide the public.
We see our role like lawyers.
Lawyers represent their clients to a court and to a jury.
"We represent sources, whistleblowers and people whose freedom of speech is under threat to the jury of public opinion."
And so we try and get as much impact for their material as possible.
"In this universe of shades it's easy to misinterpret things, easy to distort things and use them in your own benefit."
"And I think it's hard, and a stage is opening up where everything is going to be like that."
"Where there are going to be so many shades in the network that anyone can interpret reality according to their will, because everything will be true, but if that is allowed to happen, truth will be betrayed."
"A stage is opening up in the net where nothing is as it used to be, and political affiliation is not what it used to be, there's no sense in using the same glasses to look."
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me how you organised the coverage, both during the 15M and after 15O (october)."
"From a logistic point of view too, how many people, why, how... because there is one thing that's true, you've produced so much."
"You have so much text many photos, many videos, many everything... tell me how you did it and how you organised it."
JL:
Periodismo Humano is not a live media outlet.
We don't do this often.
"Being constantly in the street sending tweets and social network updates is an exception, when we see that we can offer something that no-one else is offering."
Because there's no sense in doing what the other media corporations are doing.
"Periodismo Humano's specialty is features written with care and dedication, with text, interviews, chronicles."
We don't do live updates.
Actually during the 15M we didn't give live updates.
What we did was a dual velocity journalism.
"On the one hand we were in the street talking about everything that we saw, using Twitter as a public notebook."
When you spend 12 hours in the Puerta del Sol talking about what you're seeing and afterwards you have to write something up at 4 in the morning when you got home.
Because there comes a moment when you have to write at 4 in the morning and... what material can you use?
What inputs do you use to write your feature?
"Well, everything you've tweeted."
"You go over your tweets, you see the sensations you've felt during the day and you decide how to write your chronicle."
And using videos that have been uploaded all day.
"The coverage is done with mobile phones, smartphones, video you can upload via 3G."
They're uploaded straight to our photograph accounts and they're tweeted automatically.
Keeping a video for the day after makes no sense.
You can move it twice.
"First immediately, and afterwards at night in your narrative, inside an article where you're talking about something else."
Lots of people have offered their work to Periodismo Humano from the 15M.
"Many are from Vietnam, the US, the UK, Brussels, from all over Spain."
"We talked about what's happening in Barcelona, but also in Madrid, in Seville, under the aqueduct of Segovia, where there was also a concentration at the beginning."
"They're coming to meetings, they're learning this stuff then doing outreach work."
"On their own, you know."
"It's like, when you meet people who really care, who want to make a difference, it kind of empowers you, it inspires you to do more. while at the same time honing your professional skills different areas of the city and people and actually getting out there and working really kind of enhanced your view of the city."
I can actually see my work start growing. and I would have liked to have given back to the community by working within the community of Rochester. and working with other nonprofits as well.
"Yes, 0.4 is the product of these two values over here."
"So, in reality the solution is just to apply the product p1 * p2, and hitting the 1 button gives me indeed 0.4."
I can now go and change this probability to 0.1 and 0.8.
"You probably already figured out that the answer is now 0.08, and indeed, my code gives me the following result, 0.08."
"On July 4th, 2012, physicists in Geneva, Switzerland, made an earth-shattering announcement."
They discovered what we call the Higgs boson.
"A particle, an elementary piece of nature, that we've been searching for for over 40 years."
"And around the world, hundreds of millions of people tuned in and said to themselves,"
What in the world is a Higgs boson?
It's a very good question.
"The Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman once called the Higgs boson the God particle, and for years thereafter, physicists have been shaking their fists at him, because the Higgs boson has nothing whatsoever to do with God."
But it is very very important.
"It's important enough that the world spent over 9 billion dollars to build the Large Hadron Collider, the most complicated machine ever built, to search for the Higgs and particles like it."
"It's a ring, 17 miles around, 300 feet under ground, that goes beneath the border of France and Switzerland."
"If you are walking around in the fields, you would see just mountains, and fields, and cows, but underneath your feet, there'd be this machine that takes protons and accelerates them close to the speed of light, smashes them together to make new particles."
And we found one: the Higgs boson.
I'm Sean Carroll.
"I'm a physicist at CalTech, and I was there in Geneva on July 4th, 2012, for the Higgs discovery announcements."
"I saw the young physicists camping out overnight, waiting for good seats in the seminar room."
I heard the standing ovation when the announcements of the discovery were made.
"[Joe Incandela:] ""...five standard deviations."""
"I saw people get a little emotional, a little teared-up, at this discovery that we've waited decades to achieve."
"In one sense, the Higgs is the end an era."
"In my new book, ""The Particle At The End Of The Universe"", I try to explain why this was so important."
"Why this smart, dedicated people put so much effort into finding this little particle."
"What it is is the completion of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the atoms that make up you, and me, and everything we see in our everyday lives."
But understanding that part doesn't give us all the answers to the questions we have.
We still want to know:
"We believe that secrecy is trumped by honesty, and corporate interest by community."
We believe that the web is more cared for than owned.
More of a resource to be tended to than a mere commodity to be sold.
And we strongly believe in innovation that puts users front and center and squarely in the driver seat.
"But most importantly, we believe in you."
"We believe that the world's best browser is made possible by engineers, programmers, designers, people just like you, who give their time, talents, energy and support to the cause."
"And we believe that together with this cause in mind we can continue to innovate for the benefit of the individual and the betterment of the web, so that it always and forever serves the greater good."
We are all Mozilla Firefox.
We are not just a different kind of browser.
We are a browser that's making a difference.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; We are now going to discuss the multivariate normal distribution.
The multivariate normal distribution is a very important distribution in finance.
"It crops up in many different applications including, for example, mean variance analysis and asset allocation, as well as geometric Brownian motion and the"
Black-Scholes[UNKNOWN].
"So we say an n-dimensional vector, X, is multivariate normal with mean vector Mu and covariance matrix Sigma; if the PDF of"
X is given to us by this quantity here.
"Okay, so the PDF is equal to 1 over 2 pi to the power of n over 2, times the terminant of the covarience matrix raised to the power of a half, times the exponential of this quantity up here."
"And be right that X is multivariate normal Mu, sigma."
"The little subscript n here, denotes the dimensionality of the vector x."
"The standard multivariate normal, has mean vector mu equal to 0, and variance covariance matrix equal to the n by n identity matrix."
"And in this case, the xi's are independent."
"We can actually see that, because in this case we can write, the joint PD f of x, as being equal to the product."
I equals one to in.
One over route to pie e to the minus a half x i squared.
"And that follows just from this line here because mu equals zero so this term disappears, and Sigma is just the identity."
"So, in fact, you just end up with a sum of xi squared divided by 2."
So as we saw in an earlier module on multivariant distributions.
"If the joint PDF factorizes into a product of marginal PDF's, then the random variables are independent."
Okay.
The moment generating function of x is given to us by this quantity here.
So phi subscript x of s is actually a function of s.
Okay this vector s.
"I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics."
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.
"Whereas I'm a field person,"
I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
Take me away.
So we can work with geneticists who understand that.
"So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks, they found that the diversity was incredibly low."
"If you look at the first line, really, you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar."
I think this means they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry.
"But if you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents, you see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study, was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species."
You can see this work was only done in 2006.
"Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks."
We had no idea:
Did they distinguish into different populations?
Were there subpopulations?
"And that's very important if you want to know what the population size is, and the status of the animals."
"So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really."
"So he did another study using microsatellites, which is much more expensive, much more time-consuming, and to his surprise, came up with almost identical results."
"So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity."
"And it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity."
"And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the other plankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater."
So it doesn't really make sense at all.
"They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks: even though they're found throughout the world, you couldn't tell the difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa."
They all basically seem the same.
"Which, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that."
I don't understand or pretend to understand this;
"I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers."
So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics.
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
"8,200 animals."
"That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world."
"You're thinking, ""That's ridiculous."
This is important because information persists but it's important to have information on the life cycle and it's important to have proper destruction policies.
I remember working for a company that was dealing with sensitive information a number of years ago.
And.
"They were, discarding PC's, and not zeroing out hard drives."
You may have seen a number of television documentaries or have read about instances where sensitive hard drives have ended up in the hands of the wrong people.
Even when we see issues of dumping technology.
In other countries.
"Loan of equipment or donation of, of aged equipment."
"There are markets for tech savvy folks in countries like that for hard drives that have not been erased, and may have sensitive information."
And then of course you want to give consideration to firing or termination processes.
"You need to have procedures, you need to know how you're going to separate somebody."
And how to deal with disgruntled employees.
Because therein lie seeds of dissatisfaction that might cause people to do damage to corporate information or to steal information that is sensitive.
So I'd like to refer you to special publication NlST-850.
That clearly recognizes the people factor as the weakest link.
And this is a standard that talks about effective security awareness training.
While this is a.
An equal module in the model that I've been using to describe information assurance in organizations.
"To you, this term, it's often an overlooked aspect of the information planning process."
So it's important to note that to be effective.
"An awareness event or, or training program should be designed to a specific audience."
"You wouldn't want to deliver the same training to a technical audience that you would give to general staff, for example."
And you want to be certain that you build the training around a clear message.
And that you have specific outcomes in mind.
This is good pedagogy regardless.
But it's specifically true with security and awareness training.
Because employees are saturated by company messages all of the time.
"And you don't want the reaction, oh well here they come again."
You really want to have a clear message.
"And you, you want to understand what outcomes you want."
And you want to get their attention.
So they don't think this is just another flavor of the week.
Now come up with a catchy name so we know what to call it
First login to your twitter account
Then go to Settings
With functional coverage we can describe critical conditions that we have to meet to sign off our chip.
Therefore we have to do a very good job.
We cannot just wing it.
We have to be diligent about it.
This means we will do a planning process.
It will involve all the critical stakeholders in that development project.
People that write the verification environment.
"People that write the chip model, and the chip architects, and all of these people, come together and specify what conditions need to be met."
"We're also looking at documents like the specification document, and we consult from the experiences of the past projects."
"With all of this together we write down our plan, and then we establish and implement our coverage scores."
GROWing together....
Growing a better future...
What is GROW?
The GROW campaign is a global effort aimed at addressing the broken food system.
The movement aims to put food on the table for the 1 billion people who go to bed hungry.
These people have little or no access to resources needed to produce food ... or they have no money to buy food at all.
"The GROW movement pushes for better policies on agriculture, the environment ... and bring back the control over food production from the big agribusinesses ... to the hands of small farmers, fisherfolks, rural women and indigenous peoples."
Why join GROW?
"In Southeast Asia, such movement is crucial."
"Here, 6 out of 10 people go to bed hungry."
"Majority of them are farmers, rural women, fisherfolks, and indigenous peoples."
They are also the planet's main food producers.
Women do both productive and reproductive work and make up half of the rural labor force.
"But women have less access than men to resources and opportunities ... such as land, livestock, wages, education, financial services, and access to technology."
Other problems are making the situation worse.
Land grabs are endangering the region's food security.
Small scale farmers are pushed off their land by private sector investments in agriculture.
Southeast Asian countries are among the biggest destinations of such investments.
Extreme weather changes brought about by climate change is causing floods and droughts.
"Evidently we didn't know what was going to happen on the 16th, but by the 15th we had to be deployed in different cities of Spain, as we did."
We were clear about this.
So to us this was something natural.
We worked there because this was something important to us.
Evidently it was important because we empathized with some of the demands that were on the table.
ST:
"Maybe due to your preparation, or your perspective, the fact that you weren't caught by surprise, comes the situation that you, personally, and your media outlet was directly associated with the 15M."
"And you are a sort of medial outlet part of 15M or something like that, no?"
JL:
To inform about 15M does not mean TO BE PART of 15M.
In the same way that a journalist on the mainstream media who informs daily about the PP is not part of PP or a person who informs daily about the PSOE is not part of PSOE.
Or a person who informs daily about the NGOs is not a member of an NGO.
That's obvious to me.
"Now, I have no problem admitting that I empathize with many of the things that were happening on that square, no problem at all."
"Not one, because among another million things in which I don't believe, I don't believe in keeping my distance or in being extra careful in dealing with something."
"Firstly, being part of the 15M is very complicated because it's nothing."
"I have to insist, 15M is a diagnosis."
You can share certain parts of the diagnosis.
Each person's solutions are completely different.
"And being part of something... for the journalists who were at the Puerta del Sol not only those of Periodismo Humano, but also many other mainstream media corporations who had their journalists there, for those journalists- not the corporations- I think that the defence mechanism of warning that they were there doing their job and were not part of it, is the same defence mechanism used by the 15M as a general rule when someone asked them if they're left or right-wing."
Then the 15M said:
"""Wait, you don't understand... what I do in the street isn't that, it's different""."
"And the journalists who were in the 15M were informing on what we saw, but to say that we're part of the 15M as many have said indicates that they don't understand what the 15M is because you can't be a militant of the 15M."
You can't.
"And secondly, a lack of respect towards our work as journalists."
"Not towards those of Periodismo Humano, but towards those from Punto Radio and La Sexta, towards those from 20minutos and TVE..."
"Many people who were there informing about the 15M in their own way, maybe in personal networks and not through more institutional channels for whatever reason."
ST:
"Let's continue with journalism, which I was saving for later but since we're on the topic..."
"I'd like you to tell me first how you think the movement, the #15M and the camps have been treated in the media, generally speaking."
JL:
I think there were various phases in the media treatment of #15M.
But it will come.
You can be sure of that.
"That means, today is not tomorrow yet?"
Today - is today.
And tomorrow will be tomorrow.
Every day?
Every day.
That's wonderful!
Every day will be tomorrow!
The End Subbed by Eus
"My beloved brothers and sisters, as we gather once again in a general conference of the Church,"
I welcome you and express my love to you.
"We meet each six months to strengthen one another, to extend encouragement, to provide comfort, to build faith."
We are here to learn.
Some of you may be seeking answers to questions and challenges you are experiencing in your life.
Some are struggling with disappointments or losses.
Each can be enlightened and uplifted and comforted as the Spirit of the Lord is felt.
"Should there be changes which need to be made in your life, may you find the incentive and the courage to do so as you listen to the inspired words which will be spoken."
May each of us resolve anew to live so that we are worthy sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.
May we continue to oppose evil wherever it is found.
How blessed we are to have come to earth at such a time as this —a marvelous time in the long history of the world.
"We can't all be together under one roof, but we now have the ability to partake of the proceedings of this conference through the wonders of television, radio, cable, satellite transmission, and the Internet —even on mobile devices."
"We come together as one, speaking many languages,"
"living in many lands, but all of one faith and one doctrine and one purpose."
"From a small beginning 182 years ago, our presence is now felt throughout the world."
"This great cause in which we are engaged will continue to go forth, changing and blessing lives as it does so."
"No cause, no force in the entire world can stop the work of God."
"Despite what comes, this great cause will go forward."
You recall the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:
"""No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done."""
"There is much that is difficult and challenging in the world today, my brothers and sisters, but there is also much that is good and uplifting."
"As we declare in our thirteenth article of faith,"
"I am English so I find claiming to be successful difficult, we are very self-deprecating."
But I was doing okay ( )
"Then I got a condition like lupus,  an autoimmune condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and I hope no one here ever gets it but if you do, it is similar, horribly painful."
I was just outraged at this.
I was in terrible pain and couldn't walk very well and my life was being very narrowed by this.
"My reaction to this was just to feel outraged, that my life was being spoiled in this way."
Actually ugly enough I became quite suicidal in a sort of way.
"What is the point of life, really?"
"You know, this is not right and  I became quite depressed about this and discovered mindfulness  which actually, to be serious about it, really did save my life and it gave me my life back."
I took early retirement from a job  that was driving me nuts and decided to re-train in mindfulness  at the University of Exeter.
"Now, my job before this was in social and emotional learning and I was training to  be a mindfulness instructor for adults."
"Suddenly, it occurred to me that there might be a link between mindfulness for adults and mindfulness for kids and social emotional learning."
I don't know what took me  so long to point that out.
"Then I started developing work on mindfulness in schools and discovered, of course, that there was a lot already happening."
"As it has been said, I got involved in a major program in United Kingdom which is a lovely program  called .b (dot-be)."
"I became involved  with the work of Thich Nhat Hanh, by muscling my way into a educators retreat in London."
"I was just a substitute to a person  who was supposed to turn up, so I kept hoping that he  would turn up and take over."
"Recently, I have been advising  the Mind and Life Institute where the Dalai Lama is developing a very similar initiative to Wake Up Schools."
"So, rather like your car driver, in a way"
I thank the condition I got.
It's strange really how life can turn out.
How suffering can turn  into something such good.
"Anyway, to stop talking about myself which we the English find very difficult,"
-you guys find it very easy  but we feel embarrassed by all these hard stuff- I'll get more pragmatic now.
"And in a sense just give you a few messages from what I guess,"
"I have gathered with working  with people in schools, particularly in Europe but across the world, really."
"I think it has been said many times but this is essentially about you, as teachers, educators and administrators."
"Just to add a thought to that, which  is to bring this kindness and compassion to yourself, including the bits where it doesn't work very well, where you are not as mindful  as you should be."
Because we really need not turn mindfulness into another ought.
"So if we don't practice,  we don't feel very guilty."
"I know some of the adults that I teach, when they stop practicing  for a while and get back into it, the first rumination they say is, ""Why I don't do this more often, it is awfully good for me, I am really  a bad person if I don't keep this up""."
"So, let's be kind to ourselves, including when we aren't as mindful as we should be."
"It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own... over to camera 2...Hi there, camera 2, it's me, John Green,"
let's start with that double cheeseburger.
"Oh, food photography, so this contains 490 calories."
"To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed, raise and slaughter cows then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination."
You also have to grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elisabeth I. Then you have to milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
"That's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening of tomatoes and the grinding of mustard seeds, etc."
How in the sweet name of everything holy have we ever come to live in a world where such a thing can even be created.
"And how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US, I can earn it in 11 minutes!"
"And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of relative abundance."
"Well, to answer that question, we are not going to be able to"
"look strictly at history, because there isn't a written record about a lot of these things."
"But thanks to archaeology and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"So 15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters."
"Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses."
"Hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet, as long you could find something with meat to kill."
By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world incidentally was fishing.
"Which is one of the reasons why when you look at the history of people populating the planet, we tended to run for the shore and stay there."
"Marine life was A, abundant, and B, relatively unlikely to eat you."
"While we tend to think the lives of the foragers were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence suggests that they actually had it pretty god."
Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists.
And anthropologists who studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually they spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us.
"And they spend more time on art, music and storytelling."
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology
"""Nisa"", they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping."
What?
I call it skoodilypooping.
I am not going to apologize.
It's worth noting that the cultivation of crops seems to have risen independently over the course of millenia.
"And the number of places, from Africa, to China, to the Americas, using crops that naturally grew nearby."
"Rise in Southeast Asia, maize in Mexico, potatoes in the Andes, wheat in the fertile crescent, yams in West Africa."
People around the world began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
But that's going to be ok because I'm not going to be a moving target.
I'm going to rest my hand on top of my hand to go into my patient.
"So that's ok, there's no way I'm going to stick myself here."
I'm not moving toward my hand.
"So with a 90 degree angle, a nice smooth motion I'm going to inject the medicine the length of the needle into the patient's muscle."
Move my nondominant hand to hold the barrel of the syringe.
Aspirate by pulling back up on the plunger.
Check for blood return.
No blood return.
Administer my medication slowly.
"I draw my needle and I can message it a little bit here, ok?"
This needle is now dirty; it is not recapped.
Toss it in your patient's sharps box.
Ok.
So then I would reposition my patient and do my documentation.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In this module we're going to introduce Martingales.
Martingales play a very important role in finance.
"They won't play a hugely important role in this course, but they will crop up now and again and it's worthwhile understanding what they are and seeing one or two examples of Martingales."
"We're going to have the following definition of a Martingale, a random process, Xn is a martingale, with respect to the information filtration Fn and probability distribution P, if these two conditions are satisfied."
The first condition is just a technical integrability condition which states that the expected value of the absolute value of Xn must be finite for all n.
"The really important condition, is condition two here, which states that the expected value of Xn plus m, given Fn, is equal to Xn for all nm greater than or equal to 0."
A quick comment on what I mean by information filtration.
"So the information filtration, Fn, is just a complicated way of recognizing the information we have at time n."
So Fn will denote all of the information in our model that we know at time n.
"So usually, you will actually, it'd be the case that Fn is equal to the information given to you by X1 up to Xn."
"So basically, it's just recognizing that at time n, we've already seen the values"
X1 up to Xn.
"Returning to condition two here, we see that what this is really saying, is that the expected value of X, at any time in the future, is equal to its current value today."
"And so, Martingales have often been used to, to model what are called fair games, they've got a rich history in gambling, for example."
"Because this condition here, models the idea of a fair game, so your future pay-off, or your expected future pay-off, is equal to your current wealth today, Xm."
"We define a sub martingale, by replacing condition two with a greater than or equal to sign, And we define a super martingale by replacing condition two with a less than or equal to sign."
A martingale then is both a sub martingale and a super martingale.
"And you can see, in blue we have the three peaks, where the immediate release is up to three times a day."
The sustained release goes up to twice a day.
"So you can see that same coverage of spectrum, and the XL is once a day."
"You're going to get ultimately equivalent doses, and equivalent action throughout the day, with whatever agent you use."
"But the XL, actually, is I think a nice drug option in this population, if it's actually covered on the insurance."
"They're almost all generic now, so it is becoming not an issue."
"But the Buproprion XL is just a nice, clean agent that we can utilize so we don't have issues with"
late evening activation or anything like that.
Mirtazapine is probably one of the most confusing agents we have.
It's an Alpha-2 antagonist.
And we're going to try to walk through how the medication works.
This is not a reuptake inhibitor.
So it's a completely different shift of how we're doing antidepressants.
"It's that we're actually going to try to stimulate the manufacturing, so to speak, of the neurotransmitters."
"So, you can see that we have action on the alpha 2 antagonist's effects, to increase both serotonin and norepinephrine."
And we do this - inserting this drug - on different areas of the neurotransmitters.
"And then, these two neurons talk to each other with the end result of increasing norepinephrine, which is actually the triangles, and the serotonin, which is the little yellow tadpoles."
"So, you do get a dual-action, it's just not in the same way that we've done in the past, where we've kindof blocked that pump action, where the neurotransmitter can't get sucked back up."
This time we're actually trying to stimulate action.
"So, Mirtazapine has multiple formulations, again."
"Remeron, Remeron Sol Tab, Mirtazapine, and Mirtazapine Sol Tab."
The SoluTab does not have any absorption increase rate.
It's just a benefit in patients who have swallowing difficulties.
It's not absorbed in the mouth; it just dissolves.
"Which might be helpful in the elderly, for example."
"This is an Alpha 2 antagonist 5HT3, 2A, 2C antagonist."
"So, what we'll show you in the next slide is how we're kind of targeting where - directing, exactly which serotonin receptors we want the serotonin to go to once we've increased it, to help control some of the side effects."
The dosage is anywhere from 15 to 45 milligrams to be dosed at bedtime.
The side effects with this drug are kind of unique.
"We've got sedation, which is why it's just at bedtime."
"Interestingly, the lower end of the doses are more sedating than the higher end of the doses."
"So, 15 milligrams is actually more tiring than 45, but they should always all be dosed at bedtime."
Computers allowed us to generate digital contents.
Internet has allowed us to share those contents.
Nowadays more than ever before we have access to tools that allow us to understand our reality and to transform it.
"By backing this project you will collaborate to make ""smart cities"" being produced by smart citizens."
"Hello, my name is Martin Hausenblas and I'd like to thank you."
"By now there are more than 45,000 marketers in more than 170 countries worldwide."
"Thanks to your hard work, taxi drivers and passengers have also begun registering."
The highest priority now is to launch Liftago in the first 4 markets:
"Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania."
"The better we launch in these markets, the easier and faster the launch will be in the markets that follow."
Today I'd like to answer some of your questions and also show you the Liftago Taxi app for the first time!
"Before I start, I'd like to point out that the key to success is the understanding of our product and the way we do business."
That's why I'd like to ask you to carefully go over the materials we provide in our newsletters and on our website.
"If you haven't taken a look at them yet, please do so now."
Now to address your questions.
When is the launch of the Liftago service?
"We are launching the service in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania in June."
We'll keep you updated about the launch timing for the next markets.
Our aim was to launch the service a couple of weeks ago.
"Unfortunately though, software development is not as predictable as we'd like it to be, especially when developing such an innovative service as Liftago Taxi, together with our Liftago Community Business."
Currently we have been field-testing the apps and there's still some fine-tuning of features ahead of us before we can launch the service.
What happens after the launch of Liftago Taxi?
"First of all, we'll celebrate!"
"More importantly, the true work will begin."
"We'll launch the full version of the Liftago website for passengers, drivers, and marketers."
We'll launch the apps and send a download link for Google Play or the App Store with your invite code to all of your pre-registered members.
How do we know that a new member belongs to your community?
The key to that is in the invite code.
You've already been using your invite code to register new marketers or to pre-register new taxi drivers and passengers.
"If you don't know how to use it, take a look at our materials on our website."
"After the launch, share your invite link through www.liftago.com, and also directly from the Liftago apps in various forms, such as QR code, sms, e-mail, or social media."
"Users can install our apps also without the invite code, but it will be much easier for them to simply click on your invite link."
Are you using this?
"Well, Gwenyth Paltrow is,"
"Julianne Moore,"
"Charlize Theron, and, oh, Hilary Swank, yeah, they're using this product."
What it is is the Opal Eye Treatment.
You use it on the eyes.
It is amazing.
I use this--both of these--every day.
You can use this at morning and at night.
Morning and at night.
"This helps with fine lines, wrinkles, puffy eyes, which I get a lot, because I have allergies and a toddler, so sleep is a precious commodity that I always always get, so I must, must, must use this in dark circles."
"Oh, the dark circles, they-- I don't think they're ever going to go away."
"And the Clarisonic, this helps them as well, so to fight all of my problems, here for my beautiful skin, this will take it to the next level."
"So, again, if you're already using all of these amazing products that I hear, you say, ""I'm good."""
This is what you do to go to the next level.
"We've seen a number of techniques, some in previous lectures and some we talked about in this lecture."
"We've seen the Naive Bayes classifier, fairly in detail."
We've seen some Probabilistic Graphical
Models like Bayesian Networks.
"We've seen linear regression in detail, this time, we also heard about logistic regression neural networks and support vector machines, at least as to what they are."
"And, let's look at the problem and see which kind of techniques one would need to consider depending on the nature of the problem."
"We classify the problem in terms of the kind of features it has, whether they are numerical or categorical, that means numbers or classes."
"And the target variable, which is what we are trying to predict."
"We might be predicting a value, then it becomes a prediction problem where the value is numerical."
"We might be predicting a class in which, in which case it's a classification problem which is part of learning theory."
"Techniques can be used interchangeably across these two different types of prediction based on the kinds of features, of course, some techniques are more applicable than others."
"So, in the most straightforward case,"
"If we have numerical features and a numerical target we want to predict,"
"The correlation is stable and fairly linear, we'd use linear regression."
"Now, when I say stable and fair, fairly linear, even in situations like this,"
One would still prefer to use linear regression rather than some complicated non-linear function.
"Because using high order functions we'd, we'd say squares or cubes and sines and cos's, will tend to over fit the data and will not generalize to situations which may come up, arise in the future."
It was an extremely painful delivery for my wife.
The doctor rushed the whole process so he could go sailing.
"My daughter is 37 now; but wherever we go, she is always the last to leave the house."
"And whenever we go somewhere by car, she is always the last one to get out of the car."
I think she is still angry for having been rushed at birth.
In the Front Line
"For example, when my son was born I had to fight very hard to be there."
Somebody had decided that it would not good.
"And after he was born, I wasn't allowed to hold him in my arms, because I had walked in from the street."
Decisions like these.
That is bio-politics.
"What do those people think, who make such decisions?"
I remember a book: a thick book written by an American journalist.
"Its title was 'Eleni', which is about his ordeal trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order."
"She was shot to death in the Greek Civil War but before it happened, she had looked for someone to help his son escape the country."
And the whole book is about how he is trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order.
And he believes that he is going to kill the person.
"However, when he finds the old man the only thing he does is to spit him in his face and with that the story was over."
"Well, whoever signed the order to have Agi Gereb imprisoned, I would like to spit in their face."
I've never felt as outraged in my entire life as I felt when I heard this story.
There can't be any more unjust and cruel misunderstanding than this.
"It's as if Hungary had regressed to dark, medieval times."
"'Malleus maleficarum' was a book in the medieval ages, which was used in the systematic persecution of witches, by which they made a distinction between witches and non-witches."
It is the same dark force that was used by the Dominicans to persecute those whom they wished to accuse as witches.
"The harm that is done by obstetrics, by a doctor who works in a mechanical and dogmatic way, may go unnoticed for 20, 25 or 30 years after a person's birth."
"Since the harm done by obstetrics cannot be implied immediately, it is even harder to recognize than the situation was in Semmelweis' case."
So this is where those psychologists who know prenatal psychology should stand up and say:
"'Ok, perhaps both mother and child will live, but it is very likely that the child will need 20 years of psychotherapy 20 or 30 years from now, just because we are not listening to Leboyer or Agi Gereb.'"
"If there is any kind of tension around a child's birth, it is something that a whole generation will pay for within15-20 years."
"So the sooner there is some kind of solidarity and cooperation between obstetrician and midwives, the better it is."
"Michel Odent, who has visited me on a few occasions, and we have given several lectures together."
"He has stated several times, without any reservations, that everything he knows about births, as an obstetrician, he has learned from midwives."
[crowd laughing]
AYE.
It's approved.
[crowd cheers and claps]
"In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment may have had an effect."
"So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores."
"And then the other treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I seriously might do."
"After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about whether or not this will work."
I guess we'll just have to wait and see the results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning.
"Speaking of which, that's the dependent variable."
In the next lesson you'll learn how to formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOUGLAS CROCKFORD:
Thanks everybody for coming back for what turns out to be Scene 6:
Loopage [in the Crockford on JavaScript series].
"Before we begin, I recently read a white paper: some guys comparing two application platforms, one written in C++ and one written in Java."
"They went through the features, comparing them and deciding which of the platforms was better."
"When they got to garbage collection, they said garbage collection is a programmer convenience."
But then they evaluated the two systems based on how large a convenience it appeared to be.
"They measured the number of dispose instructions in the C++ code and found that there wasn't a lot of that, and then determined that it was more than a programmer convenience, which was completely wrong."
That's not what garbage collection is.
Garbage collection is a reliability mechanism.
Having garbage collection means you're not going to have dangling pointer errors and all these other hazards.
It also means there's a large class of wonderful algorithms that you can consider that are really too dangerous to consider if you don't have garbage collection.
So they completely screwed up their analysis.
"Basically their conclusion was: if you're into C++, you can feel good about not understanding Java."
That turns out to be a really bad way to think about things.
"You really should be making decisions based on good information and deep understanding, and very often that's not what we do."
But that's not what I'm going to be talking about tonight.
I'm going to be talking about loops.
Here's a loop statement.
"It says loop and you've got a block, and as you would expect, all of the statements within the block will get repeated over and over and over until something happens."
"JavaScript doesn't have a statement that looks quite like that, which"
What?
Roomate?!
Did something happen?
"No, I'm fine."
Voiceover:
"Let's say I am an economist, and I am curious about whether, in general, things are getting more expensive or not, and if they are getting expensive, by how much?"
"The way I'd approach that is,"
"I'd think of, what are just a bunch of goods and services that the average person would buy?"
"I would think up some type of basket of goods and services, and I would try to weight that basket, based on how people actually spend their money, so I would say, ""Okay, 40% of people's money"
"""on average are spent on housing;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on transportation;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on food,"" and I would go out into the market, and I would try to take an average of what these things cost, and I would sample a bunch of products, a bunch of services, so I could get a decent average of that."
"This is not a simple thing to do, but I am an economist, and I am serious about trying to calculate it."
"Let's say that when I take that weighted average of all of the stuff, I just come up with a number."
"I'm not giving you the details of how it's actually calculated, but to give you the idea of what they are doing."
I get a number.
"To rent, to buy or lease your average automobile; to lease your average apartment; to buy your average servings of food for a given family; all the rest;"
"let's say I come up with, that costs, and I'm making up a number here,"
"let's say that it costs $20,000."
My basket of goods and services.
Just based on the way that I've weighted it.
This is all happening in year 1.
This is in year 1.
"I'm curious whether between year 1 and, let's say, year 5, and year 5, whether things got more expensive."
"I'll take that same basket of goods and services, so, basket of goods and services, and I'll try to figure out what is their weighted average cost in year 5?"
"This is a lot harder than it might sound right now, because the baskets of goods and services change."
"If computers get faster, do you use the same computer, or do you think about what the average computer is, which would now be a better computer?"
"If most people's TVs got bigger, do you use the same TV in year 1 and year 5 or do you adjust for what is now the average TV, which is now bigger?"
"If houses have gotten bigger on average, do you use the same house, or would you use the average house?"
"There's a whole bunch of areas here that you can really tweak, and these are actually huge subjects of debate, on what is the actual increase in cost."
"Let's say that you're able to do this in what you think is a pretty reasonable way, and you find that the same basket of goods, adjusted for things like technology and all of the rest, now costs $22,000."
"Your takeaway from here is that the same things that cost $20,000, the things that gave you the same standard of living in year 1, to get that same standard of living in year 5, you now need to spend 10% more."
Enhancing the size of the student body means we need more faculty to teach them.
"We hired five new faculty last year, eleven new faculty joined us this year, and we're out recruiting for even more faculty to join us next year."
These new faculty add to our expertise and they add an energy that's revitalizing the College of Business Administration.
We believe that we are shaping and molding the next set of ethical leaders for Nebraska and the world.
"As our enrollments increase, we are taking steps to keep all these new students highly engaged."
"For example, all freshmen now take a course that's designed to introduce them to the rigors of college work, introduce them to the various majors in business, to leadership, and to help connect them to fellow students so they have a sense of community here in the College of Business Administration."
Many people say we're a large college that feels small.
And I like that.
"Hi I'm Clark Cunningham, are you from Germany."
"I think it was a fantastic way for me personally, I'm from out of state so it's kind of hard for me to get to know people."
"It was a really great way for me to experience new cultures, get to meet people."
"We're all doing something that's new to us, we're all in this new environment and I thought it was fantastic."
The University of Nebraska is a city within a city.
Get to know as many people as you possibly can.
Speakers like alumnus Aaron Davis and Husker legend Dr. Tom Osborne speak to our freshman class.
They stress the importance of meeting new people and both are examples of the rich traditions of this university.
This fall we rolled out a new major in supply chain management.
We also revised our management major to include a new track in entrepreneurship.
"Finally, we started a new minor in business designed especially for non-business majors from all the other colleges around the campus."
And it's been very well received.
"This summer, I attended the CBA Nebraska at Oxford Program along with 71 students from the University of Nebraska."
"The program, held at one of the most prestigious schools in the world, is the largest study abroad program at the university and has flourished over the last 24 years."
"All these great things happening here in the College of Business Administration would not be possible without the support of you, our friends, our alums, and our business partners."
"In fact, we've just wrapped up our annual CBA partnership summit and advisory board meetings."
More than 170 individuals from all over the nation give of their time and talents serving on our 12 advisory boards.
We're fortunate to have such loyal volunteers who take an active interest in CBA.
"As you can see, it's a great time to be part of the College of Business Administration."
Thank you for your interest and support and I encourage you to continue to engage in our CBA community.
CBA's the place to be.
You'll be hearing more from me soon.

"When you quit smoking, it's like there's a good self on one side saying,"
"But unfortunately, half the reason why I wanted to make this video is because part of what he's saying, at least in my experience, a lot of guys don't understand."
"Ponytail makes the argument in one statement that the swimmers are broad-shouldered and flat-chested with little waists, and then in the other argument he's saying that they flatten them into stubs."
"And, see, that doesn't really make sense, Ponytail,"
"'cause on one hand you're saying it's their body type, and then on the other hand you're saying it's their attire."
Are they flattening their boobs or are they just flat-chested?
"You really don't know what that person looks like, is what you're saying."
"Girls are majestic fucking creatures, just like I said, Ponytail, and you have been tricked yet again by the optical illusion, in this case, of a swimsuit."
"I made a video on my blog channel awhile back about how to trick people into thinking you have big boobs, and basically gave a step-by-step tutorial on how to make your boobs go up to your neck and look gigantic, and you can do that the other way so that you can be good at sports, and it's called a sports bra."
"And in fact, when I was in college,"
"I actually had multiple people introduce themselves to me during the day, when I looked like a little kid, and then introduce themselves to me later at a party in a much different way, because they thought I was two different fucking people."
"And aside from the obvious hair/makeup thing going on, without fail, there was almost always a comment along the lines of,"
[DEEP VOlCE]
"""Whoa!"
"Where did those things come from?"""
[NORMAL VOlCE]
It's like guys don't understand how sports bras work.
"It's like boobs are fucking ghosts, and they're only real if they're in front of your face."
Have you ever tried running with two giant cantaloupes attached to your chest?
"No, you'll give yourself a black eye."
It fucking hurts when you're doing things with your boobies bouncing all over the place.
I'm sorry that it's not aesthetically pleasing to you.
"There is a time and a place for watching girls being sexual objects while doing something athletic, and it's called a strip club."
"So if you'd like to go there, you can go ahead and do that."
Sports bras make you look like you have no tits because you can't do shit with your titties bouncing all up in your face.
"We can't expect you to just know all the secrets of our top-secret titty club, but that doesn't mean that they're not there."
"How dare you, Creepy-Facial-Hair Ponytail, call someone broad-shouldered and flat-chested when you probably have no fucking idea what her titties look like."
So I'm gonna show you what a girl typically working out would look like versus what you want me to look like — but it's still fucking me.
"Oh, hey."
"Don't mind me, I'm just a 12-year-old boy-man-girl lady here to ruin femininity in the Olympics for you."
"Beautiful, huh?"
What's that 12-year-old little boy doing here?
Out to win a gold medal.
"They run the first 10 minutes of the film, and then they stop it dead... and then they run commercials on the screen, and they have a break... where they walk up and down selling ice cream sandwiches and pop corn... completely interrupting the movie."
"And I remember the first time I witnessed that, I turned to someone in the audience and asked..."
"""How many pauses are we going to have to sit through?"""
"And they said, ""just one."" But it's a real interruption."
"So this is a practice that's been going on for a long time in Europe, and now it's come to America."
Why?
Because theater chains are in trouble.
Theater chains just aren't making as much money as they should on their films...
"And also you have to realize that studios have what's called a ""90/10 split"" on the first week."
Most of money goes to the studio.
Only 10% goes to the theater.
"And since most movies these days are what's called ""front loading""..."
They make all of their money in the first couple of weeks...
"Even though the split increases for the theater as it goes out into the second and third and fourth week... or ""frame,"" as they call it in the business... it's just not that much money."
"So commercials, unfortunately I'm afraid, are here to stay."
"When a movie says it's going to start at 1:30, I usually show up a 1:45, and miss all of the commercials... and that's pretty much what I recommend that you do."
"Commercials are, unfortunately, part of the contemporary movie scene, and will stay that way..."
But it's necessary to maintain the theatrical experience... and that's what we really need to do to keep films in theaters.
"I'm Wheeler Winston Dixon, and this is Frame By Frame."
"If you look at the history of the world, a huge fraction of the improvements in the standard of living have come because private businesses have created new products, have given people jobs, have generated profits that raise people out of poverty and allow them to live fruitful and productive lives with reasonable standards of living."
"We can have much more of that, and it will have beneficial effects around the world, if we step back from the excessive regulation and have a much more capitalistic system."
"My name is Jeff Miron, and I'm Director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University."
I want to talk about three myths about capitalism.
The first is that being pro-capitalism is the same as being pro-business.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
"The point of capitalism is to make sure that businesses have to compete vigorously against each other, and that benefits consumers."
It's not good for the businesses per se because they have to work really hard.
"So many businesses understand this, and they hate capitalism."
"They're constantly trying to get government to erect various rules, restrictions, regulations that help them, but they're not in the interest of the consumers."
So pro-capitalism is good for consumers.
That's who we're ultimately trying to help.
A second myth is that capitalism generates an unfair distribution of income.
"Given 12, we would have to resort to trial-and-error to find matching exponents."
How hard is this?
"Well, with small numbers, it's easy; but if we used a prime modulus which is hundreds of digits long, it becomes impractical to solve."
"Even if you had access to all computational power on Earth, it could take thousands of years to run through all possibilities."
So the strength of a one-way function is based on the time needed to reverse it.
"Now, this is our solution:"
"First, Alice and Bob agreed publicly on a prime modulus and a generator, in this case 17 and 3."
"Then, Alice selects a private random number, say 15, and calculates 3 to the power 15 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Bob."
"Then, Bob selects his private random number, say 13, and calculates 3 to the power 13 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Alice."
"And now the heart of the trick,"
"Alice takes Bob's public result and raises it to the power of her private number to obtain the shared secret, which in this case is 10."
"Bob takes Alice's public result and raises it to the power of his private number, resulting in the same shared secret."
"Notice they did the same calculation, though it may not look like it at first."
"Consider Alice, the 12 she received from Bob was calculated as 3 to the power 13 mod 17, so her calculation was the same as 3 to the power 13 to the power 15 mod 17."
"Now consider Bob, the 6 he received from Alice was calculated as 3 to the power 15 mod 17, so his calculation was the same as 3 to the power 15 to the power 13."
Notice they did the same calculation with the exponents in the different order.
"When you flipped the exponent, the result doesn't change."
"So they both calculated 3 raised to the power of their private numbers, without one of these private numbers, 15 or 13."
Eve will not be able to find the solution.
And this is how it's done.
"While Eve is stuck grinding away at the discrete logarithm problem and with large enough numbers, we can say it's practically impossible for her to break the encryption in a reasonable amount of time."
This solves the key exchange problem.
It can be used in conjunction with a pseudorandom generator to encrypt messages between people who've never met.
"What we're going to do right now is a recurrence relation, which is a kind of recursive mathematical function, which is a good match for this recursive algorithmic expression for Rec_Russian--"
Rec_Russian recurrence relation.
"Looking at the structure of Rec_Russian, if a is 0, then it's going to execute 1 statement-- basically the test to see whether it's 0 and returns."
"Otherwise, if a is bigger than 0 and even, let's take a look at what Rec_Russian does in that case."
"We come in here with a number that is even and greater than 0 is going to execute the condition of this if statement, which fails so there's 1 of that."
Then 1 more to do this plus it's going to recursively workout the value of this quantity.
Then one more operation to multiply that by 2.
I call a total of 3 plus however long it takes to multiply a over 2 times b.
We don't know what that is.
- so accepting.
And that builds up.
"The most powerful emotion which I know, the inspiration of peace in deep meditation, and that has moved me to tears."
I've cried many times as a monk.
"But not out of grief, or out of anger, or out of frustration."
"Just cried out of pure inspiration, beauty, joy, delight, either in seeing amazing inspiring feats of others or just seeing the beauty and peace in your own heart."
This is actually what happens and why I've often said that it's the females in general do better in deep meditation.
"Simply because they have more familiarity, in general I'm saying, because there are many exceptions"
- and you're probably one of them [laughter].
"But I've noticed that because you do need that emotional sensitivity to be able to allow these positive emotions to grow, to be able to develop them in the first place."
Deep meditation is a powerful emotional state.
It's not a blanking out.
It's not an intellectual state.
It's what you feel - deeply.
"The whole point of mindfulness is being deeper where you already are - feeling it, being it."
"Not with thought, with this mindfulness which can accept the power of a still mind."
Those forces get very very strong.
I'd say the highest emotion I've ever felt are the emotions in deep meditation.
So still but incredibly powerful.
"They move you to become monk, they move you to stay as a monk, they move you to teach, they empower you."
So these are the very highest emotions.
"So in Buddhism we're not saying you should be this emotionless zombie, like a robot, because that's what sometimes people think."
"They think when you meditate you can't get any rise out of you, you're not supposed to tell jokes, or laugh at jokes, you're supposed to be like this automaton who doesn't feel because you're supposed to have no craving, no emotions, no attachment, you're never unhappy, you're never happy, you're sometimes in this middle just like.."
If that was the case I would never be a monk.
"We start the path with the corners of our mouth turned downwards, in the middle part of the path the corners of our mouth are horizontal, as the path develops those corners go higher and higher and higher [laughs]."
It's great seeing these enlightened masters in places like Thailand - and they're the happiest people who would really laugh.
"That told me something, that the goal of this is not being emotionally dead."
The goal of this path is having those negative emotions transcended and replaced by this beautiful inspiring peaceful kind compassionate empathetic emotions.
Caused by letting go of control.
Caused by kindness.
Caused by the great gentleness of respect to every moment.
"That way whatever's happening to you in your life, the negative emotions, make peace with them, they're going to pass, they're part of things."
And we raise the a little more.
And so I will show you now s- some of the results for maxima.
So I only go now for constructive interference.
And I have done this for three different distances.
"Those of you who are 5 meters away from me, 10 meters away from me, and 15 meters away from me."
"And what you see on the left side is going to be X, that is the linear separation, and these, so these were in meters, forgive me but I will do these in centimeters."
"And this is X1, if you are 5 meters away from me, you will have -- I will put X1 a"
"little lower than I have it now, you will see shortly why I put it a little lower -- X1, this is about 38 centimeters."
So the linear separation from one to the next is 38 centimeters.
"And you're 10 meters away, it's double that, that's no surprise, 76 centimeters."
And if you're 15 meters away it is 113 centimeters.
"And then X2, which is the position where you have another maximum, would be at 76 centimeters and it would be at 152 centimeters, and it would be at 228 centimeters if you're 15 meters away from me."
"So the minima will fall almost exactly in between, and so the minima where, in an ideal case there is no sound at all, sound plus sound gives silence, think about it, sound plus sound will give silence, will be when you are roughly at 19 centimeters, half of this, this will be 38 centimeters."
"Half of this, and here will be something like 57 centimeters."
"And you can calculate what these values are, they are exactly in between."
"And so the conclusion is that if you're 5 meters away from me and you're near the center line, but you can also be a little bit in this direction, that the separation between bright sound,"
"loud sound, which is always at zero of course in the middle, to silence is 19 centimeters."
And then you move another 19 centimeters and then you hear loud sound.
"If you are however 10 meters away from me, just past the cameras, then you have to move 38 centimeters to go from loud sound to silence."
"And if you're all the way in the audience, in the back of the audience, it's more like 60 centimeters."
And this is what we're going to do now together.
I want you all to stand up and I'm going to make you listen to 3000 hertz.
And what I want you to do when
"I turn on the two loudspeakers, I want you to move your head very slowly and try to find locations where you hear silence."
"The position of silence is extremely well-defined, so don't go too fast, you miss it, also keep in mind that there are reflections of the sound from the walls, and from the blackboard, and so the pattern that I have calculated here is not perfect."
But you will see that there will be locations where sound plus sound will give you silence.
[tone]
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
"If the separation between a lot of sound and silence is 19 centimeters, that's about the separation of your ears, you dummies, so one ear could be at a maximum, the other ear could be at a minimum, so at least close one ear."
How can that be?
"We just computed that on the one hand I, we I thought we had this symmetry relation."
Relativity tells us that if the black twin sees the blue clock running slow so does the blue twin see the black clock running slow.
What ruins relativity here?
"Well, when you think about it."
It's pretty clear that these two twins are not related by Lorentz Transformation.
"They were related by Lorentz Transformation, as long as twin number one, two was moving to the right at this constant speed, v. But there is a big difference in their life histories."
"And the big difference occurs, of course, here, at this instant."
Twin
Number two jumped from one spaceship to the other.
He was not inertial.
At that instant twin number two was actually accelerating.
"Not only that but as I drew it, since his velocity changed instantaneously the rate of change of his velocity was infinite."
He was experiencing an infinite acceleration.
"So that's not very realistic, but it makes the calculation simple."
But this is why the.
"Life history of the two twins is different, it's different and it's not, you don't expect symmetry if blue thinks black clock runs slow then black thinks blue clock runs slow, the difference is that one of them accelerated and the one who accelerated will be younger and this is brought out by drawing some auxiliary world lines here, so what I've done is at this event, event number one."
"I took, I drew before the t double prime axis the world line of the moving twin as h e returns."
I can now draw the auxiliary light cone and therefore the x double prime axis.
And here we see the resolution to the mystery because remember before I suggested that we introduce event number two over here which is.
What is this?
"This event is from the point of view of the blue twin of the, the moving twin as long as he is moving away from earth, event number two is simultaneous with event number one."
"So if these guys were exchanging messages then indeed when he decided to change The, to, to jump ships."
"The moving twin was, would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was."
And in just as the stationary twin would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was.
"Until that point, everybody's inertial, and life is symmetric."
But at the moment that he jumps ships.
"What happens is that, now, simul-, what he considers, when he's moving to the left, to be simultaneous with this same event #one is actually event #three over here."
Is line of simultaneity changed because you changed velocities instantaneously.
"So in particular over the instantaneous jump from ship to ship, his brother aged this much."
All of this aging took place essentially instantaneously during the instant that the moving twin jumped chips.
"This is the resolution.This is where the symmetry is broken, indeed this segment."
"And of course as soon as you bring a node into the set X, into the [inaudible] territory, you have to commit or Dijkstra's algorithm chooses to commit to a shortest path distance and a shortest path."
"What is the definition of its shortest path distance, as computed by"
Djikstra?
Well it's just a degree score.
"So it's going to assign the vertex t the shortest path distance of minus two, and the path is going to be just the arc S t."
But notice that this is in fact wrong.
"The shortest path distance from S to t is not minus two, in this graph."
"There is another path, namely the one that goes thorough V that has length minus four, less than minus two."
"So, [inaudible] computes incorrect shortest path distances on this trivial 3-note graph."
"So t o summarize the story so far, We've described Dijkstra's algorithm."
I've shown you that it works in a very simple example that doesn't have negative edge lines and I've showed you that it doesn't work in and even simpler example that does have negative edge
lines.
"So, I've both given you some plausibility that it might work generally at least for non negative edges links."
But I've also tried to sew some seeds of doubt that it's not an all clear if at this point if Dijkstra's algorithm is always clear correct or not even if you have non-negative edge lengths and certainly if it is always correct there better be a fool proof argument to why.
You should be demanding and explanation of a claim If Dijkstra's is correct in any kind of generality.
That's the subject of the next video.
Now let's find the sum of squares for within subject variability.
This one's a
little harder.
We take the sum of each value and subtract the respective mean.
Then square it.
Then we add them all together.
This is a little trickier.
You need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respected mean.
Square them and then add them all up.
Do the same for every sample.
And then add up each sum of squares.
"You're welcome to enter your calculations here, but that part won't be graded."
Only the complete sum of squares for within groups will be graded.
"There are many people who experience discrimination in healthcare here in Oregon, but members of our transgender communities face healthcare discrimination at a systemic and unparalleled level."
"As the mayor mentioned, the American Medical Association has identified transgender health care as being medically necessary."
"Yet many transgender Oregonians are routinely denied the ability to even purchase health insurance, or are denied the coverage for basic medically necessary care solely on the basis of their gender identity."
Not only with the poor but also with young people.
"Because in Davos, I saw that the owners of technology are mostly young."
"And so, the young people own the future."
"And so, and these are exciting times."
"I realize that that's also, you know, what innovation is about."
"Always have aspirations, always have hope so that - because aspiration drives innovation, invention and creation."
Thank you.
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.
"Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing for penetration testing purposes."
"And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with random testing sort of in the general software robustness."
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
"On many an occasion I've been camping in the Adirondacks, and one of my favorite periods is right at dusk, when the lake becomes absolutely glass-like."
"The sun is setting but you can still see the silhouettes of trees - all these conical spires, beautiful reflection on the water with the last few bits of sunlight."
And then you hear the wail of a loon.
"You'll hear one individual of the pair give this long, mournful wail, which is essentially saying,"
"""I'm here."
"Where are you?"""
"Generally, moments later, you'll hear the response from the other member of the pair giving its wail, saying,"
"""I'm over here."""
Loons are active at night.
"You can be out in a beautiful Adirondack lake after dark, or a northern Minnesota lake, and this is one of the characteristic, evocative sounds you're going to hear from that area - something that'll stick with you for the rest of your life."
"It just punctuates the fall of night and really sets the mood for what follows: the solitude, the peacefulness."
It's all wrapped up in that one vocalization.
Thorotrast was a contrast medium used in Germany since 1890.
"It was used in Japan since 1930, but it was found that 25 to 30% of people developed liver cancer 20 to 30 years later."
Why does it take so long before cancer develops?
Thorotrast is an alpha-radiation nuclide.
"Alpha radiation injures nearby cells, and the DNA that is harmed most is a gene called ""P53""."
"We now know, thanks to genome science, the entire sequence of human DNA."
"However, there are 3 million locations on the DNA that are different from person to person."
"So today, it doesn't make sense at all to proceed as if all humans are the same."
"The basic principle should be the ""personalized medicine"" when we look at internal radiation - which DNA is damaged, and what kind of change is taking place."
The only real rule here is to make sure that all the crossings are distinct.
"Next, make it start weaving- follow the curve around and that each crossing alternate going under and over until you've assigned all the crossings."
"Then put on the finishing touches, and voila!"
"You try it again, adding a little artistic flair to the lines."
"The cool part is that the weaving always works out perfectly, when you're going around alternating over and under and get to a crossing you've already assigned, it will always be the right one."
"This is very interesting, and we'll get back to it later."
But first I'd like to point out 2 things: one is that this works for any number of closed curves on the plane.
So go ahead and link stuff up or make a weaving out of 2 colors of yarn.
The other is that this doodle also works out for snakes on a plane as long as you keep the head and tail on the outside or on the same inside face. because mathematically it's the same as if they linked up or just actually link up the head and tail into an Ouroboros.
"For example, here's 3 Ourobori in a configuration known as the Borromean Rings which has the neat property that no 2 snakes are actually linked with each other."
"Also because I like naming things, this design shall henceforth be known as the ""OuroBorromean Rings""."
"But you are me, after all, so you're finding a lot to think about even with just drawing one line that isn't a snake."
"Such as, ""What kinds of knots are you drawing?"""
"""And can you classify them?"""
"For example, these 3 knots all have 5 crossings but 2 are essentially the same knot and one is different."
Knot theory questions are actually really difficult and interesting but you're going to have to look that one up yourself.
"Oh, and you should also learn how to draw rope because it's an integral part of knot theory."
"So integral, in fact, that if you draw a bunch of integral signs in a row, a sight which is often quite daunting to a mathematician, you can just shade it in, and TA-DA."
"But, being able to draw snakes is also super useful especially as this doodle game is excellent for producing Dark Mark tattoo designs."
"Also, this doodle game can be combined with the stars doodle game."
"For example, if this pentagram gets knighted, it will henceforth be known as ""Serpentagram"""
"Also notice that this snake is a 5 twist Mobius strip so you could also call it a ""Mobiaboros"" but we'll get back to one-sidedness later."
"Or, if you want to draw something super complicated"
"like the 8th square star, combining snakes and stars is a great technique for that too."
Here's a boa that ate 8 8gons.
"The creativity that your mind is forced into during these boring classes, is both a gift and a burden."
But here's a few authentic doodles using these techniques that I did when I was in college.
Just to show you I'm not making all this up.
"These are from a freshmen music history class, because I happen to be able to find this notebook."
But this is a doodle I actually did most often during my 9th grade Italian class.
Language being another subject usually taught by unfathomably stupid methods.
"For example, these snakes are having trouble communicating because one speaks in Parseltongue and the other speaks in Python."
My question is around working in a country or a continent like ours where there is so much social inequity.
"And those of us who are teaching, many of us are probably working in schools where much of the leadership and ourselves does not reflect the backgrounds of our students."
We are probably dealing with folks who are coming from backgrounds and inherited ancestry of inequity in our area.
My question is -and I was especially drawn towards Jon.
He said in a biography in the book about working with creating spaces for sanghas of color in creating retreats even  for people of color practicing this.
I am wondering what you can say  to us about what we can do to demonstrate our mindfulness and  our sensitivity to that with our students.
But also encourage us to release.
What we want to hold on to is our story of pain and suffering.
How it is stopping us for going forward.
"And that is a very not politically  correct thing to say, encouraging us to release  what pain we can, especially when it is around our identity is being racial or ethnic one down to the rest of society."
I am curious of what you  have to say to us about that.
"(J.K. Salunga) I think I'll try to respond,"
Maybe I can have a conversation with you afterwards to share my experience.
I think the issue of difference is something that is definitely a very rich area for mindfulness practice.
To be able to have that just like an area of contemplation.
I think you even raising this question it is a very nice question.
That would be the same even for me when I work with students that  might be second language learners and working through any sort of differences.
So I really appreciate your question.
"I think, if I can share about the people of color, that are mostly my students,"
I think that space there is the space that sometimes people may not fully understand.
But I think it is an issue of safety.
"So maybe I can ask you how do you communicate safety  in your classroom, so that students feel like whether they are different from you, there is a sense of safety there,  that they can do that."
Or maybe you are being able to share  about resources that are available.
I think those are just maybe  quick things that are coming to mind.
"But I think those spaces for me,  in terms of supporting that cultivation, it is way be safe, so that you can go in and be able to explore some other things that sometimes in other spaces that type of environment is not readily available."
"There are obstacles to being able to enter, and explore and work."
"So I can end here,  we'll talk later."
"(R. Brady) I'd like to add one thing to that, if I may."
"In our recent conference  of mindfulness in education, we had a psychologist, Sam Himelstein, who works with incarcerated youth."
"Most of the young people  are members of gangs, perpetrators of violence  and victims of violence."
He talked about one of his colleagues  in his organization who he described as a nerd.
"He said, ""This is the last person you would expect to be able  to relate to the clientele."
"If you don't take advantage of the talent, you're inefficient."
"If there is a lot of competition, you'll get displaced."
"However, there's a second type of discrimination: statistics."
And this is one is much more persistent.
I'd say this one is recognized by those of you who work in human resources and it has a lot to do with the gap hypothesis.
Think about the employer of the previous example who must decide who to promote.
Both candidates are 30 and have no children.
It's about a promotion to a high managing position.
Both have a very good CV.
Who will you promote?
"Statistically, we observe that for people who are 30 and have no kids, the probability of having children in the near future is quite high."
"Also statistically, empiric evidence shows, there is a quite high percentage of women that slow their career when they have kids, but very few men do that."
"For example, taking up part-time, or reduce the working shift when they have kids."
"From a human resources point of view, if we think about maximizing the company's profit, with incomplete information and uncertainty, and based on statistics, because they don't know the candidates personally, maybe they will choose to promote him and not her."
"Because that was their only difference, one was a woman and the other a man."
In that case discrimination happens.
But it's not based on prejudices or misogyny
like with the previous example.
It is much more rational.
It's a rational managing of an organization that we want to make profit.
"It may be unpleasant, but it is not based on the wrong values, because it is only financial managing."
"This is much more subtle, and, therefore, as I pointed out, it is much harder to get rid off."
"Competition is not going to displaced it,"
It is based on what we just mentioned in the gap hypothesis or concrete ceiling. that we just mentioned.
"If we believe the explanation of discrimination based on gender in the labor market is mainly here,"
"- because Gary Becker's theory, in my opinion, is very useful in order to explain discrimination against other type of minorities, for example, ethnic minorities,"
"like religious, cultural differences, etc."
"There it is true that sometimes there is xenophobia, pure prejudice."
"""I don't like to work,"" says the employer, for example, ""with Latin Americans,"" or something like that."
That is a person with a certain ideology
that will end up being inefficient because they don't make the most of it.
But this other is different.
"There is I think, though, a difference between a fix-up, what I call a composite novel."
A composite novel takes these pieces and it puts them together in such a way that you actually have something more powerful or at least different than you would have if you had the separate pieces.
"For example, I, Robot by Isaac Asimov began as separate pieces."
The seperate pieces all obeyed what were called the Three Laws of Robotics that
"John W. Campbell, the second great editor of"
"Science Fiction after Hugo Gernsback, suggested to, to Aasimov."
Here are the three laws of robotics.
"A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."
"Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except in cases when the orders would conflict with the first law."
"So, robots are our slaves unless of course we ask them to do something that would harm us in which case they are suppose to resist us."
"Three, a robot must protect its own existence."
"As long as, such protection does not conflict with the first or second law."
"So, robots are pretty valuable."
"Entities, and they have a survival instinct but their survival instinct is subordinated to human beings' orders, and human beings' orders are subordinated to the survival of human beings."
Robots are clearly second class citizens.
"Now if you think about this for a while, you'll realize that these laws are impossible."
Alright.
"You know that saying about people who are exercising hard, they're training for one contest or another and they say, no pain, no gain."
"How is the robot to know that the pain that you are asking for is worth it to you, when the robot's law says it may not allow you to injure or harm yourself?"
"But, but I'm training for a marathon."
"One of the best stories in I, Robot is a story in which the two technicians who are, who occur in the stories in the in the collection, set up a robot to beam energy down to Earth."
This huge solar collector is not interfered with by the atmosphere that's why its up there and the microwave that they beam down to Earth are going to provide enormous power basically for free.
"It's terrific but if that solar collection station should wander a little bit, the beam would traverse the Earth and God knows what damage it would cause all that power."
"So, rather than relying on human beings to keep that beam on beam, they set up a robot, a very skilled robot."
"After they've got the robot up there, checking it out, making sure everything is working fine before they leave the station in the hands of the robot."
"And they get into a discussion you see, they congratulate each other on having gotten this robot put together and being able to leave."
"And the robot says huh, you didn't make me."
And they say ofcourse we made you [laugh].
And the robot says how could you make me?
I'm superior to you.
What do you mean you're superior?
Well if you aren't superior to me why do you want me to do this job.
You may recognize him.
"This is Brian May from the rock band Queen, who's actually a PhD astronomer, it should be said."
"And Brian, not right now, not in this image, but Brian is  an avid Galaxy Zoo classifier."
He inspired many other people to come to Galaxy Zoo and join in.
He inspired in particular this woman.
"This is Hanny van Arkel, who's a teacher in the Netherlands."
"As you can see, she's got a guitar that's just like Brian's."
"Anything that he did, she was going to do."
"And so she took up Galaxy Zoo too, and she became the first person in history to pay attention to this object."
And this illustrates the ability of humans to get distracted from what they are supposed to be doing.
What we wanted Hanny to do was classify the galaxy.
It's a Warped Spiral.
A rather beautiful one.
"But of course like you, she wanted to know what the blob underneath was and she called it a ""Voorwerp"", which I believe is Dutch for ""thingy"", a term which I'm proud to say we've worked into the scientific literature."
Because this object is literally one in a million.
We didn't know it was there.
"It's a gas cloud, a galaxy sized gas cloud, hanging in space, energized by a jet, driven by a black hole in that neighboring galaxy, which has recently shifted from being an active black hole to a quiet one."
"It's a process that we knew happened, but never before have we managed to catch a galaxy in the act, catch it in the act of this transformation."
"But because we had so many eyes and we could pay individual attention to each image, we were able to catch this and follow it up."
"We also discovered that, as astronomers, we're not the only people  struggling with this data flood, with having more information than we knew what to do with."
"This is a problem that confronts scientists in field, after field, after field."
"And so after the last few years, we've helped researchers not just look at galaxies, but provide the most accurate forecasts of whether solar flares are going to hit the Earth with a project called ""Solar Stormwatch""."
"We've transcribed more than a million log book pages from World War I Royal Navy logs to help climate scientists understand  the weather of the past, and thus predict the weather of the future."
"We have a side project, trying to find out whether wales have accents."
"And we're also helping cancer scientists in the UK do that pathology by classifying images, like the one on the screen."
Each of these projects makes use of the time and the pattern recognition abilities of hundreds of thousands of people.
It uses them collectively to accelerate science.
"We've collected all of these projects together in what we call the ""Zooniverse"", a platform for this kind of citizen science a place where people can sit in front of their web browsers and, within a few minutes, see something  that no one has ever seen before, and, more importantly, make an authentic contribution to science."
"This is science education, but it's also the cutting edge."
People actually get to help us.
Even that's not the exciting part.
"Magical things happen once you convince people that they too can take part in science, once you convince them that they have  the ability to contribute."
We see that the total salary for Y is 300 in the total salaries for Z is 70.
"And if you check, cross-check this result against the data you'll see that these are indeed the total salaries when we take the managers we specified for projects Y and Z. And finally our last and most fun example."
"The one to find how to fly from point A to point be when all we're concerned about is cost, and we don't care how many times we have to change planes."
"So, here's the little flights table"
"I've set up, and I used A and B so we can literally fly from point"
"A to point B. All of our intermediate destinations are actually real airport codes, and I've put in some airlines, although they're not actually going to be used in our query."
And then I've put in the cost of the flights.
"You might want to draw yourself a little graph so you can see what's going on, and we can fly from"
"A to Chicago for 200, from Chicago to B for another 100, or we can go from A to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Las Vegas. to Las Vegas to oh-oh, I don't remember what this is."
"CMH, Detroit, Cincinnati, somewhere in the midwest."
And from there to point
"B, or we can take a non-stop from A to"
B on good old Jet Blue for 195.
"So clearly we're never going to be going through Chicago for a total of 300 with that Jet Blue flight. but I've set up the data, as you're probably not surprised, so that this"
"long route through Phoenix and Las Vegas and somewhere in the midwest is, in fact, gonna be our cheapest way to go."
"So now let's take a look at the recursive query that's going to find us our root from point A to point B, or at least find us the cheapest way to get from point A to point"
"B. So the first query I'm going to show actually gives us all the different costs of getting from A to B, just so we can see those enumerated for us, and then we'll modify the query to give us the cheapest cost."
So here's the recursive query and we're going to use a recursively defined relation called root.
And root says that we can get from an origin to a destination for a particular total cost.
OK?
"So, we again in our recursion have the base query and the recursive query."
This is exactly what you'd imagine.
"We can certainly get from point X to point Y for a total cost, if we can take a direct flight from point X to point Y for a given cost."
"So that's our base query, we start out with all of the direct flights in our route relation."
And then we start adding routes by doing the JOlN of a route with a additional flight.
"So basically what this join here says, ""If I can get from the origin in a route to the destination and then that destination is the origin of another flight, then"
I can add that flight.
"I can start with my original origin, final destinationand the cost of that is going to be the total that I already had."
Plus the cost of the new flight and that's my new total.
"So again, this is another transitive closer like recursion."
It's very similar to the ancestor recursion.
Very similar to expanding the company hierarchy.
"You must be able to use it in your own life to be better to live, also to get closer to yourself and other people."
Martin:
"And on a scale of 1 to 10, how far are modern philosophy from doing exactly that?"
Ole:
"Um, unfortunately it is very far from it."
"There was the existentialist group which, according to its name tried to do these things."
But the Anglo-Saxon tradition which has been very tied to a science ideal.... have tried to think philosophy little as one thinks of science and that is thinking philosophy out of life.
"I've spent most of my time to philosophise about the event and the body, but most of the event and the event is the center of our lives so I have been forced to make a personal philosophy."
Martin:
And ofcause you have been bullied for doing that?
Ole:
"I was bullied for it, yes and I was bullied for that I have allowed myself to do it and not just have sat and interpret other thinkers, as many prefer to do especially when you are Dane .."
"A Dane may not have his/hers own project then you must be dead like ""Løgstrup"" simply more or less people start to accredited that you have your own project. . Martin: and that is when you have read all the philosophers and know them by heart, but it takes some years.."
Ole:
It takes some years and you will not always learn from it I would say
Martin:
"And you can end up becomming very tired.. but now philosophy be the foundation of all knowledge, so if philosophy is a crisis, then, many things are in crisis, or does it reflect the fact that many things are in crisis?"
Ole:
"I think that it does, in the sense that we, in an absurd way is starting to find out that we have a social nuisance and that we are not some evolutionary war machines"
"We are nice and friendly and is tuned to be close to each other, but in spite of it you become the more and more confused about what man is, the more expertise you get.. and as you become more and more confused about the universe,, now is all rags is the pulled away beneath physics because the particles turns out to be a little bit faster than they are allowed to be ..."
Martin: they should preferably not be faster than light ..
Ole:
"No, and it's been confirmed once again, which isn't a good thing, is it.."
That's what Giordano Bruno (Filippo Bruno) was burned at the stake for saying (Feb.
"17) in 1600, he said there were many universes, and ofcause there are many universes .."
"There are some galaxies that are very busy at the edge of our universe and why are they suddenly very busy out there, well it's probably because there is something that pulls them further out.. it is something you can measure.."
Martin:
"Yes, and one could say that I am one step ahead"
Of course I can not reveal all my knowledge to the earthlings for what we are doing is an education project or a maturation project for Earthlings and that is also why this the transition to the big change is as it is..
"This maturation change man must go through because it will benefit the rest of the universe and that is why, some of us must push a little onwards, because otherwise it just wont work but you're one of those who are pushing onwards what sort of imbalances is it you are pushing?"
What is it you philosophically believe to successfully push today?
Ole:
Lots of things we collaborated in.
"They would call us to kind of interview us, but what they really wanted was for us to give them a chronicle."
"It's a typical trap: ""interview a journalist to get a free article"". that happened a lot."
And to tell you the truth we got the impression that it was all pretty well understood.
"A journalist from the New York Times came just after the local and regional elections, she called me so we could have breakfast together and I could bring her up to date because she didn't know how or what or who... and after she wrote a very sociological article without including any of the stereotypes or anything wierd."
It was all very correct.
"I think it was contextualised within the international economic crisis, that was the plot of the main international media companies with the 15M."
"There is a serious economic crisis, and a long time before the ""No nos representan"" came along, they aligned their editorials with the economic crisis and people protesting in the street because of the 4 million unemployed."
And I think that was the plot of the majority of the big international media corporations those days.
ST:
"To finish, if you want to add anything else, anything you consider important or you wish to reformulate."
Now's the time.
JL:
No [he thinks]
I think that...
I don't want it to be a sound byte or anything.
"What I mean is that if there's really a fervour amongst the citizens for there to be new spaces for public debate, new spaces for public debate, that these new spaces in the street and on the internet should be able to force the public and private powers that be into behaving a different way."
And we should be wary of the media.
Keep our eyes on those who keep their eyes on us.
"If we want everythingt to be like that, and I do 100%"
"I want it to be like that, and these new spaces for debate are created, people have to remember, we all have to remember that we need a different way to make money circulate."
Through speeches and debates we need there to be a new and different way for money to circulate.
"That's open source, creative commons, common benefit, which also needs financing obviously."
"It's about this film and projects that are being undertaken, it's about Periodismo Humano and projects that are yet to be created."
I think that's the lesson which I don't know if it's been absorbed.
"It's really necessary for there to be new spaces, but those spaces have to be sustainable in some way."
Maybe the best way is not to just put money into them.
I don't know how.
"But the lesson to be learnt here is how debate and enrichening can be made sustainable, regarding political participation, public life, demands, social life... so that it's posible to solve those things that we don't like about our society."
"That's the question, I think."
It's the question I don't know the answer to.
I have my own personal bets but I don't have the magic recipe.
"And their language classes, much like math classes, focus too much on memorization and not enough on immersion"
"But just pretend you're in math class,"
learning about graph theory so that I can draw the parallels because here's the 2nd doodle game which is very much mathematically related.
Draw a squiggle all over the page and make sure it closes up.
Pick an outside section and color it in.
Now you want to alternate coloring so that no 2 faces of the same color touch.
"Curiously enough, much like the weaving game, this game always mathemagically works out."
"It also works really well if you make the lines spiky instead of a smooth curve and once again, it works with multiple lines too."
"It probably has something to do with the 2 colorability of graphs of even degree, which might even be what your teacher is trying to teach you at this very moment for all you're paying attention."
But maybe you can chat with him after class about snakes and he'll explain it to you because I'd rather move on to the next doodle game.
This is a combination of the last 2
Step 1: draw a smooth closed curve
Step 2: assign overs and unders
Step 3: shade in every other face
"After that, it takes a little artistic finesse to get the shading right, but you end up with some sort of really neat surface."
"For example, this one only has one edge and one side but if you're interested in this, you should really be talking to your resident topology professor and not me."
"But here's the thing: if someone asked you 5 minutes ago what tangled up snakes, demented checkerboards, and crazy twisty surfaces have in common? what would you have answered?"
This is why I love mathematics: the moment when you realize that something seemingly arbitrary and confusing is actually part of something.
"It's better than the cleverest possible ending to any crime show or mystery novel, because that's only the beginning."
"Anyway, have fun with that."
Sugaring is a topic of hair removal that comes up often.
And let's clear up all the myths about it.
"First of all, it's from decades and decades ago."
It was a type of wax people used to make from sugar.
"It's a very inexpensive way of doing it, because you can actually go on the internet and find out how to make this wax at home."
But this is sugar wax.
"I don't recommend it, it doesn't get the fine hairs if it's coarse, so it's not the best."
"And then also in the past there have places that have come out with, like, a sugar wax just because of the name, it was more of a marketing kind of thing."
So my point is stay away from sugaring.
"There's plenty of high-tech, result-oriented waxes out there that give you a great result."
You don't really need to make a wax at home.
"Sugaring doesn't work great, because you have to keep going it over and over, but, I mean, you could make a great sugaring product, but, I mean, there's things out there, like, why go backwards?"
"It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building."
"The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this."
What's interesting about it is not the shape.
What's interesting about it is how it's made.
How it's made.
"A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization."
"No, it is not an oxymoron."
"What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again."
That's why we all live in developer houses.
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
That's because it's cheaper.
"Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts."
"The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine."
It doesn't care.
It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost.
It doesn't spend any extra time.
"It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time."
"Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,"
"like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."""
"And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals."
"Just simple ""Bolt A to B"" and they will be able to put them together."
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end.
"You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura."
"Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series."
"And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?"
"In the summer, you go to the beach."
"And when you go to the beach, what do you get?"
You get sand dunes.
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
"They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood."
So he's surrounded by drug addicts and drunks.
"And so, there are no village models."
We have
lost the fathers in our home and the heroes in our communities.
And the fourth is that he's in a survival mode.
And so the environment is quite predatory and mercenary.
And fifth is that it's a subsistence economy.
"We call it ""Isang kahig, Isang tuka""."
"One scratch, one peck."
And so we realize that a country that does not deserve to be poor is poor.
A country that has a tradition of very strong Christian values is one of the most corrupt.
"And so, this was the source of my midlife crisis."
And I realized too that I just follow the old patterns.
"You know, send your children to the most exclusive schools, become successful,"
live in an exclusive subdivision and just create your own artificial bubble of security and comfort in a sea of third world poverty.
And I realize that that's not the kind of legacy I wanted to pass on to my children.
They cannot wander in the - they cannot walk the streets in safety.
"And especially the most successful, they are also the most vulnerable to crime and to rebellion."
"At the same, in the countryside, the poor continued to be the most vulnerable to the calamities, to the typhoons and to the floods."
"So I realized too that at 35, I was at the prime of my life, I had so much energy, why was I so unhappy?"
And that's when I went to the biggest slum in the country called Bagong
"Silang, north of Manila, and started to really discover because I was in search of my soul, as a Filipino, as a Christian and as a human being."
And I did not find it in the artificial surroundings that I just boxed myself in.
"I lived in an exclusive subdivision with security guards, with high walls."
"And I was surrounded by squatters around me, my people, my family that I did not know."
And so I realized that I had to go beyond my own definition of family.
"I had to consider the poor, the orphans, the criminals, the rebels as my family."
"Otherwise, I will not invest my time, my talent, my treasure, I'll just - it's just convenient to write out a check and just perpetuate this whole tradition of charity."
"So anyway, I realized that it is really about connectivity that the brightest and the best, those with the greatest opportunities are disconnected from our people, are disconnected from the land, are disconnected from the rich natural resources and that's the reason why we're poor."
"You know, there are countries that do not have the fertile land that we have, do not have the biodiversity, the rich natural resources, do not even have our producer - our human resource and our market base, almost 100 million market base."
"And, you know, it's now very interesting for me just coming home from Davos where I was invited two weeks ago."
"And yesterday, it was very fascinating that finally what a - my own reflections about Davos was printed at the Huffington Post."
"It's better not to be associated with me actually because.... (Offscreen) No, no no."
Here we go.
"Thank you, sir."
(Mic) Thanks for all the work you're doing in Britain towards a rational psychedelic use.
"(Mic) Epigenetics, I believe that that's going to become a factor in some of these areas, do you have any information on that?"
"Well we don't do any, we haven't even considered doing any epigenetic studies in humans yet."
"I don't think the technology's there, I suppose one could in animal studies."
"There will be changes I'm sure, I'm sure those layer 5 cells will show epigenetic changes following a single dose."
That's a really interesting thing to do but we don't have that technology.
(Mic) You mentioned that people with depression have higher densities of 5HT2A receptors.
(Mic) Have you seen any connection with that and maybe high tolerance in people with depression?
"That's a really interesting question, yeah."
"We've never, we haven't administered Psilocybin to people with depression yet because we haven't crossed that threshold for getting the drug for clinical use"
"We would love to do that, we'd love to scan people,"
"look at the number of their receptors, look at responsivity the trouble is PET scans are hugely, hugely expensive you're talking twenty thousand dollars a scan we don't have that kind money and we don't have a 2A tracer currently running in our lab but at some stage in the next year or two I think we will have a 2A tracer then if any of you wants to fund that research let me know and we'll do it, alright?"
(Mic) Speaking of funding research has the success of Drugs Live on Channel 4 continued the conversation about funding further research at all?
Any of your other studies?
"Well, we are negotiating to do another study this year with them, yes."
"Hopefully we can get it done, yeah."
"That won't be with Psilocybin, that will probably be with different sorts of cannabis."
(Mic) Thank you.
"(Mic) At my location in Florida in the sensitive political area, that I4 corridor, gives me the opportunity to meet with a lot of politicians coming through and lets me work as a kind of psychedelic advocate and lobbyist."
(Mic) Are there any names of people I can consult and write to to get better information?
Maybe we can talk afterwards I'm not entirely sure you are saying but you can ask me afterwards.
(Mic) The effect of MDMA has been tied to upping the Oxytocin level and one gets many of the same effects with Psilocybin.
"Camaraderie going up, empathy going up, trust, contentment."
(Mic) Has anyone looked at or have you looked at perhaps the Oxytocin level going up?
"So yeah, we've done that in the MDMA study but I haven't got the results,"
"I haven't got adequate assays of the Oxytocin during it,"
I'm not happy with the reliability of the assay.
"We have not done it with Psilocybin, I don't know why."
"It's just a bit of a chore, we've tried to avoid the need to have needles in people because that does change the way in which they experience the scanning and that but we could do and it is a very good question."
"It means you can't keep the information in the server, you've got to keep it somewhere else."
"One place people put it is on the wire, so you put it in the cookies or you put it in headers, or you put it in secrets fields or in URLs, so you're passing all that information back and forth all the time, which is really inefficient."
"Some people got tired of that and decided OK, let's just put it in the database."
That's an awful place to put it.
That's like the worst possible place in the universe to be putting your ephemeral state.
That's just not where you want to do it.
But you don't have anywhere else.
"Fortunately, there is an alternative."
There's a system called Elko that was developed by
"Chip Morningstar, which is all about maintaining session in these servers."
He's got a device called a session server.
You initially connect to the session server and the session server will determine:
"OK, we'll use one of these servers for your session."
"It'll tell you about it, and it'll tell the server about that, and from that point on, the browser and that particular server have a connection that they preserve through the life of the session."
"The wonderful thing about that is, where does the ephemeral state now go?"
It goes in JavaScript variables that are closed over the event handlers that are in the event queue in the server.
"They are in the best place in the universe, where there is absolutely no cost at getting that information and making it available to the application."
You add that to the node.js now and the amount of work you have to do in order to do a stepwise increment in the
"Ajax application starts to get really, really small."
So you've got some really wonderful stuff now happening in server architecture because of opportunities afforded to us by
JavaScript.
A final thought.
"A little while ago I was talking to a friend of mine — a really bright guy, one of the smartest programmers I know -- about what we should do next with JavaScript."
"I suggested to him that we should get the tail recursion thing going, we should get that fixed."
Why do we want to do that?
"Well, I said, among a lot of other things it would allow us to do continuation style passing."
"I think that would be a useful option for us to be able to provide within the language, and if we don't optimize the tail calls then we don't get that."
His answer was:
"I've never used continuation passing, so I really don't see the value of it, which I immediately recognized as a really stupid answer."
"The way I was able to recognize it so fast is that I have used that same argument myself, and I've been hearing that same argument throughout my entire career."
"Basically, the core of that argument is:"
"""I'm not qualified to make a decision about that."
Hi.
I'm Richard Mckenzie.
"In past lectures, my focus has been on what competitive markets do right, or how they tend to maximize production, and efficiency."
Efficiency.
Giving the constraints of supply and demand.
And make no mistake about it.
Markets do a lot of good in this world.
"Just take a look around at all the goods at your disposal, at prices that are often surprisingly low."
I remain dazzled by how much computing power I can buy today for a few hundred dollars.
"Frankly I'm amazed, at how little the equipment, and software used to produce these video lectures cost."
"To produce this video course, two decades ago would have cost a minor fortune."
Involving any number of people who would need to
"labor away for weeks, to get each video, lecture, in final form."
Thanks to the ongoing competition in technology markets over the past twenty years.
The production of this course really is a one man show.
"Both on the screen, and behind it."
I'm also impressed with how market prices summarize so much information on relative values in costs of.
People around the country and world.
"And with how those, summary prices ease the problems of shopping."
We don't need to know much about the cost of all the components that go into large screen televisions.
"All we have to do is compare the prices, along with their differing features, to make the choice."
That we need to make.
"Over past lectures, I have also shown how some government policies that seek to interrupt or redirect the forces of supply and demand can often have unanticipated and even perverse effects."
"In this and the following lecture, I will seek to explore the conditions under which competitve markets will not work well, or with the full efficiency that we have described."
"In these two lectures, I will deal with problems caused."
Caused by so called externalities.
"Externalities, for economists, are the positive or negative effects that exchanges may have on people who are not involved in market trades."
"They are sometimes called third party effects, or spill over effects."
"When su ch effects are pleasurable, they are called external benefits."
"When they are unpleasant or impose the cost on people other than the buyers or sellers, they are called external costs."
"In this, in the next lecture I will take up external benefits."
"In this lecture I will restrict my discussion of the effects of external costs on the competitive market in terms of their effects on production, prices, and efficiency."
I'm sorry--second question.
I apologize.
You asked a question about the venture arm and M&amp;amp;A strategy.
We have largely been waiting for prices to get better.
A lot of--the good news is we have lots of capital.
"And the bad news is we're still trying to get everybody into the model that we really want in terms of M&amp;amp;A. And I think it'll start soon, but it's pretty inactive right now."
"Sir, go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:"
"You mentioned in your, a few minutes ago here, that you were in strong support of the new increases in the government spending and the stimulus program."
"Could you explain a little bit, perhaps, how you expect to benefit from the new stimulus program?"
"And, what do you say to the argument that if government spending were the answer, the Soviet Union would have been the richest country in the world? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"I have a very long and strong answer to the last part of the question but, in the interest of time, I'll say that we benefit when our customers have jobs, because they buy stuff."
"So any solution that gets the middle class, if you will, to feel more confident, benefits Google--our advertising revenue, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders."
"So, we can debate the specifics."
"As you know, the current stimulus package is--no one has ever done it at this scale before--it's two-thirds as directed spending and one-third is tax credits of one kind or another, much of which goes to the state and local governments and for extended unemployment benefits, and then various things involving the AMT."
"With respect to how Google would specifically benefit beyond that, it's more a question of how does the Internet benefit?"
"And the stimulus package has on it on the order of 20 billion of essentially payment subsidies and credits that cause the build out of the fast internet, the Broadband Internet, to occur more quickly."
"It also has about $20 billion in increases in science funding, which we believe will go into universities that will then help with the lag."
They'll build some of the new and creative applications that we depend on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
"In the past, you've talked about where you were in terms of monetization of existing properties and existing applications."
"I was wondering if you could, sort of, give us an update on where you think you are?"
"I mean, of the things you can control, monetization of your properties is one of them."
Where do you think you are at this point?
What this downturn means in terms of accelerating monetization?
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"There's always a danger, when you have a web site, that you temporarily over monetize?"
"In other words, that you take your page and you fill it with ads."
"And that works for a quarter or two, and then your customers say, ""Well, heck, that's an ad page rather than a content page."""
And then they move somewhere else.
"So, we at Google are roughly at our monetization, or what we call coverage,"
"level, of about a year ago."
And that feels about right.
"It's, frankly, a judgment."
So they worked with sound instead of against it with Scarface and the gangster film.
Howard Hawks brings sound more fully into service of character and drama.
Sound is the way that Tony Camonte dominates the world.
The sound of his voice on the soundtrack makes him the most powerful thing in that universe.
And the gunshots are an extension of him.
"At the same time, Hawkes gives us the painful silences that follow the violent action."
Something that Tony is unaware of until the end when he has to live within that painful silence.
So manipulation of soundtrack of sound effects and ambiance becomes a way of tracing a characters rise and fall of giving a character arc for Hawkes and Scarface.
And finally Ghost Ship shows us Hollywood the fully forged sound aesthetic.
Sound is accepted in Hollywood by 1943.
It's not novel or new anymore.
And it does its job tt gives you a solid world with emotional underscoring.
"People accept what they see as part of the world, but sound is always there shaping the way you respond to the image."
"And sound becomes, more or less, unnoticeable."
"We're used to the orchestral sound track, we don't notice it but it's there working on us."
"Nonetheless, sound can rise out of the background, express emotion, psychology, and things like that."
"It's there, always there, it's a fact of seeing a movie."
But it's there and can be tapped by filmmakers and brought forward.
"So what Ghost Ship shows us, is a film that takes sound, and really pushes it and experiments with it."
"This is a fact of film technology, you have a change in technology, from silent to sound."
Sound is new and novel for several years and artists work very hard to make self story and they experiment with it.
"But then once they have the conventions they can rely on the default conventions and, and just let it get it's job done."
But what we see in Ghost Ship is that the potential is always there for that technology to come forward and to become creative once again.
We have a film that experiments with sound and image to create an unsettling atmosphere to move the audience and it's proof that the Lewton's films and Ghost Ship in particular is proof of the continued creative potential of sound or of any technology really any technique after it's become normalized.
We see it with sound in Ghost Ship and we'll see it with color again at the end of that unit.
So this has been an overview of how sound works in cinema by looking at the birth of sound and the vanishing of silence.
Our next stop is to think about what happens when black and white is replaced by color.
"When young people see Dr. King caught in 1963 talking about his dream, what was that dream?"
"When we look at the atrocious numbers of people that are poor and struggling today, King's legacy speaks to that."
"When we look at people who are dealing with 'How do we respond to a nation at war, King's legacy deals with that."
But we want to expand his legacy to talk about other issues that he didn't necessarily address.
"So when we do all of that, King's legacy is alive, it's vital, and it certainly applies to young people right where they are today"
"There's a bit of a--there appears to be a bit of a freeze right now on action for a variety of reasons--but to your point because companies really do need customers, at some point this becomes unfrozen, theoretically, the on line medium becomes unfrozen faster--any thoughts on how that might play out when it plays out?"
"Let's say, the economy turns in quarter ""X."""
"When we come out of it, are the indications that you're seeing positive in the direction of on line gaining more share from off line than it has over this long period when it should have been gaining more share than it has? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, in the first place, on line continues to gain share in many, many ways."
Share of mind--share of dollars--and so forth.
I don't think there's any new news there.
And there are more and more on line choices.
It's worth trying to figure out when this will occur.
"And for the next few quarters, things are going to be very, very tough."
"So we're talking about 2010, I think, in talking to CEOs or talking to customers, everybody is sort of assuming that 2009 is a tough, tough year."
"So the first question is, what can you do in 2009?"
"And our sales force goes in to the customer and says, ""You need revenue now; this is the quickest way to get revenue now."""
"In many cases, customers are struggling with contractual commitments to off line advertising, for example, where the overall advertising budget has been cut so dramatically that they really don't have a lot of room."
And so there's a political dynamic that goes within the customers.
Hopefully that'll resolve fairly quickly.
It's obviously in their interest that it does.
The other thing that's going on is that there's an increasing willingness to try new systems in the enterprise.
"We have a set of enterprise offerings which are around information, mail, applications, and documents; and we've been pleased with the willingness of customers to now accelerate their trials."
"Now, I'd like to think this is because our products are brilliant, clever, and wonderful,l and consistent with cloud computing."
"Another possible explanation is their budgets are very, very tight and our stuff is just a lot cheaper."
"Either one of those is acceptable from our perspective, because we'll earn the right of the customer over time."
"So the answer to your question is, what does 2010 look like?"
A lot of that depends on what the growth rate of the recovery will look like.
And nobody at this point knows what a global recovery is going to look like.
"But it's reasonable to expect that now that we've gotten off of the on line penetration, we'll get back to that."
Because the trends are still all in that direction. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"On that cheery note, let's talk about music videos. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"The You Tube, to me as a consumer, is sort of like MTV was 20 years ago--"
15 or 20 years ago.
You haven't monetized it yet the way you are starting to.
"There are initial signs, or I don't know how many instances you're doing this and where you're selling the music--either"
"Before you send something off to your editor before you send something off to be peer reviewed, there's a little check list you ought to go through on that very final draft."
"Once you revise it and the prose is sounding good, there's a few other things that I want to make sure that you think about and check."
"So my little checklist for the final draft, got to check for consistency and in particular for numerical consistency."
You also want to check and make sure that your references are not what I call references to nowhere.
And I'm going to talk a little bit more about.
"So those are kinds of things that kind of a high level that you want to make sure you've, you've checked off your list before send something out."
"So, checking for consistency just means, make sure that you don't have things that are totally contradictory in different parts of the manuscript, and, and this happens often."
"I was recently editing somebody, somebody's work, and in the methods section, they said, we followed participants for a minimum of two years."
"And then later on, I went over to the results section, and I read, the average follow up time was 1.5 years."
"So I was going, huh."
"If every participant was followed for more than two years, how could the average be 1.5 years?"
It didn't make any sense.
So they probably had an incorrect word choice there.
They didn't need a minimum of t2wo years.
They actually were.
"Their, their goal was two years."
So that was a little inconsistency.
"So try to pick up on those, because reviewers will look at those in with, with great, you know, it raises a lot of questions, a lot of red flags."
Even more importantly. well I think it's more important cuz I often focus on the statistics and the numbers of papers is make sure that you check for numerical consistency.
So do the numbers in your abstract.
Match the numbers in the rest of the paper.
And I put that one up first because it's a frequent thing that I see.
"The papers I'm reviewing, or even in papers that are actually published in"
"literature, that sometimes for some reason the abstract numbers don't end up matching things in the rest of the paper and I don't know why that's such a frequent occurrence."
I think it's possibly that people write the abstracts first for like a presentation before the data analysis is really final.
"And then, they end up cutting and pasting that abstract and they forget to change all the numbers or maybe there's a cutting and pasting error just from going from the tables and figures in the text to the abstract."
"Or, I don't know why it is, but there, there seems to be often a lot of inconsistencies there."
"I've seen many examples also, where the numbers and the text don't match exactly the numbers in the tables and the figures."
"So for example, I was doing a statistical review of a paper just this week."
"And, I got very confused because I read the numbers in the text and then I went to table two, where they told me to go,"
And the authors had basically subtracted column one from column two to come up with the numbers in the text.
They had just done a subtraction.
"Android, the basic theme is always black, the background, whereas iPhone is always white."
"So I'm wondering if you can speak to that, or why you guys decided that kind of design?"
ALEX FAABORG:
There's a few functional things.
The OLED screens consume less power when they're not illuminating.
"Also, they're occasionally very bright, so you don't want to just burn the retinas of the user."
Those are very literal things.
Christian can speak to the [INAUDlBLE].
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Particularly when we first
"launched Nexus 1, the OLED screen on that device is amazing, and some of these design decisions were made based on that."
AUDlENCE:
Right.
"So you talked a little bit about how people have assumptions that they've made based on a world that we've all got, and how that's not always that important."
"And like a good example of that is that designers, I think, try and do a lot with color where green is a positive action and red is generally error, warning, whatever."
"And so in Gmail, the Compose Mail button is a bright orange red, and I've always wondered, what is some of the thinking?"
"I don't know if you guys worked on that, but what is the thinking that makes you break that really, really firm color association model that most of us have?"
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So first off, I won't put words in your mouth, but when we're talking about the design process, sometimes it's really important to get those associations out of our mind to make sure that we can work on that more fundamental level."
But those associations are extremely important.
"And so once we've kind of worked out, how do we make it work without these kind of elements of style and trends and all that stuff, it is really important to layer that stuff back on to evaluate the work."
"In terms of the specific choice of that color, I can't speak to it, except for the fact that red is a signal for, look here."
ALEX FAABORG:
"Also, I didn't work on it either, so I don't want to put words in the mouth of the designers that did, but one thing you can see from the design is that the colors, they have external consistency meanings, but they also have really good internal consistency meanings, where blue is always representing Search, green is always representing Share, and red is representing Create."
"And that's not the kind of thing that you have to actually know, or on a conscious level know, but it's the kind of thing that on a subconscious level, as you're trying to find the Search button, or you want to quickly share something, you start to pick up those color associations as you're doing your targeting."
So I thought that was a really nice touch they did with the design.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you.
AUDlENCE:
"I work at a fairly large media company, and many projects I end up working on tend to have five or six design cooks in the kitchen, and I'm primarily an engineer."
I was wondering if you had any suggestions on ways to influence the design when I see something bad or that I disagree with from that position?
ALEX FAABORG:
"Then the next part is step two, 2B. which is to specify Googlebot's preferred behavior."
"So given that parameter, how would you like Googlebot to actually crawl those URLs."
And we'll talk more about this as well.
[music in background]
The first parameter I'd like to cover is the sort parameter.
And we're covering this first.
But it's a fairly complicated parameter and setting.
The sort parameter is something like
"""sort equals price ascending"" or ""rank by equals bestselling."" Any of these types of parameters that just change the order that the content is presented."
These are sort parameters.
"Once you identify a sort parameter or sort parameters on your site, the next part is to specify Googlebot's preferred behavior for when they see URLs with this parameter."
Now this can get pretty tricky.
So I have two scenarios here.
Let's go through the first scenario.
"You could ask ""Is the sort parameter optional throughout my entire site?"" Meaning that the sort parameter is never displayed by default."
But only with manual selection.
"If you can answer ""Yes"" to that question, that ""Yes, it's optional throughout my entire site."" Then go on to question two."
"""Can Googlebot discover everything useful when the sort parameter isn't displayed?"" Meaning that we can actually crawl all of your items even if no sort parameter is present on the URLs."
"If that answer is ""Yes"" and the first answer is ""Yes"" then it's"
"likely that with your sort parameter you could specify ""crawl No URLs."" Once you've applied this setting, please verify that the sample URLs displayed in Webmaster Tools are in fact not canonicals."
So they're just duplicates.
"And that the canonical URLs, the URLs that you really want crawled and indexed, can be reached by regular user navigation."
"If the first sort parameter recommendation didn't apply to your site, then hopefully the second recommendation will."
"The second recommendation is, if the same sort values are used consistently site-wide."
"The questions to ask yourself are, ""Are the same sort values used consistently across my entire site?"""
"So a negative example of this, where the user would say ""No"" is if you're a Webmaster selling things like coins and coin albums."
"So for your coins, you might have ""sort equals"" with the value ""year issued."" But ""sort equals year issued"" doesn't apply to the selling of your coin albums."
So it's not used consistently.
"If the answer to the first question is ""Yes,"" Then you can ask yourself the second question."
"Which is, ""When a user changes the sort value, is the total number of items unchanged?"" If that answer is also ""Yes"" then it's likely that with your sort parameter you can specify"
"""only crawl URLs with value x"" where X is one of the sorting values that's used site-wide."
"If neither of those recommendations apply to your sort parameter, then perhaps select"
"For example, the browser today is a nice event driven system which is good, but we've got this terrible problem that we call the cross site scripting problem — which is terribly named, because the name suggests that there's something wrong with cross site scripting, and there's not."
Cross site scripting is extremely desirable and valuable.
"It's how we do mashups, and mashups are good and we want to be doing more of that."
"The problem is that the browser's security model didn't anticipate that we were going to do that, and that's bad and needs to be corrected."
"If you look at what causes this problem, there are two basic causes."
It's pretty simple.
The first is the sharing of the global object.
"Any script that can get onto the page anyhow gets access to everything that that page knows, so they all get into everything."
"Now, we're improving that in ECMAScript 5."
ECMAScript 5 has a strict mode which will allow us to put third party code on a page and be confident that that third party code cannot do all the bad things that happen in cross site scripting attacks.
"That's a wonderful thing, so hooray for ECMAScript 5."
I just can't wait until Microsoft and all the other guys get it out so that we can get on with the future.
"The other problem, though, is inherent in HTML, and that's just that HTML is way too complicated, particularly in that it has nesting of multiple languages, including CSS and URLs and JavaScript, which can all be nested inside of each other, that all have different encoding patterns and different escapement patterns."
It's extremely difficult to do static analysis on a piece of code and determine if it's going to be safe in any context in which it might be put onto the page.
Both of these things need to be corrected in HTML; we cannot fix them on the ECMAScript side.
"Tragically, HTML5 ignores and worsens the XSS problem."
It does nothing to make it better and does a few things which will make it significantly worse.
"The editor of the HTML5 recommendation has written that ""HTML does not ever have a markup injection vulnerability."" That working group simply doesn't understand the problem that you guys are living with every day, so they're not at all motivated to try to correct it."
"I think that's intolerable, but that's the situation."
"What you have in the browser is a loaded gun pointed at your head, and this pulls the trigger."
"We tend to use page templating languages -- PHP, ASP, JSP -- which made a lot of sense in 1995 when Rasmus did PHP."
"That was a really good idea then, but it's not so good now."
Templates are way too rigid a framework for the kinds of really dynamic pages that we're trying to build.
"But worse than that: it's way too easy to insert text into a context that gets delivered as part of the HTML load which can be misinterpreted and executed, completing an XSS attack."
So could we do better if we had JavaScript on the server?
There are some obvious advantages.
One is that all of the expertise that you've gained in doing JavaScript can be applied immediately to the server.
That's got some huge benefits.
It turns out this is not a new idea.
The first server side JavaScript implementation was from Netscape in 1996.
Unfortunately they modelled it after PHP.
Syntactically it was a little different.
Their benefit as well will be reduced.
"For a couple, the surviving spouse will receive the larger of the two benefits that the couple is eligible to receive."
This dramatically changes the break even calculation for a potential higher benefit member.
"On average, benefits are going to be payed to one of them, approximately five years"
longer Then the benefit paid the lower benefit member.
This decreases the desirability of the higher wage earner to wait.
The flood of baby boomers currently reaching full retirement age has brought the interest in maximizing benefits to the forefront.
"When one spouse reaches full-retirement age, they can file suspend their benefit."
This allows the other spouse to claim a spousal benefit while the first spouse continues to work maximizing their benefit.
"Similarly a spouse can do restricted filings for spousal benefits which while allowing their own benefit to increase With many, with many baby boomers being two worker families, the combination of restricted filing, and file and suspended strategies, has yielded some interesting opportunities for couples."
There are various articles on the reading of this possibility.
No dogs or Captivas were harmed during this test.
Do not attempt.
Can a car's dexterity match up to a dog's?
Let's put it to the test.
Madrid | Spain �
Let's go through this one in parts.
"Any regular expression starts with r' or r""."
I'm going to use the single quotes this time so that I won't have to escape quite as many of these.
"Then we want to match the blue "" here at the beginning, and somewhere way at the end, we'll want to match the closing one, and that will be the end of our regular expression."
"So now we just have to think of what goes in here in the middle, and this may not be enough room."
I may have to erase it and write it again.
"Now whatever it is, it's going to be 0 or more of something, and as we're going across the string, there's sort of backslashes, which are important, and everything else, which is not so important."
"So if there's any character that's not a backslash, and here I'm escaping the backslash, we can just read right over it--that's no problem inside of our string-- or you could actually have an escape sequence, like this \""."
"That looks like a literal backslash, followed by anything, and then it's done."
So let me just diagram this a little more.
"Say this opening quote is 1, that matches things like this opening quote in the string."
"Then in here, we have anything that's not a backslash--that's 2."
"That's I-space-say-s-a-y-comma, but then eventually we do get to a backslash."
"Over here, we have a 2-character sequence that's a backslash followed by a dot."
"These 2 characters--the backslash, followed by the quote--they are 3, and then we're back to matching 2's--h, e, I, l, o, dot."
"Now we have another backslash and a quote, so these 2 together will be another 3, and then this part at the end is number 4."
"What we do see appears to be a port, with some ships; we see water and a small coastline; and some trees; and the vast blue sky above."
Steven:
"That blue sky, of course, is framed by a window that does not open, that's just above her, with the thinnest wood framing."
"That creates a cross, and she's directly below it."
"You do have the sense of the way in which spirituality must enview her, but she does seem as if her world is inside this room and that her only access outside is through this window."
"You mentioned the harbor, but there is a second kind of symbolism here that I think is important, and that is the mast on the right that's close seems to be moving."
"You do get the sense that the ship is passing slowly, and it becomes such a perfect metaphor for her life, as she watches life pass before her."
Beth:
"And the ships that she looks at will move on, and she will remain where she is, within this domestic environment."
"We wonder if she's feeling a sense of yearning for more, or that perhaps she's expressing a more generalized sense of yearning and desire for meaning that we see in so many other paintings by Friedrich."
Steven:
There's clearly that sense of the quiet and the contemplative in this painting.
All the things that we're saying are borne out in this painting through the subtlest means.
The sense of restriction that we're talking about is not because the room in which she is placed is small.
"It's in fact a very large space, it seems, with a very high ceiling, and of course these"
large windows that must let lots of light in.
It's not that.
It's the strictness of the geometry with which the painting is rendered.
"Friedrich grew up in Greifswald, which was then part of Sweden, and was schooled on Copenhagen, initially, before he went to Dusseldorf to finish his education."
That Northern tradition of the strictness of the geometric is really felt here.
"The woman, in contrast, though, is curvilinear, and so she doesn't fit easily into this geometry, into the rectilinear in which she's placed."
The ship that seems to be passing also breaks with the purely rectilinear.
"That mast is tilting ever so slightly to the right, as if it's moving forward."
"And so, all of this feels in contrast to the perfect verticals and the perfect horizontals."
Beth:
"As that mast moves slightly to the right, her body lists slightly to the left, breaking that rigid geometry."
"And, like so many other paintings by Friedrich, there's a real sense of symmetry and order, so that we immediately feel that the artist is saying something more in these scenes that otherwise we could classify as genre scenes or landscapes."
Friedrich is trying to imbue them with greater meaning.
Steve:
Friedrich's technique here is just spectacular.
"I mean, you've got this very soft rendering of the poplars beyond, and the beautiful sky that seems so translucent, is if it really does go on forever."
It makes the longing of the woman seem even more potent.
Getting a lock is surprisingly expensive.
Deadlock is a constant threat.
A program that does not deadlock can be transformed into a program that does deadlock with extreme simplicity; it's really easy to break a program and allow it to lock up.
It's just incredibly difficult to think about.
"In my opinion, the most tragic design error in Java was that it couldn't make up its mind if it wanted to be an application language or a system"
language.
"In trying to do both, it exposed threads to the application developer, and that was terrible."
"Fortunately, though, there is a model that completely avoids the reliability hazards of threads, and that model is the event loop."
Hooray!
So here we go back again to the event
loop.
Nothing's for free -- there are some trade-offs -- so let's look at them again.
"On the pro side, we can be completely free of races and deadlocks, which is a huge win."
"For application developers, that's the world you want to be living in."
"In terms of memory allocation, there's only one stack which gets shared over and over and over again."
"Again, that's not a big deal, but it's sort of nice."
"For example, at the end of every turn the stack gets reset, so getting machine clean after something goes wrong turns out to be really easy."
"We have very low overhead because we're not blocking all the time, and we're not doing process switching, which can be expensive."
"It's just running through the event loop, which is a really efficient thing."
We also get some resiliency.
"If a turn fails, generally the program can still keep going, whereas if a thread fails, there is a possibility that that thread was holding onto a lock, or that another thread was waiting on it completing some action that will never get completed."
So you can get cascading of thread failures.
"That doesn't happen in an event loop, because we don't have that kind of dependency."
"On the con side, again, programs must never block."
"Programs have to be written inside out -- waa! -- but you know, that's not hard if you're a JavaScript programmer, because that's how we've always done things."
And turns must be finished quickly — this is the most important con.
"It means that event loops are not suitable for all programs, because some programs need to take a long time to run and anything that takes a long time to run cannot be put into an event loop."
"Despite that, there are a couple of things that we can do."
One is that we can employ eteration.
"Eteration means to break a task into multiple turns so that on each eteration, instead of going through a conventional loop, at the bottom of the loop we call setTimeOut, passing it a function which causes us to do the next eteration."
That means that the turns are going to be short — the turn's only as long as one eteration -- and we can do as many eterations as we want and not lock up the event loop.
The other thing we can do is we can move the task into a completely separate process.
"So the first thing is, you want to always speak in terms of the user base as a whole."
"If you immediately go in and say, I find this bad for my usage, the designer is going to be like, I don't care."
You are statistically insignificant.
"Even if what you're saying is identical to the mainstream views, it's just the phrasing."
So that's really key.
"Also, if you can back up any of the things you find wrong with it with irrefutable principles, then you're actually having a debate on the actual design, as opposed to opinions."
"We don't see opinion debates in engineering as much because you have these irrefutable principles like, something shouldn't crash, or it shouldn't use too much memory, or it should be fast."
"So if you start grounding things in mode errors, or consistency, or the user being able to find help if they need it, things that everyone agrees should be right, then it's not really a debate as much as you just pointing out a bug that they need to fix."
AUDlENCE:
Thank you.
AUDlENCE:
"I've worked on projects with dedicated designers, and then I've also worked on projects that are just a bunch of engineers making something that inevitably ends up looking horrible."
"Do you have any suggestions when you have just engineers working on a project, and any things that they could do, when they know they're making something that's not well-designed, what to do to help improve the design?"
ALEX FAABORG:
"Well, hiring an agency is always an option."
"People often discount that as too expensive, or they haven't done it before so they haven't tried it, it works really well."
"And also, you often see a lot of the return in having a"
[INAUDlBLE] designed thing if you're selling the application.
"If you're just doing it yourself, trying to isolate your mind and look at it from the perspective of a user."
"If you are able to, show it to other people that haven't seen it before, and do sort of quick tests."
I Ask them to think out loud as they're interacting with it so you can hear their thought process.
Sometimes everyone's so secret about their stuff that you can't do that.
So that's really important.
Do you have other suggestions?
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Another thing for independent developers that don't have a very big staff is that for a
"lot of these platforms, there is a lot of work that's done into making the platform and making those pieces so that they work and do the right thing."
So looking at the platform itself and kind of figuring out the standard way that the platform does things is a really good way to get oftentimes a good portion of the way there.
ALEX FAABORG:
"Also reading the style guide, I should mention that."
"Android has a great style guide that we both worked on, so biased."
"But what's nice about it is it doesn't just give you the various principles, but it also gives you kind of the thinking behind all of them."
"It's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around us, are shaped by that stance."
We are social to the core.
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals.
This is a long time ago.
"And for them, autism was devastating."
They had profound intellectual disabilities.
They didn't talk.
"But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people."
"In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things."
But they're always doing things by themselves.
"So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere."
"Extremely, extremely isolated."
"Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you about."
These are survival skills.
"These are survival skills that we inherited over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution."
"You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility."
"Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival."
They orient to the caregiver.
"From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds, rather than just sounds in the environment."
"They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away."
"Well, they orient to the caregiver."
The caregiver seeks the baby.
"And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind -- the social mind, the social brain -- depends on."
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life.
It doesn't; it begins with the beginning of life.
"As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see it, but it's really critical."
And that thing is called attention.
"And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word, that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want."
"They also learn to follow other people's gazes, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about."
"And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue."
"They are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude."
Look at what the probability here is of the backscatter.
"Hey, that probability, we can calculate that."
"The probability is simply the number of backscattered particles, 20 (the count rate of the backscattered particles, 20), over the count rate of the incident number of particles, 132,000."
That probability is 2x10^-4.
"Not large, but not zero."
There is something coming off.
And Rutherford was amazed.
And what he wrote later on was that this experiment was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.
It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15 inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and bit you.
So how does he interpret that experiment?
"Well, what he said is that since most of these alpha particles went right through this foil to the detector, that must mean that those gold atoms that make up that gold foil must be mostly empty."
So the picture is that you've got this gold atom here.
"And he knew, roughly speaking, how large that gold atom was."
He knew it to be about 10^-10 meters.
"But what he was proposing is that these helium ions going through, these alpha particles are just going right through that volume because most of the atom, --"
"-- and he knew that there were electrons in this atom because he knew about the electrons already, most of that atom is empty."
"However, occasionally, once in a while, not very often but occasionally these helium ions, these alpha particles, what happened?"
"Well, occasionally they hit something very massive in that atom."
"And when it hit that massive part of the atom, it reflected, it scattered back into the direction from which it came."
"And from knowing what these scattering probabilities are and from knowing roughly the size of this atom and the thickness of the gold foil, he could calculate what the diameter of this nucleus was."
"And that number came out to be about 10^-14 meters, the diameter of this heavy massive part of the atom."
"Now, he called that massive part, he called it the nucleus."
He called it a nucleus in analogy to the massive center of a living cell.
That's where that name comes from.
"And this number of 10^-14 diameter, that's a good number to know, the relative size of the nucleus."
All MlT students should know that.
He also knew that that nucleus really had to be positively charged.
Why did it have to be positively charged?
"Well, because he knew that these atoms were neutral, he knew already that an electron was part of an atom."
And so this nucleus had to be positively charged.
"And, in addition, he made some very sophisticated measurements of the angular distribution of the backscattered alpha particles."
"And from those measurements of the angular distribution, he was able to back out the fact that this nucleus had a charge of plus Z, where Z is the atomic number, times unit charge e."
"So, one of the things I just want to start out with--there's been a lot of chatter in the media and other places lately that the search market is settled and done."
What's your view on that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, there's obviously a lot of innovation ahead of us."
"If you look at what happened, we had a bug where we put a malware statement out for users, and in that time Yahoo searches gained very, very quickly."
"It looks like people will move very quickly from one search engine to another, for any one of reasons."
We've looked at this pretty carefully.
"A majority of people actually say they use more than one search engine, and of course Microsoft is working very hard to build a competitive search engine, and of course recently leaked more details about what they're doing."
"So, we have all of that activity, and then of course we have other activity as well, including a new entrance we're trying to combine search with other things."
"So I think search as it's defined right, as"
"Google has historically defined it, or defined by Google, is not settled at all."
It's interesting to note that people said the same thing 10 years ago about search with a different company. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
"And they've said it about operating systems today, and we had an interesting panel a moment ago."
"It leads to a question that, you worked at"
Sun where the network was the computer.
"You competed and partnered with Oracle, which believed the network computer was the future."
Netbooks are getting a lot of traction.
What's your view of how that market plays out? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
This is all part of cloud computing--whatever term you want to use--
let's use cloud computing.
Cloud computing is one of those changes that is going to happen regardless of whether the companies that are participating in the ecosystem allow.
Because the technology will make it happen.
I think everybody here knows what cloud computing represents.
"You can think about it in all the obvious ways, right?"
"So, for example, rather than buying a piece of software for a client, the Java Script and Ajax Code comes over to your browser and makes it very powerful."
All of that technology is getting much more mature.
But it is a fact that we live on very high performance wireless broadband networks.
"And that's not going to go away any time soon, because networks are getting much, much stronger."
"To me, the more interesting question is, what can you do, as a consequence of cloud computing, that you couldn't do before?"
A way of thinking about that is that IT systems today are so-- and excuse the broad overstatement--are so slow in the way in which they evolve.
"They're so stuck in the systems and parameters and architecture that they were built, that you have an opportunity to build a whole new generation of applications which cycle much faster for IT that integrate information in ways that could never been done before."
"In the same way that you can do this for the web, we're now, because everybody's on line, you have a lot of information that you can get about user behavior, that you can either mine or build products for, or do new interesting things for. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Once it's digitized, then it's available for the next thousand years in whatever formats will occur."
"We've done this very successfully with historic books, and we've done that with a set of partnerships here in Europe as well."
Some more questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; MORGAN:
Jerry Morgan from IFA International.
"What would you define as the main business sort of strategic benefits to Google of Android, this free operating system which is use to cross different tablet, smartphone devices?"
What would you define as the key business benefits to Google of this?
And the second question is will this--could this possibly lead to commercial conflict with other organizations which you haven't had in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, I'm sure that there will be commercial conflict with other people that we've not competed in the past because this is so new and we accept that."
Google takes an unusual view of these business questions.
We try to solve the problem from the end-user perspective and then we try to figure out a way to make money later.
"So in the Android's case, we think it's just interesting technology."
It enables a whole generation of new applications.
We demoed some of them.
These are things which we would never even conceive of a few years ago.
"And more importantly there are many, many people who are built--who do not work at Google, who are building powerful applications on top of the Android platform."
"So, from our perspective, the end-user benefit is obvious."
"If there are many, many, many millions of users of Android, I am sure that Google can figure out some ways to make money from that, but it will not be from charging for Android, it would be an insularly things."
I'll give you an example.
People who use Android search more.
"Well, we--as they search more with a powerful browser, they click on more ads."
So we estimated that Android already pays for itself so we're very happy with Android.
You could imagine there are many other things that we could do if we really cared about growing that business.
"For us, Android is precisely strategic because it allows us to create the complete system that we just showed you, the smartphone to the network to the super computer, and strategic because with that system you could do these amazing things that we saw in our demos."
"And by the way, Android is part of the Google television platform as well. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I've got to say, I appreciate your--right next to him--your vision of a bright future."
I would think that we would all like to share that.
There are some very large players your vision has to navigate around.
Players you don't and can't control whether it'd be autocratic governments.
"I know Google has had some issues in China recently, there's issues regarding network availability, whether or not the 3G network can--or the mobile network can handle, this new traffic data farms, et cetera, et cetera."
What are some of these issues that you can't control you are concerned about that we should be looking towards? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, it's worth saying right now that Google is not a country."
We are not a sovereign government and we are subject to the laws of the countries that we operate in.
And I want to make that very explicit because people get sort of confused about all of this.
"We can suggest what you put--what you should do next, what you care about, all the things in front of you."
"Imagine the world's calendar knowing everything, all the events, and we know where you are, we know what things that you like and all of a sudden, we can suggest, ""Well, there's an amazing play over here or there's a great concert around the corner that you didn't know about it, that your friends care a lot about."
And what I'd like the most about this vision is it's a future for everyone.
It's not a future just for the elites.
"Historically, information services and information and power have been for the rich people, the knowledge workers and so forth."
"This is technology which is accessible to every single person on the planet, or at least all the people who can afford or are working very hard to get smartphones, too, which is today on the order of a billion people."
And in my view over the next five to ten years will approach three to four billion people with powerful networks that will back them up.
That is a humongous change.
It is a tremendous change in accessed information for people who have struggled to get through the day and worrying about all the things that we all care about.
"So for me, this is a future that is committed to doing good."
It's a future that we care a lot about at
Google.
"It's a future that's gives people time to do what they really care about, thought, ideas, intuitions, solutions and doing what they love, which I think is mostly about people and about society and about the fun that they all have."
It's interesting that this is a future that is a stuff with poetry.
"It's a quote that I like, ""Google is made of us, a sort of coral reef of human minds and their products,"" from William Gibson last week."
I tell you now that the future--this future that I've talked about that you've seen is really available to all of us right now.
I'm proud to be part of it and thank you so much for coming and participating in this talk.
Thank you so much.
"I think we have--okay, we have some time for some questions."
"If you will give us comments or questions, we have some hands up here."
I think we have some microphones.
Do you want to just sort of do them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FABlEN:
Fabien from AndroidPlT. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Yes, how are you? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FABlEN:"
I was wondering when I saw your
"Google TV presentation as well as your presentation for the Android phones, if Google becomes a content provider more than like right now, someone where everything gets into Google and someone else can retrieve it, this is more because I think, from my perspective, and my perspective, TV is a very passive medium where I sit in front of it and then I get information, but I don't want to probably check information out."
"I just want to be passive, in my personal opinion."
Is Google becoming a content provider? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
We've decided to stay right on--there's a line that we've decided not to cross.
"So we want to work with content providers and get them onto this new platform, whether it be Google Television or YouTube or the web."
"We're very unlikely to go into the actual content production, at least in a significant way because we want the content providers to be able to make money."
"I will tell you, by the way, as a passive television viewer, once you have Google Television, you're not going to be passive."
"But you get so busy sometimes, I made this suggestion to have one of these answering machine services - you know like you get in these government - like press 1 for something."
Because it has happened that sometimes people sometimes their dog has died or someone says can you do some chanting for me over the phone.
"Can you do some Buddhist prayers, they ask for."
"I've done that sometimes, in the middle of the night, to the opposite side of the world - their dog is sick so I've done the chanting over the phone.. sometimes I'm too compassionate."
[laughter].
"But.. so I've decided actually to actually, uh, so if you want..we can record these chants and have them on the recorder so if you want a prayer you can just press number 1."
[laughter].
"Why not, that's very easy."
And then if you want to speak to
Ajahn Brahm you haven't got a prayer so press number 1 anyway.
So that way I get rid of everybody and have a nice easy time.
"But you have to deal with people, and that's only a joke."
"You have to deal with..it's much nicer to be accessible to people, even though you're tired, I'd rather be accessible then be sort-of somehow separated from the people who support you, and feed you, and clothe you, and look after you and your friends."
So even though it's a lot of work I enjoy doing it.
"But when you're dealing with people's emotions, sometimes you have to let people understand, number one, that those emotions are real, they have a place in life, but also where they come from."
"Because it's great when you have an emotion in your heart, to find out why is that there, where did it originate from."
"Because it's great when you track it back, you can see how emotions arise, how they build up."
"I don't know how many of you have been to movies, but you can actually see that the trick of the movie is to start with the music."
You know the different musics that get your emotions going and just how even the lighting starts to change.
"If you want to get people afraid, you turn the lights down.. and the music is very very soft.. apumbabambumbum bumbumbum.."
"And it gets people, because actually your heart beats."
When you get excited you heart beat goes at that level.
"And if the music or whatever else. the beat gets that, it actually encourages your heart beat to sort-of get very very very strong."
And you can even use your speech to say that..something..is..coming.....and make people afraaaaaid..
"But you can see how emotions can be generated, just in movies especially by the music by the way that speech is actually said, and also by the lighting."
"One of the first times when I saw this, how people can play your emotions is actually when we started our nun's monastery down in Gingegannup because that was before Sister"
"Vayama was here, and we were looking for a nice piece of land, we found this nice piece of land over in Reen Road but it was on auction."
"And so I went there for the auction, with"
- I don't know if he's here this evening - Eddy Fernando was our bidder.
"But when the auctioneer started the auction he was very calm, saying about this beautiful block of land, wonderful place for retreat, lovely forests and the river and then he started mentioning the figures.."
"And he said, I think this is worth so much, I think we should start for at least a million dollars."
"And straight away I thought, ""oh no""."
"So here's an example of a shower stall that has multiple showerheads in it, multiple faucets."
So that water demand is often increased in bathrooms designed
like this.
Most green building programs also attempt to regulate the building materials that are used in furnishings.
So here's an example of a bookcase and set of drawers that seemingly are made out of oak.
But this is actually an oak veneer.
"And if you have been up in Kroon Hall where the Forestry and Environmental Studies School is, you may know that about seventy percent of the wood that's on the interior of this was grown on Yale property, on Yale forests."
"It also is red oak, but it's solid red oak."
It's not a veneer.
So what's beneath the veneer?
Here you can see a strip of pressboard that is faced with a white oak surface.
But the interior is basically low-grade wood chips of a variety of different species that are compressed together and they are mixed up in liquid form with adhesives and then they are rolled out in a strip and then cut into a variety of different sizes.
The adhesives have compounds that are often proprietary and even unknown to most who purchase them or sell them at building supply houses.
"They commonly contain adhesives that are epoxy resins, some of which contain bisphenol-A that we talked about earlier in the course."
But also formaldehyde is a component that is commonly used that is an allergen and it's a suspected carcinogen.
I'd like you to think too about the problem of your understanding.
How could you increase your understanding of the energy intensity of your own lifestyle?
"Well, here's a pretty good example of the way that houses that were built in the 1990s and previously are metered."
"So that this is at your utility junction box, where the line comes in from the road."
This is my meter.
I have the same brand.
And it's got five dials on it.
"And you might think, well that's not that tough to figure out."
"But if you walk up to it, you'll see that the dials actually have the numbers that on the first dial on the left, it goes from lowest to highest in a clockwise motion."
But in the second it goes from lowest to highest in a counterclockwise motion.
So they switch on as you move across the screen.
So this is actually a very difficult thing to keep track of.
"Now also, you might wonder well, how would I find out how my variance in behavior, how I manage my computers or my"
"lights or my water consumption, or how big a refrigerator I have, how is that going to affect my electric bill?"
It's really hard to figure it out given this kind of a metering system.
"Because if you can decipher what the meter says, you'll only get a total figure for your consumption."
"Now, this has created an opportunity for people to design a variety of smart meters that keep track of energy intake and use and how it's distributed in a house for different purposes."
Thank you.
"Just because for accessibility, auditory accessibility as well."
Diane:
"Diane Gallinger, and I'm a independent museum specialist and my question is for some people who are um, who have.... visual issues, they are not necessarily trained in using or working with tactile diagrams, now that I know at the Louvre, they have a program where they actually bring them in for workshops and work with let's say models of figure of models so that they get used to the feeling the full three-dimensional model and then they work to getting used to the feel of that so how that would translate into the feel of a two dimensional tactile diagram."
"But if you were just working, say in a small community in Ontario, which is where I am at right now, you have people who are coming in and doing programs and working with tactile diagrams but they may not necessarily have a background in using tactile diagrams and yet they may be, if you don't have the opportunity to do ongoing workshops with them to sensitize them or give them more experience in using a tactile diagram."
"What would you recommend for someone like myself, who is doing that program to enable someone who is new at working with this, to be able to comprehend the feeling of your hands."
"And I do do,. visual descriptions and do work with models that they can relate to the diagram as well, so it's not, you know, not being used just in on its own to use the two depiction but it's just how do you get over that hump apart from maybe using something like visual description or a tactile model, so how do you help them to use a two dimensional tactile diagram?"
Dr. Kennedy:
"Um, great question."
I'll tell you two stories.
"One of them is, imagine a blind woman"
"I was doing a test in Ottawa and she said, uh, You know, I'm no good with space and"
I can't do this kind of thing.
"Uh I have no experience with pictures, I can't draw."
"And I basically said to her, take up thy pen and draw."
"And she started, and her first drawing was a scribble."
Drawing on a raised page line drawing.
"I said, well Kit, and her first drawing was a scribble."
And then she looks upset __.
"I should draw this box, that I was offering to her, this way, and then the next drawing, within minutes, had some scribbles but also a clear face of the box."
"And I actually, that's like a change from say a two to three year old to a three or four year old sighted kid."
That takes a year.
"And she went from that in less than five minutes and then she said, ""Oh, no, no, _"""
"Her next drawing had two faces attached side by side like a fold out drawing, which is typical of a seven year old sighted child."
"So then, in fifteen minutes she had gone through three or four years of drawing ability on her own."
I had never taught anybody.
I just want to know what they can do when they think about what they are doing.
"And how they think they might improve, and then what I see is that gradually themselves getting better because the drawing development sequence that unfolds in a sighted child, also unfolds in the blind."
And they push themselves because they _ themselves.
"Okay, second story, is Esref herself."
"So she was encouraged to draw, so she said ""Okay, I'm going to draw an advent wreath."""
If you don't know what that is.
That's quite a lot.
In fact 18% is quite a lot.
And this has to do with the fact that in this assessment we took into account all the changes in land use that are related to
"livestock, the production of animals in terms of methane, the manure management in terms of also methane and nitrous oxides and the various steps of the feed production, livestock production, processing, transport and so on that have to do with livestock and feed commodities and this is how you get to 18%."
OK.
How did you respond yourself when you were confronted with these figures?
I knew it was high.
I knew also the impact on water and biodiversity was going to be very significant.
"I didn't expect it to be quite as high, but this is the figure we came up with."
And what do you think?
What was the most shocking amazing conclusion from your report?
"Well, I think one of the issues is that this huge environmental impact that"
"livestock has is not well understood by the public, and not even well-understood by the farmers themselves."
So there is actually a strong case for regulating the livestock sector much more than is currently the case.
Thank you.
Everyone is talking about global warming and trying to find out why its happening.
But how can it be that livestock farming is hardly ever mentioned as one of its causes?
Certainly when more and more scientists have made the link between livestock farming and climate change.
"It's not generally known, but between 40 and 50 % of cereals are not eaten by humans, but by livestock."
"And for soy, that's about 75%."
"If you consider that it takes about 7 kg of grain - that's corn and soya beans - to make just one kilogramme of beef, we are talking about hundreds and hundreds of hectares of soya bean planted in former rainforest to provide meat."
That's not a very efficient way of producing protein food.
The soya beans imported come from places like Brazil.
"Brazil has the biggest soy export market in the world, and there soy production has grown since the 1960s something like 57 times."
So they're just producing more soy than ever before.
"And most of that soy is being produced in very environmentally sensitive areas, including the Amazon rainforest, and the Cerrado, which is woodland savannah."
What can I say?
It's a disaster.
"The main drawback is losing biodiversity, but indirectly it's also influencing climate change."
It's speeding up the climate change that's already occurring.
"Carbon sinks are places in the world, like the rainforest or the Cerrado, some agricultural lands that soak up and sequester carbon, and when those are lost, we are losing a very important tool in the fight against global warming."
Today there is nothing more important than trying to contain the problem of global warming.
The embedded tack was then cut and polished.
"To determine the tack's composition, it was analyzed using an x-ray technique known as X-ray fluorescence or XRF."
The XRF instrument creates a spectrum with each line representing a different chemical element.
"The spectrum showed that the tack was made of brass, but also contained significant traces of other metals."
"Such impure brass was commonplace in the 1500s, but not in more recent times."
"Next, to determine how the tack was made it was examined under an optical microscope."
"Getty scientists observed that the tack had a very even and rounded crystal structure, which indicated that the metal was cast into a mold and then allowed to cool naturally."
A common working method in the 1500s.
"A tack that had been made more recently, would probably have been hammered or stamped resulting in a very different crystal structure."
The microscope also revealed an interesting layer on the surface of the tack.
"To identify the composition of this surface coating, a scanning electron microscope was used."
The upper layer was targeted and analyzed with an electron beam.
The spectrum produced by the microscope showed that the layer was primarily composed of the element tin.
"As you can see in this replica, the thin layer of tin was used to imitate the shiny appearance of silver."
"These discoveries about the manufacture and chemical composition of the tacks, enabled Getty scientists to conclude that they are authentic and date back to the fabrication of the cabinet in 1580."
What's the most important issue  to you this election season?
"You know, the most important issue to me is  really the economic disparity."
"I have a lot of concern that the rich keep getting richer,  and the poor keep getting poorer, and I really think we need a big overhaul  to change what's happening in our country."
Do you think the political system is broken?
"If so, how would you fix it?"
"You know, I do a little bit,"
I think the way that I see it as broken is that we have a lot of political backing by donors who can afford to back the politicians.
"And, so, I don't know that I see it as equal representation, and so I think if there was some way we could make our system be more about an equal - starting at an equal base."
Okay?
So each - each party had an equal amount to spend we would have a little more equality in terms of the voices and the issues that we heard.
Are you hopeful about the future?
I am hopeful.
"I do think we need some changes, and that I don't necessarily mean changes in presidency, but we need some changes in the whole system."
But I'm always hopeful; I'm always hopeful.
"I think we have a great country, and I think people have their hearts in the right places."
"Let's do this again,using once again our election example."
"This time with four parties--A, B, C, and D."
So I have 0 or more copies of my string body.
The elements of my string body are either normal characters or 2-character escape sequences.
All of this looks like 3 characters.
It's really just 2.
I have to escape the backslash.
"As a minor aside, after the Beatles and Sound of Music examples from above, you may not be surprised to know that a number of English songs of enduring popularity--ABC 123, BlNGO--seem to have a regular expression sort of feel."
"Repetition is very common in songs, and you get the same thing out of it that you get out of a regular expression, a concise notation versus in choruses, but then when you expand it out, it takes a long time to sing."
"However, there is 1 song that is actually too complicated for regular expressions-- the dreaded 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
If you actually want the counting to work out correctly-- 99 to 98 to 97--we can't fit it in a regular expression framework.
"We'll have to return to that later, and eventually we'll be smart enough to sing this song."
"For more info on this, Don Knuth, the computer scientist has written an essay on the complexity of songs."
Let's take a look at the first step of customer discovery.
You're going to be living this for the next couple of weeks if you're doing this for real.
Phase 1 is you state your hypotheses and you draw the business model canvas.
"And again, you put the canvas on the wall, you and your team get around and put up yellow stickies."
But the next step is you get out of the building.
You're going to test the problem.
"You're going to test your understanding of the customer's problem or need, and you're going to figure out how to build the prototype."
"The next thing is you're going to test the solution, and you're going to test the solution if you're on the Web by building a low fidelity and then a high fidelity prototype, and you're going to again test your understanding of the customers' needs and whether your solution matches this."
"And this match, again, is called product market fit."
That's the holy grail for entrepreneurs.
Am I building something that people can't get enough of or are just willing to open up their wallets and empty it in front of you to get their hands on?
And the fourth phase in customer discovery is you verify your pivot.
"Do people agree that you're solving a high value problem or need, and do you understand your business model enough to start test selling, which is the next step in customer validation."
"Now, what's really depressing to most entrepreneurs is the answer most often the first time you go through this is, ""Heck no."""
"And what's worse is, ""Well, they kind of, sort of like..."""
"Well, kind of, sort of is not a startup."
"Kind of, sort of is people have been nice to you."
"The only time you know that you have something that's worth investing your time and money in is if people are literally trying to force their money on you or can't use your product even in its buggy, uninitialized form enough."
This is what you're looking for.
"And if you haven't found it yet, that's why the customer development process is an iterative circle."
It assumes you will be going through this multiple times.
But many may not realize just how deep and how broad that is.
There's certainly the hands on labor and construction.
"The program significantly impacts the indirect job market as well; the job market created by the material suppliers, the product manufacturers, even the trainers whom weatherization depends upon."
They're the supply chain for our weatherization technology and this panel that's next is going to help touch on that of the training and the technology the tools that we use.
"The weatherization program has been a technological breeding ground for over twenty five years, which enabled these suppliers to develop the cutting edge technologies that reduce energy costs for those homes that can least afford any inefficiency, as well as ensure that homes are healthy and safe."
"In so doing, these businesses are helping create green technology jobs that our country needs to compete in the global energy economy."
"Today we're seeing tools and techniques techniques that were introduced into the program as standard practice nearly twenty years ago, if not more."
And now we're seeing them gradually being integrated into the broader construction and retrofit industry.
"The weatherization program creates jobs in technology, manufacturing, supply, training, and construction."
One day we'll look back and see that the first round of jobs creation was just the tip of the iceberg.
So let's try another quiz.
This one's going to be quite a bit trickier.
"Here the question is, ""What does the 'sum' procedure do?"""
"And here's the definition of 'sum,' so here we're defining the procedure of sum."
"It takes two inputs, ""a"" and ""b,"" and its body assigns to ""a"" the value of ""a"" plus ""b."""
So the choices are:
"Nothing; that it takes two numbers as its inputs, and outputs the sum of the two numbers; that it takes two strings as its inputs, and outputs the concatenation of those two strings."
"So the final choice is that it takes two numbers as its inputs, and changes the value of the first input to be the sum of the two numbers."
This is a quite tricky question.
I would encourage you to try some experiments in the Python interpreter to see if you can determine for sure what the sum procedure does.
We can see that there's a common factor of x minus 5 in the numerator and in the denominator.
So we know those simplify to 1.
This would leave us with x minus 6 in the numerator and x minus 4 in the denominator.
Great job on that simplification.
Once upon a time in a faraway land there was once a little girl who preferred to play instead of doing her math homework.
"Griselda, have you done your math homework? yes your majesty"
"I did it this morning but.. my little one, obviously you do not know the difference between addition and multiplication. wouldn't it be better if you told the truth?"
"Ha, I escaped the slavery of homework!"
Ay what a beautiful day.
I have all day to enjoy.
"Ay, no more of 2 plus two is five and a half what a bore"
"I know that two times two is the same. ay, what an entrance ah, there is the little girl grumbler no ,griselda, my name is Griselda ah, I knew that"
"I'd like to remind you to watch previous episodes, and subscribe to our channel, and send funny videos to the link below."

Hi everybody.
"Please watch 3altayer Lam, with Omar Hussein and Ahmad Fathaldin."
"In addition to Fe2a Fala 10, with Ammar and Mahmoud Ramadan."
Enjoy watching.
"Okay, folks, in this clip, I'm going to talk to you about how to become an artist."
That
largely depends on what type of artist you want to be.
"If you want to go into school for design and architecture, obviously, you need to go off to design school or to a university and major in architectural design or graphic design."
"It largely, these days, deals with computer software, a lot of your work now is done with computer and no longer by hand, but it is definitely still a very popular form of artistic expression, I would say."
And there's a lot of money to be made in it.
"Another route you might choose to go is the animation or visual illustration, such as graphic novel, that particular route."
What
"I would advise doing in that is, if you feel like you need to take courses or classes or get your degree in art or studying art in any way, shape or form, that would be great, not entirely necessary though."
What you really need is a lot of practice.
And what you also need is a very good portfolio.
These two things combined will come through crystal clear to you when you're applying to these types of jobs.
"Granted, it always looks good on your resume to say that, yes, I majored in art design in school and art history or whatever to show that you got your degree."
"But at the end of the day, what they're really going to care about is your portfolio."
"So, if you're going to go in the animation route or the illustration, graphic novel route, make sure you have a very, very comprehensive portfolio of your work, one that really showcases what you can do."
That is the most important thing to become and becoming that kind of artist.
"Now, if you want to be free of all that, you know, daily grind, working, punching a clock, working for a boss, you know, nonsense, you can always go the freelance route, where you take on gigs based on, you know, your own skills and availability."
"You could open up your own gallery, which is, you know, going to take a lot more than just a wink and a smile."
"You know, you're going to need to find a building, obviously, potentially some investors who are willing to initially back you."
You're going to need to have something to sell.
You're going to need to be able to create a product that people are crazy about.
"And, eventually, when you build up your own reputation, your success, you know you're pretty well established at that point and that would, in my mind, be the cream of the crop job for any aspiring artist, having your own art gallery and have your work displayed in galleries across the world."
That would be another route that you could take.
"It's about a passion for the next generation that learning from own mistake, that it's selfishness, it's greed, it's self-interest that has made this country poor and corrupt."
"And so, we hope that we can get more of the students in Xavier to really invest in countryside development."
We're coming up with our social innovation camps this summer.
We are building a 100-bed facility now in Angat.
"And we'll be inviting the Business and Management students and even the third year and fourth year high school to come up in our career camps and also for us to really train them in social entrepreneurship, in green innovation and so on."
"So, we have - this is, to me, the most interesting place in the world to live in."
"It's, to me, the most exciting time to be Filipino."
"And it's not even about legal citizenship, it's not even the colour of our skin."
"Right now, I have with me our volunteers from France."
"This year, we're expecting over 1000 people from Europe who will do their internship with us in our Gawad Kalinga communities because they're starting to see that this is now the Asian age and this is also the time for global partnership, that those who have developed technology in the West will be able to really work with the creative talents of our country, to really transform this country and make it productive and expand the market base."
A lot of big business now are supporting us because they realize that investing and bringing people out of poverty makes good business sense because it expands the market base.
And it also brings peace which is very important in terms of sustainability.
So this is just an old man rattling.
I am very - I'm always very impatient for young people to wake up and for them to now be connected because many of our young people have very
- they are very idealistic.
Their hearts are less corrupted and their minds are less polluted but they're just disconnected.
"They're connected through social networking, they're all Facebook users, Twitter users."
"They go to the clubs, et cetera."
But they do not know the poor.
"So the first thing that this - the brightest and the best of people here and abroad, just"
"like what the French are doing, is for them to know the poor because that is the abandoned wealth of the world."
For them also to go to the rural areas because it's not just in the malls that you find opportunities or in the developed areas.
"Because, you know, areas that have hit rock bottom have no place to go but up."
That's where the opportunities are.
"And so, again, we hope that you can continue to help us as we transform the countryside."
"First, we're addressing the needs of the disaster victims right now, we are building 5000 homes for the Sendong victims in Mindanao."
We have a team right now to help also the earthquake victims in Dumaguete.
And the amazing thing is just build and they will come.
"If they - if you build, you tried and if you show the world, the people also who are part of this because that cannot be done by one man or one organization."
"My role is to just create the platform, my role is just connect people, my role is to just for us to really be on the same page in terms of the kind of world we want to build."
"And so, this is an exciting time."
My only problem is that I have enjoyed working with young people.
"Why can't we just say ""he called me a pig"" and then forget about it."
"Instead of allowing us to trigger that emotion of anger, ill-will whatever else it is."
"The anger that comes up in you, you actually you allow it to happen."
"There is no reason for it at all, you don't have to follow that path."
"If you trace anger back, where did you get angry from, you can actually see a series of irritations which you dwell upon, you think about, and you create the fire."
"Anger is like a blaze, like a forest fire, but all forest fires they start just with a small spark."
And even that small spark it starts just with a small little fire in the twigs or in the leaves.
If you catch it quickly it's just so easy to put out.
"But a lot of times we don't notice it that easily, until it gets so big, so big it's a forest fire."
"Living in the bush, and having experienced major bushfires, I know just how difficult they are to put out once they are fully alight."
It's much better to catch them earlier.
"If you can catch these negative emotions earlier, through you mindfulness, through your awareness, through your mental training, it's not that hard to actually to transcend emotions such as anger, or fear, or grief."
"If we really want to, we can train ourselves."
"And it's not like a training of willpower, it's always a training of wisdom power, to see where these things come from, to see their cause, how they're built up and catch them earlier."
"Even some of the people who have panic attacks, who get very afraid in certain situations, sometimes you think the panic or the fear just comes up almost immediately, but it doesn't, there are signs there.."
And trouble is that sometimes we're so busy that we're not really aware what's going on in our body or in our mind because we're taken up with the needs of the moment.
"We don't actually notice how these emotions are getting built up in us, and how they're being reinforced by unskillful thought patterns."
"Even like depression, another negative emotion, we create that."
"And again through some unskillful thinking, not being mindful, not actually understanding where these things come from we build up the negativity, minute by minute, day by day, until in gets so strong and then we notice it like the huge fire."
"So what are the ways of understanding these emotions, especially the negative emotions, is actually to trace back where they come from."
"If you're angry, if you're afraid, ask why."
"Over in Thailand, the Thais are just so so afraid of ghosts."
"And there was amazing, that sometimes like the one thing they were most afraid of was actually being with a newly dead body."
And being a Westerner I wasn't afraid of that at all.
I remember once when
"I think it was Ajahn Chah's brother that died and was being cremated, I told one of the monks - I'm just going to go and do some meditation by the corpse."
"He said ""what?!"" I said ""I'm going to do some meditation by the..""."
"He said ""have a cup of coffee""."
I thought - that's really nice.
And I couldn't understand why they were giving me all this coffee.
"And the reason way they were so impressed that anybody could sit in meditation next to a newly dead corpse, because they were just so afraid of that."
"So once I found that out, I always went to say I'm going to sit by a corpse, and they brought all this nice coffee."

In this section we are going to talk about meal planning for diabetes.
I split the information into two parts because we're going to look at two relatively different approaches.
In this first 1st part I'm just going to go through some of the basics about healthy meal planning for people that have diabetes.
Speaking first about the macronutrient mix.
"The mix of carbohydrate, protein and fat, should be adjusted per the individual's preferences."
"And it should be adjusted, based on how they're doing, the blood sugars are looking good, and we're getting the desirable outcomes, if the person wants to lose weight, and that's working."
There maybe small little changes that might need to be made along the way.
"What's important to know is, that there is no, one size fits all approach."
For meal planning in diabetes.
"We can't just rip off a pad of paper and say, this is your 2,000 calorie diabetic diet."
It doesn't work like that.
And we know that the diet therapy for people that have diabetes has to be highly personalized.
"Like all new plans, if you don't like some components of it you're not going to be likely to stick with it."
"So it is important if you're working with, with people who have diabetes, to find out what sort of foods they like."
Find out what their end goals and outcomes are and to make a meal plan that really meets their individual needs.
"Carbohydrate is, and will be, and always has been, the most important nutrient of concern for people that have diabetes."
"Monitoring carbohydrate intake, and monitoring that carbohydrate intake's affect on blood sugar, is really the primary tenet of meal planning for people that have diabetes."
There is all sorts of different ways that you can help regulate or track how much carbohydrate an individual is eating.
There's tools like carbohydrate counting.
You can use what are called exchange lists for tracking carbohydrate intake.
Or people that get pretty good at this might have had diabetes for a while.
Can start using experience based estimations. becaus e they have a pretty good idea of how much carb is in the food that they're about to eat.
And what effect that's going to have on their blood sugar.
Dietary fiber is very important for people who have diabetes.
"Recommendation is that you should aim for somewhere around 14 grams for every 1,000 calories that you eat."
"But if we say your average adult can get by with 2,000 calories per day they would need about 28 grams of fiber a day."
Half of the grains that you should eat in your diet should be whole grains if at all possible.
Fiber plays a very important roll in helping to minimize blood sugar spikes from carbohydrate intake.
"We might test that the mean is zero versus the alternative, that the mean is greater than zero or the mean is less than zero."
And again this could be useful as a screening device.
Because assets that have means that are positive are assets that are giving or making money.
Assets that have negative means are assets that are losing money.
And so if you're constucting a portfolio you wanna go long the assets that are making money and go short the assets that are losing money for example.
"So you can use, use hypothesis testing as a screening device in that context."
"And then similarly, you know, the screen device for assets that are you know, good diversifiers in a portfolio, could be correlation of zero versus the correlation is positive or, or negative."
Another kind of hypothesis test is a test about one of the assumptions of the model.
"So, in the constant expected return model, the asset returns are assumed to be normally distributed."
"And we've done a lot of descriptive statistics to, get a feeling for how good that assumption is."
Right?
"We looked at histograms, we looked at Q-Q plots."
"Now, we would like to have a rigorous test of this hypothesis, so we're gonna say, are the returns normal or not?"
Well we need to make a decision.
All right?
And so we would like to be able to test the hypothesis that returns are normal versus the alternative that they are not normal.
Okay.
So why is this important?
Well.
"One of the reasons, well, when you assume a distribution for returns, that dictates, for example, how you compute value at risk on your asset."
"So if I assume returns are normally distributed, then I compute value at risk based on the quantile of a normal distribution."
Okay?
"If the normal distribution's not appropriate, then I should be using some other quantile estimate, to compute value at risk."
"So, you know, again, we could, value at risk is an interesting risk metric."
And how we compute it depends upon assumptions of our model.
"And so if we want to use the formula for normal value at risk, then we should test the hypothesis to see if the normal distribution is appropriate before we use that technique."
So that's a reason here.
And then also in portfolio theory we have the underlying assumption that returns are essentially multivariate normally distributed.
And if that assumption is broadly not very good then we should perhaps look at an alternative way of creating portfolios rather than using the traditional portfolio analysis.
"And so that's, that's another reason."
"Now, another kind of test it, is based on another assumption of the model."
In our constant expect to return model we expect assets are uncorrelated over time.
"They make it a, a force that pervades the entire ship and that force of course centers on Captain Stone who's mad, but then infects everybody else, even our hero."
So this is how sound more or less works in
Ghost Ship it underscores the surface emotions.
That's how sound generally works in Hollywood.
"The, the idea Orchestral score tells us how to feel."
"But in this film, sound also gives us access to subjectivity."
"It tells us what's going on in character's minds, even when they don't want to show it to other characters."
"And for Lewton and Robson, the one thing it gives us that's new is that tension between sound and image."
And the entire film is about that.
The tension between what we see and what we hear.
"And that's going to be in the tension, attention that informs the entire horror film for Val Luten."
The difference between the surface that seems happy and the darkness which is always beneath.
So sound in this film creates a foreboding atmosphere.
It's the sound of the wind and the sound of the fog horn and the sound of the engine room.
The sound of Billy Radd singing that cannot ever be taken out of the ship and that always points forward to the darkness and doom.
If there is a ghost in the film it's I think the ghost of being a professional.
"This is a film about the horrors of being middle aged and having a job where you have to have authority over others, and you loose your sense of right and wrong and your ability to touch and understand the world at the very dark look at middle aged."
"And then the film has these great set pieces, theses scenes of terror, or suggested terror that loved, and we looked at the hook in which sound creates a monster out of."
"Of this, this object of the hook and makes it much bigger than just a piece of equipment on the ship and I recommend you look at the chain sequence and think about how sound works there because it does even more to turn that chain into, into a beast that is the monster of the film."
Began this class with two silent masterpieces really the last gasp of silent film made right when sound was coming in.
"And in those films we saw transcendent images, images that were lifted out of time and space and were emotionally charged speaking directly to the audience and an abstract way."
"Sound then, changes things because it makes the world more solid, more concrete, more mundane."
And we saw a different artists struggle with different ways of using sound.
"If sound limits abstraction one way to deal with it is to try to still go after silent abstraction, while having dialogue."
And that's what Rouben Mamoulian did in applause.
"He really, kind of, split the difference between the inflexibility of the new technology."
And its desire to have a more transcendent style.
"And in the end, the film works, but when it reaches after the silent, style it fails, because it can never become as fluid or dynamic as something like Street Angel, or Docks of New York."
"Vaudeville comedians like the Marx Brothers, took the concreteness and the solidity of the sound world and ran with it."
They brought iwth them an ability to manipulate oral space.
And enliven the soundtrack.
"And at the same time, the in congruence between their anarchy and the solidity of the world made things all the more funny."
"So they, they, they, they are connected to some extent."
"So, that's the baseline approach."
The next one is the detailed analysis approach.
This one is a
little bit more in depth.
"So, what you're going to do here is an in depth analysis and identification of assets, and assessment of the threat levels against those assets, and associated vulnerabilities."
"So, this is more a more comprehensive approach similar to what we talked about earlier with that three step flow."
The security level appropriate for the security need is identified using this approach.
"So, rather than setting a baseline and then comparing everything against the baseline, this focuses on a specific combination of threat, vulnerability, asset, and consequence."
The next one is a combined approach which combines the baseline and detailed analysis.
"What you do here is that, primarily, focus this approach high risk exposures."
"And, you would do a detailed analysis of the high risk areas, and then use the baseline approach on everyth ing else."
"So, rather than do a selective risk analysis where you may, and it certainly wouldn't make economic sense for you to try to do a detailed analysis of everything."
Remember we talked about priority.
"However, by using this combination of detailed for high risk areas and base line for everything else, you were able to touch a pretty wide swath of the organization and do it in a efficient and economical way."
"So that's, that's the benefit of the combination approach."
"And then, the last approach is the informal approach which is sort of the, you know, using your gut, using your heuristics, you know, things that you"
"learned, you know, rules of thumb and its not structured at all."
I would argue against doing the informal approach unless its the only approach you can do.
"And in some organizations, it may be the only approach you can do."
"Like I said, any, any approach is better than no approach."
"But, keep in mind that it's going to be very difficult for you to document that for you to make it repeatable. and if, if, you know, something you'll have to, live with."
"So, you know, think, think in terms of what's going to happen down the road as you make choices with respect to what's the right risk analysis approach for you and your organization."
This is that exhibit I was referring to.
"Basically, what you do with the a, with they baseline approach is you would set a baseline."
"We say, this is where we want our level of protection to be."
"And then, you would look at various assets and say, well, where are we vis-a-vis that level with respect to asset A. We've got a gap."
"And that's why you guys have all heard the term gap analysis, this is also called a gap analysis."
"You know, with asset B, you know, there's still a gap, and it's smaller."
"With asset C, there's no gap."
"In fact, we're higher than the level of protection we specified."
What does that mean?
"And after about one or two minutes she stopped moving her arms up and down, she stopped shouting, and at that point Ajahn Jagaro put down his spoon, put aside his bowl, and said ""what happened?"""
I thought it was a beautiful piece of psychological calming a person's emotions down.
"Because he was not responding with anxiety to her great distress, he was just calming her down just by his actions and by his softness, she too calmed down in the space of one or two minutes."
It was the most brilliant counselling
I'd seen for years.
He was giving her a sense of perspective about what had happened.
"So by having someone who was calm, was not being agitated, she could calm down too and see the bigger picture."
"Which is what happens sometimes, when we see this is my boyfriend that's left me, this is my child that's died, this is my job which someone else has taken, these are my shares which have just all disappeared, it's my team the Dockers have lost - I'm being fair because I've mentioned the Eagles first now I'm mentioning the Dockers."
Sometimes that we when lose perspective we can actually get emotionally distraught and that was a very beautiful way that he dealt with that by calming her down to see a bigger picture.
"Not negating her feelings but acknowledging them, but calming them down."
"Because you see just how these emotions can get built up, what actually builds them up and how they're created."
I just was at a funeral service this afternoon - and I enjoy taking funerals because at a funeral service you do have a group of people who are emotionally raw.
They've just
"lost a close member of their family or their friend and it's, I've seen many many times just how grief can be created or how that feeling of grief can be calmed down to get a different emotion coming up."
"I can actually see that I remember even when my own father died that obviously I knew my mother so well but when my father died she knew he was going to die, you know he came very close many times, when he actually did die she was at ease, at peace with it."
"It was only when a cousin came in to the house and opened up her arms to my mother and said, ""oh you poor thing"", and of course that meant the floodgates of my mother's tears started coming."
And I knew that if that cousin hadn't said that stupid thing my mother would be much more at peace with the death of her husband and my father.
"It was as if that there was a social trigger there, that you've lost your husband that you must cry, and that was pressed by this cousin when, before that happened she did not need to go on that path of grief."
And I've seen so often that our social conditioning creates these emotions.
And one of the things which I love doing if you're teaching at a funeral is to actually give people other triggers.
"Trigger not to actually generate these emotions in the same old ways, but look at them in a different way."
To give different triggers to different emotions.
"And let's look at another sort-of emotion, the emotion of anger."
Where does that anger come from?
"You know the old story, that someone calls you a pig, I don't know if anyone's called you a pig today, but now I'm going to call you a pig."
And what happens when somebody calls you a pig?
"You think - ""they have no right to call me a pig!"
Who does he think he is to call me a pig!?
I am not a pig!
"He shouldn't call me a pig."" And every time you remember that I've called you a pig, you allow me to call you a pig one more time."
Every time you remember that I'm calling you a pig again.
Why do we do such things?
"Maybe you want to do the initial page load on the server side so you can send HTML over the first view, so views are going to be looking at that while you're sending the rest of the scripts over."
You can do that now trivially.
"It used to be you had to write the program twice in order to have the two views, but now you only have to do that once."
"If you wanted to have a web service which provides a portion of that view so that it can be included in other programs, that web service can be created with the same program."
"We've got other advantages, too."
We can take advantage of YUl's connection manager to go off to several services simultaneously and get additional material that we want to put onto the page.
"That all happens asynchronously, so the time cost we spend on that is the max of all of the services that we go out and read."
"Whereas if you're doing it in PHP, you pay for the sum of the time of all of those services, which can be significantly bigger."
"In PHP you can do it asynchronously, but it's hard, and nobody wants to do hard in PHP."
That's madness.
[laughter]
That's not what it's for.
"But in JavaScript, on YUl, in node, it's easy and it's wonderful, so it's a huge advantage."
"Also we're running on V8, which is Google's JavaScript engine, which is a very nice engine."
"It comes out of the Self tradition, which is really smart stuff."
"It observes the program as it's interpreting it, and if it sees patterns of recurrence then it goes OK, I think I know what's going on, I will compile it and make that little bit of code faster."
"So it starts finding sequences in the code it can make fast, and eventually your program's going really, really fast."
"V8 is also available in the Chrome browser, and it's not as effective there because you tend not to spend that much time on running a program on any page."
"But in the server, you're running there all day, so there's a good opportunity for it to learn about your program and speed it up."
So this is really wonderful configuration.
"If you look at the stack of protocols that we have to work with, we've got the wonderful"
"IP, which can move a packet pretty much from anyplace in the world to any other place."
It's a wonderful thing.
"We've got TCP that runs on top of it, which makes it reliable and provides for sequencing."
That's a really good thing.
"Then we've got HTTP, which is just completely wrong."
"It was designed for a time when the web was a static document retrieval system, and it's fine for that, but that's not what we do now."
"We're not retrieving static documents, we've got highly interactive applications going over this channel, so the fact that HTTP is stateless becomes a real problem."
"We spend a lot of time in working our Ajax stuff, trying to put the state back in, and it's hard."
"It'd be nice if we could just get rid of HTTP completely and run Ajax on top of TCP, which would be really clean and elegant and performant and wonderful."
"I don't think that'll ever happen because there's so much arthritis that's found its way into the internet now; all these nodes out in the network that will only allow HTTP through, so that really the only value in HTTP now is for funnelling, because that's the only thing that can get through the firewalls and the proxy servers."
"Stupid, but that's the world we live in."
"But to pick up where we left off last time, was we had written a vector based implementation of the stack abstraction and so looking at the main operations here for a stack or push and pop array that its mechanism here is just to add to the end of the vector that we've got."
"So I'm letting the vector handle all the growing, and resizing, and memory, and manipulations that are needed for that."
"And then, when asked to pop one, we just take the one that was last most added, which will be at the far end of the array."
"And so given the way vector behaves, knowing that we know it's a continuous array based backing behind it, then we're getting this O of one access to that last element to either add a new one down there or to retrieve one and remove it from the end so that push and pop operations will both being in constant time no matter how many elements are in the stack, 10, 15, 6 million, the little bit of work we're doing is affecting only the far end of the array and not causing the rest of the configured storage to be jostled whatsoever so pretty easy to get up and running."
"So in general, once you have one abstraction you can start leveraging it into building other attractions and the vector manages a lot of the things that any array based implementation would need."
"So rather than using a raw array, there's very little reason to kind of, you know, ditch vector and go the straight raw array in this case because all it basically does it open up opportunities for error and kind of management and the kind of efficiency you can gain back by removing vectors intermediate stuff is really not very profound so not worth, probably, taking on."
What we do is consider the only link limitation.
We had talked about a link
list for a vector and we kind of discarded it as likely not to lead anywhere interesting.
"I actually, am going to fully pursue it for this stack because it actually turns out that a link list is a good fit for what the behavior that a stack needs in terms of the manipulations and flexibility."
"So if I have a stack of enterers where I push 10, 20, and 30."
I'm going to do that same diagram we did for the vector one as I did for the stack is one possibility is that I put them in the list in this order.
"Another possibility is that I put them in, in this order."
We'll call this Strategy A; we'll call this Strategy B.
"They seem, you know, fairly symmetric, right."
If they're going to be a strong reason that
"leaves us to prefer Strategy A over B, or are they just equally easy to get the things done that we need to do?"
Anybody want to make an argument for me.
Help me out.
"Last in, first out."
"Last in, first out."
[Inaudible].
Be careful here.
"So 10, 20, 30 means the way the stack works is like this, 10, 20, 30 and so it's at the top that we're interested in, right?"
Um hm.
That the top is where activity is taking place.
Oh.
So we want to be adding things and losing from the top.
So do we want to put the top at the end of our list or at the front of our list?
Which is the easier to access in the link list design?
[Inaudible].
"The front, right?"
I'm going to argue that it's a pretty reasonable one.
We tried limiting our recursion to only add new routes that were cheaper than existing routes to and from the same place.
We weren't allowed to do that syntactically the recursive with statement didn't allow the sub query with the recursively defined relation in it.
"So we're going to do a different change here where we're not going to add new roots to our flight when the length of the root, in other words the number of flights contributing to that root, is greater than or equal to ten."
So how do we do that?
"We're going to add to our recursively defined relation route the origin, destination and total cost of that."
And then we are going to add the length.
"And so that's going to put in each root tupple, how many flights were involved in the root."
So let's see how we do that with our recursion.
We still have the base case here and the recursively defined union.
"In our base case, we're going to be adding to our route the non-stop flights, so we'll have exactly what thought we had before, and then we'll have the constant one to say that this non-stop flight is just one flight."
"Then when we do our recursion, we're joining our route relation that we're building up by extending it with an additional flight exactly as before, but there is two changes here."
One of them is that we're going to compute our new length by adding one to the existing length of the root for our new root because we're adding one flight.
And then we're only going to add tupples to the root relation when the length of the route that we're adding is
less than ten.
So now let's see what happens.
I'm going to start again by
looking at all of the costs of getting from point
A to point B and then we'll take to look at finding the least.
"So, we'll go ahead and execute the query and we see that we have, one, two, three, four, five ways of getting from A to B, where the length of the number of flights involved is less than or equal to 10."
We see our friends here.
This was the nonstop flight.
This was the one through Boston.
Here's our favorite one and there's a few more so these are going to go through that cycle a couple of times.
"But once we get to the length of ten, we're not going to add any more, so we've got termination and if we want to change it to find the minimum cost flight, then it's just the min total as before, and we'll find good old 175."
"Now what 's unaesthetic about this, is that we're actually limiting the amount of recursion."
"So, the whole point of writing recursive queries is when we don't know the minimum number of computations that we need to do to get our answer."
"So maybe it would so happen to turn out that more than ten flights were required to get the cheapest and, if that was the case, then we wouldn't get our right answer."
"Of course, we could change it to a hundred and we'd still get the one seventy five."
"And, you know, honestly we could change it to 10,000 and you can't see it happening here but it is actually recomputing that 175 even when I put in 10,000."
"I can even do a 100,000 and still going to work for me."
"So, if we presume that nobody wants to take more than a 100,000 flights in order to get from Point A to Point B in the cheapest fashion then, this would be a reasonable way to bound the recursion and get the answer that we want."
"The nutrients are held in the skin primarily so you want to take off a little skin as possible with carrots the skin is nice and thin, with parsnips itís a little bit tougher on the outside so I usually, actually peel them but if you use a peeler it will take off very"
little of the skin.
Ok!
"So peel them and then weíre gonna cut them into sticks, as small as you like."
"The smaller would be more fine, obviously!"
"Thicker sticks will be a little bit, a little bit crunchier and thatís fun too."
Alright!
Vegetables are chopped and I always like to multitask when I steamed so wrap them in just boiling water and putting my steamer over top and boiling some potatoes for something else that Iím doing tonight.
In water and then Iím gonna put my bamboo steamer over top of the pot so whenever your steaming vegetables you need to add just a touch of salt to them to help them cook.
Now you can avoid this if youíre on a sodium free diet but just keep in mind that the vegetables will not cook as quickly so theyíre gonna have to be steaming for a lot longer if youíre not using salt.
And Iíve just used a very tiny amount on this big pile of vegetables and at this point you can mix the carrots and the parsnip together when you steam you donít have to worry to keep them separate.
"My potatoes are really going here so put these into your steamer, calm!"
Calm down!
"If something is boiling by the way and you blow on it, it will bring the bubbles right down, the froth if you will."
Alright!
"So last one parsnip, there you go!"
"Steamer full of vegetables, that is a beautiful sight, right there."
Iím going to put the top on.
Put this over my potatoes and they need about 15 minutes to soften up a little bit.
"So while those are going, what you can do is turn your oven 350F or somewhere there about and weíre gonna toast some mustard seeds."
Now these guys donít take very long to toast and put about a tablespoon into a baking dish so they donít need to go in right away.
"And depending how on long your oven takes to heat, you can leave it off for a little while, mine takes a little while to heat up so itís about 5 minutes and Iíil put the mustard seeds in for a couple of minutes."
And then take it out and get things ready to go so that they can go back into the oven so you donít want to turn the oven too early like while your chopping up your vegetable is too early and then your oven gonna be on until you put those vegetables back in.
"Now while weíre waiting we can also make the glazed and this is gonna be really simple one, like I said itís maple Dijon."
"Get about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and when youíre buying mustard like anything else look at the ingredients and see whatís in there because you donít want a lot of crap when youíre making this really good food from scratch and then you throw some crappy mustard on top, thatís not really that great."
"So this mustard has organic apple cider vinegar, organic mustard seed, some salt and some spices."
"Pretty good, right?"
And per teaspoon it has 65 milligrams of sodium which isnít a whole lot and what that mean is I donít have to use any salt in this dressing.
Normally I would put just a pinch of salt to bring the flavors together but because thereís salt in the mustard Iím gonna leave that out.
"Now what Iím gonna add next is olive oil, extra virgin means that itís the first press of the olive which means that they donít have to use much heat, they donít have to use chemicals."
Itís an easy press; itís also the most nutritious press because itís the first time the olives are getting press into oil.
So always extra virgin and some maple syrup and for those of you who are wondering yes
"The power to over-rule and suspend elected government, justified by a financial emergency."
"Oh, and how do you know when you're in a financial emergency?"
Because the governor tells you you're in a financial emergency.
"Or a company he hires to so, does that instead."
"The Senate version of the bill, in Michigan, says it has to be humans declaring your fiscal emergency, the House bill says a firm can do that just as well."
This is about a lot of things.
This is not about a budget.
"This is using, or fabricating crisis, to push for an agenda, you'd never be able to sell under normal circumstances."
"And so, you have to convince everyone that these are not normal circumstances."
These are desperate circumstances.
And your desperate measures are therefore somehow required.
What this is has a name.
It is called Shock Doctrine.
This video is about the coalitional game theory solution concept called the core.
Recall that the Shapley value told us about how to divide the coalition's value fairly among all of its members.
"In this video We instead want to think about whether the agents would be willing to form the grand coalition, as compared to forming smaller coalitions that might give all of their members greater value than they're able to achieve in the grand coalition."
Let's begin by looking at an example which we're going to call the voting game.
"We're going to think about a parliament that consists of four political parties which we'll call A, B, C and D."
Each of these parties have a different number of seats in the parliament.
"45 seats, 25, 15 and 15 respectively."
The parties have to vote to decide whether to pass a spending bill of a 100 million dollars and also to decide amongst themselves how to divide that spending between the parties.
"It's necessary to get a majority which is to say fifty one votes in order to pass any legislation and of course if the bill doesn't pass, then there will be no money for any of the parties to spend."
Let's begin by thinking about the Shapley values in this case.
"I,"
"I'll tell you what the answer is in a second, but you may want to pause the video here and work out for yourself what the Shapley values are in this situation."
"So, these are the Shapley values here."
I won't show you how we did the calculation.
"Notice in particular, That even though, B and C and D have different numbers of votes, they end up getting the same value in the Shapley value."
"The question that I want to focus on today, is whether any sub-coalition can gain, by defecting from the grand coalition?"
Again I'll invite you to pause and think about that before I give you the answer.
"So the answer is that a sub-coalition can gain, in particular, A and B together could form a sub-coalition which would do better than the grand coalition and Being paid according to the Shopley values."
"So, A and B by themselves have en ough votes to pass the legislation without the help of C and D and if they were to divide the 100 million amongst themselves, for example 75, 25, then they would each get more than they got Under the Shapley value division, and they would still pass the legislation."
"You kind of figure, you've kind of, kind of got yourself behind the eight ball there. so you have to weigh, you know, and, and I know there's a certain amount of security in working for, for that organization."
"But, the you've got to weigh that against number one, the fact that you really don't have any meaningful measure for how well you're doing."
"All you can do is fail, you can't succeed."
"And number two, it'd be very easy for at the time of making, making any decision with respect to your career for management to say, you didn't meet our expectation, you didn't meet our goal, which puts you in a very bad spot."
"Of course, another, another, you know, way to approach it would be to be, you know, try to become, you know, someone who could influence management's thinking on that topic."
"I mean, it's one thing to have an aspirational goal."
"There are organizations, you know, companies that adopt six sigma, for example."
"You know, one error in a, in a million."
"I mean, that's an aspirational goal."
Some companies achieve it.
"I mean, one error in a million's different from zero errors in a million."
Tremendous disparity between the two.
"I know it doesn't sound like it is, but it is. so, you might want to talk with them about, you know, something more realistic, like developing something like a six sigma type approach applied to information security or something like that."
"That way, you know, you're trying to be part of the solution instead of either, you know, walking away or just accepting."
"So, that might be a, a thought."
"And, you know, who knows, if you, as far as I know,"
"I mean, I'm not aware of any papers."
"Any research where, wh ere someone has tried to apply six sigma type methods."
"And certainly, there's, there, you know, probably management methods that have been applied to information security."
But I don't think specifically six sigma.
"You know, there might be something to it in terms of, you know, either publishing something or, or developing some sort of consulting business around it, or something like that."
It could be kind of interesting to look at. residual risk is the remaining risk after you've applied controls.
"And, you need to make sure when you do your risk assessment report, that you highlight the fact that we've got this exposure, we've got this control framework."
"And after the beneficial effect of these control, this is what's left."
And get management to sign off on the fact that they acknowledge that you have pointed out to them that there is residual risk that exists after the application of controls.
"It's really, really important."
"When you're accepting risks, there are two primary considerations."
"The first one is, after you implement the control, you need to be sure that what you've done actually satisfies an acceptable level, level of risk."
"So, going back to the example of the gap analysis, you know, if you remember, asset A. There was a big gap between where management had, had set the, the bar, as far as protective controls."
And where the protective controls actually were for that asset.
"So, you put in a new widget which is supposed to get it up to the level."
"You need to test it and make sure that it, that it is up to the level."
"The important message is that at the scale of life on the planet, global warming is trivial."
Life has dealt with it and will deal with it just fine.
"There will be extinctions, but life will not go extinct because of global warming."
"There's been plenty of species that could deal with much warmer conditions on the planet, and those kinds of things will increase in abundance as things warm."
However that doesn't mean that global warming is not important.
"Global warming is especially important because of sea level rise, and because of the increase in variation in weather patterns, which means that both periods of drought and floods will become more frequent at intermediate latitudes, and the intensity and the number of major storms will probably increase."
It would be interesting to know what the hurricane strength was
like back in the Silurian.
You know?
"Katrina might have been just a little blip, compared to a"
"Silurian hurricane, but unfortunately we don't know how big they were."
Now the fate of the carbon that was in the original planetary atmosphere can be sketched here.
"And basically what you see is that it's mostly in limestone and in sediment, and there's a huge chunk of it sitting in the ocean as bicarbonate."
So think about that the next time you buy a bottle of soda water or sparkling water.
"That's representative of 37 or 38,000 gigatons of carbon."
"Fossil fuel, organic sediment and so forth, you find that there's dissolved CO_2, which actually is the molecule CO_2, and not as the bicarbonate ion, in the ocean."
"Living biomass, fairly small; methane in the atmosphere pretty small."
"So when you look at that, you wonder well where is the biggest source of carbon that might get mobilized into the atmosphere?"
And in fact it's in methane hydrate.
Okay?
Methane hydrate will be a solid in cold water but it will melt and release methane with just a little increase in temperature.
Okay?
"It turns out there's about 100 trillion cubic meters of methane hydrate stockpiled around the planet, sitting there in sediments, ready to be mobilized."
"So if the world's oceans warm up by a few degrees, there will be a very dramatic positive feedback effect as this methane comes bubbling out."
"And methane is a more efficient greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, by quite a bit."
"So its contribution to global warming could triple and really accelerate, if things warm up."
And this is just a picture showing you that methane hydrate is stored in places like the sediments underneath deep water.
"So you have, say in the Arctic, it will be fairly shallow; off Louisiana it will be fairly deep."
But there's a lot of it.
The phosphorous cycle is different from the carbon and nitrogen cycles because phosphorous doesn't have a gaseous phase.
It's a solid or a liquid.
And it's the scarcest essential element.
"Now, more secure connections that could that, too, hasn't been seen too much yet."
We do track that on gsmmap.org.
"The second way, of course, of making this system uncorrectable is to decrease the key size sufficiently so that none of these tradeoffs"
leads to practical values anymore.
"That is used, for instance, in 3G and 4G networks most of the time."
"Then a third way of protecting against these types of attacks that assume, if you predict a message you have a direct mapping between message out and key, is to introduce an auxiliary input."
"It's usually called either a ""nonce"" for random number or initialization vector."
"GSM, in fact, does have an initialization vector, so you would think that it breaks the correlation between key and message."
Now you'd have to compute your table separately for every nonce.
This is sort of like adding SALT to passwords.
Exactly.
This is the exact same system as adding SALT.
This has been included in GSM.
"However, the nonce is only effective if the attacker has to go for the key to break the system."
"There are different encryption functions that are attackable with time-memory trade-offs in different ways, in particular for block ciphers."
"This protection measure works out of the box, because the block cipher consumes the key, crunches it in complex ways and outputs the message."
"Unlike those, stream ciphers take the key, do once more computation, do the same computation again, do the same computation again-- in the case of GSM 100 times--and then outputs the message."
"It becomes a function that's consistent over very many smaller functions and the nonce is, of course, only input at the very beginning."
"To make this now resistant against time-memory tradeoff their intermediate states--those results of the first round, second round, and so forth to the 100th round--have to be a non-attackable time-memory tradeoff."
"That sometimes is achieved by a large, internal state of the function."
"For instance, the GPRS functions or etch function--2.5G networks-- they also consume a 64-bit key, but they have an internal state of at least 96 bits."
"That is a protection, because now the attacker has to go for the key after all."
"However, if you use a small internal state, then the attacker can go to attack that internal state and GSM falls exactly in this category, and then the countermeasure doesn't work anymore."
So the internal state is still 64 bits. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Exactly. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Combining the key and the nonce.
Yeah.
"Message in, the key, and the message out as well as the internal state-- everything is 64 bits in GSM."
"Of course, adding a large internal state doesn't come at a great cost."
It takes a few more flipflops and hyper-implementation or slightly larger words in the software implementation.
"This didn't prevent the attack that you described, but the attack you showed us would actually be better than this."
To do the n lookups would have taken hours.
You were able to show it working in a manner of seconds or minutes.
"To explain why JSM is more vulnerable, we have to go a little bit into this discussion we started earlier on the hundred little functions instead of one big function-- what makes this a stream cipher."
Backgrounds tend to be less important once we've actually picked out the objects.
"But if we're designing the experience, it's important for us to help people do that, pick out the groups in the foreground."
One of the ways we do that is by looking at the spaces in between things.
"Our subconscious brains are constantly parsing our field of view, looking at the spaces between things, and when have the same amount of space between them, we very easily and very quickly just rest."
We check that off.
"Those things are grouped together, those things make sense."
"In the case where every element on the screen has slightly different spacing, again, our subconscious brains are wasting cycles."
"In our massively parallel processing brain, there's billions of threads that are just in infinite loops trying to figure out what's going on, and in the best case, maybe we'll still be able to parse it."
"In the worst case, we'll just discount it as noise and we won't understand the intended structure."
So design the spaces.
"Likewise, using bigger spaces is a great way to break things up."
We could talk about white space.
So this is especially true in typography.
This is kind of a typographer's curse.
"Once you see kerning, you kind of can't unsee it and you'll constantly be looking at, every time you see a v and an a, you're like, did they kern that?"
"The idea is, just the squares of the letters are drawn and don't naturally fit together, so you have to sometimes push them together."
"In the case of type designers, spend many hours looking at all of the possible combinations and straightening them out."
"So the very last gestalt principle says something like, people can also order things based on past experience, which is a very short way of kind of discounting the whole rest of design."
It turns out that this is really one of the biggest and hardest parts.
All of style and culture and all of these things fit in as the very last principle.
"If you look at this right here, you can see some of these spacing and grouping principles, and help me to understand, maybe make this number easier to parse."
"But if you've ever called somebody in the US or looked up something in an address book, you know immediately that this is a format for a phone number."
"It's not because of the spacing, it's because of these kind of learned ideas."
"We have a lot of these, and they're hard to deal with because they're kind of vague."
"The associations aren't super crisp always, and here's an example of that."
Let's consider for a moment a grocer that wants to communicate to everybody that her produce is extremely fresh.
"And wanting to put her best foot forward, she commissions a sign, and she hires an expensive designer, and they may make it out of chrome and neon, and she thinks, good, now people will always know that the produce here is fresh."
"Now contrast that with the grocer across the street who doesn't really think about it too much, but all of her produce that comes fresh from the farm, just like the one across the street, comes in these cardboard boxes."
"She cuts out pieces of the boxes and just scrawls ""Fresh peaches"" on it."
"Now, which of these two design systems conveys, fresh peaches?"
This is a good example of the idea that better isn't always better.
"When you're communicating something, these vague associations that people have been can be a very strong cue."
"like my kitchen waste: more or less, like 70% is organic, so I have a compost box, I just put this 70% of organic [waste] into the compost, because this will go back again to nature, you know, back again to my vegetable plot, and then the rest, 30%, most of this 30% not organic garbage is recyclable, and has an economic value, too, because in Bali we have 'pemulung'."
Pemulung are like the garbage collectors.
"Sometimes they buy it from you, from every house."
"They will travel around [saying], ""berang bekas, berang bekas,"" meaning like ""garbage, garbage,"" and then they will buy it."
"They have a really good value for plastic, for bottles, like beer bottles, for paper, for aluminium, metal, steel, copper, they have a really really good price to buy it from the people, and most of this 30% not organic garbage from my kitchen is recyclable, so you can sell it, or just give it, to this garbage collector, and this 25% will be going to recycle, to be something good, new goods, and so only 5% is your actual garbage, what we call really garbage."
This is
"like the soft plastic material, like biscuits,"
"'kemasan' biscuit packaging, or plastic bags."
"So, from my opinion, if there's only 5% garbage going to the dumping place because we cannot do anything with it"
"I think the dumping place would not be so full so quickly. / So I think the most practical way now that we in Bali don't have a waste management facility yet, a proper one, is to do waste prevention: each household can do that, like bringing your own bag, bringing your own container, bringing your own bottle, so you don't add more waste."
I know it looks just small.
"""But it's only one plastic bag!"" But well, I worked with a group of students once, and we asked them to observe how many plastic bags entered the household each [day], and one student came and said, ""5 plastic bags""."
"Ok, let's calculate."
"In a month, that will be 150."
"And how many people, how many families, more or less in your banjar (village)?"
"She said, ""55""."
"That means, in a year, there will be more than like 10,000 plastic bags."
That's a lot.
"This happened to me, because when we're talking about plastic, for example, the big problem in Bali, I tried to live a one month ""plastic diet""."
"We call it ""plastic diet""."
"Just to get the data about how difficult it would be to live without, to minimize as much as possible using plastic."
It can be done.
"We go shopping, we just bring our own bags, our own carrier, so it's not so difficult."
"For most of our customers, we provide them with a monthly recycling report."
"So, they get a sheet of paper that says, ok these are the things that you were able to recycle: this much aluminum, this much plastic bottles, this much of this other plastic, paper, blah, blah, blah."
And then we go down the list of other things that were man made but weren't recyclable.
"You know, styrofoam, or some hazardous stuff."
"And then we go down into the organics and explain to them the food waste we collected and all that, so they have a record of what actually they are producing."
"And at first, you know, they're like, ""oh, that's cute, that's nice, whatever,"" but after a while, when they look back and they see, over 6 months or a year, they realize actually how much waste they produce."
"And in some cases, it's quite shocking."
"So it's kind of a wake-up call, and it makes them realize that yes, they are polluters; they have to think about their impacts."
I think tourists have an enormous responsibility for the impacts that they create on any country that they visit.
"But what's important about this is when you're dealing with interface design, you're not necessarily designing reality as much as you're designing the simulation."
"You're designing how people are going to think about your application, and how they're going to interpret it, and if they're going to understand things."
"So looking at this just in terms of a quick diagram, you have the implementation, which of course you're incredibly familiar with, then you have the interface, which is how that implementation manifests itself."
"What's really important is the mental model, the simulation of the interface inside the user's head."
This is something Alan Cooper writes a lot about in his early work.
"And of course, you have this fourth component, which is the manual."
"And often, the manual likes to take the blame in email lists or talking engineers, it's not uncommon to run into, read the fracking manual as kind of the explanation of why this doesn't work."
"And just passing the blame forward if you don't want to blame the manual, you can always blame the users, which maybe they're stupid, maybe they didn't get it, that's why it failed."
And I would argue that it's really not about the intelligence of the user.
"So to quickly make that argument, let's say we take four geniuses, we'll just select Einstein, Turing, Eric"
"Schmidt, and you."
"And we're going to run a lot of experiments, so we're going to need clones."
"So we start cloning all these guys and we put them in our deep underground lair, and now, clones are really expensive."
"So we're going to have to keep them safe, so we're going to put them in a room like this."
"And the rooms are to protect them, because clones are expensive, but it's also to protect them from any external information."
"We want to have total control over this experiment, right?"
"So every day, we bring them into a testing chamber, looks like this."
"We start to teach them, we start to teach them about the world."
"We go over various things like traffic lights, common things people are going to encounter, turtles, you get the general idea."
"And then once we've got that baseline knowledge of what we expect them to have encountered in the world, we're not going over any theoretical physics or anything, just baseline knowledge, then we start running our experiments, and here's where it gets fun."
"So we show them a screenshot and we say, looking at this thing you've never seen before, what does that button do, and can they get it?"
"Can they get it right, even though they don't have access to anything other than what they're seeing right here?"
"And they're starting to think, well, the curvature is very similar to the arc of the thing that's next to it, it's visually lighter so it feels like it's sort of not there"
like the other thing is there.
"There's only one of these, and it's just the side."
"So they might not know for sure, but they might start to guess, I bet it creates another one."
"Just the way that it's shaped, the way that it's placed, conveys those types of things."
"Or another example, this one harder."
"You say, OK, what does HTTPS stand for?"
"And there's no way they're going to get this right because we didn't tell them, right?"
It's jargon.
It's an acronym they're not going to get.
The wage over the marginal product of labor.
So marginal cost is the wage over the marginal product of labor.
"Marginal product of labor was delta q delta I, so wage over the marginal product of labor is the marginal cost."
So think about this intuitively.
"What we're saying is the cost of the next unit of production is declining with the marginal product of labor, it sort of makes sense."
"The more productive is a worker, the less expensive is producing the next unit."
"The less productive is the next worker, the more expensive is producing the next unit."
So it's an inverse relationship between the marginal cost and the marginal product where the wage is the constant that scales that relationship.
"So basically, when workers are very, very high marginal product, then it's going to be cheap to produce the next unit."
"When workers have a low marginal product, it's going to be expensive to produce the next unit, and that's going to depend on what you actually have to pay the worker."
Questions about that?
"So basically, the first key thing we want to derive here is that the marginal cost is directly related to the marginal product of labor, and the marginal product of labor we saw last time comes out of production function."
"So if you're given a wage, and given a production function, you should be able to derive the short-run marginal cost."
You might someday be asked to do that.
Now what about the long-run?
"The short-run's no fun, what about the long-run?"
"In the long-run, firms can choose their mix of labor and capital."
"Remember, in the short-run the capital is fixed, so fixed costs rk bar."
The only thing they could change was the amount of
"labor, so we could derive their marginal costs."
What about in the long-run?
"Well, the long-run's a little more interesting because in the long-run firms get to choose their input mix to maximize their production efficiency."
So input mix is chosen to maximize production efficiency which equates to minimizing costs.
Maximizing production efficiency equates to minimizing costs.
"So we talked last time about isoquants, and the notion that isoquants were combinations of labor and capital that delivered the same output."
"Just like indifference curves are combinations of pizza and movies that deliver the same utility, isoquants are a combination of labor and capital that deliver the same output."
"The key point is that, technologically, any choice of"
"labor and capital produces the same q, so there's nothing that tells you technologically which of those to use."
"We just know, technologically, there's a set of choices which deliver the same q."
"Well, how do we tell which to use?"
"Well, we want to choose the one which is minimizing costs."
"So to do that, we're going to have to bring in the cost of those inputs."
"You can have this with water waves, so it's on a two-dimensional surface."
"You can also have it with sound, which would be three-dimensional."
So the waves go out on a sphere.
"And you can have it with electromagnetic radiation as we will also see today, which is of course also three dimensions."
If particles oscillate then their energy is proportional to the square of their amplitudes.
"So therefore since energy must be conserved, the amplitude of sound oscillations and also of the electric vector in the case of electromagnetic radiation, the amplitude must fall off as one over the distance, 1 / R. Because you're talking about 3-D waves."
You're talking about spherical waves.
And the surface area of a sphere grows with R squared.
"And so the amplitude must fall off as 1 / R. Now if we look at the superposition of two waves, in this case at point P and we make the distance large, so that R1 and R2 are much, much larger than the separation between these two points, then this fact that the amplitude of the wave from two is slightly smaller than the amplitude from the wave from one can then be pretty much ignored."
Imagine that the path from here to here is one-half of a wavelength longer than the path from here to here.
That means that this wave from here to here will have traveled half a period of an oscillation longer than this one.
And that means they are exactly 180 degrees out of phase and so the two can kill each other.
And we call that destructive interference.
And so we're going to have destructive interference when R2
"- R1 is for instance plus or minus one-half lambda, but it could also be plus or minus 3/2 lambda, 5/2 lambda, and so on."
And so in general you would have destructive interference if the difference between R2 and R1 is 2N + 1 times
"lambda divided by 2 whereby N is an integer, could be 0, or plus or minus 1, or plus or minus 2, and so on."
That's when you would have destructive interference.
We would have constructive interference if R2 - R1 is simply N times lambda.
"So then the waves at point P are in phase and N is again, could be 0, plus or minus 1, plus or minus 2, and so on."
If the sum of the distance to two points is a constant you get an ellipse in mathematics.
"If the difference is a constant, which is the case here, the difference to two points is a constant value, for instance one-half lambda, then the curve is a hyperbola."
It would be a hyperbola if we deal with a two-dimensional surface.
"But if we think of this as three-dimensional, so you can rotate the whole thing about this axis, then you get hyperboloids, you get bowl-shaped surfaces."
"And so if I'm now trying to tighten the nuts a little bit, suppose I have here two of these sources that produce waves and the separation between them is D, then it is obvious that the line right through the middle of them and perpendicular to them is always a maximum if the two sources are oscillating in phase."
So this line is immediately clear that R2 - R1 is 0 here.
If the two are in phase.
"And they always have to generate the same frequency, of course."
So this line would be always a maximum.
Constructive interference.
"It's this 0, substitute there."
"And in case that we're talking about three-dimensional, this is of course a plane."
We actually looked at three different cooling regimes:
"(-45°C.), (-60°C.) and (-75°C.) and so under those conditions we were exploring whether or not there would be an impact on our ability to enhance or affect the white of the egg."
The egg white contains proteins and water.
"What we've documented here is those eggs, the quality of those eggs would stay longer than 12 weeks."
"So we've actually identified in this work that if we cooled the eggs with the CO2 process the quality of those eggs was equal to what they were under the initial so as if the chicken had just laid the eggs, that quality was maintained for 12 weeks."
An increase in shelf life wasn't the only result of Keener's research.
"The other part of the study that we looked at was the vitelline membrane, which is the egg yolk membrane."
"You would be familiar with that, when you break an egg out in the skillet it's what contains the yolk."
And so we've documented in this study that the CO2 process that we've been exploring actually will maintain the structure of that membrane longer.
And the potential benefit is that it would be a barrier for bacterial penetration.
So in essence the egg safety could be maintained even longer.
"So to sumarize the results of the study we documented: that the vitella membrane, which is related to the food safety can be enhanced or maintained longer and then the quality of the eggs, the shelf life, based on the quality can be extened from 6 weeks to 12 weeks."
The answer is that you're on the moon.
"Now there are many ways you can solve this question, but the one that I think is the most fun and probably the most useful is figuring out how range, the distance you can throw an object, scales with the acceleration on the planet."
What do I mean by that?
I mean figuring out its proportionality.
Is the range proportional to the acceleration in the planet?
Is it proportional to the square?
Is it proportional to something else?
Let's see if we can find that out.
"So this has become a question of, ""How does range scale with acceleration?"""
The reason why we're looking at proportionality sorts of our units is because these two numbers the range on earth and the range on this unknown planet how far we can throw these rocks.
So we also know the ratio and ratios are used whenever we have this proportionality sorts of our units.
What we already shown from the previous problem that the optimal range occurs at 45°
So if we can set at an initial velocity of this zero--these are the horizontal and vertical components.
"Well, when we're calculating range the first thing we want to know is how much time does the object spent in the air."
And we think of measuring to the top of the trajectory and then multiplying by two.
Have we find the time it takes to get to the top?
"What we used is equation, we plugged in our known values and solve for t."
"And I noticed I have been using numbers, I have been keeping everything in terms of variables except for this 45°."
This could be an intimidating tactic to use when you're first solving physics problems.
"Often you tend to want to plug everything in, but actually you could often get more interesting results if you leave the variables in place and don't plug until the very, very end."
Our second example was a case where we have an arbitrarily deep company hierarchy and we want to compute the total salary cost of a project starting at that project's manager and summing the salary of the entire sub-tree. and our third example was about airplane flights.
"Where we want to find the cheapest way to fly from point A to point B. And we're willing to change planes as many kinds, as we might need to in order to bring down the cost."
"We saw that all of these examples, involved, basically a notion of transit of closure computed as a recursively defined relation."
"The last portion of our demo, after we see these three queries solved using recursion, will introduce one more twist, which is what happens when we introduce cycles."
So in the Airline example.
We'll set up a case where you can fly from one city to another one and back.
"Which is of course true in reality, and we'll see what happens when we try to answer our query in that setting."
I've started by creating a table called Parent of.
With parent child relationships.
"So we have, Alice Carol, Bob Carol, Carol Dave, and so on."
You might actually want to write this down on a piece of paper to see what the actual tree
"looks like, but the query we want to run is to find all of Mary's ancestors so we're going to, of course, have Eve as a parent, and Dave as a parent."
"And then Dave's parent is Carol, and Carol's parent is Bob, and so on."
We'll get most of the data in our database in our query.
"So here is the query, our first example of our recursive query."
"Let me say right off, that even more than anything else, we've done in these videos, I am going to encourage you to download the script and take a close"
"look at the query, and preferable actually run the queries and play with them on the postscript system."
And we are using for this demo postscript a sequel
lite and my sequel do not support forth the Withery cursive statement at this point in time.
"So, anyway here's our query and it is the form that we described in the introduction, it's a width-statement with recursive that's going to set up a recursive relation called ancestor, so this is what we were calling ""r"" earlier."
This is our ancestor with a schema AD for ancestor and descendant.
"Our final query, once ancestor is all set up, is very simple, it just says, take the 'A' attribute from ancestor, where a descendant is Mary so that will give us Mary's defendant."
"Of course what's interesting is what's right here,inside these parans because this our recursive query."
"And it does take the form we described of having a base query, that is the first"
"line, and then the recursive query with a union between them."
So we're going to start by saying that whenever we have a parent child relationship that's also an ancestor relationship.
So we're going to take from our parent of table.
"The parent and child, and we have to rename them as"
"A and D, and that says that parent children are an ancestor."
What else in an ancestor?
"Well if we have a tuple an ancestor, an ancestor and a descendant, and that descendant is the parent of a another person, then the A and the ancestor, together with the child from the parent of, is also an ancestor relationship."
So this is a kind of doing the join.
So this is the kind of thing you'll get from failing to protect your [inaudible] from being revisited.
And so I'll be - if I haven't deft this funny little symbol I just made up then I want to find it in the end deft.
"So if it came back around and it saw this same header file, it was supposed to say I already seen that symbol and I won't do it."
"But, in fact, I had accidentally named one of them with a capital H and one with a lowercase H. It says if this symbol's not been identified then define this other symbol and keep going."
"And so the next time it saw the header files it said if that this lowercase H hasn't been defined, well it hadn't so it made it again and then it kept doing that until it got really totally twisted up about it."
"So I will make them match, with any"
"luck, without the caps lock on."
Three times is a charm.
"And then one, two, three pop out the other side of queue, as I was hoping."
Okay.
"So you know what I'm going to do, actually?"
I'm actually not going to go through the alternate implementation of queue.
I'm just saying
"like given that it works so well for stack, right, to have this kind of single link list, you know, efficient allocation, it's not surprising that queue,"
"like, given to us."
"And what this is, like I said earlier, I said, well, you know you can do things with vector, you can do things with stack, anything you do with stack you can do with vector if you were just being careful."
Right.
"The pushing, and popping, and the queue D queue, are operations that you could express in other terms of vector adds and removes and inserts that things."
"But one of the nice things about providing a structure like a stack or queue is it says these are the only things you're allowed to add at this end, remove from that end, it gives you options as a implementer that don't make sense for the general purpose case."
That the vector as a link list had some compromises that probably weren't worth making.
"But in the case of stack and queue it actually came out very cleanly and very nicely, like this tidy little access to one end, or the other end, or both, right, was easily managed with a link list and then it didn't have any of the constraints of the continuous memory to fight with."
And so often having a structure that actually offers less gives you some different options as an implementer because you know you don't have to support access into the middle in an efficient way because the stack and queue don't let you.
"They don't let you riffle through the middle of the stack or the queue to do things and that gives you some freedom as an implementer, which is neat to take advantage of."
"Yes, sir."
"[Inaudible] in Java that, you know, we supposed to use an Array whenever we could because Array uses more memory ?"
Um hm.
"Does the queue and stack use more memory than an Array, for example?"
"So typically they'll be about the same, because of exactly this one thing, which is it allocates tightly so it asks for one cell per entry that's in there, right."
And that cell has this overhead in the form of this extra pointer.
Right.
So in effect it means that everything got a little bit bigger because everything's carrying a little overhead.
Okay.
"look at the result and to find the result after one millisecond for part A, and after ten milliseconds for part B. So now, let me make a comment about this part."
"When you solve the equation, solve dN0 / dt, for N0 as a function of t, it should be, it should be that N0 after ten milliseconds."
"Is getting close, it's approaching alpha over alpha plus beta."
"Now, I say that because I've done this problem before."
Why don't you do it and see if that's the case.
"See if, if N0 after ten milliseconds is pretty close to alpha over alpha plus beta."
"In fact, is it close enough that alpha over alpha plus beta can be used as a good estimate of the answer?"
Or is it still some distance away?
"Please check that out, and get those details straight."
"So, thank you for watching this problem segment."
And we'll go on soon to the week in review.
Male Voice:
"In the last video we saw how there could be an industry that has two firms, a duopoly, and if those two firms coordinate they could behave as a monopolist and they could optimize their collective economic profit."
"In the last video we saw that would happen when they produced 50 units per period, and they could split it, assuming these were two identical firms, by each producing half of it."
"In the case of the last video, it was 250 units per firm."
"Then we saw that there was an incentive to cheat; that by producing extra units, from a market's point of view, the marginal economic, or the economic profit on those incremental units would be negative, so the whole economic profit would shrink a little bit as you produced units beyond that, but the cheater would get a bigger chunk of those units, or the bigger chunk of that economic profit."
"The cheater could actually gain, go from $250 per time period to $280, and it would be all at the expense of the non-cheater, and then some, who would lose even more than what the cheater gained."
"Obviously who was initially the non-cheater has an incentive now to cheat, and they'll both keep increasing, they'll both keep increasing production so that if they wanted to keep doing this one-upmanship."
They both have the incentive to keep going assuming that they don't hold to their cartel agreement until you get to a quantity where there's no economic profit left.
"Right over here, the way"
"I've drawn it, the demand curve intersects the average total cost curve right over here, and there's no economic profit left."
We're producing a good quantity.
It looks like it's about 75 units combined; 75 units for the whole market.
"But at this point, the market price is equal to the average total cost, and so there's no economic profit per unit on average."
What I want to do is think about this in kind of a Game theoretic way.
Let's look at a bunch of states.
This is the optimal state that we are starting off in.
"You can actually call it the Pareto optimal state, named after Vilfredo Pareto."
All it means is that's the state where there's no other state where you can make someone better off without making the other person worse off.
"Any of the states here, there are states, for example, where blue is better off."
"For example, in this state right over here blue is better off, but green is worse off."
So that's why it's called Pareto optimality.
"So, you would call head or tails, I would flip the coin, you have a 50% chance of winning, and you may win $ten."
"If you do this multiple times, long term you would have an expected return of $five and that you should be right half the time."
The second game may have a one percent chance of winning $250.
"So, with that, if we had a hundred numbers on a hat."
"If you guess the number, I pulled out that number and if they matched one to 100, then you would win $250."
"So you have a one percent chance of winning 250, and over time your expected average return is $2.50."
"And if we do that math, we see that the safe bet is 50% of winning $ten."
"And that we can see when you multiply the probability of that occurring, if you were purely rational and purely logical in your decision making, you would always choose the flip a coin option."
But many of us may be tempted to go for the $250.
That the difference of what we could do with $ten versus 250 is significant.
"And many people may have the preference of taking that one percent chance of winning 250, recognizing that the odds are against them."
"That's what we mean by entrepreneurial decision making and that it's not rational per se, and that there is a level of risk involved."
But that a number of us would take that risk and that we would shoot for the higher goal understanding that probability of achieving that is less.
"And so, with that entrepreneurs are not necessarily risk seeking, nor are they necessarily any riskier than others individuals."
"But, they may just simply accept risk or perceive risk differently, and in that way they may see things differently then others."
And it's that risk propensity that certainly plays a role in that.
"If you are an individual, for example, that may have been laid off from a job multiple times, such as a friend of mine."
"Her decision to start a company was perceived as being safer than going to work for a company to which she may be laid off again, which had happened multiple times before."
"So in that way, she saw the opportunity of starting a venture as being safer, in her perception, than going to work for someone else."
"And again, that perception is hers and hers alone and isn't necessarily right or wrong for others."
It's based on how you perceive risk given certain scenarios and certain individual tendencies.
"And so, within that, when you go back and you take a look at this gain, it's n ot necessarily a question of, should you be risky or should you not be risky?"
It's more of a question of what you perceive as the incentive.
What you perceive as the risk.
"And then, what decision would you make between the 50% gain or the one percent gain."
"And a simpler example of that again, would be if you were given the opportunity to play me in a round of golf."
"And the winner would receive an A. the loser would receive an F. So, in that way, there are significant stakes of receiving a high grade or receiving a low grade."
And there are a couple of considerations that you should ask.
"One is, do you play golf?"
"If you do play golf, and if you're good, and if you believe that you can beat me, it might be a low-risk proposition to engage in such a game."
"If however, you do not play golf and/or you do not believe that you could beat me, then you probably should not enter that game."
"So again, risk is more about the scenario, your background, your experience, your tendency."
"So, the set of minimal coalitions that are able to pass the"
"legislation are A B, A C, A D, and B C D. All of these subsets of the agents have enough votes to pass the legislation."
"Now we can Just looking at these sets reason that there isn't any way of dividing the payments that would be stable, for all sub coalitions."
"In particular we can see that if the sum of the payoffs to the parties in b c and d ends up being less than a hundred, then this set of agents has reason to deviate and form this coalition, where they can then Divide the full hundred million amongst themselves."
"However, if B, C and D get the entire payoff of a hundred million, then A can form a coalition with any one of B, C or"
"D, which would be sufficient And it could do this with which ever of the of B, C, and D is getting paid the least under whatever payment profile we're assuming is adequate for B, C, D. And best that we can see is there is always some sub-coalition that can profitaly deviate from any."
"Payment profile that, that we propose, and that means that the core is empty for this game."
"The second thing we might wonder is, in cases where the core is not empty, is it unique?"
"And again, here the news is bad."
"Because, no, the core is not always unique."
"So now let's consider changing teh voting game, so that we require an 80 % majority, instead of a 51% majority."
"It's now the case that the winning coalitions are these 2 coalitions, these are the only coalitions that are able to obtain 80% majority, the, the only minimal coalitions"
And it's now the case that a and b are a required in all winning coalitions.
"And this means that any complete distribution of the $100 million between just a and b is going to belong to the core because there's no way that c and d, even if they're not paid anything can go off and form some As different coalition that would pay them more."
"And so, the grand coalition is stable as long as a and b get paid everything."
Now let me give you a few more definitions so I can say some more positive things about the core.
First let me define a simple game.
"I'll say that a game is simple if it's the case that, for all coalitions, the value of the, the coalition is either zero or 1."
And notice that our voting game is a simple game.
And the reason is that we either produce 100 million dollars.
"Or 0, depending on whether we get a majority or not."
"And so, we can scale those payoffs where 1 is 100 million dollars and 0 is 0 and we can then encode this as a simple game."
My 2nd definition is of a veto player and I'll say that a player i has a veto if The value of all coalitions that don't involve i is 0.
So in other words the participation of i in a coalition is necessary if the coalition is going to produce any value at all.
Putting these 2 things together it's possible to show that.
"In a simple game, the core is empty exactly when there is no veto player."
And that's precisely what we saw in our voting game example already.
We had no veto player. in the case where we needed a 51 percent majority.
Because there was a coalition that didn't involve a.
"On the other hand, the core was empty, in that case. on the other hand, if there are veto players, the core consists of all of those payoff vectors where the nonveto players get zero and the payoff is divided among the veto players."
"And, again, we saw that in our voting game example here where we had the 80 percent majority required."
Where a and b were both veto players.
I mean the idea that a plastic bottle consumes a typical 600ml plastic bottle needs a quarter of it in oil to produce that bottle is just mind-boggling.
When you're looking at that plastic bottle you're not buying water; you're buying crude oil.
"And then, in Bali, people don't realize how many bottles there are."
"Just water bottles, there are over 3 million bottle a day, and that doesn't include all the other kinds of beverages, from your soda to your energy drinks and things like that."
"And even if you were able to recycle 90% of those, you would still have 300,000 of them being thrown in the environment every day."
It's not acceptable.
It's nonsense.
"In Bali we produce 20,000 cubic metres of waste everyday."
"And if we say that 15% of that is plastic, then that means we're producing 3,000 cubic metres of plastic waste everyday."
"I think that it's an incredibly valuable resource; it's mined, oil is drilled from the ground and it creates this product which is incredibly useful, so it should be rightly respected as a resource, and used and used and reused and reused again and again and again."
"Our argument as a campaign is not with plastic; it's about our consumption, and our habits around this disposable culture that we've created. / I mean people come to Bali and they've looked at the brochure; they've heard about it or read about it, and seen stuff, and they have this image of what Bali is, and there have been a few times where they've been quite shocked at what happens, what actually is the situation."
"There was a story, where I was asked to help with this hotel, they had had a problem with garbage that right in front of their hotel entrance, literally, there was a huge garbage dump, and it would burn almost every day, and the smoke would go right through the hotel's lobby, and through their restaurant and through to the beach, and it wasn't good for business, as you might suspect."
"So they had tried every, they had called every government office, I think even calling up to the Governor to help deal with this problem, and nothing every happened."
"And so out of desperation they asked for help, and"
"I went down there and did a quick little survey, you know, I was working for an NGO back then and they were willing to pay us to do it, and at the time we thought quite a bit."
If we knew how much money they were losing we would have asked for more.
"But we did a survey of what was going on and what we discovered was that most of the garbage burning in front of the hotel was their own, that they had created their own problem."
And why that happened was they were selling their garbage to the local trash guy and he was just taking what he wanted out of it and dumping everything in the traditional dump.
"In fact, the dump had been there before the hotel."
"So no one in the hotel had bothered to go across the street and look, and they would have seen their logo."
They would have seen it.
"And their reaction at first was, ""well, let's fire this guy and get rid of him,"" and I said, no, that's not going to work."
If you replace him it's going to be the same thing.
"The problem is not this guy dumping here, the problem is you're asking him to pay for this garbage."
"You should be paying him to take care of it properly, to dump it at the landfill; a novel idea!"
I mean they really were kind of accustomed to selling their garbage.
It's completely crazy!
"And they realized that they needed to change, and it was easy to make the decision, because they were losing tens of thousands of dollars a day."
"I mean, they were losing a lot of money."
So to switch over and pay a local guy a few hundred dollars a month to take care of it made a
"lot of sense. / So every year, Bali has I think it's 4 million domestic tourists and 3 million international tourists."
"Now on top of that, we have a population that's just about reached 4 million."
"So, this goes to show that while the Shapley values may be fair, they don't necessarily give the right incentives to all of the different parties to want to actually join the grand coalition and so, instead, we should look for different ways that the parties could divide the payments so that they would be willing to form the grand coalition So that's the question that we're going to think about in this video."
Under what payment divisions would the agents be willing to form the grand coalition?
And the answer as we'll see is that they would be willing to do so if the payment the profile belongs to a set which we'll call the core.
Here's how we define the core.
"So, we're going to think about a given payment vector, that's going to be an assignment of a certain amount of value to each of the different members of the coalition."
"And we're going to say that the core, that this payment vector is in the core of a coalitional game."
If and only if the following condition is true.
For every coalition that could form and which is a subset or equal to the grand coalition.
"So every subset of the grand coalition, it's the case that for all agents in that subset. if we sum across all of the agents in that subset, excuse me."
The amount of payoff that the payoff vector says that we give to each of those agents I in the subset.
"That sum is at least as much as the value that the agents would have gotten as a coalition if they had deviated, and instead, formed that subset S. So, kind of intuitively, what we're guaranteing here is that the sum of the payoffs to all of the agents in any subcoalition, is at least as much as they could earn if they actually did go off and form that subcoalition."
And you can see in the voting game that's what we saw Wasn't ach ieved.
"That the amount that we were paying a and b under the shoply value payments wasn't as much as they could have gone off and gone, gotten on their own."
So if there doesn't exist any sub coalition where the agent's could have gotten more on their own then our pay affecter is in the court.
And intuitively this is like Nash equilibrium.
Because what we're saying is the agents don't have any profitable deviations.
"It isn't the case that any subcoalition could deviate away from the grand coalition, and end up with higher payment for themselves."
The way it's different from Nash equilibrium is we're thinking about groups of agents jointly deviating.
So.
"In, in a sense it's a stronger notion than a Nash Equilibrium."
We don't think only about unilateral deviations here.
"So, any time a solution concept is introduced to you, there are two questions that you should wonder about."
The first is whether the solution concept always returns something.
Analogously remember Pure strategy Nash equilibrium doesn't always exist.
Mixed strategy equilibrium does always exist.
"So we might wonder, if the core always nonempty?"
Does it always suggest at least one payment profile to us?
"Secondly, we might wonder, is the core always unique?"
"When it does return something to us does it always return one thing, does it make a sharp recommendation, or might it return multiple things?"
"Well first of all, is the core always nonempty? the answer here unfortunately is no."
"So there are some games in which, there aren't any stable payments, that can be allocated to the agents."
And we can see this already in the voting game.
And you also just kind of need to be aware: patients are feeling the need to self-medicate with an herbal product.
"Whether they're on an antidepressant - maybe it's not working as well - or they're feeling that they need to treat with an herbal product, maybe they need to seek some formal treatment."
"There have been studies done from the National Institute of Mental Health on St. John's Wort, and it has been shown to be effective in either mild, to maybe moderate cases of depression."
"And the drug interactions: a couple to highlight, one to highlight is birth control pills"
"We define the equation of the plane containing the straight line that goes the equation, right over here and this plane has to be perpendicular to the plane containing the straight lines x/3 = y/4 = z/2 and also it has the line x/4 = y/2 = z/3."
"Now just to visualize this properly, let me draw the planes."
"So the first plane in question that we defined the equation of, let me draw it, let me draw it like this."
I am going to try and do this problem using vector notations because it is easier in my mind to manipulate vectors in a way that you can find perpendicular vectors and equations of planes...There's other ways that you can do this problem.
SO we define the equation of this plane right here.
"Now we know this plane contains this line and this line, if we look over here, contains this point (0,0,0)"
"If x, y and z all equal to 0 then all sides of this equation are zero."
"So it contains the point (0,0,0) or you can view it as if it contains the position vector (0,0,0) and it also contains the point (2,3,4) because if x=2, y=3 and z=4 then all of these are going to be equal to 1."
"So it also contains the point where the position vector, we can say, (2,3,4)"
"So if we wanted to draw this line, 2 points specify the line so this line would look"
like that.
"But if wanted to look at a vector that this plane contains, it would be the vector that goes from (0,0,0,) to (2,3,4) which really is the position vector (2,3,4) and I am gonna write it in the (i,j,k) notation just to make it clear that this is a vector."
"So this vector that lies in the plane in question is the vector 2i +3j + 4k, i just wrote it in the unit vector notation and will call this the vector a."
Vector a is equal to that and I will write a over here.
"Now we need to figure out the equation of this line and the best way to do it, is if I can find another vector in this plane then I can find a normal vector in this plane and then using a normal vector and some arbitrary other vector in this plane, I can then figure out the equation of this line because the normal vector dotted that arbitrary other vector has to be equal to zero."
"Now if none of that makes sense, maybe as we go through this problem, it will make more sense."
Now what I am gonna do is use these other vectors that are implicitly defined by these lines to figure out another vector in this plane over here.
So let me draw what I am talking about.
So let me draw this other plane and I will draw it in white.
"And this other plane also contains (0,0,0)."
"Actually both of these lines contain (0,0,0)."
So let me draw it over here.
"I think what I just said, if I do step by step it will make a lot more sense."
"So the other plane, that one comes vertically over this plane and it goes vertically below as well."
"And we see here that the plane that contains these two lines is perpendicular to this, they are perpendicular to each other."
"Now this blue line over here contains the point (0,0,0) and the point (3,4,2), same logic that we took to get to this point over here."
"If this is (3,4,2) they all equal 1, the equality holds."
"So let me just draw some arbitrary place, so (3,4,2)."
So the scales in this diagram are misleading.
"If you really want to lay scales on it, you need to use the invariant interval or, the appropriate hyperbolas to draw these distances."
This is one of the reasons why doing calculations from these graphs can be confusing the thing that is always meaningful in these graphs is the order of things.
"In other words, what is true is that the entire region above the'x' axis is positive't' and that an event that is. further up than another is later as viewed by this observer and similarly the entire region above in this sense, the x prime axis is at +t prime and the region below it in this direction is at -t prime and the order of the events can be read off from this grid, you draw the grid and if you have some random event over here the infamous birthday party that we spoke of, over here."
Then to read off its X and T we drop.
Parallel to the x and t axis and we see that this happened at x a little larger than two and t getting close to four.
"If you want to plot this in x prime, t prime co-ordinates we."
Draw lines parallel to the axis because remember this line is a line of constant T prime.
"It's parallel to the X prime axis, and this is a line of constant X prime."
And we see that this happened at X prime a little less then one and T prime somewhere between two and three is when this birthday party happened.
"So this is how we read coordinates off of these space time diagrams, I hope that was helpful."
And now
I am going to erase all these grids which are just confusing.
And note that I have marked here our favorite two events.
"Event number one is the instant t equal to zero when the left end of the ladder enters the garage and notice that as anticipated because I made this point which we know is L root one - v^2 over c^2 less than G then there, the entire ladder at this point is enclosed in the garage and this goes on until the time of this event labelled two, event number two is the instant where the right end of the ladder starts protruding from the garage and so as I suggested there, there is this whole region here from t1 to t2 where the entire ladder's inside the garage, okay?"
"So, now we can ask what happens if I close the door."
"Well if I close the right door and oh, sorry and I forgot to note on the other hand we can see directly from this diagram that at event number two."
While in the garage frame event number two happened after event number one and indeed for this whole time the ladder was inside the garage.
"In the ladder frame, event number two occurs before event number one, remember these are all the events that are simultaneous with the ladder entering the garage."
Event number two corresponds.
To some negative value of t prime down here and indeed it preceded as seen by the ladder event number one there as seen by the ladder the right end poked out of the garage before the left end got in and the ladder was never in the garage.
"So now you can ask, alright well, what happens if I close the door?"
"Well if I close the door, then let me decide that the front door of the gara, the, the, the, the door of the garage at g is going to be closed."
"What that means is that the right end of the ladder travels, at event number two it hits the garage door and from that moment on the left end, the right end of the ladder is at rest and moves along this green trajectory."
Now.
"The way we're used to thinking about it, is a ladder is a ladder."
If at this point in time.
"The ladder stopped, then the entire ladder stopped and if voila, we have the entire ladder contained in the garage as seen by the garage frame."
"But, this is confusing because in the ladder frame, remember, at when this event happened, in the ladder frame, the left end of the garage wasn't in the garage yet."
The left end of the ladder wasn't in the garage yet.
So what is this saying?
"Well, the answer to this is that we have made an unwarranted assumption here."
"I mean, it's like the easy one to handle. / If you're talking about garbage problem in Bali, from my perspective, you can debate about it, but actually the original culture of people in Bali here, they're really clean, in their house."
"They wake up in the morning, like 5:00 early, and already clean their house, clean their yard, and before sunset also they're doing the same thing they clean it, and they throw all the garbage into the area in the household it's called ""tegalang"", it means the area that you plant or grow anything, or you grow a pig there or something."
There is a special area to put this garbage.
"But a long long time ago, let's say 25 or 30 years ago, most of this garbage was organic and the Balinese, most of the Balinese, are still doing this culture, only the material of the garbage has changed."
Now it's plastic. / Waste is a man-made concept.
"It didn't really exist, and it especially didn't exist before the 50s and 60s."
"Everything was organic; we didn't have all this man-made material. / Mostly things would have been packaged in banana leaves, so if you look at the offerings, your daily offerings which can be bought at the market, they are now being packaged in plastic bags, single use very thin, high density plastic that is used once and then thrown away because it's so thin you can't really reuse it."
That would have all been packaged in banana leaves.
But I also think that probably what's happened is the change in lifestyle - food also would have been packaged in banana leaves - a change of lifestyle so that now there's a lot more things available on the market.
"In the past, I don't think, offerings for instance as an example, would have been so widely sold as they are nowadays."
"But so many people are working, directly or indirectly, in the tourist industry, so that, you know, increasingly people are having to buy things which in the past they wouldn't have had to buy. / There really wasn't the culture of obsolescence that exists today."
"Traditionally in Indonesia, and also Bali of course, most people don't want to pay for waste disposal."
They never had it.
"What they did with their waste was just throw it in the back, or burn it, or throw it in the river, and those habits spill over into businesses."
"People have a restaurant, or they have their hotel, and they take the same approach."
"They're just like ""get it away, get it away"", and they've never thought about having to pay for this."
"It's always, you can just throw it on the open lot or throw it in the river, and it's taken care of."
"And it's further complicated now in that you have a lot of large hotels that produce a huge amount of waste, and there's actually a lot of valuable stuff in that waste."
"And you have an informal scavenging sector that approach the hotels and businesses and say, ""We will provide waste services for you for free, and we'll buy the waste."""
"And what they're really interested in, they're actually buying the waste, they're buying access to the recyclables."
"So they're taking the stuff of value, but the stuff that has not value, guess where it goes: in the river, on the side of the road, wherever."
"You really get what you pay for and if you're selling you're waste or paying very little, you're going to have a dirty island."
"And for the tourism sector, obviously it's in their interest not to have a dirty island."
"So they have to make that leap and start realizing that if they want to have this thing taken care of, the stuff that doesn't have value, you're going to have to pay for it."
Also another problem that we have in Bali is that plastic waste is often burned. and this can create all sorts of problems.
Respiratory illnesses are the number one reported illness in Bali.
"And if you're breathing in plastic waste that's being burned, particularly at the speed that it's being burned, because it's not a high heat burning, which is less toxic, but it's usually a smoldering slow burning heap, so this can create all sorts of problems for human health and air quality."
I mean think of all these things we have that are really pointless.
"A plastic bag, you use for 15 minutes, and then it's around for your grand kids and their grand kids."
It's just insane.
"And it's not just plastic bags, there are some things you"
"look around, from plastic straws to plastic bottles..."

"The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: নইস্য শেখ) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations."
Etymology.
"There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them ""nosto seikh"" meaning ""spoiled Shaikh"". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term ""nosto seikh"" slowly got islamicised into ""Nashya seikh""."
Origin.
"The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib."

History.
"In 1913, Elwood Brown, president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association and Manila Carnival Games, proposed the creation of the ""Far Eastern Olympic Games"" to China and Japan. It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association."
"The first event was held on the Manila Carnival grounds (later the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex) in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913 and was known as the ""First Oriental Olympic Games"". Forbes was also the one who formally declare the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: the host country then-named Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong."

They were held there again in 1921. The games were held every two years except in 1929 when Japan decided to delay the project to 1930. The FEAA decided to change the time table to four years and the Philippine Islands hosted the tenth games in 1934. Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) joined in the 1934 FECG."
"The 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled."

SR Class 2Wim
"2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class."
SR Class 4DD
"Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."

"While director of Dorpat Observatory (1817–39) he wrote ""Stellarum Duplicum et Multiplicum"" (1837), which proved that double stars are not exceptional and that star systems are governed by the laws of gravity. Struve added a lot to the study of galactic structure and also engaged in notable geodetic operations such as the triangulation of Livonia and the measurement of an arc of the meridian. In 1839 he became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory and was one of the first three astronomers who almost simultaneously obtained an approximate stellar parallax. (One of the others being Bessel)"
"In 1822 he published the first of many double-star catalogues, the identifying numbers of which are still used today.

"In 1937, Hartnagel met Sophie Scholl at a dance event. Under Scholl's influence and after experiences on the front (including in the Battle of Stalingrad), Hartnagel changed from an enthusiastic soldier to an opponent of war and Nazi dictatorship.

Atlanta Compromise
"The Atlanta Compromise was an informal agreement, between the black people of the cotton-producing states of the United States, and the government of these states. It came after a speech by Booker T. Washington, given in 1895. The compromise is the following: The black people would tolerate means of racial segregation, most notably the Jim Crow laws. In exchange the white government of these states would allow them to get some basic education for free; this education was focused on technical jobs or basic training in jobs the industry needed. This would also improve the living conditions of the black peaople. Black people would no longer focus on fighting for egality, integration into society or justice. White people would finance educational institutions for black people, such as Tuskegee University. Even though people agreed on these points, their agreement was never written down."
"Shortly afterwards, arounf 1900, African-American leaders, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter, said that black people should instead focus on the stuggle for civil rights. It was Du Bois who coined the term to Atlanta Compromiise to refer to the speech by Brooker T. Washington."

Secure Digital card
"A Secure Digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is ""chipped off"". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way."
There are different kinds of cards:
"SD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system. Some devices (for example the Wii) that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update."
"There are also different ""classes"". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are ""Class 2"" - which means 2 MBytes/second, ""Class 4"" - 4 MB/sec and ""Class 6"" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions."
"Still another measurement is called ""rating"". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x."
microSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller.

Game of Death Redux
"Game of Death Redux (死亡遊戲 Redux) is a 2019 special features distributed with the movie ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"""
Background.
"In 1978 the ""Golden Harvest"" has released ""Game of Death"" (""死亡遊戲""). The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot. The revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original ""The Game of Death (1972)""."
Creation of special feature.
"But on 2019 producer ""Alan Canvan"" edited ""Game of Death Redux"". The edit only uses footage shot during the original production of ""The Game of Death"". The movie was released as a special feature in ""The Criterion Collection's"" Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020."
"It was presented closely the way Bruce intended. While at the same time, keeping in-tact some of the stronger as aspects of the universally panned, pieced together 1978 movie (known to fans as Game of Death ’78), such as John Barry’s acclaimed score, as well some of the film’s strong audio design."
New Version on 2022.
"There is a second version of ""Game of Death Redux"" on 2022."
"With the first version Alan Canvan had concentrated entirely on the flow of the piece. But he was not satisfied to how the shots were cut and how the music drove the narrative artistically. Canvan wanted a complete visual and sound restoration. So he got help from a new team. After a year the new Redux has been fully restored with a brand-new color grade and audio mix. Additionally, Chris Kent, who looped Bruce’s war cries for Robert Clouse’s Game of Death movie, lent his voice once again to match the audio portions from 1978. Finally, reworking a dozen sequences resulted in a much more concise and dramatic presentation of the narrative."
Legacy.
"Canvan’s Game of Death Redux was the latest project that focused on Bruce Lee’s original 1972 storyline, a subject that was previously explored in John Little’s 2000 documentary, and Artport’s Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 (released in Japan the same year), not to mention a series of fan edits that have been circulating the internet. All aforementioned edits use 1972-era The Game of Death footage that was initially discovered by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan, who stumbled upon the footage in the now-defunct Golden Harvest studio vaults back in 1999."

Trailer.
"The United States has a history in intelligence services dating back to its origins. During the American Revolution, George Washington and other Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and Patrick Henry used espionage networks."
"The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has been Gina Haspel since April 26, 2018."
"The CIA is made up of four groups, which do different things. Its goal is to protect the US people. Many people feel that the CIA does more bad than good. Others people that the CIA does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the United States. Others think those secrets should remain secret. American law makes it illegal for the CIA and other agencies to kill foreign leaders."
"In 1992, Saddam Hussein tried to kill US President George H.W. Bush, who used to be director of the CIA, during a visit to Kuwait. The assassination plot failed. In revenge, President Bill Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the Iraqi equivalent to the CIA. That occurred at night and so only the cleaners were killed, not those who had planned the assassination."
"CIA has many clandestine, or secret, operations. Some CIA employees have been killed during their work. Their names are on a CIA memorial with a star for them, but some of the names are still secret. The number of stars is deliberately inaccurate."
"The CIA also uses open sources to gather information. Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasts to learn information, which can be pieced together to make a conclusion."
"The CIA used to report to the President. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a reorganization made the CIA and other intelligence agencies report to a Director of National Intelligence."
"The CIA has been featured in many television and film productions, including the American television show ""The Agency,"" the American television mini-series ""The Company,"" the film ""Spy Game"" that stars Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, ""Night Flight to Moscow"" that stars Yul Brenner, ""Scorpio"" that stars Burt Lancaster, ""Clear and Present Danger"" that stars Harrison Ford; ""Ice Station Zebra,"" and several James Bond films that featured the CIA agent Felix Leiter."

"Controversy about injected hCG for weight loss started marketing campaign for injections of ""homeopathic hCG"" for weight control. The ingredients in these products if prepared from true hCG via homeopathic dilution, will contain either no hCG at all or only small amount of it."
We can measure hCG level with Blood or urine tests. These can be done by pregnancy tests.
"Below is a list of hCG levels during pregnancy. (""LMP"" is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of your last period.) The level of hCG grows over the time during pregnancy."
Giovanni Bellini

International marketing
International marketing (IM) or global marketing is a marketing done on international level. The International Marketing is based on strategy created in home country of company and distributed to its other offices/affiliations. In most cases it is international company level (company have offices in different countries) market identification and targeting. International Marketing is very similar to Global marketing.
The main difference will be the fact that Global Marketing is focusing on intercontinental point of view.
The example of International Marketing would be where an English company would like to enter Chinese market. It will be done by either developing marketing strategy in their home country that will be then introduced in new market or they will hire a company to create such a plan.
Differences between marketing and international marketing.
International marketing is developed by many multinational companies on a global level. It is then send to local markets which make changes for their country and starts following new strategy. Such a way of creating marketing strategies ensures that the global brand will be following same strategy and targeting same buyers group.

1960 Winter Olympics
"The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VIII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States (in the Lake Tahoe basin). Squaw Valley won the bid in 1955."
"Alexander Cushing, the creator of the resort, campaigned vigorously to win the Games. After being awarded the Games, there was a rush to construct roads, hotels, restaurants, and bridges, as well as the ice arena, the speed skating track, ski lifts, and the ski jumping hill."
1984 Winter Olympics
"The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. (Sarajevo is now in Bosnia and Herzegovina.) Other candidate cities were Sapporo, Japan and Falun, Sweden. It was the first Winter Games and the second Olympics held in Eastern Europe (the first was the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow)."
1988 Winter Olympics
"The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and opened by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé. The Olympics were highly successful financially as they brought in million-dollar profits. The games left a lasting impression on the host city and gave it a new identity from a cowtown to a large commercial sector of the country."
1988 was also the last year that the Paralympic Games and the Winter Olympics were held in separate cities. All Games after the 1988 Winter Olympics have been hosted by the same city or a city nearby.
"The Canadian team did not win a gold medal during the 1988 Winter Olympics, similar to how the Canadian team did not win one during the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. At the time, Canada and Yugoslavia were the only countries that had not won a gold medal when their country hosted the Olympics. (However, Canada would later win a gold medal when the 2010 Winter Olympics were hosted in Vancouver.)"

Football at the Summer Olympics
Football (soccer) has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932 as a men's competition sport. Women's football was added to the official program at the 1996 Atlanta edition.
History.
"Football was not in the original modern Olympic Games program as international football was not that popular in 1896. However an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition. Complete records have been lost and may not even be true but it seems that only two games may have been played. An Athens XI lost to a team representing Smyrna (Izmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. Smyrna went on to be beaten 15-0 by a team from Denmark. Demonstration tournaments were played at the 1900 and 1904 games and the ""Intercalated Games"" of 1906, but these were contested by various clubs and scratch teams, and are not considered to be official Olympic events. Neither FIFA nor the IOC recognize the Intercalated Games. The first proper tournament is said to be in the 1908 Olympics, organized by the Football Association. It had 6 teams. The next tournament was organized by the Swedish Football Association in 1912. However, the tournament was very unbalanced, with some high scoring games such as 10-0 and 12-0, and all of the players were amateurs. The tournaments of 1924 and 1928 are the two only editions officially recognised by FIFA as championships of the world."
"For the 1984 Olympics, the IOC admitted professional players."
"Since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, all teams have to be under-23 years old. Since 1996, three over 23 players are allowed."
"A women's edition was added in 1996. The women's tournament has no age restrictions, unlike the men's tournament."
1976 Winter Olympics
"The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria. The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado, United States in May 1970, but a 300 percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to voters' rejection of a $5 million bond issue to finance the games in 1972. As a result, the IOC offered the games to Whistler, British Columbia (Canada), who had bid on the games, but they also declined due to a change of government there. (Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.) The IOC finally called on Innsbruck, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Games just twelve years earlier, to also host the 1976 games. Salt Lake City, Utah, which would eventually host in 2002, offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC declined."
Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics
"Gymnastics has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. For thirty years, only men were allowed to compete. Women's events were introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The competition was held in artistic gymnastics discipline until 1984, when rhythmic gymnastics discipline was added to the program of the Olympics. Since 2000, trampolining discipline has also been competed."

Factoring (finance)
Factoring is a financial arrangement whereby a supplier of goods sells its trade receivables to the factor (bank) at discounted price for immediate cash payment. Factoring is selling rights to the future payments. People and companies that are receiving money from contracts every some time may be in need of extra money - so they sell rights to receive those payments for cash hence Factoring. This is done especially in construction business where companies are paid for parts of work completed instead of upfront payment. Such a company will sell future payments for small percentage fee and will receive all money they need to continue the work without delays.
The structured settlement factoring transaction can be really helpful for business in financial needs.
It provides business with better financing and more funds on hands in exchange for small percentage of total sum.
Some banks are entering field of Factoring trying to provide same service advertised by well known names.

Sulfur cycle
"The sulfur cycle is the way sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems."
"Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion."
Steps of the sulfur cycle.
Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.
Human Impact on the sulfur cycle.
"Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming."

Halteres
"Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better."
"The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings."
Function.
"Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight."
"They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight."
"Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres."
"The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres."
Development.
"In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene ""Ultrabithorax"" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype."
Convergent evolution.
"The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the ""forewings"" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the ""hindwings"" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution."
"Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and ""in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight""."
Bill Hicks
"William 'Bill' Hicks (16 December 1961 - 26 February 1994) was an American stand-up comedian known for his controversial act which made fun of religion and politics amongst other areas. Since then, many other stand-up comedians in the United States and United Kingdom have said they have been very influenced by his work, which is still very popular today."
"Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia and raised in Houston, Texas. He died of pancreatic cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Gene Wilder
"Gene Wilder (Jerome Silberman; June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016) was an American actor, author, comedian, director and screenwriter. He was most famous for his acting work and in particular for the movies he made with Mel Brooks which include ""The Producers"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"". He also played the part of Willy Wonka in the musical movie ""Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory""."
Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa.
"Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956."
"An unauthorized biography of Wilder called ""Gene Wilder: Funny and Sad"" by Brian Scott Mednick was published in December 2010 by BearManor Media."
"Wilder died from Alzheimer's disease on August 29, 2016 in Stamford, Connecticut at age 83."
Exeter City F.C.
Exeter City F.C. is an English association football club currently competing in the English Football League. They were founded in 1904 and currently play at the St James Park ground.
Possibly their most famous game was when they drew 0-0 against Manchester United in an FA Cup match in 2005 at United's home ground of Old Trafford.
Die Lollipops
"Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old."
Music.
Their music can be divided into three basic types:
Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics:
History.
"""Die"" is German for ""the"" (plural); ""Lollipops"" is a loanword from English. The most common German word for lollipop is ""Lutscher"", but Germans now also use ""Lollipop"". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called ""die Lollipops"" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000."
"Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called ""Einfach tierisch"" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called ""Immer in Bewegung"" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus Büchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called ""Wir feiern wieder Feste"" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus &amp; Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus."
"Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com."
Water opossum
"The water opossum (""Chironectes minimus"") is also known as the yapok. It is an aquatic marsupial and a member of the opossum family. It has black and grey waterproof fur and webbed hind feet. It is ""the only living marsupial where both sexes have a backward-pointing pouch""."
"The animal is found in the freshwater streams and lakes in Mexico, Central and South America. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows. It comes out after dusk to search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank."
The yapok's webbed back feet helps it chase its prey in the water.
Blazing Saddles
"Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy western movie directed by Mel Brooks starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and Harvey Korman. It tells the story of a black Sheriff, played by Little, who is appointed Sheriff of a small Western town and how he must try to make friends with the racist towns people and stop a ruthless businessman from knocking down the town to make way for a railway line."
"Tradition tells that he was a member of the Sanguini family. Before being elected, he was the cardinal-priest of the church of Santa Susanna in Rome."
He died on 15 March 931 in Rome and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Pope Stephen VII.
Korea University Museum
"Korea University Museum is in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It was established in 1934 as the first university museum in Korea. When it was first established there used to be a separate university museum building. But in 2005, Korea University Museum was moved to the Centennial Memorial Samsung Hall which is on the right side of the main gate. The museum is divided into four floors including the basement floor. There are five exhibition halls including Centennial Hall, History Folklore Hall, Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Hall, Donation Hall and Special Exhibition Hall."
Layout.
"On the first floor is the Centennial Hall, which introduces the 100 years of Korea University. This hall is divided into four parts including the history of Korea University, two theme rooms and a theater room which shows the past and history of Korea University."
"History Folklore Hall is on the second floor displaying ceramics, Buddhist art of Korea, calligraphy and paintings. The History Folklore Hall is divided into two rooms: Joseon Dynasty Room and Ancient Art Room. Joseon Dynasty room is divided into five parts displaying cultural relics of Joseon Dynasty: the earth and the sky of Joseon, life of Joseon, patterns of Joseon, social system of Joseon, life of Min Yeong-hwan and Yu Kil-chun. Ancient Art Room displays ceramics, Buddhist art, and traditional paintings of  Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, Goryeo and Joseon."
"The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room, which exhibits the paintings and sculptures of Korea's modern art, is on the third floor. The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room displays the modern art of Korea which shows the influence of Western art techniques. This room presents the transfiguration of Korean traditional paintings."
"Also, the Donation Hall is on the third floor exhibiting the relics which were donated to the university museum."
"The Special Exhibition Hall, which is open occasionally for special displays, is in the basement floor. Special exhibitions are held three to four times every year."
Collection.
"Korea University Museum possesses approximately one hundred thousand relics including three National Treasures, which are Honcheonsigye, Donggwoldo and Buncheong ware. Also, the traditional Korean paintings by Sim Sa-jeong, Jeong Seon and Kim Hong-do and modern arts by Park Su-geun, Whanki Kim and Yi Eungro are in display. The museum displays various relics of all times in fields of history, archaeology, folklore and art, continuously developing a variety of exhibitions and education for public."
"Honcheonsigye, National Treasure of Korea No. 230."
"Honcheonsigye is a celestial globe clock created by Song I-yeong in 1669. The clock has an armillary sphere with a diameter of 40 cm. Unlike Chinese astronomical clock, it could measure the accurate time by observing the whole movement of universe. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon Dynasty. An image of the clock's sphere is shown on the reverse of the 2007 issued 10,000 won banknotes."
"Donggwoldo, National Treasure of Korea No. 249."
"Donggwoldo literally means ""Painting of Eastern Palace."" The painting depicts the Eastern Palaces, Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung in 19th century. ""Donggwol"" is an alternative name of Changdeokgung, which means it is located to the East of the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty,Gyeongbokgung. The palaces in this painting were depicted elaborately in details so its value as the reference of Joseon Dynasty's palace arrangement is great."
"Buncheong ware, National Treasure of Korea No. 177."
"Buncheong ware or  Punch'ong ware, is a type of celadon in grayish blue color. It is a style of Korea's traditional stoneware, which emerged in the middle era of Joseon Dynasty. It started to lose its popularity after 16th century with the appearance of white porcelains. Korea University Museum owns a special Buncheong ware which was a jar to contain the placenta of Royal Family in Joseon Dynasty."
Poitou
Poitou was a province of France of west-central France whose capital city was Poitiers.
"There is a marshland called the Poitevin Mar on the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort."
"Many of the Acadians who settled in what is now Nova Scotia beginning in 1604 and later to New Brunswick, came from the region of Poitou. After the Acadians were deported by the British beginning in 1755, a number of Acadians eventually took refuge in Poitou and in Québec. A large portion of these refugees also migrated to Louisiana in 1785 and following years became known as Cajuns."
Kristubhagavatam
"Kristubhagavatam is a mahakavya (an epic poem) written in Sanskrit. It is based on the life of Jesus Christ. It was written by Mahakavi P. C. Devassia. Devassia was a Sanskrit scholar from Kerala, India."
Pope John VII
Pope John VII (650 – 18 October 707) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1 March 705 until 18 October 707 when he died.
His father was Plato was a curator of the Palatine Hill. This makes him the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official.
"He had bad relations with the Quinisext council of 692 but had good relations with the Lombards, who had ruled much of Italy at the time. Liber Pontificalis criticized Pope John VII for not signing Canons which were really unpopular in Italy at the time."
The magazine is based in Sutton in Surrey in the UK.

Highland Football League
"The Highland Football League (HFL) is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands, as the name may suggest, but also in the north-east lowlands (Moray and Aberdeenshire). It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association."
History.
Formation.
"The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle."
Recent History.
"Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland."
"The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate."
"In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected."
"On February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club."
Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.
"The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous."
Linked Competitions.
The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs. These competitions are:
Meselson–Stahl experiment
"The Meselson–Stahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, using ""E. coli"" DNA."
"With their experiment, they found that DNA replication was semiconservative. The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, that is called ""synthesis""."
There are three different way this replication could happen:
"Meselson and Stahl found that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They put the bacteria in an environment with a Nitrogen isotope. They first used N15. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N14. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all v. Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N14."
Woodford tube station
"Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom."
The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell.
History.
The ancient Greeks called the Great Pyramid one of the seven wonders of the world. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them are on the western side of the River Nile. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the Egyptian pharaohs went to the stars to join their gods in the afterlife.
Pyramids in the Americas.
The Aztecs and Mayans also built many massive pyramids. None are as old or big as the oldest or biggest Egyptian pyramids. Most of them are step pyramids.
"Unlike Egyptian pyramids, which were used as tombs for rulers and wealthy people, Aztec and Mayan pyramids are believed to have been used for public displays of human sacrifice."
Other pyramids.
"There are also ancient pyramids in other parts of Africa, Central America, Europe, North America, and Asia. There is a famous modern glass pyramid in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada is also a glass pyramid."
Care Bears
"The Care Bears are a very successful toy franchise from the 1980s. Over forty million of these stuffed teddy bears, made with a variety of colours, were sold from 1983 to 1987. Each Bear had a name, a job, and a symbol tied to it. For example, Funshine Bear helps people wake up, and has a sun on his stomach."
"The toys were first made as characters on cards in 1981; the original artwork was done by James Lewis. Later, other toys called the Care Bear Cousins were introduced."
"They also gave way to three animated movies for the cinema in the mid-1980s. A related TV series from DIC and, later, Canada's Nelvana Limited came out at almost that same time."
"Recently, Care Bear toys have been brought back in a new edition for the twenty-first century. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in their first two DVD movies (both computer-animated), as well as a few video games."
Bolzano
"Bolzano (; ; , Southern Bavarian: ""Bozn"") is the capital city of the province of Province of Bolzano-Bozen in northern Italy's Alto Adige."
Data.
"Its population is 98.057 (March 2005) and the area of the municipality is 52.34 km2. Bolzano has a history of Italian-speaking inhabitants since the Middle Ages. The region of Alto Adige/Südtirol is mainly German speaking, but in the city the Italian speaking population was the majority (75%) in 2001. The German speaking population of the city was 24% and the Ladin speaking less than 1%. Actually the foreign-born are around 7% (mostly are from eastern Europe)."
"Historically between the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated by neolatins from the time of the Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanisation. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present area of South Tyrol (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin. After the Italian victory in WWI the Italian government promoted a huge immigration of Italians in the city, that was fully modernized with new areas and with the creation of an industrial section: since then the Italians are the majority and in the 2011 census they were nearly 77% of the total population."
"Bolzano actually is an international city with a trilingual English-German-Italian university (Free University of Bolzano), the European Academy (EURAC), a Business Innovation Centre (BIC), an international airport (ABD, daily flights to Rome and Munich), the ""Bolzano Fair Area"", the Archaeology Museum with the Frozen Fritz (the Iceman called here Ötzi), other important museums, the famous ""Monumento alla Vittoria"" and an old Tyrolean medieval centre with the typical alpine arcades (""Portici""-Lauben)."
"Bolzano is the centre of the ""Euregio Tirol-Südtirol/Alto Adige-Trentino"" and with Innsbruck is the capital of the ""Alps Convention""."
City districts and neighboring communities.
Bolzano has five city districts:
"Communities next to Bozen are: Appiano, Cornedo, Laives, Deutschnofen, Renon, Genesio, Terlan, and Vadena."
"Other important towns near Bozen are: Bressanone, Brunico and Merano."
Flubber
"Flubber is a 1997 American science-fiction comedy film directed by Les Mayfield (who had previously directed another John Hughes scripted remake, ""Miracle on 34th Street"") and written by Hughes, based on an earlier screenplay by Bill Walsh. A remake of ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" (1961), the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton, and Clancy Brown with Jodi Benson providing a voice. The film grossed $178 million worldwide despite negative reviews. In selected theaters, the ""Pepper Ann"" episode ""Old Best Friend"" was featured before the film."
Mary Wollstonecraft
"Mary Wollstonecraft (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was a British writer. She was born in Spitalfields, a daughter of a rich farmer who inherited his fortune. Her father was known because he was sometimes violent towards her, her four siblings, and their mother when his farms failed. Mary Wollstonecraft was the second oldest child in her family. She was the oldest female child. She left home at the age of nineteen to work and become independent."
"Working in the English city of Bath, Somerset, she developed a disliking for the upper class and their social lives. In 1784 she experienced the near death of her sister Eliza who was also the victim of abuse at the hands of her husband. She escaped with her sister to London to preserve her life. Soon after, her good friend Fanny Blood, died of complications in childbirth. Wollstonecraft suffered depression following this and being in financial straits, she began to write her first book ""Thoughts on the Education of Daughters"". Then she wrote """"."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Wildcats. They have 7 varsity teams and they compete in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.
Bain-marie
"A bain-marie (or water bath) is a piece of equipment used in science, industry, and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time."
Description.
"The bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source."
Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.
"The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching."
"When a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures."
Alternatives.
"A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric ""dry-heat"" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts."
"Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or ""bath""), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam."
Origin.
"Bains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated."
"The name comes from the medieval-Latin term ""balneum"" (or ""balineum"") ""Mariae""—literally, ""Mary's bath""—from which the French ""bain de Marie"", or ""bain-marie"", is derived. There are many theories as to how the name ""Marie"" came to be associated with this equipment:"

"In short, moksha symbolizes something which is beyond comprehension; too great and too wondrous to be truly understood, it can only be felt when one attains it. The world is truly a beautiful place, but the greatness that lies within is even more so, since the power of the greatness is completely unknown."
"After all, isn't that what beauty is; appreciation of the unknown!"
For a more comprehensive explanation of this topic read the books:
Moksha is the ultimate goal of a person to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death
Caste
"The caste system is a system in India that was once mainly used by Hindus. This system has been generally accepted for about 3000 years. There are four castes in this system, and one outcast group regarded as ""untouchables"". There are also castes in countries other than India as the system spread to South Asia about 2000 years ago. For centuries, this system has dictated one's marriages, geographical location, and occupation. People must not marry someone from another caste, and they must not do things that another caste does. The Indian government today works to decrease this discrimination with the quotas set in government jobs in 1950."
Brahmin
Brahmin is one of the part of four varnas in Hinduism. Brahmins are the highest and most respected among people. In ancient India people who read the complete Upanishad Brahmanak were called Brahmins
Caste system.
"The caste system classified people by jobs. The people in this caste were mostly priests and dramatists in the Aryan society. The Brahmins arranged prayers and rituals. Parashurama was one of the well known Brahmin by birth, but throughout his life, he was a warrior whose job was to protect Dharma. Parshurama is also Creator Father of Bhumihar Brahman and Bhumihar Thakur, Bhumihar's are also known as Parashurama Brahman &amp; Bramhkshatriya. Most Brahmins practice vegetarianism. An old tradition is that Brahmin Men pulled there foreskin back since childhood, with an Glansring, because of became clean in this part"
"There are many subgroups in Brahmins based on demography. Rishiswar, Sanadhya, Kanyakubj, Telang, Saryupareen, Bhumihar, Goswami, Tyagi, and Saraswati are the main streams of Brahmin. Across the subcontinent, other Brahmins are also believed to have switched from the traditional duties of Brahmins in favor of military and administrative ones. In other parts of the subcontinent, outside of Punjab and the Gandhara region, they have been known as the Tyagi Brahman and ""brahma-kshatriya"" groups. These groups also claim to have descended from the Parshuram Tyagi Brahmans of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh; traditionally, they have a close relationship and brotherhood with Mohyals."
"Some Mohyal Brahmins migrated eastward and became as some sub-divisions of Bhumihar Brahmins, some of whom are also descendants of Hussaini Brahmins and mourn the death of Imam Hussain.[7] Bhumihar Brahmins and Tyagi/ Mohyal Brahmins have an affinity and brotherhood for each other. The  Bhumihar Brahmins, of whom many, though not all, belong to the Saryupareen Brahmin division of Kanyakubja Brahmins.In Kerala Ezhavathy is also a Mohyal community.[8]"
The Brahmins of Vedic Period.
"The Brahmanas of the Vedic period were regarded as the most knowledgeable people and the best of best in all arts. Therefore, not all Hindus worship other Gods."
The sub-groups.
"In Tamil Nadu, The Iyers and Iyengars are well known Brahmin communities. Iyers are mostly worshippers of Shiva and the Iyengars are Vaishnavites."
DNA.
"The majority of the Males in Brahmin caste belong to of Y-DNA R1a1* Haplogrup, interestingly the same Haplogroup can be found view in the Roma people too"
Kshatriya
"Kshatriya is a division of the caste system in Hinduism. A ""kshatriya"" is a warrior, ruler, politician, or administrative worker."
There are 3 lineages of Kshatriyas:-
"However, there is one more lineage (not mentioned in any Puranas) - Nagavanshi (snake-born), who claims descent from the Nagas."
Vaishya
"Vaishya is a division of the caste system. A vaishya is a trader, merchant or artisan."
Shudra
Shudra is a division of the caste system. A shudra is considered a servant or peasant. Shudra and Ati-shudra indicates the bottom most ranks in the Indian caste system.
"Mahatma Jyotirao Phule set out the history of shudra-ati-shudra communities in his book ""Gulamgiri."" He drew the attention to the exploitation of Shudras, Ati-shudras, and women etc. At this time, most prefer not even to touch such castes."
Pavel Eljanov
Pavel Eljanov (born 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
"Eljanov's most notable tournament result to date was winning Corus B tournament 2007 in Wijk aan Zee, Holland with a score of 9/13. This result enabled him to qualify for the category 20 tournament Corus A 2008."
"On the September 2010 FIDE rating list, Eljanov had a rating of 2761, making him number 1 in Ukraine and number 6 in the world. His results in the Russian premier league had been exceptional. Since then he has slipped to #21."
Lactase
"Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested."
"Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea."
Lactase evolution in humans.
"Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism."
The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk.
Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers.
Genetics.
"A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives."
"This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait."
"Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution."
Tanduay
"Tanduay Rhum is an alcoholic drink from the Philippines. It is produced by Tanduay Distillers Inc., and with origins dating from 1854."
Asia Brewery
"Asia Brewery is a brewery founded in 1982 in Makati City, the Philippines. It is one of only two breweries in the Philippines, and is the smaller of the two, with only 10% market share. It is owned by Lucio Tan, listed by Forbes Magazine as the second richest Filipino in the Philippines, with assets worth $1.5 billion."
Products.
"It produces malt beverages like beer, shandy, iced tea, bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. Its sister company Tanduay Distillers, Inc. produces hard liquor. It somewhat mimics the structure of its bigger rival San Miguel Corporation, except that ABI has no food and agribusiness divisions."
"It offers eight beers in the Philippines with its flagship brand Beer na Beer launched in 1988 as Beer Pale Pilsen. It changed its name to Beer na Beer after lawsuits by other breweries using the term pale pilsen. In 2001, Beer na Beer was reformulated and now has 6.0% alcohol volume."
"ABI's seven other beers are sold on a somewhat limited scale, but its Colt 45 brand, launched in 1995, is the biggest among them. This malt liquor's biggest competitor is Red Horse Extra Strong from San Miguel. ABI's other licensed brands are Carlsberg (the brewery's first beer in 1987), Lone Star (launched in 2000), Lone Star Light (2002), Colt Ice (2003), Lone Star ULTRA (the country's first low-carb beer, launched in 2004, Stag (either cancelled or it's just hard to find in the country), and Coors (2008)."
"The company also offers Absolute distilled drinking water, the second biggest-selling bottled water brand in the market behind SMC's Wilkins, and Summit mineral water. They are both launched in 1992."
"In 1995, Q Shandy was launched to compete with SMC's Cali. In 1999, Pacific Sun iced tea was launched. In 2009, Asia Brewery introduced Feelgood, the first juice drink in the Philippines to contain prebiotics."
"Asia Brewery entered the low-priced carbonated soft drinks market by acquiring a license to produce Virgin Cola from Virgin Drinks. They are responsible in distributing products such as Summit Vitaminwater, ZeroCal and 100Plus."
"In 2008, Asia Brewery partnered with Cobra International Beverage Holdings, Inc. introduced the Philippine version of Cobra Energy Drink, is the ready-to-drink energy drink now in the Philippine market."
Ginebra San Miguel
"In classical antiquity, the river was known as the ""Ōxus"" in Latin and Ὦξος ""Oxos"" in Greek."
"The name ""Amu"" is said to have come from the medieval city of ""Āmul"", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as ""Türkmenabat""), in modern Turkmenistan. ""Darya"" is the Persian word for ""river""."
"Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's ""Wakhan Corridor"", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's"" Kyzyl Kum"" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times."
In hadith.
"In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan)."
As the river Jayhan.
"Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Jayhan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghanastan historians. ."
Description.
"The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D."
"Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the ""Syr Darya"" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek)."
Watershed.
"About of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan."
"Of the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river."
"This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the ""Zeravshan River"") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe."
"The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and ""Tian Shan"","
"which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about ."
History.
The Amu Darya is (also theJayhan river)
"was called the ""Oxus"" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river Jayhan was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river Jayhan drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Jayhan river northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea."
"It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian."
"People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities."
"The first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Viné collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862."
"The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built."
Literature.
"The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus."
Founding Fathers of the United States
"The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, either helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term ""Founding Fathers"" was first used for these people in 1916."
"There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison."
"Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. Most of them owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government. Five of them, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, were later elected president of the United States."

Barry Marshall
"Barry James Marshall, AC, FRS, FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian doctor and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria ""Helicobacter pylori"" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University."
Early years.
"Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion."
Life and research.
"In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of ""H. pylori"". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that ""Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right"". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the ""H. pylori"" idea could be proved."
"Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between ""H. pylori"" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal."
"After this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at ""H. pylori"" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA."
Awards and honours.
"In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium ""Helicobacter pylori"" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease."
Marshall was given other awards including:
He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.
Diglossia
"Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use. One is the common language they use every day, and the other is either a much older version from centuries before (for example, Arabic or Chinese) or a similar but clearly different modern-day version (for example, Norwegian with Bokmål and Nynorsk)."
Mutual intelligibility
Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are alike. This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different languages or different dialects.
"There are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and spelling between British and General American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible."
"Sometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani, the official language of British India until India became independent. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu."
"Also, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin, Shanghainese/Wu Chinese, and Cantonese/Yue in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other."
"As one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real-number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis."
Cabo Corrientes
Cabo Corrientes is a cape on the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is the most southern point of the Bahía de Banderas.
Homeland
"A homeland (rel. ""country of origin"" and native land) is the concept of the territory (cultural geography) to which an ethnic group holds a long history and a deep cultural association with. It's the country in which a particular national identity began."
Strike (attack)
"A strike (or blow) is an attack with an inanimate object, such as a weapon, or with a part of the human body. It is intended to harm an opponent."
Mazatlán
"Mazatlán () is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa; the surrounding ""municipio"" (municipality) for which the city serves as the municipal capital is also called Mazatlán. It is located at on the Pacific coast, just across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula."
"Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word meaning ""place of the deer."" The city was started in 1531. By the mid-1800s a large group of immigrants had arrived from Germany. These new citizens made Mazatlán into a successful commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. They also influenced the music, banda, which is an form of Bavarian folk music, and also started the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900."
"Mazatlán, with a population of 352,471 (city) and 403,888 (municipality) as of the 2005 census, is the second-largest city in the state (after Culiacán) and Mexico's largest commercial port. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry across the Gulf of California from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur exists. The municipality has a land area of 3,068.48 km² (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, El Habal and many other small villages."
Mazatlán is served by Gral. Rafael Buelna International Airport.

Rennet is a set of enzymes made from the stomachs of mammals. It is used in things like suet and cakes. It can also be used to make cheese.
Kol people
"The Kols, also known as Kolarians, are the original inhabitants of modern-day West Bengal and North-east India. The term Kol has been corrupted by the Aryan-Sanskritic speakers to the word ""kalu"", meaning both ""black"" and ""ugly"", in almost all of the 16 major languages of the subcontinent. The Kolarians are a Dravidian peoples stock group, whose descendant communities can be found also in West Bengal and elsewhere in the eastern part of the East India."
"Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the Tertiary era. Semi-recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago. A 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district. This Neo-stone age began 3,000 BC lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements."
"Physically, the indigenous peoples of eastern India were long-headed, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature. Sometimes labeled as ""Negritos"" and ""Negroids"", their physical features are unchanged today among the lowest castes of Bengal, mainly the peasants, as well as 95% of population of West Bengal today who derive from these lower castes and tribes."
Sena dynasty
"Language revival tries to save a language that is dead or endangered. The Hebrew language was once a language that was not spoken, but the language was revived, and people now speak and use it again. Many people are now trying to revive their languages. The revival of languages is good, beautiful, and useful."
John Travolta

Objectivity (science)
"Objectivity in science means that scientific ideas and measurements are tested. That means they are independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them. In other words, if scientist A claims something, scientist B must be able to check whether A is right."
"The evidence can (in principle) be shown to anyone who doubts it. The ""in principle"" bit is because some science needs complex machinery, and if you don't understand the machinery, you won't understand the results. But elementary science can often be shown in a classroom, or on television."
"Some science does need a proper scientific education. To some extent the general public has to trust a qualified scientist to present the idea in some suitable form. That means on television or on the web, or perhaps in published articles or books. Most awards of the Nobel Prize in science are followed by presentations on various web channels."
"It is generally agreed that, at least in some subjects, modern science needs a person to have some education before they can understand it. Specialist communicators often do this on television or the web. 150 years ago, people read science directly from books written by scientists like Faraday and Darwin. Now most people get their science from people who act as communicators of science."
Objectivity in measurement.
"To avoid the variety in subjective (ambiguous) interpretation of quantifying terms such as ""green"", ""hot"", ""large"", ""considerable"", and ""negligible"", scientists try hard, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standardized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc.) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc.) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use ""hard"", ""objective"" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would get the same results."
Roundhay Garden Scene
"Roundhay Garden Scene is a short movie made on October 14, 1888 in the garden of ""Oakwood Grange"", Roundhay, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was made by a French man named Louis Le Prince. It was silent. The movie had Adolphe Le Prince, Sarah Whitley, Joseph Whitley, and Harriet Hartley walking in the garden of Oakwood Grange. It is believed to be the oldest surviving movie by many people. It is 1.66 seconds long. The digitalized version lasts 2.11 seconds."
Herpetology
"Herpetology is the branch of zoology concerned with reptiles and amphibians. It is about cold-blooded animals like salamanders, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, tuataras and crocodilians."
Herp.
"""Herp"" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term ""herpetile"". Linnaeus grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles."
Batrachology.
Batrachology is the study of amphibians. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite pets.

Cooling.
"Cooling is when an object gets cold, or lowers in temperature. This can happen by taking away heat, or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature. Fluids used to cool objects are called coolants."
Air cooling is making the temperature of an object lower using air. This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object. The process will work better if there is more surface area on the object or if the item's mass can be made smaller.
"Other ways to cool objects include using ice, dry ice, or liquid nitrogen. This works by convection; the heat is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant."
Electrical conductivity
"Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the ""siemens per meter"", (A2s3m−3kg−1) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm−1."
It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test.
"Electrical conductance is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge (such as electrons), which can carry electricity. When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears."
"A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity, and an insulator like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity. A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions."
Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal (or inverse) of electrical resistivity.
Pierre Omidyar
"Pierre Omidyar (born June 21, 1967) created and is now the chairman of eBay. He was born in Paris, France to a French-Iranian family. Born in Paris, France, brought up by Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the United States at the age of six. He grew up in Washington D.C. and developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated high school in 1984. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University. He helped write MacDraw in 1989 for Claris, a part of Apple Computer. Two years later he co-founded Ink Development (later renamed eShop). He was 28 when he wrote the original computer code for what eventually became e-Bay. The site was launched on Labor Day, Monday, September 4 1995, under the more basic name “Auction Web.”"
Caribert of Laon
"Caribert of Laon, son of Martin of Laon, was the grandfather of Charlemagne. He was the father of Charles's mother, Bertrada of Laon. In 721, he signed, with his mother Bertrada of Prüm, the foundation act of the Abbey of Prüm. The same year, also with his mother, he made a donation to the Abbey of Echternach. In 744, his daughter Bertrada of Laon (by Bertrada of Cologne) married Pepin the Short, mayor of the palace of Neustria and Burgundy and later king of the Franks. He died before 762."
First Lady of the United States
"The First Lady of the United States, abbreviated to as (FLOTUS) is the title and role held by hostess of the White House and usually the wife of the President of the United States, during the president's term in office."
"Jill Biden is the current First Lady of the United States, in role since January 2021 as the wife of President Joe Biden."

Events of Buretsu's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Buretsu's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"As emperor, Buretsu is described as wicked in the ""Nihonshoki,"" but this assessment is not mirrored in the text of the ""Kojiki."""
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Buretsu.
Overcharge
"Overcharge is an economic term used in legal discourse about price fixing violations. An overcharge is the difference between what a buyer or seller ""actually"" paid for a good purchased from a cartel and what the buyer or seller ""would have"" paid in the absence of a price-fixing cartel. The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court."
"The overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices. The Lerner Index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market. The overcharge has no upper limit."
Rye House railway station
"Rye House railway station is in Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, England. It is on the Hertford East branch of the West Anglia Main Line, and train services are provided by Abellio Greater Anglia."
Services.
"The typical off-peak service is two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street via Tottenham Hale, and two trains per hour to Hertford East."
List of London Underground stations
"The London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom. It serves Greater London and the nearby districts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. London Underground was first opened in 1863 which makes it the oldest underground metro system in the world."
Stations.
"This list includes all stations on the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway. Listed for each station is the line or lines serving it, the local authority and London Travelcard zone in which it is located, the date it opened, previous names and passenger usage statistics in millions per year."
"There are three instances where two separate stations share the same name: Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Canary Wharf. Although the Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms at Paddington are on the other side of the mainline station from the platforms of the other Underground lines, it is treated as a single station. It is currently shown this way on the Tube map, but has been shown as two stations at times. Canary Wharf has separate Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway stations, which are shown as one station on current tube map."
Ratatat
"Ratatat is a Electronic Rock/Electronica duo with guitarist Mike Stroud and synthesizer driver and producer Evan Mast. The two met as collee students in Skidmore, started working together in 2001 under the name ""Cherry"". In 2004 they published their debut album Ratatat which includes songs such as ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", and ""Desert Eagle"". Following, in 2006, Classics, then LP3, in 2008 was released."
"Other works done by Ratatat are single albums and remixes of other musicians. Single albums include ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", ""Wildcat"", ""Lex"", ""Loud Pipes"", ""Shiller"", ""Mirando"", and ""Shempi"". Their most recent remix album ""Ratatat Remixes No. 2"" featured 14 remixes featuring: Young Buck, T.I, Ludacris, The Notorious B.I.G, Jay Z, Z-Ro, Devin the Dude, Juvenile, Beanie Sigel, Despot, Memphis Bleek, Slim Thug, Bun B, Young Jeezy, Kanye West, Beans, Saigon, and U.G.K."
The band is known for their unique use of eletronica style music that emphasizes guitar towards the front while keeping the beat flow in the background.
Their songs were featured in various media. Some examples would be :
"""Seventeen Years"" was featured in the 2008 movie ""Cloverfield""."
"""Loud Pipes"" was featured in the PlayStation game ""MLB 07: The Show""."
"""Dura"" was used in CSI Season 9, Episode 7 ""Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda""."
"""Montanita"" was used in Season 2 - Episode 2 of the NBC show Chuck"
"They have currently gone through their spring 2009 US tour, and their next upcoming show is scheduled to be in Arendal on June 23, 2009."
Binary form
"Binary form (also know as AB Form or movement of continuity) is a type of form of music pieces. The word Binary means ""in two parts."" The word Form is a kind of guideline for composers when they write a piece of music. So, binary form means ""An outline in two parts."" A musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections."
Binary form was popular in the Baroque times and was often used for movements in sonatas for keyboard instruments. Each part of a binary form piece of music are usually repeated.
Minuets.
"Binary form was most commonly used in the Baroque era for short dances called minuets. The minuet's two parts are usually labeled as ""A"" and ""B."" In the A section of a minuet, the exposition is stated. This section almost always is repeated a couple times. The beginning part of the B section develops a slightly new musical idea, usually going to the dominant key, to add variation. Then it returns to the ""A"" key at the end. Some famous composers of minuets include Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel."
University of South Carolina Upstate
"University of South Carolina Upstate is a public university in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The university has about 4,608 students. It was founded in 1967. The current chancellor of the university is Dr. John C. Stockwell."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Spartans. They have 13 varsity teams. They compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Stetson University
"Stetson University is a private, co-educational university in DeLand, Florida. The university has about 2,200 students. It was founded in 1883. The current president of the university is Wendy B. Libby."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Hatters. They compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Atlantic Sun Conference
"The ASUN Conference is a NCAA conference whose members play in NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Atlanta and mostly features universities and colleges from the southeastern United States. The ASUN did not play football until 2022, when it began play in the second level of Division I football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS)."
The ASUN began in 1978 as the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC). It became the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2001 and rebranded itself as the ASUN Conference in 2016.
Members.
"As of the 2022–23 school year, the ASUN has 14 full members, or schools that play almost all of their sports in the conference."
"The ASUN has added five members in the 2020s. First, three schools, one a returning member, joined in 2021. The first-time members were the University of Central Arkansas and Eastern Kentucky University, which respectively arrived from the Southland Conference and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). Jacksonville State University, which had been an ASUN member from 1995 to 2003, returned after spending 18 years in the OVC. At that time, the ASUN technically began sponsoring football, but did not start conference play. It partnered with the Western Athletic Conference, which was launching an FCS football league in the fall 2021 season. Under the agreement, the three newest members, all of which play FCS football, became de facto WAC football members for that season only."
"The next membership change came in July 2022 with the arrival of football-sponsoring Austin Peay State University from the OVC and non-football Queens University of Charlotte from the Division II South Atlantic Conference. When Peay was announced as an incoming ASUN member, it gave the conference six members that play FCS football and award scholarships for that sport, which is the number of teams needed for a conference to receive an automatic bid to the FCS playoffs. However, the ASUN would lose one of those six members when Jacksonville State announced a 2023 move to Conference USA (C-USA). JSU began a transition to FBS in 2022, making it ineligible for the FCS playoffs. The WAC lost two of its planned six playoff-eligible members in 2022, with Sam Houston starting an FBS transition ahead of its 2023 move to C-USA and Incarnate Word backing out of a planned move to the WAC and remaining in the Southland Conference. This led the ASUN and WAC to renew their football partnership for 2022. Both conferences will play separate league schedules, with officials from each conference choosing their one automatic playoff team. The new ASUN football league, launching in 2022, will feature Austin Peay, the three 2021 arrivals, Kennesaw State, and North Alabama. Three other ASUN schools sponsor football but will not play that sport in the ASUN. Stetson plays in the Pioneer Football League, whose members do not award football scholarships; Liberty plays as an independent in the top level of D-I football, the Football Bowl Subdivision; and Bellarmine began play in sprint football, a weight-restricted form of the sport not run by the NCAA, in 2022."
Associate members.
"The ASUN also has 12 ""associate members"" that play one or two sports in the conference while being full members of another conference. Seven of these schools, plus full members Bellarmine and Jacksonville, make up the ASUN men's lacrosse league, restarted in the 2021–22 school year (2022 season) after having been shut down when the ASUN began a lacrosse partnership with the Southern Conference (SoCon). Four more schools joined in July 2021. Two returned women's lacrosse to the ASUN after the SoCon shut down its women's lacrosse league, and three joined in beach volleyball."
"After the Atlantic 10 Conference started a men's lacrosse league for the 2023 season, taking away two of the SoCon's six men's lacrosse members, the SoCon shut down its men's lacrosse league. Jacksonville, which had played in SoCon men's lacrosse in the 2022 season by agreement between the ASUN and SoCon, returned that sport to the ASUN. It was joined in ASUN men's lacrosse by Mercer, a full SoCon member that was already an ASUN beach volleyball member, and Lindenwood, which started a transition to D-I in 2022 as a new member of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), which does not sponsor the sport. Lindenwood also joined the ASUN in women's lacrosse, also not sponsored by the OVC, at that time."
"The ""Joined"" column shows the year in which a school joined the ASUN. Since all ASUN sports that have associate members (beach volleyball and men's and women's lacrosse) are spring sports, this means the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of ASUN play."
Higher Learning

Oomycete
The Oomycota are a class in a huge phylum of eukaryotic microorganisms called the heterokonts. Oomycetes are a distinct phylogenetic line of fungus-like microorganisms.
"They are not actually fungi, though some have filaments as fungi do. Like fungi, they are saprophytic and pathogenic. also like fungi, oomycetes rarely have septa, and if they do, they are scarce."
"They are microscopic organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes are some of the most prolific pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as potato blight and sudden oak death."
"They are often referred to as water moulds (or moulds), although the water-loving nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens."
Article Two allows Congress to set a national Election Day.
Clause 5: Qualifications for office.
"This clause simply means that to be President, a person must meet three requirements:"
"If a person does not meet all of these requirements, they cannot be President."
Changes.
Two later amendments changed these rules about who can be President and Vice President:
Clause 6: Vacancy and disability.
"This clause talks about the possibility that the Presidency might become ""vacant"". This might happen because:"
"If the Presidency becomes vacant, the Vice President becomes President. If the Vice President is ""also"" unable to be President, Congress can decide who will become President. Whoever takes over the Presidency will act as President until the actual President gets better (if he is sick or disabled), or until a President is elected in the next Presidential election."
"Congress has come up with a ""line of succession"" a list of the people who would become President, and in what order, if both the Presidency and Vice Presidency became vacant. As of 2016, the order is: the Speaker of the House of Representatives; the President ""pro tempore"" of the Senate; and then the fifteen Cabinet Secretaries, in order of when their Departments were first created."
Changes.
This clause was partially changed by the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. That Amendment creates a process for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. It also says that the Vice President can become Acting President (temporary President) if:
"If the President declares himself unable to discharge his duties, he can take the Presidency back at any time. For example, in 2002, George W. Bush became the first President to formally use the Disability Clause. He gave power to his Vice President for about two hours while he had a medical test which required anesthesia. Once he felt ready to be President again, Bush took back the Presidency."
"If the Vice President and the Cabinet say a President is unable to do his job, the President can still try to take control back. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet still think the President cannot do his job, they can challenge the President's return. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate agree, the President is declared unable to discharge his duties and the Vice President stays in control of the Presidency."
Clause 7: Salary.
"This means the President can receive a salary. However, the salary cannot be changed during the President's four-year term in office. Also, the President cannot receive any other salary, either from the federal government, or from any state government."
Clause 8: Oath or affirmation.
"Before he becomes President, Clause 8 requires the new President to take an oath, promising that he will do his best as President, and will also do his best to protect and defend the Constitution. Usually, the Chief Justice of the United States gives the oath (""swears in"" the new President) at the President's inauguration."
Section 2: Presidential powers.
Section 2 talks about the powers that Article Two grants to the President.
Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons.
The Constitution gives the President the most powers in areas that have to do with national security and protecting the country.
"The President is the military's Commander-in-Chief. However, as part of the system of checks and balances in the Constitution, Article One says that only Congress can declare war. Still, the President can take actions like sending soldiers to certain places without needing Congress's approval, or a declaration of war."
"The President may ask the ""principal (head) officer"" of any executive department to give him advice in writing. The Constitution actually does not require a formal Cabinet. However, America's first President, George Washington, organized his principal offices into a Cabinet, and every President has done the same since."
"The President may grant pardons or reprieves to people who were convicted of crimes (except when the person was impeached). A ""reprieve"" cancels or changes a punishment for example, changing a death sentence to a sentence of life in prison."
Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause.
"This part of Section 2 is called the ""Advice and Consent Clause"". It gives the President powers, but he has to use them with the ""advice and consent"" (agreement) of the Senate. This is another example of checks and balances in the Constitution."
Treaties.
"Here, the Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with other countries. However, two-thirds of the Senators must agree with the treaty for it to take effect. If two-thirds of the Senate does not agree with the treaty, it is not approved, and there is nothing the President can do about it."
"The Constitution does not say how the United States can ""end"" a treaty. Since the Constitution has passed, the government has done this in a few ways. In 1798, the first time the government wanted to end a treaty (the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France), Congress passed a law ending the treaty. Other times, in the 1800s, a few Presidents ended treaties after Congress asked them to. The first time a President ended a treaty without Congress's approval was in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter ended a treaty with the Republic of China. In a lawsuit called ""Goldwater v. Carter"", members of Congress asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a President could end a treaty on his own. The Supreme Court could not agree on a decision, and the case was dismissed (ended without a decision)."
Appointments.
"The President may also choose judges, ambassadors, consuls (diplomats), ministers, and other officers; but again, he needs the advice and consent of the Senate."
"Some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want. Others leave a lot to the performer to decide. Historically, composers several centuries ago, such as Bach, only wrote occasional dynamic marks. Even Mozart only wrote a few, mostly p and f. By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music."
"Sometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks. ""Sforzando"" means a strong, sudden accent and is abbreviated as sf, sfz or fz. The notation sfzp (or sfp) means a ""sforzando"" followed immediately by ""piano"""
"The terms ""crescendo"", and ""diminuendo"" (or sometimes ""decrescendo""), mean a gradual getting louder or quieter. They can also be shown by signs known as ""hairpins"". A hairpin opening out is a ""crescendo"", one which closes is a ""diminuendo""."
"For a quick change in dynamics, molto cresc. and molto dim. are often used (""molto"" means ""a lot""). For slow changes poco a poco cresc. and poco a poco dim. are used (""poco a poco"" means ""little by little"", i.e. very gradually.)"
Francesco Botticini
"Francesco Botticini (real name Francesco di Giovanni, 1446 – 16 January 1498) was an Italian painter. He lived in the early part of the Renaissance period. He was born in Florence about 1446 and is best known for his painting called ""Assumption of the Virgin""."
"He died in 1497 or 1498. After he had been an assistant to the painter Neri di Bicci he started his own workshop. The shop was famous for its decorative works, a few of which can be seen in the cloistered church of Empoli. Botticini was influenced by Filippino Lippi and Botticelli who were two very famous Florentine painters."
Grana Padano
"Grana Padano is a type of hard cheese. It is similar to parmesan cheese. The name comes from the noun ""grana"" (‘grain’), which refers to the distinctively grainy texture of the cheese, and the adjective ""Padano"", which refers to the river Po."
"Grana Padano was created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle. They used ripened cheese as a way of preserving extra milk. By the year 1477, it was regarded as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy. Today, this product is made in the regions of Piedmont, Lombardy and Veneto, and in the province of Trento."
"Like Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano is a semi-fat hard cheese which is cooked and ripened slowly (for up to 18 months). It is produced by curdling the milk of grass-fed cows. The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then partially creamed. It is produced all year round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year."
"A wheel of Grana Padano is cylindrical, with slightly convex or almost straight sides and flat faces. The rind, which is thin, is white or straw yellow."
"Grana Padano cheese has been produced since the 12th century, and production and quality are now overseen by the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Grana Padano."
North American Free Trade Agreement
"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The agreement was signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas on December 17, 1992 in San Antonio, Texas, and took effect on January 1, 1994. It removed taxes on products traded between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also protects copyrights, patents, and trademarks between those three countries. It was updated with the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution. It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation, which helped people fight for better work conditions."
"On September 30, 2018, it was announced that the United States, Mexico, and Canada had come to an agreement to replace NAFTA with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
Effects.
"Since it took away taxes between products traded between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico has been buying more products from the US. It saved U.S. companies on the cost of selling products to Mexico, and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from U.S. companies."
"A benefit of the bill is that labels on products exchanged between the three countries come in French, English, and Spanish. That way, Mexicans and Americans who speak Spanish can read the Spanish label, Americans and Canadians can read the English label, and Canadians who speak French can read the French label."
"NAFTA also encourages more immigration from Mexico to the US. Since small businesses can no longer be protected by tariffs, many small business owners in Mexico cannot compete with the prices of subsidized products from the US and therefore many of them have gone under, or they lost more money than they could make. As a result, many Mexicans have gone to the US looking for work. The human rights organization EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de la Liberación Nacional), a revolutionary Mexican grass roots movement, is a strong opponent of NAFTA and points out how its provisions only make the economic situation worse for the poorest in Mexico and better for multi-national corporations."
Job losses.
Small Business Chronicle
"With the increased ease by which Mexico can import food products from the United States, the role of Mexican farmers is overwhelmed by the output of American farming. This is a notable con of NAFTA. According to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends, over 1 million Mexican farmers have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement."
"The American economy lost about 683,000 jobs thanks to NAFTA -- more than 60% of which were in the manufacturing sector. Almost 35,000 Ohioans found themselves unemployed, or without jobs, thanks to a free trade agreement that’s been a disaster for our nation’s industrial base. - Sharrod Brown"
Immigration.
"It was possible that NAFTA would encourage Mexican citizens to stay in their country since their manufacturing work could still reach the American market easily. But since the creation of NAFTA, illegal immigration between Mexico and the United States has only gotten worse. Over the 10-year period between 1990 and 2000, the number of illegal immigrants per year doubled, or increased two times, despite the creation of NAFTA in 1994, according to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends. NAFTA not being more effective in preventing the immigration crisis is a disadvantage to the agreement."
Language revival
Language revival is people trying to make a language spoken often again when it is not spoken or is spoken very little. Language death happens when a language is not used by the people who used to speak it.
Main battle tank
"A main battle tank (MBT), also called a battle tank, is a tank that is used as the most powerful combat vehicle in modern armies. They were made to replace the light, medium and heavy tanks used in World War II with just one tank. Lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight. Light tanks are still used in places where heavy ones cannot go."
MBT's are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles. They also get help from observation or attack aircraft.
History.
Cold War.
Medium tanks were the earliest MBTs. MBTs started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks. Heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks.
The nuclear weapon threat and other anti-tank weapons in the Cold War made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat. Weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor.
"The British Centurion is generally considered to have been the world’s first main battle tank, although the term was not popularised until long after it entered service. The British followed this up with the Chieftain main battle tank, which entered service in 1966. The first Soviet main battle tank was the T-64 and the first American MBT was the M60 Patton. By the late 1970s, MBT's were manufactured by France, West Germany, Britain, India, Japan, the USSR, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States."
The Soviet Union made MBTs very quickly because it needed them for their type of war. The Soviet Union improved the cannon by replacing the loader crewman with an automatic autoloader. This made the turret smaller which also makes the tank harder to see or hit The Soviet Union made missiles that could be shot much farther than other ammunition.
Gulf War.
"After the Cold War, American tanks quickly defeated Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War. The American MBTs were still not as good as attack helicopters at destroying Iraqi tanks. Some people said that the MBTs could not stop an enemy force from attacking."
Swami Vivekananda
"Vivekananda (Shami Bibekānondo) (January 12, 1863–July 4, 1902) was the chief disciple of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta (Bengali: নরেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত). He was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophy of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century."
"Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with ""Sisters and Brothers of America"". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893."
Vivekananda talked about Jnana Yoga in one of his discourses—
"""“ The Mahabharata is an epic that most Indians know. Let me give you a summary through Vyasa’s initial shloka. This shloka holds the entire summary of this gigantic epic. The shloka is given in the initial of the Vyasa’s texts itself which says-"""
"The Hastinapur (Duryodhana) is an old tree of spirituality, the incarnation of all virtues, i.e Vrisha Karna is its trunk, king Dhritarashtra and Bhishma are its roots, Drona, Dushashana and Kauravas are its branches, the evil Shakuni is its blooming flower and I myself Krishna Dwaipayana along with Narada and saptarishis are its twigs. Indraprastha (Yudhisthira) is a new tree of righteousness, Krishna is its trunk, Sages and Brahmins are its roots, Bhima and Arjuna are its branches, Nakul and Sahdev are its twigs, Vrishaketu is its fruit."
"""I would also like to narrate you interpretation of shlokas by sage Bhasa whose writings and proses included scraps of history, tales and legends. He regarded the त्रिदुष्टम or the 3 evils against the progress of Bharata- evil Indra, Drona and Arjuna. The shloka was written in Sanskrit, translated in Prakrit language. It’s English translation goes like this."""
"The great Aryavartha shall never go on the path of progress if it has evils in this society who discriminate worthy men and who are arrogant in their nature. Ravana too was arrogant through his deeds and his name vanished away from history forever. The त्रिसदुष्टम- Arjuna, his arrogant preceptor Drona and his evil father Indra are an allegory of discrimination and Kshatriya arrogance of the society. There will always be domination-discrimination, arrogance and the त्रिदुष्टम in every society, consider it a rule of the nature but for every त्रिदुष्टम, there will be a heroic Karna to shatter this arrogance and dominance, and shall attain great fame and name in world."
"In his youth he visited the ramakrishna Samaj and later he came in contact with Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna initiated him, and after his death Narendranath left his house and went on to found the Ramkrishna movement."
Vivekananda's mission.
"Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions."
Ashford Black Marble
"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of dark limestone, which was mined from Ashford-in-the-Water, in Derbyshire, England. Once cut, turned and polished, its shiny black surface becomes very beautiful. Strictly speaking, Ashford Black Marble is not a marble formed by heat, but a smooth sedimentary rock, a hard mass of dusty minerals. To make art objects, Ashford Black Marble can be cut as materials of them and put together with other fine stones. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
History.
Ashford Black Marble had been used for decorative purpose since the prehistoric age. Bess of Hardwick was known to use Ashford Black Marble.
"Henry Watson played important roles in the development of the local industry of inlaying Ashford Black Marble in the 1750s. He was the uncle of Derbyshire geologist White Watson, and had a water-powered mill at Ashford in the Water."
"Pots, obelisks, and other decorative items of AMB were frequently traded during the late 18th and early 19th century. John Mawe had a museum in Matlock Bath that dealt in black marble. Ann Rayner carved Black Marble into pictures using a diamond. Many art objects of Ashford Black Marble are collected in local institutions, including those of Derby Museum, Buxton Museum, and Chatsworth House. In 2009, huge blocks of Ashford Black Marble were found underground in Derby. The auction of these was planed because these blocks are valuable. The rocks might have been abandoned when an ""Ashford Black Marble"" manufacturer moved in the 1880s."
Geology.
"Sometimes a mass will change to energy. Common examples of elements that make these changes we call radioactivity are radium and uranium. An atom of uranium can lose an ""alpha particle"" (the atomic nucleus of helium) and become a new element with a lighter nucleus. Then that atom will emit two electrons, but it will not be stable yet. It will emit a series of alpha particles and electrons until it finally becomes the element Pb or what we call lead. By throwing out all these particles that have mass it has made its own mass smaller. It has also produced energy."
"In most radioactivity, the entire mass of something does not get changed to energy. In an atomic bomb, uranium is transformed into krypton and barium. There is a slight difference in the mass of the resulting krypton and barium, and the mass of the original uranium, but the energy that is released by the change is huge. One way to express this idea is to write Einstein's equation as:"
E = (muranium – mkrypton and barium) c2
"The c2 in the equation stands for the speed of light squared. To square something means to multiply it by itself, so if you were to square the speed of light, it would be 299,792,458 meters per second, times 299,792,458 meters per second, which is approximately"
(3•108)2 =
(9•1016 meters2)/seconds2=
"90,000,000,000,000,000 meters2/seconds2"
So the energy produced by one kilogram would be:
"E = 1 kg • 90,000,000,000,000,000 meters2/seconds2"
"E = 90,000,000,000,000,000 kg meters2/seconds2"
or
"E = 90,000,000,000,000,000 joules"
or
"E = 90,000 terajoule"
"About 60 terajoules were released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima. So about two-thirds of a gram of the radioactive mass in that atomic bomb must have been lost (changed into energy), when the uranium changed into krypton and barium."
BEC.
"The idea of a Bose-Einstein condensate came out of a collaboration between S. N. Bose and Prof. Einstein. Einstein himself did not invent it but, instead, refined the idea and helped it become popular."
Zero-point energy.
The concept of zero-point energy was developed in Germany by Albert Einstein and Otto Stern in 1913.
"Momentum, mass, and energy."
"In classical physics, momentum is explained by the equation:"
where
"When Einstein generalized classical physics to include the increase of mass due to the velocity of the moving matter, he arrived at an equation that predicted energy to be made of two components. One component involves ""rest mass"" and the other component involves momentum, but momentum is not defined in the classical way. The equation typically has values greater than zero for both components:"
where
There are two special cases of this equation.
"A photon has no rest mass, but it has momentum. (Light reflecting from a mirror pushes the mirror with a force that can be measured.) In the case of a photon, because its m0 = 0, then:"
"The energy of a photon can be computed from its frequency ν or wavelength λ. These are related to each other by Planck's relation, E = hν = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant (6.626×10−34 joule-seconds). Knowing either frequency or wavelength, you can compute the photon's momentum."
"In the case of motionless particles with mass, since p = 0, then:"
which is just
"Therefore, the quantity ""m0"" used in Einstein's equation is sometimes called the ""rest mass."" (The ""0"" reminds us that we are talking about the energy and mass when the speed is 0.) This famous ""mass-energy relation"" formula (usually written without the ""0""s) suggests that mass has a large amount of energy, so maybe we could convert some mass to a more useful form of energy. The nuclear power industry is based on that idea."
"Einstein said that it was not a good idea to use the classical formula relating momentum to velocity, p = mv, but that if someone wanted to do that, he would have to use a particle mass m that changes with speed:"
"In this case, we can say that E = mc2 is also true for moving particles."
Plural ignorance
"Plural ignorance or pluralistic ignorance is a term which gives a name to a situation where a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but at the same time, they assume incorrectly that most others accept it. The term describes a context in which ""no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes."""
A context of plural ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network.
A situation of plural ignorance develops when each individual decision-maker in a group of decision-makers does not have the necessary information to solve a problem.
History.
"The term ""pluralistic ignorance"" was coined by Daniel Katz and Floyd H. Allport in 1931."
"Plural ignorance may partially explain why people are more likely to intervene in an emergency situation when alone than when other persons are present. If people monitor the reactions of others in such a situation, they may conclude from the inaction of others that other people think that it is not necessary to act."
Millionaire Hot Seat
"Millionaire Hot Seat is an Australian television game show. It is a spin-off of the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". It first aired on 20 April 2009. It is hosted by Eddie McGuire."
Gameplay.
"Six players compete for a prize of $1,000,000. Players are asked multiple choice questions with four possible answers. Each question has a time limit. The time limit is 15 seconds for the first five questions, 30 seconds for the next five questions, and 45 seconds for the last five. Players have one ""pass"" that they can use. If a player uses a pass, the question goes to the next player in line. That player can not use their pass on the question. If a player answers a question incorrectly, they are removed from the game, go home with nothing, and the top prize is lowered. If a player does not give an answer in the time limit, it is considered a pass. If they can not pass, they are removed from the game."
"If the first player answers the first five questions correctly, they win a $1,000 bonus."
"The game ends when all of the players are removed from the game or the last question is answered. If the question is answered correctly, the player wins the amount of money the question is worth. If it is answered incorrectly, the player goes home with nothing. If the 5th question was answered correctly, they leave with $1,000."
Bathroom cabinet
"A bathroom cabinet (or medicine cabinet) is a cabinet in a bathroom. Most of the time it is located above bathroom sink. The main role of bathroom cabinet is to be place to keep drugs, hygienic equipment and toiletries like toothbrush and perfumes. Having a bathroom cabinet saves a space (it is located above sink which usually is unused space), helps to organize belongings in case of broken pipe or other kind of flooding in the bathroom."
Michel Aflaq
"Michel Aflaq (‎, , 9 January 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, sociologist and Arab nationalist. He is considered to be the principal founder of Ba'athism."
Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)
"The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party (also spelled Ba'th or Baath, ""resurrection"" or ""renaissance""; ""Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-'Arabi Al-Ishtiraki""), also called the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath movement, is a Ba'athist political party headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq. It is one of two parties which formed in 1966 after split of the original Ba'ath Party. They ruled Iraq between 1968 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq."
Ba'athism
"Ba’athism is an ideology which emerged in the Middle East in the twentieth century. It is a revolutionary ideology which stands for Arab nationalism, Pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism and socialism, though the ideology has taken different forms in different countries and periods. Ba’ath (Arabic: بعث) is an Arabic word which translates to ‘’resurrection’’ or ‘’revival’’. This term reflects what the groups and movements behind the ideology strive to accomplish, namely a rebirth of Arab culture, nationalism, values and society. The main thinker and founder of Ba’athism is Michel Aflaq. Due to Aflaq’s efforts Ba’athism has been established in the past in Syria and Iraq."
Origins.
"The emergence of Arab nationalism in the early twentieth century falls in line with the historical developments of the time as well as earlier ideological developments. Among the historical developments, is the Ottoman Empire’s neglect of the Arab region as well as their overusage of the region's agricultural resources during the period of World War I. After the Ottomans, there was the imperialist presence of the French and the British in former Ottoman regions like Syria and Iraq. The combination of being ruled by others as well as the rise of nationalist ideologies across the globe had given rise to Arab nationalism and eventually Ba’athism."
Beliefs.
"Since the first establishment of a Ba’athist party in Syria in the 1940s, there have been a number of different Ba'athist parties and figureheads. The most prominent examples are Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There are different forms of Ba'athism. However, the core principles can be reduced to the writings and ideas of Michel Aflaq. These principles are Arab nationalism, revolution, pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism and socialism."
"When Aflaq speaks of (Arab) nationalism in an essay, he describes it as unconditional and even unquestionable love for the Arab nationality. Part of the love for the Arab nationality is to be of “useful service” to the Arab nation. This idea of the Arab citizens’ individual responsibilities and services ties in with the socialist aspects of Ba'athism."
Game Boy Camera
"The Game Boy Camera is an accessory for the Game Boy line of video game consoles. It was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 1998. It allows a person to take 256x224 black and white digital pictures. It is meant to be used with the Game Boy Printer, which uses a special kind of paper to print saved pictures. It can be used with all Game Boy consoles except for the Game Boy Micro. It was the only Nintendo product to allow a person to take pictures until the release of the Nintendo DSi console."
Raebareli district
"Raibareilly is a district of Uttar Pradesh, India."
Game Boy Printer
"The Game Boy Printer is an accessory for the Game Boy line of video game consoles. It was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 1998. It allows a person to print pictures taken with the Game Boy Camera. It can also be used to print images from Game Boy and Game Boy Color games that can be used with it. It uses thermal paper, which is a kind of paper that changes color in heat. It runs on six AA batteries. It can be used with all Game Boy Consoles except for the Game Boy Micro. Like the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, Nintendo stopped making the Game Boy Printer in 2003."
Blast injury
"A blast injury is an injury caused by exposure to an explosive blast. Blast injuries are divided into four main types, with a fifth type for illnesses caused by the blast, and a sixth type for the effects of psychological trauma after the blast such as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)."
Explosions.
"The type of injury and how severe it is depends on different things. This includes the type of explosion, the force of the explosion, the environment where the explosion happens, and how close the person is to the explosion."
An explosion results from the rapid release of energy. Explosions fall into four general categories:
Chemical:
"A chemical explosion is the result of a rapid chemical reaction or change of state which creates a lot of heat and usually gas. There are various types of chemical explosions including natural gas explosions, dust explosions and those caused by explosives."
Explosives are categorized as high-order (HE) explosives or low-order (LE) explosives and they each cause different injury patterns. Only (HE) explosives produce a shock wave.
Mechanical
Electrical
Nuclear
Injury classification.
"Blast injuries are divided into four classes of physical trauma primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. A fifth category, the quinary injuries, are those caused by toxic substances associated with the blast."
Primary injuries.
"Primary injuries are caused by the explosion's shock waves. Air and fluid-filled internal organs are most commonly affected, but the blast wave may also cause external injuries such as traumatic amputation."
"The structures of the internal ears are most often affected by the blast wave, with perforated ear drums the most common injury. The most common fatal injury in victims who survive the initial blast is blast lung. Blast lung can result in pulmonary contusions, bleeding and fluid build-up in the lungs with damage to airways and blood vessels."
Secondary injuries.
"Most casualties in an explosion are caused by secondary blast injuries. These injuries may be caused by fragments of the explosive device and other objects within the blast zone being propelled by the force of the explosion. These objects may strike any part of the body resulting in penetrating trauma. The severity of the penetrating trauma depends to a degree on the size of the object, the depth of penetration, and the part of the body hit."
"Secondary blast injuries are common in deliberate explosions such as those caused by terrorist bombs. The bombs are often designed with objects such as nails, or ball bearings packed in and around the explosive device to act as shrapnel."
"These injuries may also occur in accidental explosions - such as may occur in an industrial accident - when objects in the environment affected by the blast, such as shattered glass take the role of shrapnel."
Tertiary injuries.
"Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries."

Messerschmitt Me 163
The Messerschmitt Me 163 is a German military aircraft used during World War II. It was a rocket-powered aircraft. It was designed by Lippisch.
"The plane weighed 4200 pounds when it was empty and almost 10,000 pounds when it was full. It could fly 560 miles per hour. During the last part of World War II, Messerchmitts fought B-17 bombers over Germany. About 18 B-17s were shot down and about 10 Messerschmitts were shot down."
The fuel the Messerschmitts used sometimes exploded.
Mil Mi-8
The Mil Mi-8 is one of the most famous helicopters built in USSR during the Cold War. It is used for transport and attack by more than 50 countries in the world. It's the basis of Mil Mi-14 and Mil Mi-17 helicopters.
Yellow-bellied glider
"The yellow-bellied glider (""Petaurus australis"") is an arboreal and nocturnal gliding possum. It lives in the native eucalypt forests right down eastern Australia, from northern Queensland to Victoria."
Habitat.
The yellow-bellied glider lives in forests and woodlands in eastern Australia and is found at a range of altitudes from sea level to 1400 metres.
"In North Queensland, the sub-species lives at over 700 m above sea level. There are 13 different populations in three places where this glider lives in North Queensland. One population lives on Mount Windsor Tableland, another on Mount Carbine Tableland, and the third lives in a linear habitat from Atherton to Kirrama on the Atherton Tableland. These three populations together have about 6000 individual gliders. With their habitat in danger, the yellow-bellied glider is classified as uncommon to rare and is named vulnerable to the tropics. This species is more widespread in southern Queensland, NSW and Victoria."
"The yellow-bellied glider is and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other members of the same family. It is also one of the most vocal possum gliders. It has a distinctive growling call that it uses as means of communication. A recording of the distinctive call can be heard at"
"It eats nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen and a wide spread of tree sap."
Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on August 18, 1920, Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution granted American women the right to vote. The amendment marked the end of a long struggle for women in the United States that began in the mid-nineteenth century. The movement, called women's suffrage, marked a radical change in how women were viewed in America. When the Constitution was written, it was accepted that a woman did not have a separate legal identity from her husband. Women's suffrage challenged that concept. The Nineteenth Amendment overturned an earlier decision by the United States Supreme Court in ""Minor v. Happersett"". The Court held that the right to vote, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to all citizens of the United States, did not apply to women. Women were citizens, but did not have the right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent. The bill calling for the amendment was introduced unsuccessfully every year for the next 40 years. Finally, in 1919, Congress approved the amendment and submitted it to the states for ratification. A year later Tennessee gave the final vote needed to add the amendment to the Constitution."
Background.
"In Colonial America, women had fixed gender roles they learned from their mothers. Growing up, a woman was legally subordinate to her father. When she was married she became a ""feme covert"" (French: a married woman). Her property and her legal status transferred to her husband. The intent of this protected-class status was to protect women from the evils men dealt with including politics. In addition, the custom was also used to ban women from professional jobs, higher education, voting, serving on juries and testifying in court. Single women were limited to the jobs of teaching and nursing."
"In 1848, the women's suffrage movement began on a national level. A convention in Seneca Falls, New York was organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott that also demanded a woman's right to vote. Susan B. Anthony, along with other activists, joined Mott and Stanton in forming organizations that demanded the right to vote. Many of the early orgainzers never lived to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment some 70 years later."
"""Leser v. Garnett""."
"When the Nineteenth Amendment became law, it guaranteed the right to vote could not be denied on account of sex. However, it was not the same as women being allowed to vote. The Supreme Court case of ""Leser v. Garnett"" (1922), while not intended to do so, established this right. The plaintiffs challenged the Nineteenth Amendment as being unconstitutional. They argued first, that the amendment was invalid because it increased the electorate without the state of Maryland's consent. They argued secondly that ratification was based on several states that denied women the right to vote in their state constitutions and therefore their legislatures did not have the right to ratify the amendment. The third argument was that the last two states to ratify the amendment, Tennessee and West Virginia, violated their own rules of procedure."
"In a unanimous decision, the court rejected all three arguments. The first argument is invalid because wording was almost the same as the Fifteenth Amendment. Each used the same method of adoption so one cannot be valid and the other invalid. The second argument, that certain state legislatures did not have the power to ratify based on their own constitutions, is rejected because they were ratifying an amendment to the federal Constitution, and so is a federal function. The Court ruled the third argument a moot point because two other states after Tennessee and West Virginia (Connecticut and Vermont) who followed their own procedures would have been enough to ratify the amendment. But in addressing the substance of the argument, the Court went on to point out that the Secretaries of State of Tennessee and West Virginia each accepted the ratification by the legislatures making the ratification by those two states valid. The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote but ""Lesser"" made it certain the right could be used even in states where the state constitution did not allow it."
Ken Adam
History.
"After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Hidaka Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869."
"In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Hidaka Province were reformed in the 1870s."
"In 1882, Hidaka and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."
Burke and Hare murders
"The Burke and Hare murders (or West Port murders) were serial murders in Edinburgh, Scotland, from November 1827 to 31 October 1828."
"The murders were done by Irish immigrants William Burke and William Hare. They sold the corpses of their 17 victims to Dr Robert Knox. Knox was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the Conservator of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy in Edinburgh. He was a teacher of human anatomy to Edinburgh medical students, so needed bodies for his students to dissect."
"The murderer's accomplices included Burke's mistress, Helen McDougal, and Hare's wife, Margaret Laird. From their method of killing their victims has come the word ""burking"", meaning to purposefully smother and, more generally, to quietly suppress."
The Resurrectionists.
"From 1826 to 1840 Knox ran Barclay's anatomy school in Surgeon's Square, Edinburgh. He was the most popular lecturer on anatomy in Scotland, but his class were always short of bodies to dissect."
"Before the Anatomy Act of 1832 widened the supply, the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. This led to a shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection. The shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell."
"In his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since – after 1815 – the Royal Colleges had increased the study of anatomy in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as ‘French method’ the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil. As a consequence, body-snatching became so common that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body before and after burial, to stop it being taken."
"In November 1827 William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid £7.10/- (seven pounds &amp; ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox. Now Burke and his accomplice Hare set about murdering tramps and drunks on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, in what became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 Burke and Hare were caught. The whole city were convulsed with horror, fed by ballads, broadsides and newspapers, at the terrible deeds of Burke &amp; Hare. Hare turned King's evidence, and Burke was hanged, dissected and displayed."
"Knox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob, and windows were broken. A committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh cleared him of blame, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many were wary of him."
Discovery and trial.
The last victim was Marjory Campbell Docherty. Burke lured her into the lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty. He had to wait to kill her because the lodgers James and Ann Gray were present. The Grays left for the night and neighbours heard the sounds of a struggle.
"The next day Ann Gray, who had returned, became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When the Grays were left alone in the house, they checked the bed and found Docherty's body under it. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week. They refused."
"Burke and Hare had removed the body from the house before the police arrived. However, under questioning, Burke claimed that Docherty had left at 7:00 a.m., while McDougal claimed that she had left in the evening. The police arrested them. An anonymous tip-off led them to Knox's classroom where they found Docherty's body, which James Gray identified. William and Margaret Hare were arrested soon there after. The murder spree had lasted twelve months."
Kronberger 61
"Kronberger 61, also known as the ""soccer ball"", is a Nebula discovered by an amateur astronomer in January 2011. Newer images of this nebula were taken by the Gemini Observatory. The nebula was discovered by Austrian Mattias Kronberger, a member of the amateur group ""Deep Sky Hunters"". They found it while searching near the northern constellation of Cygnus."
Australian Aboriginal mythology
"Australian Aboriginal myths, also known as Dreamtime stories and Songlines, are the stories traditionally performed and told by the indigenous people of Australia. Each of the language groups across Australia has its own stories."
All the myths explain important features and meanings within each Aboriginal group's local landscape. They give cultural meaning to the Australian physical landscape. People who know these stories have access to the wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back beyond the reach of memory.
"David Horton wrote in the ""Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia"" that:"
"""A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else."""
"""Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories."""
"Australian Aboriginal myths have been described as parts of a catechism, a liturgical manual, a history of civilization, a geography textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of the world and the universe."
Antiquity.
"An Australian linguist, R. M. W. Dixon, collected many Aboriginal myths in their original languages. He discovered some landscape details in myths were the same as scientific discoveries being made about the same landscapes. For example, on the Atherton Tableland, myths tell of the origins of Lake Eacham, Lake Barrine, and Lake Euramo. Geologists have dated the volcanic explosions which formed the lakes, and were described by Aboriginal myth tellers, as having happened more than 10,000 years ago. Pollen fossil sampling from the bottom of the craters agrees with the Aboriginal myth-tellers' story. When the craters were formed, the area was eucalyptus forest, not the current wet tropical rain forests."
History.
"Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the Han Empire conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but the Chinese writing system was adopted for official purposes in 1010. Vietnamese began to use Chinese characters to write in their own language at about this time. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, is the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. Nguyen Thuyen composed Nôm poetry in the 13th century. However, none of his work has survived. The oldest surviving Nôm text is the collected poetry of King Tran Nhan Tong, written in the 13th century. Many Nôm documents were destroyed by the Chinese during the Ming occupation of 1407-1428. Nguyen Trai (1380–1442) wrote both Chinese and Nôm literature in the 15th century. Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc, consort of King Le Than Tong, is credited with a 24,000-character bilingual Chinese-to-Vietnamese dictionary written in the 17th century."
"Unlike Chinese, Nôm was not studied or classified systematically for most of its history. Vietnamese authors who had studied Chinese applied the principles of Chinese writing to their native language. Although official records were generally kept in Chinese, Nôm was used under two short-lived dynasties, the Ho dynasty (1400-1407) and the Tay Son (1778–1802). King Minh Mang (1820-1841) opposed literacy and the use of Nôm. In 1838, Jean-Louis Taberd wrote a Nôm dictionary that eventually gained general acceptance and wide circulation. In 1867, Catholic scholar Nguyen Truong To petitioned King Tu Duc to replace Classical Chinese with Nôm in official usage. The king did not consent to this, but he did respond with various efforts to promote Nôm. A decree was issued entitled ""Please respect ""quốc âm"" [the national voice]."""
"In the 19th century, there was a flowering of popular literature written in Nôm, including such classics as Nguyen Du's ""The Tale of Kieu"" and the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong. Although only 3 to 5 percent of the population was literate, nearly every village had someone who could read Nôm aloud for the benefit of other villagers."
"In Korea and Japan, the traditional writing system was simplified so it could be taught to the general public. Vietnam's educated class looked down on Nôm as inferior to Chinese, so it was not interested in doing the work required to simplify and standardize the system so that it could be used for mass communication."
"Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. It has nearly 5,000 distinct syllables, far more than other East Asian language do. Phonetic scripts used elsewhere, including hangul in Korea and kana in Japan, do not indicate tone, so they cannot be applied to the Vietnamese language. As in Chinese, a semantic meaning is attributed to every syllable. This characteristic of the language may be can considered a result of the traditional writing system."
"Beginning in the late 19th century, the French colonial authorities promoted the use of the Vietnamese alphabet, which they viewed as a stepping stone toward learning French. Language reform in other Asian nations stimulated Vietnamese interest in the subject. Following the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, Japan was often cited as a model for Asian modernization. Nationalists embraced the alphabet as ""quốc ngữ"" (the national language), and as a tool for promoting literacy. The Confucian education system was compared unfavorably to the Japanese system of public education. Nationalist writer Phan Boi Chau encouraged the young to ""study in the East,"" meaning Japan."
"The popularity of Hanoi's short-lived Tonkin Free School suggested that broad reform was possible. In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a ""Franco-Vietnamese curriculum,"" which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The teaching of Sino-Vietnamese characters was discontinued in 1917. On December 28, 1918, King Khai Dinh declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status. The civil service exam was given for the last time at the imperial capital of Hue on January 4, 1919. This exam tested knowledge of Chinese. The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years. China itself abandoned Classical Chinese soon afterward as part of the May Fourth Movement."
"In the 1920s, the Vietnamese alphabet became the country’s dominant writing system. By the 1930s, the use of Sino-Vietnamese characters was largely restricted to books with limited woodbock printings intended for the Buddhist clergy. In more recent times, the traditional characters have been used mainly in calligraphy, such as wedding decorations. In 2012, manuscripts in Classical Chinese were translated to support Vietnam's claim to the Paracel Islands."
Most common characters.
The following are the twenty five most common characters in Nôm literature. The modern spelling is given in italics.
Fonts.
Some characters in this article may require the installation of an additional font to display properly:
Dio Chrysostom
"Dio Chrysostom (; ""Dion Chrysostomos""), Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus (c. 40 – c. 115 AD) was a Greek speaker, writer, philosopher and historian of the Roman Empire. He lived in the 1st century, from about the year 40 to around the year 115. He is also known as Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus. Eighty of his ""Discourses"" (or ""Orations"") are known. A few Letters and a funny mock essay In Praise of Hair, as well as a few other fragments also survive. His surname ""Chrysostom"" comes from the Greek ""chrysostomos"", which literally means ""golden-mouthed"". He should not be confused with the Roman historian Cassius Dio, nor with the 4th-century bishop John Chrysostom of Constantinople."
Cauchy's integral formula
"In mathematics, Cauchy's integral formula is a central statement in complex analysis. The statement is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk. The statement also provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, ""differentiation is equivalent to integration"": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result denied in real analysis."
"Magdalen College, Oxford"
"Magdalen College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. The Bishop of Winchester, William of Waynflete, founded the college in 1458. The full name of the college is ""The President and Fellows of the College of St. Mary Magdalene in the University of Oxford""."
"At dawn on May Day, the College choir sings hymns from the top of the Magdalen Tower. Large crowds gather each year on Magdalen Bridge to hear the choir."
"Mansfield College, Oxford"
"Mansfield College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1838 as Spring Hill College in Birmingham. Spring Hill College moved to Oxford in 1886. At that time it was renamed Mansfield College, in honor of its largest donors, George and Elizabeth Mansfield. The college's main building was designed by Basil Champneys, and was completed in 1889."
"The first female student at Mansfield was admitted in 1913. In 1955, Mansfield was named a Permanent Private Hall at Oxford University. In 1995, Mansfield was granted a Royal Charter making it a full member of the University."
Chlöe Howl
"Chlöe Howl (born 4 March 1995) is an English singer. On 4 March 2013, her first extended play ""Rumor"" was released for free download. In June 2013, she released the video for her first single ""No Strings"". She released her second extended play ""No Strings"" on August 23. ""No Strings"" was played in the movie ""Kick-Ass 2""."
Howl was nominated for BBC's Sound of 2014 prize on 3 December 2013.
"On 5 December 2013, was nominated for the 2014 BRITs Critics' Choice Award."
Manic Street Preachers
"Manic Street Preachers (often referred to as the Manics) are an alternative rock band from Blackwood, Wales, formed in 1986. They are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Their biggest success was during the 1990s."
"The band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead."
"The Manics released their debut album ""Generation Terrorists"" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken"
"invective and songs about ""culture, alienation, boredom and despair"" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words ""4 REAL"" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's ""The Holy Bible"" showed the result of Edwards' instability."
"Following Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire kept with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success. They became one of Britain's top rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album ""This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours"" and the singles ""If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"" (1998) and ""The Masses Against The Classes"" (2000). They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, ""Journal For Plague Lovers"", was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance."
"In 2010 their tenth album ""Postcards from a Young Man"" was released. Their eleventh album ""Rewind the Film"" was released on 16 September 2013. Their next album ""Futurology"" is going to be released in 2014."
Turnstile
"A turnstile, also called a baffle gate, is a type of gate. It only allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to make one-way traffic of people. It can also make passage only to people who put in a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. A turnstile can be used for paid access (sometimes called a faregate when used for this). For example, it can be used in public transport as a ticket barrier or at a pay toilet."
"Turnstiles are used at a variety of places. This includes stadiums, amusement parks, museums, and mass transit stations."
Toroid (geometry)
"A toroid is a geometric shape that resembles a torus. A toroid is constructed by rotating a geometrical shape around an axis which is outside the shape. If this is done to a circle, a torus results."
Ashburys railway station
"Ashburys railway station in Openshaw serves Beswick and West Gorton in Manchester, England. It is located on the Manchester-Glossop Line at its junction with the branch line to and and the freight-only line to Phillips Park Junction (on the Huddersfield Line)."
Regional casino
"A Regional Casino, more commonly known as a Super Casino (or occasionally known as Mega Casino), is the term given to the largest category of casino that was to have been permitted under UK law. It is meant to be the same size as the larger casinos in Las Vegas. The first Regional Casino was proposed to be in the City of Manchester. This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom."
History.
"The Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England. Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of 'destination casinos' in the style of Las Vegas, commonly referred to in the media as 'Super Casinos'"
"Initial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size, referred to as a 'Regional Casino', with a further eight 'large' and eight 'small' casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits."
"Prior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK, the largest of which in Star City, Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres. Customers were required to register twenty-four hours prior to gaming."
Definition of casino types.
"Under the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino, with reference to any matter he or she chooses; although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number, location and concentration of gaming tables, and the floor area designated for a specific purpose."
Definitions have been determined such that the 'super casino' will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited-jackpot slot machines.
'Large casinos' will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of £4000.
"The 'small casinos' will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres, up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of £4000."
The shortlist.
"In May 2006, a short-list of eight sites, selected from various ones submitted by local councils, was announced for the location of the Regional Casino. These were:"
"On 30 January 2007 it was announced that the first Regional Casino would be built in East Manchester near the City of Manchester Stadium. This was a shock to the Blackpool and The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome) bids. Both of them were thought of as the favourites. However, the Blackpool bid organisers pledged to continue the work in getting government approval for a 'supercasino'."
"The ""evolutionary tree"" shows the relationships among various biological groups. It includes data from DNA, RNA and protein analysis."
"Tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy, and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research. Below is a simplified version of present-day understanding."
Precursors.
Lamarck.
"Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his ""Philosophie Zoologique"" (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex."
Hitchcock.
"The American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1763–1864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his ""Elementary Geology"". On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and animal trees are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. However, they were not ""evolutionary"" trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change."
Vestiges.
"The first edition of Robert Chambers' ""Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation"" was published anonymously in 1844. It contained a tree-like diagram in the chapter 'Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms'. It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M)."
"In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: ""there may be branching"".p191"
Darwin's tree of life.
"Charles Darwin (1809–1882) was the first to produce an evolutionary tree of life. He was very cautious about the possibility of reconstructing the history of life. In ""On the Origin of Species"" (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large genus (see figure)."
"In Darwin's own words: ""Thus, the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera."""
"This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later."
"In his summary to the section as revised in the 6th edition of 1872, Darwin explains his views on the Tree of Life:"
The tree of life today.
"The model of a tree is still considered valid for eukaryotic life forms. Research into the earliest branches of the eukaryote tree suggests a tree with either four supergroups, or two supergroups. There does not yet appear to be a consensus; in a review article, Roger and Simpson conclude that ""with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution""."
"Biologists now recognize that the prokaryotes, the bacteria and archaea have the ability to transfer genetic information between unrelated organisms through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Recombination, gene loss, duplication, and gene creation are a few of the processes by which genes can be transferred within and between bacterial and archaeal species, causing variation that is not due to vertical transfer."
There is emerging evidence of HGT occurring within the prokaryotes at the single and multicell level and the view is now emerging that the tree of life gives an incomplete picture of life's evolution. It was a useful tool in understanding the basic processes of evolution but cannot explain the full complexity of the situation.
Three's Company
Three's Company is an American situation comedy. It aired on the ABC network. It began in March 1977 and ended in September 1984.
"The show is a remake of the British sitcom ""Man About the House"". Nowadays the domestic distribution rights are handled by creator Don L. Taffner's estate and the international rights are handled by FremantleMedia (whose company Thames originated the sitcom ""Man About the House"")."
"The show is set in Santa Monica, California. It is about a man pretending to be gay so his landlord won't evict him, it is also about financial struggling such as the roommates not being able to pay their rent. The sitcom heavily relies on innuendo and sexy misunderstandings. It is also a comedy of errors. The show had two spinoffs also based on Britcoms: ""The Ropers"" (""George &amp; Mildred"") &amp; ""Three's a Crowd"" (""Robin's Nest"")."
"The series was later the subject of the made-for-TV movie """". The movie showed how cast changes led to the show ending."
Filmation
"Filmation Associates or Filmation Studios was an American production company that produced animated television series and live action programming during the late 20th century. Founded in 1963, the company was in Reseda, California."
Theriodont
"Theriodonts are a major group of therapsids. They are a clade which include not only the traditional theriodonts, but also their descendants the mammals as well (in the same way that theropod dinosaurs include the birds as a sub-clade)."
"They can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of Synapsida that lived from the Middle Permian to the Middle Cretaceous. Theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago, in the Middle Permian. Even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their relatives."
The first plot theme is the Devil in modern Moscow; the second is the story of Pontius Pilate.
Plot line A.
"1930s Moscow is visited by Satan in the guise of ""Professor"" Woland or Voland (Воланд). This mysterious magician of uncertain origin arrives with a retinue."
"The group causes havoc in the literary elite, especially its trade union, . is a Soviet-style abbreviation for the ""Moscow Association of Writers"" or ""Literature for the Masses"". Targets are Massolit's posh HQ, corrupt social-climbers and their women (wives and mistresses alike), bureaucrats and profiteers and, more generally, skeptical unbelievers in the human spirit."
Plot line B.
"The second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, described by Woland talking to Berlioz and later echoed in the pages of the Master's novel. It concerns Pontius Pilate's trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus the Nazarene). Pilate recognises an affinity and spiritual need for Yeshua. There follows his reluctant but resigned submission to Yeshua's execution."
"Linking plots A and B are the rather sympathetic characters of Berlioz, Pontius Pilate and Ivan Ponyryov, a young, aspiring poet whose pen name (Bezdomny) means ""homeless""."
"Berlioz is the head of . Berlioz brushes off Woland's prophecy of his death, only to have it come true just pages later in the novel. Ivan, the young poet ""Homeless"", tries to chase and capture the gang and warn of their evil. This lands him in a lunatic asylum, where he meets the Master (named Faust in the drafts and margins of the manuscript, but never in the finally published version). Led to despair by the rejection of his novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ, the Master burns his manuscript and turns his back on the ""real"" world, including his devoted lover, Margarita."
Part two.
"Connecting these two themes are Satan himself, and the Master with his devoted lover Margarita. The Master is an embittered author, whose historical novel about Pontius Pilate had been rejected by the Soviet literary committee ."
"Part Two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to despair of her lover or his work. She is invited to the Devil's midnight ball, where Satan (Woland) offers her the chance to become a witch with supernatural powers. This coincides with the night of Good Friday: the Master's novel also deals with this same spring full moon when Christ's fate is sealed by Pontius Pilate and he is crucified in Jerusalem. All three events in the novel are linked by this."
"Margarita enters naked into the realm of night. She flies over the deep forests and rivers of the USSR. She bathes, and returns with Azazello, her escort, to Moscow as the anointed hostess for Satan's great Spring Ball. Standing by his side, she welcomes the dark celebrities of human history as they arrive from Hell."
"She survives this ordeal without breaking, and for her pains, Satan offers to grant Margarita her deepest wish. Margarita selflessly chooses to liberate a woman whom she met at the ball. Satan grants her first wish and offers her another, saying the first wish was unrelated to Margarita's own desires. For her second wish, she chooses to liberate the Master and live in poverty-stricken love with him."
"The Master and Margarita, for not having lost their faith in humanity, are granted peace but are denied light – that is, they will spend eternity together in a shadowy yet pleasant region, having not earned the glories of Heaven, but not deserving the punishments of Hell. As a parallel to the Master and Margarita's freedom, Pontius Pilate is also released from his eternal punishment."
History of its writing and publication.
"Bulgakov started writing the novel in 1928. He burnt the first manuscript of the novel in 1930, seeing no future as a writer in the Soviet Union. The work was restarted in 1931. The second draft was completed in 1936 by which point all the major plot lines of the final version were in place. The third draft was finished in 1937. Bulgakov continued to polish the work, aided by his wife, but was forced to stop work on the fourth version four weeks before his death in 1940."
"A censored version (12% of the text removed and still more changed) of the book was first published in ""Moscow"" magazine (#11, 1966 and #1, 1967). The text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was published on a samizdat basis. In 1967 the publisher ""Posev"" (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts."
"In the Soviet Union, the first complete version, prepared by Anna Saakyants, was published in 1973, based on the version of the beginning of 1940 proofread by the publisher. In 1989 the last version was prepared by literature expert Lidiya Yanovskaya based on all available manuscripts."
English translations.
"There are quite a few published English translations of ""The Master and Margarita"", including:"
"The early translation by Glenny runs more smoothly than the modern translations. Some Russian-speaking readers consider it to be the only one creating the desired effect, though it may take liberties with the text. As an example, Glenny's translations leaves out Bulgakov's ""crucial"" reference to the devil in Berlioz's thought:"
"Several literary critics have hailed the Burgin/Tiernan O’Connor translation as the most accurate and complete English translation. There are matching annotations by Bulgakov's biographer, Ellendea Proffer. However, these judgements came before the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky."
"A graphic novel, an adaption by Andrzej Klimowski and Danusia Schejbal, published by Self Made Hero in 2008 provides a fresh visual translation/interpretation."
In other media.
"The novel has been the basis of films, stage productions, opera, ballet, and television versions."
Padmashali
"Padmashali () or Padma Bramhana is a Hindu Bramhin in origin,and took up artisan tasks are predominantly found in South Indian States. Padmashali Bhargava Brahmins are Rugvedi Brahmins. The community members are traditionally weavers specialised in making clothes of all kinds. They engage as priests Brahmins for performing all rites and rituals and also perform services as temple Priests for other castes."
Origin.
"The term ""Padmashali"" is derived from two words ""Padma"" and ""Shali"", The Padma means lotus and Shali means weaver. They support their Sanskrit origin with various myths and ""Puranas"" such as ""Kulapurana"" and ""Markandeya Purana""."
"The Padmashalis claim to be descendants from ""Bhrigu Rishi"" and ""Markandeya Rishi"", Markandeya's son ""Bhavana Rishi"" who were born one hundred and one son; they took to weaving and the first clothes they wore was out of the fibres of the lotus stem so they came to be known as ""Padmashalis""."
Padmashalis Today.
"Service animals are animals that have been trained to do things to help people with disabilities. Service animals may also be called assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals, depending on the country and what the animal does."
Types.
There are three basic types of assistance animals:
"In the United States, as of the 2011 changes to Americans with Disabilities Act regulation only dogs may be used as service animals for the purposes of going to public places. However, in certain situations miniature horses are supposed to be accommodated the same as service animals that are dogs. The U.S. government does not recognize a right to use any other species as an assistance animal in public places where pets would not be permitted except on commercial aircraft."
Dogs.
"Dogs can be trained to do many different things to help owners with physical disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:"
"Dogs can also be trained to help owners with psychiatric (mental health) disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:"
"These are just examples of some of the things service dogs can do. Service dogs can also be trained to do many, many more things for people with all kinds of disabilities."
Miniature horses.
Miniature horses are horses that are usually less than three feet tall. They can be trained to:
"An owner might choose a miniature horse as a service animal because they are allergic to dogs, or because their religion says that dogs are unclean. Miniature horses can also live and work for about 30 years, much longer than a service dog."
Capuchin monkeys.
"Are not allowed in buildings with a ""no animal"" policy. They may be used at home or outside where any animal is allowed, but under the 2011 ADA revision, only canines and in some cases miniature horses, are legally recognized as public access service animals."
"Capuchin monkeys can be trained to do things with their hands, like:"
"Helper monkeys can be helpful to people who have trouble with using their hands and arms, like people with quadriplegia, very bad spinal cord injuries, very bad injuries to their hands and arms, and multiple sclerosis."
"Helper monkeys are usually raised in a human home as infants. Then they get years of training, usually in schools by private organizations. On average, they take 7 years to train. They are usually able to serve as helper monkeys for 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a service dog)."
"Not everyone agrees that monkeys should be service animals. Debbie Leahy, manager of captive wildlife protection for the Humane Society of the United States, says that monkeys are not real service animals and that sometimes they are abused during their training."
"In the United States, helper monkeys are also not counted as service animals under most laws."
Animals which cannot be service animals.
"If an animal has not been trained to do a job or task that will help a person with a disability, it cannot be a service animal."
"Some people with mental health problems, like anxiety or PTSD, use different kinds of animals to give them comfort (make them feel better) when they are upset. These animals are called ""comfort animals"" (or ""Emotional Support Animals"")."
"Some people use unusual comfort animals, like snakes, tarantulas, guinea pigs, turtles, and rats. Even if having the animal makes the owner feel better, these animals cannot be service animals because it is impossible to train them to do something to help a person with a disability."
"Even if a comfort animal is a dog or a miniature horse, being a comfort animal is not the same as being a service animal. Comfort animals make their owners feel better just by being there. A service animal is trained to recognize that there is a problem and do the job they were trained to do to help their owner. For example, a psychiatric service dog would recognize that its owner is feeling upset and do a specific job, like get medicine, get help, or distract the person, to help them."
Laws in the United States.
"In the United States, service animals have some protection under the law. Different laws set rules about service animals in different situations. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service animals in public places. Other laws, for example, control which service animals are allowed in housing. But these different laws do not agree on what counts as a service animal."
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
"In 1990, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its goal was to protect the rights of people with disabilities. At first, it mentioned only guide dogs as service animals. Since then, it has been changed to include more protections. It now defines a service animal as any ""dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities."""
"This means that only dogs count as service animals under the ADA. However, there is a special section in the new ADA about miniature horses. This section says that places covered by the ADA (like businesses) should allow miniature horses ""where reasonable."" To decide whether allowing a miniature horse into a place is ""reasonable,"" those places are allowed to use four questions:"
"If the answer to all four questions is ""yes,"" the place needs to let the miniature horse in, and treat it like a service animal."
"Other than service dogs and service miniature horses, no other type of assistance animal is protected under the ADA."
Protections for service animals.
"Under the ADA, it is illegal to refuse to let a service animal or its owner into:"
"San Sebastián Street Festival, also known as “San Se”, is a very popular Puerto Rican festivity that takes place in the Old San Juan. It is a four-day event that starts the third Thursday of January through Sunday. This festive is in honor of Saint Sebastian. January 20th is the day that Catholic Church celebrates the life of this Saint. More than 200,000 people participate in this festival, making this activity be recognized internationally. Also, some Puerto Ricans have started this festive in the United States. Also they celebrate the Rivera Family, next year Paris Rivera will be the starter of the festival."
History.
"Father Juan Manuel Madrazo, the priest of the San José Church in the 1950s, was the first person who organized the festival. The purpose of this festival was to commemorate the life of this Saint and raise money to repair the church. When the father was moved out of San Juan, this festival came to an end. It was not until 1970 when a historian and anthropologist named Ricardo Alegría proposed to Rafaela Balladares de Brito, a resident of San Sebastian street, to revive this tradition. Balladares de Brito with the help of her neighbors began to reorganize the festival and recollect money for an elementary school directed by Sisters of Charity."
First celebrations.
"During the past celebrations, a group of musicians in the early morning of the first days walked and announced the festivity though the street. People in costumes of Spanish Kings, Queen Isabel and King Fernando, wear huge mask over their heads and were called “Cabezudos”, also participated in the parade. During the procession, people carried the Saint’s Image from San Sebastian Street and ended at the San José Church. In addition, the neighbors decorated their home’s balcony and the streets. They also prepared typical food, wore dresses and participated as host of the music shows."
Today’s celebrations.
In Puerto Rico.
"In the present, the addition of artisans has acquired more importance, as well as music and dance in the nights. Also, artists perform at different stages localized around the Old San Juan. “Cabezudos” now include characters representing the Puerto Rican folklore that pass through the streets dancing and singing followed by the public. Now, the parade is longer than the past ones and the municipality of San Juan is responsible in organizing the entire festival. Festivities vary year by year, but mainly include the ones mentioned above."
In United States.
"In the recent years, several of San Sebastian Festivals have been celebrated in different areas of Florida and in DFW, Texas. This has been a result of many Puerto Ricans moving to the United States and wanting to maintain a connection with their typical island traditions. The festivals programed in Florida and Dallas, Texas have a duration of one to two days compared to the one celebrated in Puerto Rico which last four days. These festivals also have Puerto Rican food and rums, “Cabezudos”, artisan market, and music."
"In DFW, Texas since January 2018, a group of Puerto Ricans - Traigo esta Trulla, start to organize the first Fiestas de la San Se- DFW with more than 6,000 participants."
Least developed country
A least developed country (LDC) is a country that the United Nations considers to be the least developed out of all the countries in the world. They normally have the lowest ratings on the Human Development Index. The idea to name LDCs started in the late 1960s. The first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in November 1971.
Classification process.
Indicators are used to determine whether a country is a least devleoped country.
"To be considered a least developed country, a country must have high levels of poverty, low human resources and a vulnerable economy. The UN looks at indicators, such as gross national income, nutrition, health, education and literacy. Economic vulnerability is recorded on the Economic Vulnerability Index."
"LDC criteria are reviewed every three years. Countries may stop being considered an LDC when indicators show that they have become developed enough. Since the LDC category was created, four countries have graduated to ""developing country"" status. The first country to do this was Botswana in 1994. The second was Cape Verde, in 2007. Then Maldives in 2011, and Samoa in 2014. It is expected that Equatorial Guinea and Vanuatu will be the next countries to be promoted from LDC status."
", there are 48 least developed countries. There are also three countries which meet the criteria for LDC status, but have asked to not be included in the index: Ghana, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe."
Current list.
"The ""least developed countries"" according to the United Nations:"
Constitutional Convention (United States)
"The Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention) was held from May 25 to September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, it became clear from the beginning that many members, including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, intended to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the United States Constitution. This makes the meeting one of the most significant events in the history of the United States."
Debates.
"Most of the disputes were about the makeup and election of the Senate. Other disagreements concerned how ""proportional representation"" was to be defined (whether to include slaves or other property). They needed to decide whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single president. They also had to work out how to elect the president, how long his term was to be and whether he could stand for reelection. There were issues over what offenses should be impeachable. Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues, while the powers of legislature, executive, and judiciary were not heavily disputed. Once the Convention began, the delegates first agreed on the principles of the Convention, then they agreed on Madison's Virginia Plan and began to modify it. A Committee of Detail assembled during the July 4 recess and produced a rough draft. Most of this rough draft remained in place, and can be found in the final version of the constitution. After the final issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final version, and it was voted on and sent to the states."
The Virginia Plan.
"James Madison had spent the winter of 1787 making a study of various confederations throughout history. He came to Philadelphia armed with a wealth of knowledge and an idea for what the United States government should be. His plan was presented to the Convention by Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia. It became the broad outline of what would be a new government under the U.S. Constitution. His plan called for three branches of government with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from abusing their power. Madison's idea for a legislature had two houses. One would feature members elected by the people for a three-year term. The other would have its members elected by the state legislatures and would serve for 7 years. Both would have the seats determined by the population of the country."
Two more plans.
"After debating the Virginia plan for two weeks, William Patterson presented his plan called variously, the New Jersey Plan, the Patterson Plan and the Small State Plan. It was very similar to the Articles of Confederation and featured a unicameral (one house) legislature. All states would have one vote. He had one idea that was kept; that state laws that ran counter to federal laws would be voided."
A third plan was offered by Alexander Hamilton. It was a copy of the British Constitution. It also was bicameral with an upper house and a legislature in which members served on their good behavior.
A solution.
Ferrari F50
The Ferrari F50 is a sports car made by Ferrari in 1995. It was created to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The car has two doors. It is a two-seated convertible with a removable hardtop. It has a 4.7 L V12 engine that was based on the 3.5 L V12 used in the 1992 Ferrari F92A Formula One car.
"Only 349 Ferrari F50's were made. This was because Ferrari wanted it to be rare. The last F50 was produced in Maranello, Italy in July 1997."
The Ferrari F50 can travel at over 200 miles per hour.
Mass spectrum
"A mass spectrum is an intensity versus ""m/z"" (mass-to-charge ratio) plot that represents a chemical analysis. The mass spectrum of a sample is a pattern representing the distribution of ions by mass (more correctly: mass-to-charge ratio) in a sample. It is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same. It can depend on the operating conditions of the instrument. For example, some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces; others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation. A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment; however, all plots of intensity vs. mass-to-charge are called ""mass spectra""."
Common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the McLafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage.
"In the past, chemists with PhD degrees were needed to interpret mass spectra. Today, computer programs read the data and identify the compounds in a sample."
Stuntman (video game)
"Stuntman is a racing/action video game that was published by Infogrames and Atari. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and the Game Boy Advance systems. The game is also featured as a mobile phone game which could be downloaded. Stuntman was followed by the 2007 sequel, . The game received positive reviews, GameSpot gave it a 8.0 out of 10 and IGN gave it a 8.6 out of 10."
"The game was followed by sequel, called """" released in 2007."
"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"
"""Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"" is a single by Lady Gaga. It appeared on Gaga's debut album ""The Fame"" and was released as a single on January 10, 2009. Its music video references Gaga's Italian heritage. Though the single did not chart in the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the song gold on February 29, 2016, for shipments and streams equal to 500,000 copies there. ""Eh, Eh"" charted in the top ten in France, New Zealand and Sweden."
SN2 reaction
"The SN2 reaction (also known as bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. It is a type of nucleophilic substitution, where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it. This expels another group called a ""leaving group"". So, the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name ""bimolecular nucleophilic substitution"", or ""SN2"". Among inorganic chemists, the SN2 reaction is often known as the ""interchange mechanism""."
Reaction mechanism.
"The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it - 'X' - frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate, and approximately sp2 hybridized. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180° to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C-X σ* antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed."
"If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, this can lead, although not necessarily, to an inversion of stereochemistry, called the Walden inversion."
"In an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of OH− (the nucleophile) on a bromoethane (the electrophile) results in ethanol, with bromide ejected as the leaving group:"
"A SN2 reaction occurs if the backside route of attack is not blocked by other atoms in the molecule (sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate). So, this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon center, the substitution will use an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would also be more likely with blocked molecules because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed.)"
"In coordination chemistry, associative substitution proceeds by a similar mechanism as SN2."
Factors affecting the rate of the reaction.
Four factors affect the rate of the reaction:
Reaction kinetics.
"The rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu−] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX]."
"This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction, the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over. But in a SN2 reaction, the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile. In cases where both mechanisms are possible (for example at a secondary carbon center), the mechanism depends on solvent, temperature, concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group."
SN2 reactions are generally favored in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent. They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance.
"Lillian Lee McKim, nicknamed Lilly, was born on November 10, 1931 in Roslyn, New York. Her father was Robert V. McKim and her mother was Lillian McKim (maiden name Bostwick). She was the middle child, with an older sister named Mary Maude and younger sister named Florence Fitch. Her mother, Lillian, was an heir to the Standard Oil fortune. Lillian divorced Robert and married Ogden Phipps in 1937."
"Lilly went to the Chapin School in New York City, along with Bouvier sister Jacqueline. In 1949, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. She attended the college-finishing school Finch College in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife's assistant in West Virginia and later as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in The Bronx."
"In 1950, she married Peter Pulitzer, the grandson of publisher Joseph Pulitzer. They moved to Palm Beach, where Lilly started her clothing company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau soon after. She legally changed her name to Lillian Rousseau, but her clothing company kept the ""Lilly Pulitzer"" label. Lilly continued to live in Palm Beach. Enrique died from cancer in 1993."
"Lilly has three children from her marriage to Peter: Peter, Minnie, and Liza. Peter lives in Bridgehampton, New York, with his wife, Elise, and five children: Fiona, Caleb, Stefan, Aaron, and Daniella. Liza currently lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, Henry, and three children: Waverly, Hattie and Rayna. Liza is currently helping out in Florida with the Lilly Pulitzer Brand."
Death.
"Pulitzer died on April 7, 2013 in her home in Palm Beach, California from natural causes, at age 81."
Business.
"Lilly and Peter settled in Palm Beach, Florida, shortly after their marriage. Peter owned several Florida citrus groves, and with fruit from the groves Lilly opened a juice stand on Via Mizner, just off Worth Avenue in Palm Beach."
"In the course of working at the juice stand, Lilly found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to hide the juice stains, she designed a sleeveless shift dress made of bright, colorful printed cotton. Lilly found that customers loved her dress, so she made more to sell at her juice stand. Eventually, she was selling more dresses than juice, and decided to focus on making and selling what had become known as her ""Lillys""."
"In 1959, Lilly became president of her own company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. The company's main factory was located in Miami, Florida and the fabrics were produced by the Key West Hand Print Fabrics company in Key West."
"From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Lilly's bright, colorful clothes were very popular, worn by rich people such as First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney families. However, by 1984, Lilly felt she was not having as much fun as she used to and retired, closing down her entire clothing business."
Revival of the brand.
"In 1993, the rights to the Lilly Pulitzer brand were bought by Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. They contacted Lilly with the hopes of bringing back the brand because, ""they just loved Lilly, their mothers and sisters loved Lilly, and they wanted to bring the line back,"" according to Lilly herself. Lilly is not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, but she continues to do things like approve new designs, fabrics, and collections."
"Today, the company has 75 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores (also known as Via Stores), several company-owned retail stores, sells to independently owned stores and is in major department stores such as Bloomingdales, Lord and Taylor, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. On December 21, 2010, Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. was bought by Oxford Industries, Inc."
Products.
"Along with women's clothing, the company also makes men's clothing, children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, bedding (revived in 2010), and stationery. The company started a bridal collection in 2010."
"Lilly Pulitzer has made special collections with sorority prints on them, among them Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, and Delta Zeta. She has held contests on her Facebook page to vote on which sororities will get their own prints."
Cultural impact.
"Lisa Birnbach's humorous ""guides"", ""The Official Preppy Handbook"" and its sequel ""True Prep: It’s a Whole New Old World"", say Lilly Pulitzer clothing is a must-have item for ""preppy"" women."
"The Museum of Lifestyle &amp; Fashion History in Boynton Beach, Florida, ran an exhibit from August 2010 through May 2011 about the clothing and designs of Lilly Pulitzer. Museum director Lori Durante stated ""Lilly Pulitzer fashion is relative to the American experience ... It is relevant to Palm Beach County, to Florida."""
Space Shuttle Columbia disaster
"The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred when broke up when it was reentering the atmosphere on February 1, 2003. The cause of the disaster was that a piece of foam broke from the external fuel tank. This made a hole in the shuttle's wing. During its entry, hot gases entered the wing, causing it to break up. All of the people on board died when it broke up."
"Parts of ""Columbia"" were found across the state of Texas. The cockpit window is now inside the Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida."
Launch &amp; response.
"""Columbia"" launched on its final mission on January 16, 2003. It was ""Columbia""'s 28th flight and the 113th of any Shuttle."
"81 seconds into flight, a briefcase-sized part of the external fuel tank's foam insulation, which stops ice from forming while the very cold liquid fuel is in the tank, broke away and hit ""Columbia"". Such debris strikes had happened before - in particular on STS-27 in which a piece of a booster's forward heat shield broke and hit ""Atlantis""' bottom-side heat shield - and were seen as an acceptable risk. However, this debris strike hit ""Columbia""'s left wing head on, punching a hole through the panels on the wing's forward edge."
"Once high-quality video of the launch was ready, NASA reviewed it and concluded that everything was fine, and stopped engineers from using Department of Defense images from orbit to get a closer look. NASA management thought that even if something were wrong, it would be better for the crew not to know since rescue or repair would be nearly impossible. One flight director contacted ""Columbia"" about the concerns, but stressed ""we have seen this same phenomenon on other flights and there is absolutely no concern for [re-]entry."""
Failed re-entry.
"On February 1, ""Columbia"" prepared to return to Earth on a path that would take it over the USA from west to east. At 8:15 EST, about an hour before ""Columbia"" was due to land, it lit its engines and changed its course so that it would re-enter the atmosphere. A 13-minute video recorded in the cabin, ending eleven minutes before the loss of signal from ""Columbia"", shows the astronauts in good spirits and unaware of the danger. As ""Columbia"" entered the atmosphere, the air heated up around it due to the Shuttle moving at extreme speeds, over twenty times the speed of sound. This air was able to enter the wing through the hole made during launch, melting through it and causing the Shuttle to lose lift on that side. This loss of lift caused the Shuttle to turn away from its re-entry path, tumble, and break up from the drag of the air."
"""Columbia"" passed over California at 8:53. Video shows flashes happening and an unusual trail left behind ""Columbia"", which even hobbyist watchers saw as out of the ordinary. At this point, the temperature of the damaged part of the wing was around 3,000°F (1,650°C). By 8:58 ""Columbia"", still moving at incredible speeds, crossed from New Mexico into Texas, at which point it began shedding debris. By this point several temperature sensors in the damaged left wing had stopped working, and one of the flight controllers reported that the tyre pressure sensors on that side were reporting ""off scale low""- meaning that it is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor, and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning, due to internal or external factors, not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensor's minimum response value."
"The last communication with commander Rick Husband was ""Roger, uh bu-"" at 8:59. 45 seconds later, video from the ground shows ""Columbia"" breaking apart. Mission Control began its disaster procedures at 9:12."
Statistics.
"Between 1789 and December 16, 2014:"
Protected clauses.
Article Five protects two clauses in Article One from being amended until 1808. These clauses are:
"Article Five also puts one absolute limit on Constitutional amendments. It completely protects Section 3, Clause 1 of Article One. This clause says that every state will have the same number of United States Senators. It does not set a time limit on how long this clause is protected for. It just says: ""no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."" As of 1808, when the protections on the other two clauses expired, this is the only limit that the Constitution puts on suggested amendments. Any amendment, about anything else, could be suggested."
Separation of powers.
"Article Five gives all of the power for creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch: the United States Congress and the state legislatures. The President of the United States cannot amend the Constitution. He has no part in the process of changing the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court confirmed this in a 1798 case called ""Hollingsworth v. Virginia"". In its decision, the Court wrote: ""[T]he President ... has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution."" However, the Supreme Court cannot create an amendment either."
"This is an example of the separation of powers (also called ""checks and balances"") that the Founding Fathers built into the new American government. If the President or the Supreme Court could change the Constitution any time they wanted to, they would have too much power. One person (or nine Supreme Court Justices) could make decisions that would affect every American."
Checks and balances in Article Five.
"Instead, the Founders gave the job of creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch. By requiring that two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and three-quarters of the states, approve of every Constitutional amendment, they made sure that there would have to be a lot of debate, compromise, and thought before an amendment was approved. Also, because so many legislators have to approve every amendment, it is very difficult for small ""special interest"" groups (like people who only care about a certain part of the country, or a certain issue) cannot control the vote."
"The Founders even put checks and balances on the Legislative Branch's powers. If Congress gets too powerful, the states can make it call a Constitutional Convention. If the states get too powerful, ordinary Americans can vote on a Constitutional amendment through ratifying conventions. As a legal scholar wrote later: ""The ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment [by ratifying conventions] might be called one of the most democratic moments in American history. ... Almost all voters in America had the unprecedented opportunity to [support] or condemn a federal constitutional amendment directly. ... The conventions ratified the choices of the people without fail.""pp. 27–28"
Importance.
"Almost right away, the amendments process became very important. North Carolina and Rhode Island refused to ratify the Constitution without a Bill of Rights. This meant they would not be a part of the new United States Government. In 1789, James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights. They were ratified together, as the first ten amendments to the Constitution, in 1791. Having a Bill of Rights convinced North Carolina and Rhode Island to ratify the Constitution."
"The amendments process set out in Article Five has allowed for many other important amendments to be added to the Constitution. For example, these amendments have included:"
"If Article Five had made the Constitution too hard to change, African-American people might still be slaves, and women might still not have the right to vote."
Article Two of the United States Constitution
"Article Two of the United States Constitution creates the executive branch of the United States government. The executive branch includes the President; the Vice President; the Cabinet; executive departments, like the Department of State; independent agencies, like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and other things like committees and commissions."
Section 1: President and Vice President.
Clause 1: Executive Power.
"Section One begins by giving federal executive power to the President only. This is part of the separation of powers that the Founding Fathers built into the Constitution. To prevent any part of the government from getting too powerful, they split the power between three branches. This clause gives executive power to the President. Another clause in Article One of the Constitution gives federal legislative (law-making) power to the United States Congress only. A third clause in Article Three gives judiciary power to the federal courts. No branch is allowed to do a job that the Constitution has given to another branch. For example, the President cannot make laws; that is the Legislature's job."
"This clause says the President is the head of the Executive Branch. It also mentions the Vice President, though the Constitution does not give him any executive powers. However, the Constitution does say that the President and Vice President must be elected at the same time, for the same term (amount of time), and by the same constituency. The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure the Executive Branch would survive, and stay independent, if the Vice President had to become the President."
Clause 2: Method of choosing Electors.
"Under the U.S. Constitution, the President and Vice President are chosen by Electors. The Constitution allows each state legislature to decide how they will choose Electors. Since the 1820s, state legislatures have usually chosen Electors through an indirect popular vote. This means that people in the state will get to vote on which Electors they want. The ballot that people use to vote will have the Electors' names on it. Usually, it will also say what Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates they plan to support. This allows the people to choose Electors who support the candidates they like."
"Each state has two United States Senators and a certain number of United States Representatives representing them in Congress. (The number of Representatives depends on how many people live in the state.) Each state gets a number of Electors that is equal to the number of Members of Congress the state has. (For example, if a state has 2 Senators and 10 Representatives, they have 12 total Members of Congress, so they get 12 Electors.)"
"The only people who cannot be Electors are Senators, Representatives, and federal officers. This is meant to make sure that the Electoral College is made up of regular Americans, not politicians."
Clause 3: Electors.
"This clause talks about Electors and how they choose a President. Once they are chosen, the Electors meet in their states to vote for the President and Vice President. Originally, candidates only ran for President; there were no candidates for Vice President. Each Elector voted for two different candidates for President. They had to vote for at least one candidate who did not live in the Elector's home state. The candidate who got more than half of the votes became President. The candidate who got the next highest number of votes (the second-place winner) became Vice President."
This clause gives instructions for several possible problems:
Changes.
The Twelfth Amendment changed this process in a few ways:
Clause 4: Election day.
"The informal economy is that part of economy which is not reported in official statistics such as the gross domestic product of a country. The informal economy is not taxed, and includes the black market. In developing countries over 70% of the people work in this form of economy. They are self-employed, because it is difficult to find an employer to hire them. People working in this form of economy have no social benefits or social security, which are usually only given by the state to those who have made tax contributions."
"Usually, most people working in this form of economy are women; they work in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the job market."
"Sixty percent of female workers in developing countries are employed by the informal sector. There are two main reasons why this is the case: First, the kind of employment that is available caters mostly to women. Secondly, most women either work from home, because they also have to take care of children, or they work as street vendors; both of these kinds of work are classified in the informal sector."
"What is more, most people at the top positions of the sector are men, and most people in the bottom positions are women."
"For example, very few women are employers who hire others and more women are likely to be involved in smaller scale operations. Labor markets, household decisions, and states all propagate this gender inequality. The gender gap in terms of wage is even higher in the informal sector than the formal sector."
Two half-hitches
"Two half-hitches is a knot that is often used to attach rope to poles or other objects. It is one of many knots that are called hitches. When a clove hitch is tied around a rope, it forms the two half-hitches."
Clove hitch
"A clove hitch is a knot that is tied around an object. It is a kind of hitch knot. When a clove hitch is tied around a rope, it forms a knot called Two half-hitches."
The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 movie)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1996 American-French animated musical drama movie based on Victor Hugo's novel. It was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 34th Disney animated movie. It follows the deformed bell-ringer attempting to gain acceptance into society.
"The movie stars Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Tony Jay, Kevin Kline, Paul Kandel, Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, David Ogden Stiers and Mary Wickes in her final movie role. Produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance, the movie is considered to be one of Disney's darkest animated movie because its narrative explores such mature themes as infanticide, lust, damnation, genocide, and sin, despite the changes made from the original source material in order to ensure a G rating received by the MPAA. The musical score was written by Alan Menken, with songs written by Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had previously collaborated on ""Pocahontas""."
"The movie was released on June 21, 1996 to largely positive reviews and was a commercial success, grossing over $325 million worldwide and becoming the fifth highest-grossing release of 1996. The movie received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Menken's musical score. A darker, more Gothic stage adaptation of the movie, was rewritten and directed by James Lapine and produced by Walt Disney Theatrical in Berlin, Germany, as ""Der Glöckner von Notre Dame"", and ran from 1999 to 2002. A direct-to-video sequel, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"", was released in 2002."
Plot.
"In 1482 Paris, Clopin, a Gypsy puppeteer tells a group of children the origin of the titular hunchback. Twenty years earlier, a group of gypsies are arrested by Judge Claude Frollo, the corrupt and fanatical Justice Minister, who pursues a woman and her deformed baby. After killing her near the Notre Dame Cathedral, Frollo attempts to drop the baby in the well, but the archdeacon stops him. Frollo decides to raise the child at the cathedral and atone for his sin. He names him Quasimodo."
"Twenty years later, Quasimodo became a goodhearted but isolated young man living in the cathedral. His only friends are a trio of sentient gargoyles, Victor, Hugo and Laverne. They encourage him to attend the annual Feast of Fools. Frollo attempts to discourage him, telling him he would be shunned for his deformities. Undeterred, Quasimodo attends the festival where he is celebrated for his deformities, but is humiliated and surrounded by everyone. After freeing Quasimodo, the kind Gypsy dancer Esmeralda uses witchcraft to evade capture."
"As Quasimodo returns to the cathedral, Esmeralda meets Phoebus, the captain of the guard, who has her confined, instead of arresting her. Esmeralda befriends Quasimodo. He helps her escape the cathedral, and she gives him a pendant with a map to the Court of Miracles, the home of the gypsies. Frollo develops lustful feelings towards Esmeralda, calling on the Virgin Mary to protect him from her spell and avoid eternal damnation. The next day, Frollo and the guards arrest one of the civilians and burn every buildings. Phoebus defies Frollo, when he attempts to burn down the house. Phoebus falls unconscious at the river Seine, but Esmeralda rescues him and they head to the cathedral for refuge. The gargoyles try to encourage Quasimodo, but he becomes heartbroken when Esmeralda has loved Phoebus. When Frollo returns to the cathedral, he bluffs to Quasimodo that he knows the location of the gypsy hideout and Frollo will attack at dawn with a thousand men. Using Esmeralda's map, Quasimodo and Phoebus travel to the Court of Miracles, where Frollo and the guards capture everyone."
"Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake after she rejects him, but she is saved by Quasimodo and is brought into the cathedral. Phoebus releases himself and the gypsies, and unites the citizens of Paris while opposing Frollo and the guards. Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead into the streets to prevent everyone from entering the cathedral. Frollo sneaks inside, and pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda onto the balcony, where he reveals to Quasimodo that he killed his mother. Frollo falls to his death into the lake of molten copper, while Phoebus saves Quasimodo. Esmeralda and Phoebus receive a blessing for their relationship, and Quasimodo is accepted into Parisian society."
Biological engineering
Biological engineering (also known as biotechnological engineering and bioengineering) is any type of engineering that is applied to living things.
Audi A8
"The Audi A8 is the largest car produced by Audi. It replaced the Audi V8 in 1994, and is available with either short or long wheelbase. The range incorporates 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-cylinder petrol engines and 6- and 8-cylinder diesel engines. A more sporty version is the Audi S8."
Mariner 3
"Mariner 3 was a NASA spacecraft. It was the third spacecraft in the Mariner program. It was designed to take photos of the planet Mars after an eight month journey studying interplanetary (between planet) space. However, the spacecraft lost power eight hours after launch, and it never achieved the correct Mars trajectory. It eventually entered a heliocentric (Sun-centred) orbit."
Selenography
"Earth Day is a day that is supposed to inspire more awareness and appreciation for the Earth's natural environment. It takes place each year on April 22. It now takes place in more than 193 countries around the world. During Earth Day, the world encourages everyone to turn off all unwanted lights. On Earth day we should give something to our mother land like we can plant trees."
History.
"It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970. U Thant, the Secretary-General of United Nations at that time, has recognized it. While the first Earth Day focused on the United States, The EPA ( Enviromental Protection Agency), launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 countries. Its name and concept were created by John McConnell in 1960 at a UNESCO conference in San Francisco."
Parables of Jesus
"The parables of Jesus can be found in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and in some of the gospels not in the Bible. They are found mostly in the three synoptic gospels. They are a key part of the teaching of Jesus: they form about one third of his recorded teachings. Christians place emphasis on these parables, since they are believed to be the words of Jesus."
"Jesus' parables are seemingly simple and memorable stories, often with imagery, and each conveys a message. Scholars have commented that although these parables seem simple, the messages they convey are deep, and central to the teachings of Jesus."
"Many of Jesus' parables refer to simple everyday things, such as a woman baking bread (parable of the Leaven), a man knocking on his neighbor's door at night (parable of the Friend at Night), or the aftermath of a roadside mugging (parable of the Good Samaritan); yet they deal with major religious themes, such as the growth of the Kingdom of God, the importance of prayer, and the meaning of love."
"In Western civilization, these parables formed the prototype for the term ""parable"" and in the modern age, even among those who know little of the Bible, the parables of Jesus remain some of the best known stories in the world."
Roots and sources.
"As a translation of the Hebrew word מָשָׁל ""mashal"" the word parable can also refer to a riddle. In all times in their history the Jews were familiar with teaching by means of parables and a number of parables also exist in the Old Testament. The use of parables by Jesus was hence a natural teaching method that fit into the tradition of his time. The parables of Jesus have been quoted, taught, and discussed since the very beginnings of Christianity."
Canonical gospels.
"The three synoptic gospels contain the parables of Jesus. The Gospel of John contains only the stories of the Vine and Good Shepherd, which some consider to be parables, else it includes allegories but no parables. Several authors such as Barbara Reid, Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that ""parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John""."
"The Catholic Encyclopedia states: ""There are no parables in St. John's Gospel. In the Synoptics ... we reckon thirty-three in all; but some have raised the number even to sixty, by including proverbial expressions."" The Gospel of Luke contains both the largest total number of parables (24) and eighteen unique parables; the Gospel of Matthew contains 23 parables of which eleven are unique; and the Gospel of Mark contains eight parables of which two are unique."
"In ""Harmony of the Gospels"", Cox and Easley provide a Gospel harmony for the parables based on the following counts: Only in Matthew: 11, only in Mark: 2, only in Luke: 18, Matthew and Luke: 4, Matthew, Mark and Luke: 6. They list no parables for the Gospel of John."
Other documents.
"Parables attributed to Jesus are also found in other documents apart from the Bible. Some of these overlap those in the canonical gospels and some are not part of the Bible. The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas contains up to fifteen parables, eleven of which have parallels in the four canonical Gospels. The unknown author of the Gospel of Thomas did not have a special word for ""parable,"" making it difficult to know what he considered a parable. Those unique to Thomas include the Parable of the Assassin and the Parable of the Empty Jar."
"The noncanonical Apocryphon of James also contains three unique parables attributed to Jesus. They are known as ""The Parable of the Ear of Grain"", ""The Parable of the Grain of Wheat"", and ""The Parable of the Date-Palm Shoot""."
"The hypothetical Q document is seen as a source for some of the parables in Matthew, Luke, and Thomas."
Purpose and motive.
In the Gospel of Matthew (13:10-17) Jesus provides an answer when asked about his use of parables:
"The disciples came to him and asked, ""Why do you speak to the people in parables?"" He replied,"
"&lt;br&gt;&lt;DD&gt;""The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. This is why I speak to them in parables:"
"&lt;br&gt;&lt;DD&gt;Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand."""
"While and may suggest that Jesus would only speak to the ""crowds"" in parables, while in private explaining everything to his disciples, modern scholars do not support the private explanations argument and surmise that Jesus used parables as a teaching method. Dwight Pentecost suggests that given that Jesus often preached to a mixed audience of believers and non-believers, he used parables to reveal the truth to some, but hide it from others."
Christian author Ashton Axenden suggests that Jesus constructed his parables based on his divine knowledge of how man can be taught:
"This was a mode of teaching, which our blessed Lord seemed to take special delight in employing. And we may be quite sure, that as ""He knew what was in man"" better than we know, He would not have taught by Parables, if He had not felt that this was the kind of teaching best suited to our wants."
"In the 19th century, Lisco and Fairbairn stated that in the parables of Jesus, ""the image borrowed from the visible world is accompanied by a truth from the invisible (spiritual) world"" and that the parables of Jesus are not ""mere similitudes which serve the purpose of illustration, but are internal analogies where nature becomes a witness for the spiritual world""."
"Similarly, in the 20th century, calling a parable ""an earthly story with a heavenly meaning"", William Barclay states that the parables of Jesus use familiar examples to lead men's minds towards heavenly concepts. He suggests that Jesus did not form his parables merely as analogies but based on an ""inward affinity between the natural and the spiritual order."""
Themes.
"A number of parables which are adjacent in one or more gospels have similar themes. The parable of the Leaven follows the parable of the Mustard Seed in Matthew and Luke, and shares the theme of the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. The parable of the Hidden Treasure and parable of the Pearl form a pair illustrating the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the need for action in attaining it."
"The parables of the Lost Sheep, Lost Coin, and Lost (Prodigal) Son form a trio in Luke dealing with loss and redemption."
One thing they have in common is that they are all toxic. The soluble ones are more toxic than the insoluble ones.
Mercury(I) compounds.
"Also known as mercurous compounds, these are weak reducing agents and weak oxidizing agents. Most of them do not dissolve in water, making them less toxic than mercury(II) compounds. Most of them are colorless or yellow."
Mercury(II) compounds.
"Also known as mercuric compounds, these are strong oxidizing agents. Most of them dissolve in water, making them very toxic. They are colorless or red."
Organomercury compounds.
These contain mercury reacted with a organic molecule. They are even more toxic than other mercury compounds since they get absorbed very easily.
Occurrence.
"Mercury is a rare metal. It is about as common as silver. Mercury is not expensive like silver because the mercury is very easy to get from the places where it is found. Mercury can be found in elemental (liquid) form in nature, but this is not common. Mercury as an element is the only liquid that is recognized as a mineral by the International Mineralogical Association. It is most often found in the form of cinnabar, a mercury(II) sulfide mineral. The biggest deposits of cinnabar used to be found in Spain, but now are found in China. It also occurs in other minerals like calomel, a mercury(I) chloride mineral."
Preparation.
"China and Kyrgyzstan are the two main makers of mercury. Mines in Italy, the United States, and Mexico have been closed. China is opening more mines because the European Union wants to use fluorescent lights, which need mercury."
"Mercury is made by roasting cinnabar in a furnace. The sulfide is oxidized to sulfur dioxide, leaving mercury behind."
Uses of mercury.
Medical uses.
"Mercury has been used in dental fillings until it was replaced with safer materials. They are an amalgam of mercury with another element. An organic mercury compound called thiomersal is used to preserve vaccines. Merbromin, another organic mercury compound, is used as an antiseptic. It has been banned in some countries like the US."
"Mercury(I) chloride (also known as calomel or mercurous chloride) has been used as a diuretic, skin disinfectant, and laxative. Together with other mercury compounds, Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was used to treat syphilis. The problem with this was that mercury(II) chloride is very toxic. Sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. , a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 1800s for different conditions such as constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was given to children once a year as a laxative and dewormer. Teething powders for infants also had it in them."
"Since the 1930s some vaccines have contained the preservative thiomersal. In the body, this is changed to ethylmercury. At first it was thought that this mercury-based preservative can cause or trigger autism in children, but scientific studies could not show such a link. Because of this, thiomersal has been removed from most U.S. vaccines recommended for children six years of age and under. There are certain exceptions to this rule for influenza vaccines. In some cases, vaccines may still have very small amounts of thiomersal in them."
"Cinnabar is still an important component of traditional Chinese, Tibetan, and Ayurvedic medicine. Certain countries do not allow the use of mercury or its compounds in drugs. For this reason, cinnabar has recently been replaced with less toxic products."
"Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and blood pressure devices using mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. Now their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non-prescription mercury thermometers. In 2003, Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices. Mercury compounds are in some over-the-counter drugs, including topical antiseptics, stimulant laxatives, diaper rash ointment, eye drops, and nasal sprays. The FDA has “inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness” of the mercury in these products. Mercury is still used in some diuretics, although other things can be used for most therapeutic uses."
Other uses.
Mercury is also used:
In 2017 the worldwide use of mercury was less than half of what it was in 1980.
Toxicity.
"Mercury is liquid at room temperature, and fumes of mercury are very poisonous. Ingested elemental mercury is less dangerous. The biggest problems are organic mercury compounds which are eaten with food. As with other heavy metals, inorganic compounds such as mercury(II) nitrate are also highly toxic by ingestion (eating) or inhalation (breathing in) of the dust. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning."
"In the year 1810, over 200 people died of mercury poisoning on the ship ""Triumph"" because a barrel of mercury had leaked."
"Mercury is extremely poisonous and has to be used carefully. When mercury is spilled, there are special ways to clean it up. Smaller drops should be combined to a larger drop on hard surfaces to be removed more easily (for example, being pushed into a bag that can be thrown away). Vacuum cleaners and brooms should not be used. This is because they can spread mercury even more. Afterwards, elements such as sulfur or zinc powder should be sprinkled over the place, then collected and cleaned away. It is not easy to clean mercury entirely off clothing, so it is better not to use them anymore. Breathing in mercury vapor is also very dangerous."
Africa
"Africa is the second largest continent in the world. It makes up about a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved."
History.
The history of Africa begins with the first modern human beings and continues to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent.
"Africa's ancient historic period includes the rise of Egyptian civilization. It also includes the development of other societies outside the Nile River Valley, and the interaction between these societies and civilizations outside of Africa. In the late 7th century, North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of Islam. That led to the appearance of new cultures, like the Swahili people and the Mali Empire, whose king, Musa Keita I, became one of the richest and most influential people of the early 14th century. This also led to an increase in the slave trade, which had a very bad influence on Africa’s development until the 19th century."
Qadi's courts.
"When there was a legal dispute about family or financial matters, it would be handled in a court headed by a ""qadi"" (judge). These judges also had a legal education, and they were appointed to their post by the ruler. In simple cases, qadis would pronounce a verdict based on their own knowledge of sharia. In more difficult cases, they would express the details of the case in general terms and ask a mufti for his legal opinion."
Mazalim courts.
"Criminal cases were usually handled in ""maẓālim"" courts. These courts were controlled by the ruler's council. ""Mazalim"" courts were supposed to follow ""the spirit of sharia"". Qadis and muftis were present in those courts to make sure the verdicts did not go against it. However, these courts did not necessarily follow the letter of the law, and they had fewer legal restrictions than qadi's courts. ""Mazalim"" courts also handled complaints against government officials. Their purpose of ""mazalim"" courts was to ""right wrongs"" which could not be addressed through procedures of qadi's courts. Less serious crimes were often handled by local police and market inspectors according to local customs, which were only loosely related to sharia."
Non-Muslims.
"Non-Muslim communities living under Islamic rule were allowed to follow their own laws. The government kept out of their internal legal affairs, except when there was a dispute between people of different religions. Such cases were handled by a qadi. When that happened, sharia rules gave Muslims some legal advantages over non-Muslims. However, non-Muslims often won cases against Muslims and even against high government officials, because people thought that sharia was a reflection of divine justice which should defend the weak against the powerful."
Sharia in the modern world.
"In the modern era, most parts of the Muslim world came under influence or control of European powers. This led to major changes in the legal systems of these lands. In some cases, this was because Muslim governments wanted to make their states more powerful and they took European states as models of what a modern state should look like. In other cases, it was because Europeans who colonized these lands forced them to abandon parts of Islamic law and follow European laws instead."
Early legal reforms.
"In modern times, criminal laws in the Muslim world were widely replaced by codes which were inspired by European laws. Court procedures and legal education were also made similar to European practice. The constitutions of most Muslim-majority states mention sharia in one way or another. However, the classical rules of sharia were preserved mostly in family laws. In earlier times, sharia was interpreted by independent scholars who often disagreed with each other, and all their opinions were never written down in one place. In the modern era, it was the government who controlled the laws. Different states created their own legal codes, where the laws were clearly stated. The governments wanted to make family laws fit better in the modern world, but they still wanted people to view them as laws based on sharia. In order to do this, the scholars who wrote down these laws decided to pick and choose rules from the different legal opinions available in the classical books of law. When some of the laws they picked disagreed with the current norms of society, the government tried to solve this problem by creating additional court procedures. For example, when family laws in some states seemed to treat women unfairly to the population, the government created procedures that made it more difficult for men to take advantage of these laws in an unfair manner."
Recent legal reforms.
"In the last quarter of the 20th century, many Muslims around the world became disappointed in their governments. These governments had adopted Western ways in their legal systems and other matters, but many people regarded their actions as oppressive, corrupt, and ineffective. More and more Muslims started to think that things would improve if their government returned to Islamic traditions. They began calling for return of sharia, and conservative members of the public wanted the government to deal with crime using all the traditional methods, including ""hudud"" punishments. In a few countries, the government put some elements of classical criminal law into the legal code. However, in some of these countries (for example, Iran and Sudan) the supreme court has rarely approved the harsher ""hudud"" punishments, while in the other countries which adopted ""hudud"" laws (for example, Pakistan and Nigeria), the supreme court never approves them."
"In some countries, progressive Muslim reformers have been able to change how the state interprets sharia family laws to make them more fair to women."
Saudi Arabia.
"Saudi Arabia is an exceptional case in the legal history of the Muslim world. It has always continued to use sharia in different areas of law, and it never codified its laws. Its judges have always tried to follow traditional sharia rules for dealing with crimes, and they often impose harsh punishments that inspire international protests. However, these punishments are not necessarily prescribed by sharia. Judges in Saudi Arabia follow the classical principle which says that ""hudud"" punishments should be avoided if at all possible, and the punishments which they apply are usually ""tazir"" punishments which are left to their own choice. Saudi Arabia is often criticized for its public executions, and their frequency has increased in recent decades. Executions became more frequent because the government and courts decided to crack down on violent crime which became more frequent during the 1970s, as also happened in the U.S. and China."
Wadowice
"Wadowice () is a town in Poland in Lesser Poland Voivodeship in the mountainous range known as Zakopane region, southeast of Krakow - (former Polish capital)."
"Pope John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla) was born there on May 18 1920. He also attended elementary and high school there, graduating with honors in 1938."
"The town is twinned with 4 others, all in Italy."
Piano duet
A piano duet is a piece of music written for two people to play at one piano. It is often called Piano 4 hands.
To play piano duets the two players sit with one person on the right (playing the high notes) and the other person on the left (playing the low notes). The person on the right is called “Primo” (“First”) and the person on the left is called “Secondo” (“Second”).
Piano duet music is usually printed with the Secondo part on the left-hand page and the Primo part on the right-hand page. Occasionally it is printed with the two parts underneath one another.
"Playing piano duets is great fun and an excellent way to become a better musician. Like all group music making, each player has to learn to listen and adapt to what is going on in the other part. Sometimes one player will have to take away his or her hand quickly so that the other player can play the same note immediately afterwards. Sometimes the players have to cross their hands (secondo’s right hand crosses with primo’s left hand)."
A lot of the time the primo’s part may have both hands written in the treble clef and the secondo’s part may have both hands written in the bass clef. This can sometimes be confusing at first.
"The pedalling is usually done by the secondo player. This is because pedalling is very much about keeping chords going (“sustaining”), and it is the secondo who usually has the chords which give the harmony because these are in the lower part."
Repertoire.
There are lots of piano duets available for people to play. Some of these are simple ones written for beginner pianists. Some are written by the great composers.
"Some pieces that are really supposed to be played by an orchestra have been arranged for piano duet. In some cases the composer himself made this arrangement. Examples from famous composers include Stravinsky’s ""Rite of Spring"" which is extremely hard to play, and Maurice Ravel’s suite ""Ma Mère l’Oie""."
"Some very famous piano duets which were originally written in this form include several sonatas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, several pieces by Franz Schubert including a ""Fantasia in f minor"", Gabriel Fauré’s ""Dolly Suite"", Debussy’s ""Petite Suite"" and Georges Bizet’s ""Jeux d’Enfants"" (which he also arranged for orchestra)."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
"SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19. It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
"The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019."
"Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic."
Origins.
"The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronaviruses (96%). This means the virus may have originally come from bats. Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host, meaning another animal in between bats and humans. The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans. Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries. But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines, so they are often sold on the black market."
"Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it. They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation. Scientists are studying bats because of this."
"Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery."
Name.
"In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus ""2019-nCoV,"" for ""novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019."" The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number."
How the virus causes disease.
"First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ""."" ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors."
"SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs. Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze."
"The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease."
Lung damage.
"Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels."
COVID-19.
"In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. ""Covi"" for ""coronavirus,"" ""D"" for ""disease,"" and ""19"" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like ""Wuhan,"" or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud."
Symptoms.
"According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things."
"According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs."
Painkilling.
"A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain. It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor. This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain."
Shape.
"The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA) Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the ""viral envelope"", or outer layer, of the virus."
"SARS-CoV-2 is a ""positive-strand"" RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do."
Conspiracy theories.
"In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon. When the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: ""I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?"" said Khamenei."
One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.
"On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in ""Nature Medicine"" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. The paper in ""Nature Medicine"" soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time."
Medicines.
"There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19, but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable."
Computing.
"In computing, the question mark character is represented by ASCII code 63, and is located at Unicode code-point U+003F. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent, ？, is located at Unicode code point U+FF1F."
Kevin Federline
"Kevin Earl Federline (born March 21, 1978) is an American entertainer, who dances, raps and models as his job. He is famous for being the former husband of pop singer Britney Spears. Federline has 4 kids, 2 with actress Shar Jackson and 2 with Spears."
Mercyful Fate
Mercyful Fate are a heavy metal band from Denmark. The band was formed in Copenhagen in 1980.
Basic
Basic may be:
Electrical circuit
"A circuit is a closed path that consists of circuit components in which electrons from a voltage or current source can flow. If the circuit consists of electric components like a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor etc. then it will be called an Electrical circuit and if the circuit consists of any of the electronic circuit components like a diode, a Transistor etc. then it will be called an Electronic circuit. So, the electronic circuits may consist both of the electrical and electronic circuit components, but an electrical circuit will have only the electrical components."
"The point where electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the ""source"" of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the ""return"" or ""earth ground"". The exit point is called the ""return"" because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit."
"The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's ""load"". The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power home appliances like refrigerators, televisions, or lamps or more complicated, such as the load on the output of a hydroelectric power generating station."
Circuits use two forms of electrical power: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by power stations. DC powers battery-operated vehicles and other machines and electronics. Converters can change AC to DC and vice versa. High-voltage direct current transmission uses big converters.
Electronic circuit.
"Electronic circuits usually use direct current sources. The load of an electronic circuit may be as simple as a few resistors, capacitors, and a lamp, all connected together to create the flash in a camera. Or an electronic circuit can be complicated, connecting thousands of resistors, capacitors, and transistors. It may be an integrated circuit such as the microprocessor in a computer."
Resistors and other circuit elements can be connected in series or in parallel. Resistance in series circuits is the sum of the resistance.
Circuit and wiring diagram.
"A circuit or wiring diagram is a visual display of an electrical circuit. Electrical and electronic circuits can be complicated. Making a drawing of the connections to all the component parts in the circuit's load makes it easier to understand how circuit components are connected. Drawings for electronic circuits are called ""circuit diagrams"". Drawings for electrical circuits are called ""wiring diagrams"". Like other diagrams, these diagrams are usually drawn by draftsmen, and then printed. Diagrams may also be created digitally using specialised software."
"A schematic is a diagram of an electrical circuit. Schematics are graphical representations of the essential connections in a circuit, but they are not lifelike depictions of a circuit. Schematics use symbols to represent components in the circuit. Conventions are used in a schematic to represent the way electricity flows. The common convention we use is from the positive to the negative terminal. The realistic way electricity flows is from the negative to the positive terminal."
"Circuit diagrams use special symbols. The symbols on the drawings show how components like resistors, capacitors, insulators, motors, outlet boxes, lights, switches, and other electrical and electronic components are connected together. The diagrams are a big help when workers try to find out why a circuit does not work correctly."
Circuit breakers.
"The current flowing in an electrical or electronic circuit can suddenly increase when a component part fails. This can cause serious damage to other components in the circuit, or create a fire hazard. To protect against this, a fuse or a device called a ""circuit breaker"" can be wired into a circuit. The circuit breaker will open, or ""break"", the circuit when the current in that circuit becomes too high, or the fuse will ""blow"". This gives protection."
Ground-fault-interrupt (G.F.I.) devices.
"The standard return for electrical and electronic circuits is the earth ground. When an electrical or electronic device fails, it may open the return circuit to the earth ground. The user of the device could become a part of the device's electrical circuit by providing a return path for the electrons through the user's body instead of the circuit's earth ground. When our body becomes part of an electrical circuit, the user can be seriously shocked, or even killed by electrocution."
"To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution, ground fault interrupts devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices. When an open circuit to earth ground is detected, the G.F.I. device immediately opens the voltage source to the device. G.F.I. devices are similar to circuit breakers but are designed to protect humans rather than circuit components."
Short circuits.
Short circuits are circuits that get back to the power source unused or with the same power as put out. Using these usually blow a fuse but sometimes they don't. Doing this with a battery can cause electrical fires.
"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection caused by bacteria in part of the urinary tract. In the lower urinary tract, it is simple cystitis (a bladder infection). In the upper urinary tract, it is a kidney infection. Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include painful peeing and frequent peeing or wanting to pee (or both). Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and side and back pain. In old people and young children, the symptoms are not always so clear. The main cause for both types is the bacteria ""Escherichia coli."" Other bacteria, viruses, or fungus may be the cause in rare cases."
"Women get urinary tract infections more often than men. Half of women have an infection at some point in their lives. It is common to have repeated infections. Risk factors include sexual intercourse as well as family history. Sometimes a person who had a bladder infection will get a kidney infection. Kidney infection may also, but rarely, be caused by bacteria in the blood. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. Sometimes, the urine needs to be tested. A person with frequent infections can take low-dose antibiotics to prevent future infections."
"Antibiotics are used to treat simple cases of urinary tract infections. Resistance to antibiotics is increasing. People who have complicated urinary tract infections sometimes have to take antibiotics for a longer time, or might take antibiotics intravenously (through a vein). If symptoms have not improved in two or three days, the person will need further tests. In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection. Ten percent of women develop urinary tract infections each year."
Signs and symptoms.
"Lower urinary tract infection is also known as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with peeing and having to pee frequently (or wanting to pee) without vaginal discharge or significant pain. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In healthy women, the symptoms last an average of six days. Some people will have pain above the pubic bone (lower abdomen) or in the lower back. People who have an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis (a kidney infection), can have flank pain, fever (a high temperature), or nausea and vomiting. Those symptoms are in addition to the normal symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. In rare cases the urine looks bloody or contains visible pyuria (pus in the urine)."
In children.
"In young children, fever can be the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Many medical associations recommend a urine culture for females younger than two year old or uncircumcised males who are younger than a year and have a fever. Infants with UTI sometimes eat poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of jaundice ( a yellow coloring of the skin). Older children can have new urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control)."
In the elderly.
"Urinary tract symptoms are frequently not seen in those who are old. Sometimes, the only symptoms are incontinence (loss of bladder control), a change in mental status (ability to think), or feeling tired. The first symptom for some old people is sepsis, an infection of the blood. Diagnosis can be difficult because many old people are incontinent (cannot hold their pee) or have dementia (poor thinking abilities)."
Cause.
"""E. coli"" is the cause of 80–85% of urinary tract infections. ""Staphylococcus saprophyticus"" is the cause in 5–10% of cases. In rare cases, viral or fungal infections cause urinary tract infections Other bacterial causes of UTI include:"
"These bacterial causes are not common and usually happen when the person has an abnormal urinary system or the person has a urinary catheterization (tube inserted into the bladder. Urinary tract infections due to""Staphylococcus aureus"" usually happens after the person has had a blood infection."
Gender.
"Sexual intercourse is the cause of 75–90% of bladder infections in young, sexually active women. The risk of infection is related to how often they have sex. With UTIs so frequent when women first get married, the term ""honeymoon cystitis"" is often used. In post-menopausal women (women who have stopped menstruating), sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI. Using spermicide (a gel or cream to kill sperm) increases the risk of UTIs."
"Women get more UTIs than men because women have a urethra that is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's estrogen (a hormone) levels decrease with menopause, the risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora (good bacterial that live in the vagina)."
Urinary catheters.
A urinary catheter is a tube that is put into the bladder to drain the urine. Using a catheter increases the risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is 3% - 6% every day the catheter is used. Antibiotics do not stop these infections. The risk of an infection can be decreased by:
Others.
"Bladder infections are more common in some families. Other risk factors include diabetes, being circumcised, and having a large prostate (a gland around the urethra in males). Complicating factors are not completely clear. These factors may include some anatomic problems (relating to physical narrowing), functional, or metabolic problems. A complicated UTI is more difficult to treat and usually needs more aggressive evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. In children, UTIs are linked to vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation."
Mechanism.
"The bacteria that cause urinary tract infections usually go into the bladder from the uretha. It is believed these bacteria come from the bowel. Females are at greater risk because they have a short urethra that is close to their anus). After entering the bladder, ""E. Coli"" are able to stick to the bladder wall. They form a biofilm, which is a coating of microorganisms, that resists the body's immune response. However, infections can also come through the blood or lymph."
Prevention.
The following activities do not cause a UTI or make them happen less frequently:
"People who often get UTIs and who use spermicide or a diaphragm for birth control should use a different type of birth control. Cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of infections, but some people cannot use cranberries for long periods of time. Gastrointestinal (stomach) upset occurs in more than 30% of people who regularly drink cranberry juice or take capsules. As of 2011, probiotics used intravaginally (in the vagina) require further study to determine if they are helpful."
Medications.
"For people who keep getting infections, taking antibiotics for a long time is helpful. Drugs frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. If infections are related to sexual intercourse, some women find it useful to taking antibiotics after sex. In post-menopausal women, using topical vaginal estrogen (a hormone applied to the skin of the vaginal) has been found to reduce getting a UTI. Unlike topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries (medical devices put in the vagina is not as useful as low-dose antibiotics. A number of vaccines are being developed (as of 2011)."
In children.
There is little evidence that using preventative antibiotics decreases urinary tract infections in children. It is rare for people who have no problems with their kidneys to develop kidney problems from frequent UTIs. Having frequent urinary tract infections as a child causes less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.
Diagnosis.
"In most cases, UTIs can be diagnosed just from the symptoms and there is no need for laboratory testing. Urinalysis (testing the urine) can be used to confirm the diagnosis in complicated cases. The urine is tested for urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. Another test, urine microscopy, looks for red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is considered positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical bacteria that causes infections of the urinary tract. Cultures can also be used to test which antibiotic will work. However, women with negative cultures can still improve with antibiotic treatment. UTI symptoms in old people can be vague, and diagnosis can be difficult as there is no really reliable test."
Classification.
"A urinary tract infection in the lower urinary tract is known as a bladder infection. A UTI in the upper urinary tract is known as pyelonephritis or kidney infection. If the urine has significant bacteria, but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria."
"A formal orchestra will always consist of two of the four main instruments. The variations of the instruments are used where the piece asks for it. Usually, the newer pieces written after 1850 will have more instruments."
"Sometimes a player will double on these extra instruments, for example: one of the flute players may also play the piccolo in the same piece. It depends on the piece of music. Obviously a player cannot play the flute and piccolo at the same time. If the two instruments do play at the same time an extra player will be needed for the piccolo."
The brass family.
"The brass section has four sections: trumpet, trombone, French horn, and tuba. Some of these come in several sizes. The article on transposing instruments explains more about it. The trumpet may have several slightly different sizes. The lowest kind is a bass trumpet. The trombone may be an alto, tenor, bass or contrabass trombone. The French horn, like the other brass instruments, has changed over the years. Modern horns have at least three valves and are usually in F. They often sit in a different place to the other brass. The tuba comes in different sizes and the player or conductor must decide which to use for the piece they are playing. There are large ones called contrabass tubas. A small tuba is commonly also seen and is called a euphonium or a baritone horn."
The percussion family.
"The percussion section has the largest variety of instruments. such as: the tambourine, the triangle, the fabulous loud gong, the crashing cymbals and the ringing bell. The timpani (or ""kettle drums"") can be tuned to particular notes. They are the most common percussion instrument. Composers such as Haydn and Mozart nearly always used them, even with their small orchestras. This is the most commonly used percussion instruments and is used in almost all pieces."
"The rest of the percussion section can include tuned percussion instruments like the xylophone. Non-tuned percussion can be other kinds of drum like bass drum, snare drum, and a variety of others: simple to name the most common ones. The principal percussion player will have to decide which player will play which instrument(s). The percussionists have to work well together as a team so all parts can be covered."
The history of the orchestra.
"It is difficult to say when the orchestra was invented because instruments have played together for many centuries. If we say that an orchestra is a group of string instruments with several players playing the same part, and that there may be wind instruments (i.e. woodwind and brass) or percussion playing as well, then the 17th century is the time that orchestras started. In Paris in 1626 King Louis XIII had an orchestra of 24 violins (called ""24 Violons du Roi""). Later in the century the English king Charles II wanted to be like the French king and so he, too, had a string orchestra. Gradually the other instruments were added. At this time there was usually someone playing the harpsichord (the continuo part). It was often the composer himself, who would have conducted from the keyboard at important moments like the beginning and end of the piece."
"Clarinets came into the orchestra at the end of the 18th century, and trombones at the beginning of the 19th century. Orchestras were still quite small, though. The saxophone was invented in the middle of the 19th century, but although they started to use it in orchestras, it soon became an instrument that was used in wind bands and later jazz bands. The opera composer Richard Wagner made the orchestra much bigger because he kept asking for extra instruments. He asked for a bass clarinet in his opera ""Lohengrin"", and for his cycle of four operas called ""The Ring of the Nibelung"" he asked for an exact number of players: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, 8 double basses, 3 flutes and piccolo, 3 oboes and cor anglais, 3 clarinets and bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 3 trumpets and bass trumpet, 3 tenor trombones and a double bass trombone, 8 horns with 4 of them playing a specially designed tuba, a bass tuba, percussion, and 6 harps."
"Not all pieces written after that need quite such a large orchestra, but concert halls had become bigger and composers had got used to a bigger variety of sounds. Later composers sometimes added all sorts of unusual instruments: wind machine, sandpaper block, bottles, typewriter, anvils, iron chains, cuckoo, Swannee whistle etc. None of these are normal orchestral instruments. Sometimes a piano is used in the percussion section, e.g. Igor Stravinsky used one in ""Petrouchka"". Sometimes voices are also used."
The orchestra today.
"Today orchestras can usually be heard in concert halls. They also play in opera houses for opera and ballet, or in a large stadium for huge open-air concerts. Orchestras may record in studios for making CDs or recording music for movies. Many of them can be heard easily and cheaply every summer in London at the BBC Proms."
"Some of the greatest orchestras today include: the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the , the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra (Tokyo). Opera houses usually have their own orchestra, e.g. the orchestras of the Metropolitan Opera House, La Scala, or the Royal Opera House."
"In many countries there are opportunities for school-age children who play instruments well to play in youth orchestras in their areas. In Britain some of the very best are selected to play in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Other world-famous youth orchestras include the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar, Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, the European Union Youth Orchestra and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra."
Homosexuality
"Homosexuality is a sexual orientation. A homosexual person is romantically or sexually attracted to people of their own gender. Men who are romantically or sexually attracted to other men are called gay. Women who are romantically or sexually attracted to other women can be called gay as well, but are usually called lesbians. People who are romantically or sexually attracted to men ""and"" women are called bisexual."
"Together homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people make up the LGBT community, which stands for ""Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender"". It is difficult to say how many people are homosexual. Homosexuality is known to exist in all cultures and countries."
Other titles for homosexuality.
Definition.
"One may say that homosexuality is the term used for people that feel romantically or sexually attracted to their own sex, but other definitions also exist. When one views homosexuality as the term for people that feel romantically or sexually attracted to their own sex, more people are gay than when one might view homosexuality as only a term for people who do ""have"" sexual relationships with their own sex. Usually, the term is used to view all the people who are romantically or sexually attracted to their own sex, as well as those with such attractions who have not had a sexual relationship with their own sex yet. Nonetheless, the most visible form of homosexuality is the actual relationship. Most 'evidence' of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from drawings of the men in an intimate relationship or sex, because it's the most obvious."
"The word ""homosexual"" comes from the Ancient Greek word ""homo"", meaning ""same"", and the Latin word for ""gender"". People in the LGBT community usually say ""gay"" instead of ""homosexual."" Some people also use the term ""homophile"" (from Greek ' (""homos"", meaning ""the same"") and ' (""philein""; meaning ""to love""). This term emphasizes romantic interest in the same sex, rather than sexual attraction."
Other names.
"There are many different words to describe homosexual people. Some of these are used to insult homosexual people. However, the LGBT community sometimes uses these words to describe themselves because the word ""homosexual"" can sound too clinical. This is done to make the words less hurtful. Some words to describe homosexual men are ""gay"" and ""queer"". Words to describe homosexual women are ""lesbian"" and ""dyke"". ""Lesbian"" is used most often. ""Dyke"" is used less often and is sometimes used to describe lesbians who are more masculine (act or dress more like men). However, ""queer"" and ""dyke"" are sometimes used against gay people as insults, so they can sometimes be offensive."
Homosexual pride.
"When homosexual people keep their sexual orientation a secret, they are said to be ""in the closet"". ""Out"" or ""out of the closet"" is a slang term that means a homosexual person is open about their sexual orientation. This means they do not hide the fact that they are homosexual. Some gay and lesbian people stay in the closet because of fear of what would happen or because they live in a place that is not safe for homosexual people."
"Sometimes people who are 'out' also say they are 'proud'. ""Out"" means they are not hiding their sexual orientation. ""Proud"" means that they are pleased about it. ""Proud"" or ""Pride"" has a special meaning in the LGBT community. It means they are celebrating and being happy that they are homosexual. It is not 'pride' meaning that they have done something to be proud of, but 'pride' meaning the opposite of shame. Many cities have ""Pride Parades"". These used to be protest marches. Today, they are usually celebrations of the LGBT community. They usually occur in June, in memory of the 'Stonewall Riots' that happened in New York City in 1969. These riots happened because police harassed and arrested people for being homosexual. 'Stonewall' or the 'Stonewall Riots' are sometimes called the start of the LGBT rights movement."
Causes.
"The causes of homosexuality and bisexuality are controversial (people do not agree on them). The causes of homosexuality are not all understood, but genetics and the effects of the prenatal environment and hormones (when a baby is growing in its mother) are thought to be causes. There is not much evidence that the social environment is a cause of homosexuality. Scientists also show that homosexuality happens not only in humans. Some animals (like penguins, chimpanzees, and dolphins) often show homosexuality, and some (rams) even for lifelong periods as is the case with humans."
"Doctors used to treat gay people as if they had mental illnesses. However, homosexuality is no longer called a disease by doctors in many countries. There are some religious and non-religious groups who still try to 'cure' homosexuality. This is sometimes called 'conversion therapy'. In therapies like this one, homosexual individuals have tried to become heterosexual and have even claimed they were changed, but most people do not believe it is possible."
"Conversion therapy or reparative therapy aims to change people's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. It is condemned by medical and psychiatry groups such as the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, Royal College of Psychiatrists, National Association of Social Workers, Royal College of Nursing, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These scientific and educated groups are concerned that such therapy is a violation of the ethical principles of health care, and violates human rights."
Kami (disambiguation)
"Kami (神) is a Japanese word for any of several gods, spirits, or the God of Abrahamic religions."
Folklore
"""Folklore"" is the body of expressive culture, including stories, music, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and more within a particular people. This also includes the oral traditions of that culture, subculture, or group. The academic and usually ethnographic study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics . Ultimately, folklore is a word for the many ways people can express their culture."
"Before we get into the specifics of folklore, an example to help frame some understanding of the concept is the famous folk tale: Little Red Riding Hood (in European culture)."
Folkloristic Anthropology.
"""Folkloristic Anthropology"" is the study of folklore in groups of people throughout history. Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures and how they develop, including kinship systems (social relationships of people within a culture), governments, and economies. Folklore is a major part of culture (which Anthropologists are curious about). Folklore varies based off of the beliefs and values in different societies. Folkloristic Anthropologists work towards learning about the folklore of a society. Their goal is to connect a culture’s folklore to the larger more organized parts of populations. These parts can include kinship systems, governments, and economies. For example, a Folkloristic Anthropologist may study how certain types of folklore, like fairy tales, play a part in social relationships like families and friends. One folkloristic anthropologist is Zora Neale Hurston."
Types of Folk Literature.
Folk Songs.
"""Folk songs"" originate among the people of an area, passed down by oral tradition from a singer of one generation to the next. These can exist in several versions and usually have pretty simple melodies and verses. Folk songs can be performed with folk instruments and were traditionally unwritten, so the source of many of them is unknown. These songs can tell the story of a particular culture or special event in time and they can be played on certain days of the year such as holidays or at celebrations. The music of folklore is known to bring together family and friends to experience traditions of their culture. A popular example of a folk song is Barbara Allen. This is popular throughout English-speaking places and tells the story of Barbara Allen’s relationship with a dying man and his unrequited love for her. Folklorists can’t get their hands on the original version of this song, and some do not believe that the original version even exists today. But, many folk songs have multiple versions that are all sung about a similar central idea or story."
Folk Tales.
"""Folk tales"" are fictional stories that are told and passed down among people within a culture. The tales are are often based off of superstitions. They are not usually considered sacred or true by storytellers or story-listeners and are for entertainment purposes. We can think of fairytales and folktales as similar things that have supernatural influence and revolve around magical ideas including fairies, elves, ogres, and more. It is also known that a tale does not have a fixed time or place, so you can change a folktale’s setting without destroying the narrative or story. Although folktales have the magical or fictional elements, they tend to connect or relate to the events of everyday life. Folktales are traditional stories with a magical twist. They can involve a person or even an animal learning a valuable lesson through cultural rules. An example of a folktale include a British story about a girl who breaks into a house where three bears live to try all of their oatmeal, and then gets scared away. This is called “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”. “The Ant and the Grasshopper” is one of Aesop’s classic fables about a grasshopper who plays all summer and the ant who prepares for the hard winter ahead. Fairytales are a subcategory of  folktales, and include common stories like “Cinderella”, a fairy tale about a servant girl who becomes a princess, thanks to true love, and “Rapunzel”, a German fairy tale about a kidnapped child who grew up in a lonely tower with just her magically long hair to keep her company. These types of tales include royalty and fantastical magic, many of which are published by Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson."
Myths.
"""Myths"" are stories that symbolize the origins of a population, their world, natural phenomena, and culture. Mythology is the study of myths or could be a collection of myths belonging to a specific religion or cultural tradition. These stories normally take place in the distant past and include goddesses, gods, and other mythological or legendary creatures. These beings are usually the main character of the story. In ancient Ireland , the filídh, which is a special group of poets, had the job of learning and preserving myths . These myths included the stories of some Irish gods or god-like beings who settled in Ireland in the time before Christ. For example, these included: the Cessair, the Partholónians, and the Nemedians. These are myths about certain groups of Irish people, that were all collected and placed into one book called The Book of Invasions. It is not uncommon for a collection of myths to be published in a book. A major branch of classical mythology is Greek mythology. This is a group of myths told by ancient Greeks. Some famous examples of Greek myths include Homer’s epic poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey."
Legends.
"""Legends"" are sometimes different from myths because they talk about humans as the main characters rather than gods, and sometimes have historical basis whereas myths usually do not. The Brothers Grimm defined a legend ""folktale historically grounded"". Legends can resemble folktales because they may include supernatural beings, characters from mythology, or parts of supernatural phenomena. But, they are typically associated with as specific place or person and are told to illustrate history . Some legends are about the property of a place or person that they involve. For example, the story of young George Washington, the future first president of the United States, who confessed to chopping down a cherry tree. Many legends become attached to a particular person or place throughout history. Legends are also known to be migratory, which means that they are known across many cultures . The legend of Atlantis is another example. This legend became a part of many cultures and was told originally by Greek Philosopher Plato in 360 B.C. According to him, Atlantis was a great island populated by people who were way ahead of their time, and who were very wealthy. The island vanished after it was defeated by Athens, Greece. Some say that the island never existed, but others believe that it was gobbled up by the Bermuda Triangle, which is a location connected to many another legends that are passed down through generations."
Folklore Across the Seven Continents.
Europe.
"Folklore is present all over the world. When you travel, you may get to know other cultures, which may include some folktales. Europe has many of them from mythical creatures to iconic battles or love stories. For example, we see some in Greek mythology. “The Legend of Fairy’s Gate” is a folktale about the early colonization of Kotor by the Greeks, which tells the story of a fairy named Alkima who blessed Kotor with a special offering of her gratitude. Because of her great appreciation for the sea, she was given permission by seafarers to build a town by the bay. With her mystical powers, she created this town. As legend has it, those deemed worthy by Alkima were granted a special gift. Those who were descendants of the ancient seafarers of Kotor were those usually granted special gifts. This folktale is connected to a real place: Kotor. In Kotor, is Boka Bay, which has very nice views, and some who travel there say that they were visited by Alkima’s spirit and were blessed with her wisdom. Another example of European folklore is a tale called “Dracula and Bran Castle”, which is famous in Romania. One of the most famous, and main characters of this tale, is Dracula, the vampire of Transylvania, Romania. This story was written by author Bram Stoker. Dracula was said to live in Bran Castla in Transylvania, which is build on rocky land, overlooking a valley. As people travel to different places, they may enter a location that is affiliated with folklore and not even realize it. This folklore helps carry the history of locations paired with memorable and entertaining stories to pass down through generations."
Africa.
"Folklore is also seen in African cultures. Folktales and stories alike are very important to traditions and customs of African people. In African folklore, tricksters and animals play a common role. Their stories often teach a lesson, while being entertaining, and sometimes these lessons are about methods of survival. One common West African tale is about a wondering trickster spirit who is associated with change and disagreements. In some folktales, this wondering trickster is a messenger between the mortals of the world and supernatural beings, like the West African peoples’ supreme god. An example of this type of folklore is told by the people of Dahomey (Benin), in which Legba (a West African and Caribbean Voodoo god) is the guardian trickster of crossroads. He speaks every language and has massive power. He can remove obstacles and provide opportunities to the mortal people of the world. This trickster, Legba, is a common character in many African folktales, and he is also worshiped by religions. In some religions, all ceremonies begin and end with praying to Legba, because some believe that you cannot talk to the gods without first talking to him, and later thanking him . An example of an animal trickster in African legends is the spider named Anansi. This word “anansi” actually translates in English to “spider”. Animals are not always tricksters in African folklore. Sometimes they help people. According to the people of Mali, Africa, an antelope taught them agriculture. And according to other tribes, a praying mantis gave them words and fire. It is interesting to see how animals take part in some cultures’ folklore so heavily."
Asia.
"Asia consists of many different cultures amongst its regions. Within these cultures are many religious beliefs and traditions, which include folklore. In Thailand, there are folklore and myths that relate to Chinese culture. One in particular is about the Himmapan Forest, which is said to be somewhere between India and Nepal . Stories about this forest are in Buddhist lore and many local Thai folktales. This forest is shown in many pieces of Thai art which have hybrid animals that are said to live in the forest. Thai mythical creatures are also shown in art of this Himmapan Forest including the Naga, the Hong, the Kinnaree, and the Garuda. Some of these mythical creatures are also seen in Indonesian folktales. A folktale that speaks of the Himmapan Forest is called “Life in Vientaine” that describes it as a “secret palace” where there are people who are half-bird and half-human. Asian folklore is expressed with a lot of traditional art, which is a way that their people pass down the tales through generations."

Finding Nemo
"Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated comedy adventure film written and directed by Andrew Stanton, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the fifth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It tells the story of the over-protective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who searches for his captured son Nemo (Alexander Gould), along with a regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) in Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and let Nemo take care of himself. It is Pixar's first film to be released in cinemas in the northern hemisphere summer. The film was re-released for the first time in 3D on September 14, 2012, and it was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2012. A sequel, ""Finding Dory"", was released on June 17, 2016."
"The film received extremely positive reviews and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the second highest-grossing film of the year, earning a total of $921 million worldwide. ""Finding Nemo"" is also the best-selling DVD of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2011, and was the highest money making G-rated film of all time before """" overtook it. It is also the 22nd highest money making film of all time, as well as the 3rd highest money making animated film. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it the tenth greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10."
Plot.
"Two clownfish, Marlin and his wife Coral are admiring their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their clutch of eggs that are due to hatch in a few days. Suddenly, a barracuda attacks them, and Marlin tries to defend and save his eggs, leaving Marlin unconscious. Coral and all but one of their eggs are also eaten. Marlin names this egg Nemo, a name that Coral liked."
"The movie next shows Nemo's first day of school. Nemo has a tiny right fin, because his egg was injured by the barracuda attack. This makes it difficult for him to swim. After Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip by mistake, Nemo refuses and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat. So he gets captured by scuba divers. As the boat sails away, one of the divers accidentally knocks his diving mask into the water."
"While trying to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic Regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. While meeting three sharks on a fish-free diet, Bruce, a great white shark; Anchor, a hammerhead shark; and Chum, a mako shark, Marlin discovers the diver's mask that was dropped from the boat and notices an address written on it. However, when he angrily argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the scent of blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and attempt to eat Marlin and Dory. The two escape from Bruce but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea. During a hazardous struggle with an anglerfish in the trench, Dory realizes she is able to read the address written on the mask, which leads to Sydney, Australia, and manages to remember it. She repeats "" P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney"" to keep it in her memory. After receiving directions to Sydney from a large school of Silver moony, Marlin and Dory accidentally run into a bloom of jellyfish that nearly sting them to death; Marlin falls exhausted after the risky escape and wakes up to see a surf-cultured Green sea turtle named Crush, who takes Dory and him on the East Australian Current, referred to as the EAC by the animals. In the current, Marlin shares the story of his journey with a group of young sea turtles who spread the story around the ocean."
"Meanwhile, Nemo's captor - P. Sherman, a dentist - places him into a fish tank in his office on Sydney Harbour. There, Nemo meets a group of aquarium fish called the ""Tank Gang"", led by a crafty and ambitious moorish idol named Gill. The ""Tank Gang"" includes Peach, a starfish; Bloat, a puffer fish; Bubbles, a Yellow tang; Deb, a Blacktailed humbug Gurgle, a Royal gramma; and Jacques, a pacific cleaner shrimp;. The fish are frightened to learn that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla. She is infamous for killing a goldfish given to her previously by constantly shaking the bag. In order to avoid this fate, Gill gives Nemo a role in an escape plan, which involves jamming the tank's filter and forcing the dentist to remove the fish from the tank to clean it manually. The fish could be placed in plastic bags, at which point they could only roll out the window and into the harbor. After a friendly pelican named Nigel visits with news of Marlin's adventure, Nemo succeeds in jamming the filter, but the plan backfires when the dentist installs a new high-tech filter."
"While leaving the East Australian Current, Marlin and Dory get lost in the blooms of plankton and krill and are caught by a blue whale. Inside the whale's immense mouth, Marlin tries to escape while Dory talks with it in whale-speak. So, the whale carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. They are met by Nigel, who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and rescues him and Dory from a flock of hungry seagulls by scooping them into his beak and taking them to the dentist's man's office. By this time, Darla has arrived and the dentist is prepared to give Nemo to her. Nemo tries to play dead in hopes of saving himself, and, at the same time, Nigel arrives. Marlin sees Nemo and mistakes this act for the actual death of his son. After a struggle, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain through a sink."
"Sad, Marlin leaves Dory and begins to swim back home. Poor Dory then loses her memory and becomes a little worried, but meets Nemo, who has reached the ocean, has no memory of him. As you know, Dory's memory is restored again after she reads the word ""Sydney"" on a nearby drainpipe and, remembering her journey, she guides Nemo to Marlin. After the two joyfully reunite, Dory is caught in a fishing net with a school of grouper. Nemo bravely enters the net and directs the group to swim downward to break the net, reminiscent of a similar scenario that occurred in the fish tank earlier. The fish, including Dory, succeed in breaking the net and escape. After some days, Nemo leaves for school once more and Marlin who is no longer overprotective after all."
"Back at the dentist's office, the high-tech filter breaks down and The Tank Gang escape into the harbor. But, they realize that they are trapped in the bags of water that the dentist put them into when cleaning the tank."
Reception.
"""Finding Nemo"" currently holds a 99% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes with 100% by top critics, and an average of 89% on Metacritic. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it ""one of those rare movies where I always wanted to sit in the front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision."" The late broadway stars Paul Winchell, John Fiedler, and Ken Sansom who were the voices of three of Pooh's friends, Tigger, Piglet, &amp; Rabbit in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" franchise, said ""Finding Nemo"" was their favorite animated film."
"The film's use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in the United States, even though the movie portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain. The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu."
"At the same time, the film had a quote that ""all drains lead back to the ocean"" (Nemo escapes from the aquarium by going down a sink drain, ending up in the sea). Since water typically undergoes treatment before leading to the ocean, the JWC Environmental company quipped that a more realistic title for the movie might be ""Grinding Nemo"". However, in Sydney, much of the sewer system does really pass directly to outfall pipes deep offshore, without a high level of treatment (although pumping and some filtering occur). Additionally, according to the DVD, there was a cut sequence with Nemo going through a treatment plant's mechanisms before ending up in the ocean pipes. However, in the final product, logos for ""Sydney Water Treatment"" are featured prominently along the path to the ocean, implying that Nemo really did pass through some water treatment."
"The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the USA in order to improve tourism in Australia, many of them using ""Finding Nemo"" clips. Queensland also used ""Finding Nemo"" to draw tourists to promote its state for vacationers."
"On the 3-D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by ""the dimensionality of the oceanic deep"" where ""the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3-D explorers were born to boldly go."""
"The 3-D re-release also prompted a retrospective on the film then nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger described it as ""A genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic,"" with Roger Moore of the McClatchy-Tribune News Service calling the movie ""the gold standard against which all other modern animated films are measured."""
Home media.
"""Finding Nemo"" was released on DVD and VHS on November 4, 2003. The film was also released on DVD in a ""Gold Edition"", which came with a ""Finding Nemo"" stuffed toy character. The film had a home video release on both Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set."
Production.
"The inspiration for Nemo was made up of multiple experiences. The idea goes back to when director Andrew Stanton was a child, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992 shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There he saw the shark tube and various exhibits he felt that the underwater world had bene done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997 he took his son for a walk in the park, but found that he was over protecting him constantly and lost an opportunity to have any ""father-son experiences"" on that day. In an interview with ""National Geographic"" magazine, he stated that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone:""It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I wasn't taking my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish—it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you."" Also, clownfish are very colourful, but don't seem to tend to come out of an anemone very often, and for a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect kind of fish for the character."
"Pre-production of the film took place in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ""A Bug's Life"". As such, it began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called ""very unusual for an animated film."" The artists took scuba diving lessons so they could go and study the coral reef. The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and Bob Peterson while driving to record the actors. Ellen DeGeneres was cast after Stanton was watching ""Ellen"" with his wife and seeing Ellen ""change the subject five times before finishing one sentence"" as Stanton recalled. There was a pelican character known as Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) who was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other as Nigel being neat fastidious while Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. However the filmmakers had not found an appropriate scene for them that didn't slow the pace of the picture down, so Gerald's character was minimized."
"Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. Stanton originally did the voice for the film's story reel, and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance was popular in test screenings, Stanton decided to keep his performance in the film. Stanton recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in co-director Lee Unkrich's office."
"Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was ""this generation's Thumper"" and immediately cast Nicholas."
Yeah.
"and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"uh, I've got to go"
"my son's in a performance tonight,"
"I have to leave, in a couple of minutes."
"Oh that's okay,"
"Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time."
Okay.
"It was good talking to you,"
"Well, you, you too."
Okay.
Good night.
All right
bye bye.
"Okay,"
"Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?"
"Yeah,"
"to a point,"
it's not my best subject.
"Really,"
yeah
"it's not mine either,"
"but, uh, I know, I know our policy,"
"like in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that because we have, uh, some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border"
and they are missionaries there
"and they, they live there"
"and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,"
"and uh, I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border"
and they housed them and stuff.
"They have been down there about three years now,"
Yeah.
"I tell you what,"
"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
I will admit the same thing.
"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
"And I,"
"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
Yeah.
"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
I tell you what.
"The uh, the war spot in"
"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
Uh-huh.
"Because I was watching C N N,"
"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
"and it was just,"
I was amazed.
Uh-huh.
"I, I didn't have that experience."
"I, I don't have cable"
Oh.
"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I've got one question for you."
I you say you take the newspaper.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know,"
"you just switch that thing on,"
"and, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's true.
Yeah.
"But, you know, people,"
"it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day,"
"and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man"
"Um, even in an office?"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also,"
"as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York,"
"and, uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or stock investments  or whatever."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
right.
And now I'm getting the same calls at at the house.
"Uh-huh,"
I know.
"And they get your, and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet,"
"and, uh, credit card companies, they sell your name."
"Oh, yeah,"
"uh, well, you know, these people, they sell your names,"
I mean
I know.  Yes.
"you know, I,"
that's also an invasion of privacy.
"I think it the whole thing is, uh,"
and my father works in films
"and such,"
"and I tend to, tend to be hypercritical of these things,"
"and then, perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies"
"Yeah,"
right.
"and that's what they're for,"
"but I don't, don't remember them,"
"and I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during"
"and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well because it, it had some, some meaning to me or something."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"exactly,"
"yeah,"
"there, there, there are several movies that hit home like that."
"Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones"
Uh-huh.
"I always like the musicals, and uh,  those ones, that just stick in your head."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"they leave,"
"yeah,"
"they leave, they leave some songs with you,"
I don't know what it is
Uh-huh.
"but it just,"
"I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something, because I'm not that old"
"No,"
it could be.
"you know, those old movies seemed to have had something that, uh, that was memorable somehow,"
Uh-huh.
I don't know what it was.
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"he's,"
"anyway, and that was just excessively violent."
I was worried
"Yeah,"
isn't it amazing.
"it's like golly,"
"if kids start imitating that they'll knock each others blocks off,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it was all bloodless
Uh-huh.
and the good guys can get hit all day long
Uh-huh.
and they have to shake it off
Yeah.
"they don't, they don't, you know, get, uh, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head"
Right.
"you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,"
"partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like,"
Uh-huh.
"I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies, don't have very realistic upsets of the violence."
"The violence can seem very realistic,"
but the aftermath is usually not there.
Right.
"So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions"
Uh-huh.
"they thrash around,"
"they scream, you know, uh,"
"it's just a very, very bad thing,"
"and they never present that,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.
"Yeah,"
"exactly,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions."
These institutions of thirty thousand students and such.
"Oh I,"
And I see some freshmen wandering around in there
"and they're they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,"
"I mean, they, they,"
Yeah.
"I don't see them getting,"
"I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years"
and then I transferred to a very large school.
Uh-huh.
And that worked out pretty well.
"I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution."
Uh-huh.
But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was.
I needed to make friends.
I needed to sort of learn the ropes.
"You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more"
"and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years."
"Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,"
"so,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"and could call them,"
you go to their office anytime.
"I had some instructors that, uh, would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends, when I was having trouble with something"
Huh.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.
"No,"
"no,"
"and that,"
"And you you know, and you can't blame the professors either, because you look at their job description,"
No.
"you'd you know,"
teaching is third down on the list of importance things
"and,"
"Right,"
right.
"Publish first,"
and the
"yeah,"
"and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time."
Right.
"So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers."
People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.
Yeah.
"But, oh, well"
"Yeah,"
"it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider in, in their selection of a college"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ..."
what kind of fishing do you enjoy?
uh-huh.
and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole.
Uh-huh.
"But I think this, they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt."
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it."
Uh-huh.
"And it's not, because you know, I'm rich or anything,"
"it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,"
Yeah.
that I just.
"Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,"
"and it was scary, because I was so good at it."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And I thought, this is not right."
"I mean, this has got to stop, because eventually it'd end up catching up at, catching up with me"
and it hit me in the face.
"Right,"
right.
Um.
"But it sounds like, you know, you, you learned from it"
and you're coming out of it all right.
"I, yeah,"
"I have,"
I've learned a lot from it.
Uh-huh.
"I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am."
"Uh-huh,"
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find.
Exactly.
It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S
"I was reading,"
"Right,"
"I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact."
"They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever."
Yeah.
"Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger"
"and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi."
Huh.
"You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?"
"Yeah,"
really.
"But, uh, that's the way it is."
"I don't know,"
"I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes"
"and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue"
"and, you know, they should start making quality products."
"Yeah,"
I think they're beginning to.
"The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away"
"and,"
"That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,"
"and, uh, essentially, I I don't see much of a trend."
"I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there."
"There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars."
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy
"Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?"
"Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it."
Yeah.
"And then with our children, uh,"
"at the time they were, oh, grade five and, and grade eight,"
"so it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"Uh,"
"Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
That's good.
That kind of builds some character a little bit.
"So ,"
"Well, that's the idea."
"I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,"
"uh, it depends on the, on everyone's discipline."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog"
"and, uh, we've had him about four years now."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know,"
"it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's something that's important for sure.
Yeah.
"I think, uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, uh"
"Uh,"
"or,"
"Actually no,"
"we live in a, in an area that's, oh, probably about two and a half miles from the university."
"Uh, I don't know."
"I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N."
"Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,"
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour
but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
"Right,"
yeah.
"and, uh,"
"but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,"
Yeah.
"I, I think I'd agree."
"A, a similar method of getting the news with me too."
"It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years."
"Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts."
Right.
"Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature"
"and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth."
Uh-huh.
Right.
Yeah.
"I know, the,"
"my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada."
"Uh,"
"That, that's true, you know."
"You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them."
Right.
Yeah.
"I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything"
"and, uh, it's amazing that,"
"Yeah,"
that makes sense.
Um.
"Because you start prying in people's private lives, you ruin their lives as well as,"
That's right.
"And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, sometimes, I don't know"
Uh-huh.
I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.
I mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician.
"I, I, I agree with that and, uh, and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then, uh, then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
"And, uh you when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"The, that's, that's the thing that,"
"uh, things that you don't know uh, do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"People could say, oh, they do it,"
"so, I guess, you know,"
"but, as soon as things do get public uh, there, there is that terrible concern."
Uh-huh.
Um
"So, sometimes I ask myself, what are, uh, people doing that are in the media when somebody, you know, comes up to office,"
Uh-huh.
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.
I do desktop publishing at work
and I have a machine at home
and I belong to the user's group
"and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out."
Yeah?
All right.
"But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry."
I don't work a computer company.
No?
I'm an abuser.
"Well, that's, that's all right."
"But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen."
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer"
"and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,"
"let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,"
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what baud rate do you get?
"Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred"
"So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city?"
"Is it, uh,"
"Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad."
"Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things."
"Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day."
"Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck."
"Oh, really."
"But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida"
Uh-huh.
"and, well, my little girl goes to tap dance,"
and my little one goes to preschool
"and, um, I'm home with the children, just do a lot of running around."
"It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type, I don't know, life."
"Um, what about you?"
"I'm, I'm single,"
"and I, I live in a town home here in Raleigh,"
Uh-huh.
and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"we, we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes,"
Uh-huh.
"and at the time that I bought this one it was just a, a much better arrangement for me personally."
I'm not home a lot.
"I travel a great deal with my job,"
Uh-huh.
and so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance.
Was sort of maintenance free.
Yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
"well, um, that, that sounds, that sounds pretty good for"
"I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much now, but to, um, maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds,"
"and it's a lot of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it."
It's
It certainly is.
"sometimes I think, um, it would be nice to have a town home, with not having all that responsibility."
"Well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear."
"I, that's the main thing when I was shopping for one,"
"I wanted to make sure I could, I couldn't hear my neighbors"
and that was
Right.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's amazing."
"There's, uh, there's a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,"
"her, her father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman."
"And the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years."
Yeah.
"And, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that got killed, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,"
"and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried out, you know,"
"he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people,"
"and the State still can't bring itself to, to execute, this guy."
"To, yeah, to carry it out."
It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.
"It does,"
"it really does, you know."
"She, and they have to go back, uh,"
"occasionally, you know, she has to write letters to the parole board and, you know, lawyers,"
"and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got to do something else, you know, write another letter, or do something."
Yeah.
"It's just,"
It should be over and done with.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, she should be getting on with her life, you know, getting, getting that part behind her,"
"but yet, it's, it's kind of tied to her the way it is now."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"And she winds up being a, a victim, day after day after day."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
right.
"A victim,"
"not only of, indirectly of the crime, but also indirectly by that, indirect involvement."
Oh.
so I'm going to have to golf in the evening
or I'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me.
Right.
"And I don't think the,"
"Okay,"
have you participated in anything like that?
"Well a little bit,"
we mostly do our newspapers.
"We keep our newspapers, and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that"
and we take them to be recycled.
"Uh-huh,"
"uh, we, we have a pretty nice recycling center, uh, in our city now"
and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there.
They're open like two days a week
and you can just take it up there and drop it off.
Uh-huh.
It's kind of fun.
"And everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to, help the earth, I guess."
Yeah.
And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
Yeah.
Yeah
my husband was complaining the other day
because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling
"like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there."
You're supposed to what.
"Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid."
But what are you supposed to do with them.
"Oh, okay."
And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags.
They won't take those.
"But it, it's real,"
"the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five,"
"and I can't remember what day they call it,"
"but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff"
"Oh, great."
"Anyway Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,"
"and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,"
"and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her."
Oh.
"And she said no,"
"you can't do, you know,"
"he ran her out, was running to in a wheelchair to hide her,"
"and she said, ""You can't do that."""
Huh.
"""This is tradition."
"This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."""
"And, uh, he said, ""I don't understand."""
"It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, the the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, ""No, you can't do it,"" and then, and then, uh, ""Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"""
"and the son was, you know, ""Why?"""
"And so, in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, he doesn't."
"and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it."
"And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,"
"they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,"
Uh-huh.
"and they all go out and howl, you know"
"And, and the son refused to do it."
"He, he did,"
he thought it was not ...
Right.
"Well, no,"
"I haven't seen any,"
"so I, I thought that it all, had all been delayed several times."
So I have no idea what they look like
"and, I'm kind of anxious to see them."
"Yeah, That's going to be interesting because it's, uh, we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh,"
"I look at our big green containers,"
"and I say, well, they work fine"
and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors
"but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh,"
"Oh, right."
it will be interesting to see how well that works
"and I am, I'm glad the community is doing it."
"Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people."
"Uh, I don't know if, where you grew up in your, what you saw back, uh, years ago,"
"but for me the thing that strikes me is I, uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass"
Right.
Right.
"and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time was a lot of money, when you returned them."
Pop bottles all had a deposit on them.
Oh.
"Oh, of course."
"That, they did."
"You know actually, we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles"
Oh.
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house.
Uh-huh.
You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
Yeah.
and so you just put the empty ones back out there
"and he took them away and put, you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there."
"When people start talking about programs that help, for me, I don't care if it's socialist,"
"or I don't care, as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial,"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"I mean, that's the point I'm at now."
"I mean that's the point we all should be at, is like finding some solution,"
"Um, yeah."
"I mean, you know, nothing totally radical,"
"but if it's something that, you know, might help, you know,"
because there's not a lot being done.
"Well, you know, the, the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable."
"There are kids, families, that should just simply be taken out of the homes, you know. And, uh, uh, you know, uh, just removed from those situations,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Right.
or they're never going to get anywhere.
"But yet, politically that is not a very popular view."
Uh-huh.
"I'm sure that if you, you know, ran on a platform of, you know, we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home."
Take them out.
"Yeah,"
you know how far you're going to get with that.
"Yeah,"
not very far at all.
"Uh, but unfortunately it's, it's something like that, in lieu of that, you know, is the intervention programs in school where the, these kids are, are spotted fairly early on,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, you know, there's, well that's get to be a problem in Texas, you know, because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing,"
"I mean it's, it's almost like,"
"Right,"
right.
you got counselors and all that.
"But you know, you can counsel a kid eight hours a day"
"If you had to do something like that, day after day."
No one would want the job
No.
Not really.
"Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case."
"Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,"
Oh yeah.
"I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury."
"That, that, that right"
"I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you."
"Well, I mean, were there witnesses?"
"In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were."
Right.
Right.
"That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case."
Yeah.
I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
Yeah.

Yes.
"Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,"
"and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually."
"Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible."
"Oh, how awful"
"It was true, it was truly awful."
"It was not one that I picked,"
"but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I"
"because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people"
"and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that."
"And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures."
"Well, gasoline, especially, in this part of the country we all use it all the time, you know,"
"it's, that's not what I would consider a luxury."
No.

but it's a necessity today
"and, uh, as hard as they try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground. Or that accomplish what they set out to to accomplish."
Yeah.
What are your feelings on it?
"Well, um, I, I think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth."
"I mean, I, I think there could be a better system"
and we would get more for our money.
It's totally out of our hands
"so we don't, we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes"
"and, uh,"
Yeah.
"That, that's, that's so true."
"I mean, they say well, you voice your opinion, uh, uh, uh, on election day."

"No,"
you don't.

"I mean, they're always far out"

Oh.
"Uh, yes."
and our tax money pays for those things
Fantastic experience.
"I've got two, as I said, I've at U T now in Austin, and one at home,"
and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them.
Yeah.
It's a fantastic experience.
"Oh, we're really excited about it."
Oh yeah.
"You know, one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems, he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, like on a Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night."
Yeah.
"If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked."
"The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here."
"Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome"
Right.
and they're always over in someone else's house.
"So our, we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I think that's a really good thing to encourage.
"And then you can keep an eye, you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want."
"But at least you see what's going on,"
"and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that."
Right
Well good luck with your expected baby there.
"Oh well, thanks."
"My wife was yelling, was talking in my ear,"
"she said, reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving."
Uh-huh.
"And we have one, of course, I say, in college driving. And one going to drive this summer,"
"so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything."
"But you wait until they go and get a car, insurance, that's when they get expensive."
"As they get older you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five,"
Yeah.
but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while.
Uh-huh.
"So. But, I really think the news reports are, uh, tend to sensationalize the problems."
Uh-huh.
"I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and, uh, pay and exhaustion and  you know, things like that, rather than these, uh, uh, really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy."
This is true.
Yeah.
CURRENT AFFAIR can  get several shows child cases.
"Uh-huh. Well,"
Why don't you go ahead and start.
Okay.
Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement.
"Uh, trial by jury is good"
"but a lot of time a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness."
And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me.
I don't know.
"So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?"
I think so.
"You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student"
"and, uh that's the sort of system they have."
Uh-huh.
"The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well,"
they're like lawyers I guess.
They're experts in the law
Right.
"and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury"
"and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also."
The judges do the questioning
"and, uh they,"
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"So, you know, we have trade-offs."
"So we're more, we have a monthly budget with this, this, this, this."
"But, we have no savings, which isn't real wise,"
"but we just, we don't have the income at this time really to have any, because we have three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans."
We're still paying trying to pay those off.
Uh-huh.
"And we have one car payment that we don't, I think we have about thirteen months left on it."
Uh-huh.
"And after that, we either,"
"what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment, um,"
"they'll pay,"
our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans.
"So what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and, um, pay on the student loans, split that car payment in half and pay, you know, double up payments on both our loans."
And it'll work out perfect.
"Do you have your, uh, loans through the Texas Credit Union?"
"No,"
we don't.
Okay.
"Thing about the credit union is, it's, the way it's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left, let's say, on, on the loan."
Uh-huh.
If you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal.
Uh-huh.
"They take out for the, for the finances the finance charge, which is kind of, you know,"
"it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit,"
"one of those loans is. Not really the best in the world,"
"but. But, you know, they're, uh,"
"since your husband is, is, is, um, a T I"
"but doesn't have the loans with the credit union, they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at."
Really.
"I don't know what your percent is on your, on your car payments"

"The Siege of Ctesiphon took place on 27 April 629 between the forces of Shahrbaraz and Ardashir III. Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire."
"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

= = = Der Philosophische Arzt = = =
"Der Philosophische Arzt is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician and philosopher to the Russian Empress, Catherine II."
"The first edition of ""Der Philosophische Arzt"" was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770. It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author. The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources. A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a Catholic region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation. This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, Prince Heinrich von Bibra, maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so."

The announcement listed several reasons that the President supported the bill: elimination of the direct payments system; consolidation and streamlining of conservation assistance; and the inclusion of funding for bioenergy programs. The statement criticized the bill for not adopting all of the Administration's previous proposals for achieving crop insurance and commodity program savings and objected to any cuts at all to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)."
"Senator Debbie Stabenow argued in favor of the bill because it both reduced the deficit and supported ""16 million people who depend on agriculture for their jobs""."
The bill was opposed by groups focusing on hunger due to its reduction in spending on food stamps. It was also criticized by groups such as the Heritage Foundation for including a system of crop insurance that were less about helping farmers in the event of a true disaster and more of an income support system.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized the bill for containing a catfish inspection program that he believes duplicates one that is already conducted by the Food and Drug Administration.

"After the United States declared war on Spain on April 21, 1898, Captain Day was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of volunteers and assigned to command the 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, which had been reactivated after being mustered out at the end of the American Civil War. The 1st Ohio was a part of the Second Cavalry Brigade which included among its regiments the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, better known as the Rough Riders."
"The 1st Ohio reported to Port Tampa, Florida on July 12, for transportation to Cuba, but its sailing was delayed due to a shortage of transports and as a result, the regiment did not see action in the Spanish–American War. Day however, later saw action in the Philippines against the Moros. After postings to various units, he served as the colonel of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry, for a year before retiring from the army in 1912."

"Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province."
"Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871."
"Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ""Ernesto Tornquist y Cia"". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ""Refineria Argentina"", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the ""Bieckert"" brewery, the ""Seeber"" margarine manufacturer and the ""Bianchetti"" scale manufacturer."
"On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ""Sansinena"" and its cold-storage plant ""La Negra"" in Riachuelo and set up the plant ""Cuartreros"" in Bahía Blanca."
"Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the ""Compañía Argentina de Pesca"", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital."
"Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil."
"In 1903 he built the estancia, ""Sierra de la Ventana"", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays."
He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).
"In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires."
He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

"It shares its vertices and edges, as well as 20 of its triangular faces and all its pentagrammic faces, with the great dirhombicosidodecahedron, (although the latter has 60 edges not contained in the great snub dodecicosidodecahedron).

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in). In addition, overlapping regions of coplanar faces can cancel each other out. The difference between the fillings of this polyhedron is very slight, but still present."

"The report Environmental Risks and Challenges of Anthropogenic Metals Flows and Cycles was the third of six scientific assessments on global metals to be published by the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the United Nations Environment Programme. The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:"
"Metals and their compounds have been used for millennia because of their unique properties. They are used in highly valued products of modern technology, furthermore, they plan an essential role in renewable energy technologies. After having analyzed issues of metal stocks in society and recycling rates and recycling conditions and opportunities in the previous two reports on metals, Metal Stocks in Society report and Recycling Rates of Metals report, the International Resource Panel decides to address the environmental and energy issues related to the use and the production of metals. In this report, an assessment is made of literature on metal flows and cycles in nature and in society, the way they are connected, and the potential impacted related to them. The four areas of focus are 1) Local impacts of mining, 2) life cycle energy use, 3) non-metal sources, and 4) the need for a final sink. Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development."
"The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores."

They were led by seventh-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They were the last team to finish the regular season and enter the NCAA Tournament unbeaten until Kentucky did it the next year."
"The 2013–14 season was arguably the best season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history.

The team's 35–0 start was the best men's Division I start ever (before Kentucky started 38-0 the next year), beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls, the highest final national ranking in school history. Though some analysts noted that Wichita State's schedule was relatively easy compared to previous teams that finished the regular season primarily because none of their opponents throughout the season were ranked when they played them, as well as only beating one opponent that was ranked at any point in the season (Saint Louis, who also had a lack of quality wins)."
"They entered the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37 for their NCAA-record 42–game winning streak to start a season. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated."

They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament, receiving a 9 seed in the West Region, where they defeated 8 seed Pittsburgh and 1 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the West Region semifinals they defeated 13 seed La Salle and 2 seed Ohio State in the regional finals to be crowned West Region Champions and advance to the Final Four for the second time in school history and first time since 1965.

After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (engines, bogies, suspension etc.)."
"Breda SpA workshop provided the three prototypes of E.424 in 1943-1944. Mass production, however, could begin only after the end of World War II, part of the funds provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration program."
The locomotives have been built in four series starting from year 1943:
"Class E.424, having DC type motors like all the Italian locomotives of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on start, a rheostat is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (""Maniglione""), but through an automatic system, called ""Avviatore Automatico"", derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs."
"The driver simply selects the combination (series or parallel), and the relative rheostat contactors are automatically and gradually closed by this system; in case of failure, the driver can manually rotate an apposite wheel (that also usually rotates automatically as the system advances) to proceed with the exclusion."
"When the rheostat is completely excluded for the series combination, field shunts can be inserted, or the driver can proceed to parallel combination, making a transition, which is handled by a device called ""CEM"" that automatically combines the motors (closing various contacts) accordingly."
"Originally more than one unit could be coupled and be controlled remotely by the first locomotive using a system called ""Comando Multiplo""; on the central part of the cab there also was a door that enabled the crew to pass from one locomotive to another in case of problems. However, because of safety issues and the imperfect reliability of this system (there were no instruments indicating the status of the slave locomotive, so it was not certain if it correctly made a transition or not, for example), it was abandoned and then disassembled."
"Eleven units received compound-type motors, enabling a very fine speed control, in a range included between in series combination, and in parallel."

The Mustang Aeronautics Mustang II is a two-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding.
"Robert Bushby acquired the rights to the Long Midget Mustang in 1959 and four years later began development of a two-seat, side-by-side version. This eventually flew in 1966 and plans were made available soon thereafter. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992."
"A single engine in tractor configuration airplane, the Mustang II features cantilever low-wing, two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear, or, optionally, tricycle landing gear."
"The aircraft is made from riveted sheet aluminum with a rounded turtle deck and flat sides and bottom skins. Its span wing employs a NACA 64A212 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64A210 at the wingtip. Standard engines used include the Lycoming O-320, the Lycoming O-360 and the fuel-injected Lycoming IO-360 four-stroke powerplants. Standard fuel capacity is 25 US gallons, but optional wet wings increase the fuel capacity to 61 US gallons. Several other fuel tank options are available. A folding wing option may be installed."

Untersee (German: lower lake) may refer to:
= = = Gnadensee = = =
"The Gnadensee is part of Lower Lake Constance (), the western part of the lake."
The Gnadensee lies between Allensbach in the north and the island of Reichenau in the south. In the west it extends to the Mettnau peninsula (Radolfzell) and its eastern end borders on the Wollmatinger Ried Nature Reserve and the Reichenaudamm with its prominent avenue of poplars. The extremely small part in the northwest is called the Markelfinger Winkel. Together with the latter it has an area of 13 square kilometres. It reaches a maximum depth of 19 metres.
"The name of the Gnadensee probably dates to the period when the local judiciary was based on the island of Reichenau. If an accused person was found guilty and sentenced to death, the execution could not take place on the island. It had to be carried out on the mainland as the whole island was holy ground. As a result, the convict was taken by boat to the mainland in the direction of present-day Allensbach, in order that the sentence could be carried out. If the local ruler, the abbot, wanted to reprieve the criminal, he had a bell rung before the boat reached the far shore. This was a signal to the executioner on the mainland that the convict had received a pardon or ""Gnade"" (""mercy"" or ""grace"" in German)."
"Another explanation is that the name Gnadensee is derived from Mary, Mother of God, the ""Lady of our Grace"", and is an ellipsis of the word ""Gnaden[frau]see"" (""Lady of Grace Lake""), as the monastery in Mittelzell was dedicated to Saint Mary."

"The lake is fed by numerous small mountain streams in summer, but only one stream flows out of it into the Salzach. In winter the lake completely freezes and is used for winter sports. In summer the lake is used for pleasure boating (boats powered by combustion engines are not allowed except for the ferries that cross the width of the lake from Zell to Thumersbach, so electrically powered boats can be rented instead). The water is very clear and suitable for swimming or diving, but can be chilly."
"The southern end of the lake, near Schüttdorf, is shallower and mostly filled with water weed, making it unsuitable for boating or swimming."

"The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA), a nonprofit museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, is the only major institution in North America devoted entirely to Russian art and culture from the entire scope of Russia's history. The Museum was founded by prominent art collectors Raymond and Susan Johnson, owners of the largest collection of Russian Realist paintings outside the borders of the former Soviet Union. TMORA was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2002, and opened at its present location in 2005. The museum shows 8-10 exhibitions per year, and hosts over 50 annual events ranging from notable lecturers to classical concerts to theatrical readings. TMORA is open daily, located between Downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport."
"Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an Honorary Consul for the Russian Federation in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions ""to international cultural diversity and education,"" both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens."
"In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a Congregational church and funeral home. The building received special recognition for adaptive reuse from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes of display galleries and administrative offices."
"The renovated gallery space has been host to over 70 exhibitions from Masterpieces of Soviet Era Painting, to historical topics like World War I and the Siege of Leningrad and Russian art forms such as Faberge, Lacquer Boxes, Nesting Dolls, and Ornaments. TMORA also presents shows by living artists, such as Leon Hushcha (a Minnesotan artist of Ukrainian descent) and Canadian-Armenian artist Garen Bedrossian."
"TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including Rossotrudnichestvo, the Russian Embassy in the United States - Washington D.C., the Russian Cultural Center, the State Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), State Russian Museum (St. Petersburg), State Museum of Yaroslaval (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States."

"It was estimated that the Nation of Islam had at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility."
"The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center."
"The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the ""Nation of Gods and Earths"" (NGE/NOGE) or the ""Five Percenters"", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as ""Allah the Father""). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified."
"Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest."
"The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself ""Royall, Allah in Person""."
"After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time."
"W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire ""temple"" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the ""salat"", to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca."
"A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader."
"Although at first the India-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's efforts were broadly concentrated at over large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times."
"""Salafi methodology means that Muslims teach and understand the holy texts, the Qur’an and the prophetic Sunnah by learning Arabic and trying to live as closely to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) as possible. The early Salafis (the first three generations) are referred to as the righteous companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam). Of course, there are some state and federal laws where they must make exceptions, such as getting photos taken for identification purposes and basically obeying secular law. Most Salafis do not wish to participate in modern photography. It is considered haram, which means unlawful in Arabic."""
"Philadelphia has one of the largest concentrations of Muslims in the United States. Philadelphia's Germantown Salafi community is one of the most important, as their community is primarily African American and adherents to the Salafi methodology, according to the first three generations of Muslims. There has been an increase of authentic teachings of Islam in the United States over the past several decades to mitigate many misunderstandings, incorrect deviant sects and harmful, terrorist propagated teachings that are against traditional Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) and his righteous companions. The Germantown community has been one of the largest representatives of this effort. Teachings of correct Aqeedah (creed) and Minhaaj (methodology) according to the authentic prophetic traditions are their foundation."
"The Germantown community has a very Muslim feel with Muslim stores of various sorts. Anything from halal meat shops, clothing, authentic book stores and various Muslim businesses line the commercial corridor. One of the defining representations of the community is seeing Salafi Muslim women dressed in full length black Abayas and Hijabs, Salafi Muslim men wearing the Kufi (style of Muslim hat) mandatory beards and white Thobes (usually white lining robes) with pants underneath and above the ankles as a signature style for the community."
"Conversion to Islam is a practice which is common to African-Americans in prison. J. Michael Waller found that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. According to him, 80% of the prisoners who ""find faith"" while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests."

"Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, the ""Captain Cook"", under Captain Henry Lawrie, and the ""Experiment"", under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel, Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the ""Experiment"" under James Strange, but this is probably a mistake."
"The strait lies between the Mainland and Vancouver Island portions of the Mount Waddington Regional District, a form of regional municipal governance with power over zoning, building and sewer permits and inter-municipal integration. Most communities in the region, however, are Indian reserve communities of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples which are outside the jurisdiction of regional district governance. The traditional territories of most of the various Kwakwaka'wakw peoples overlap in the strait, which is a vital fishery resource and transportation link between their communities."

It is set in the early 1990s during the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The missions take place primarily in the southern Jubba Valley and the capital Mogadishu. The game also features a mission editor with which players can make custom missions."
"The gameplay in ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" differs heavily from earlier installments in the series. While all earlier ""Delta Force"" games focus on long distance outdoor combat and have open ended mission design, ""Black Hawk Down"" focuses on close quarters combat in urban environments with heavily scripted missions more similar to the then-recent . Many of the series' trademark features, such as bullet ballistics and later weapon sway, were abandoned in favour of simpler action-focused gameplay. The player is usually accompanied by a squad of three AI-controlled soldiers, whom the player is able to give simple commands such as the order to hold fire, hold position or throw a grenade."
"Like in earlier ""Delta Force"" games the campaign in ""Black Hawk Down"" is divided into distinct missions. While the campaign is linear, most of the time three missions are available at the same time, allowing the player to complete them in any order. Completing a mission saves the campaign progress and usually unlocks a new one. Already completed missions can be accessed from an ""instant action"" list."
"In addition to the singleplayer campaign, ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" features LAN and online multiplayer with support for up to 50 players in a single match, breaking the record for the largest console multiplayer battles at the time."
"The online multiplayer is powered by NovaWorld which tracks players' statistics, gives them increasing ranks and has a matchmaking system. Various gameplay modes are available including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill as well as objective-based ones. Like in the previous two ""Delta Force"" games players can choose one out of several character classes with individual characteristics."
"The player begins the game as a soldier with Task Force Ranger, commanding 3 team members: Huck, Mother, and Preacher. They take part in the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation during the Somali Civil War. Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of the same soldier. He/she is assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player will still play as that soldier, but is now sent to the 3rd Ranger Battalion and the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force."
The final mission features an alternate history in which the player and a team of operators carry out the assassination of Mohammad Farrah Aidid.
"""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" uses an engine based on ""Comanche 4"" which allows for more detail and advanced visual effects thanks to shader support. Also vehicle movement is not restricted to specific pre-defined paths anymore and the AI drivers are able to avoid obstacles.

"After this victory the whole Italian Kingdom lied on the mercy of the Hungarians. With no Italian army to oppose them, the Hungarians decided to spend the mild winter in Italy, continuing to attack monasteries, castles and cities, trying to conquer them, like they did before they had started to be chased by Berengar's army."
"On 13 December 899 they attacked Vercelli, where the bishop of Vercelli and archchancellor of the Carolingian Empire, Liutward, trying to escape them, taking with him his treasures, accidentally stumbled upon them, so he was killed and his treasures taken away. On 26 January 900 they conquered Modena, and two days later the Abbey of Nonantola, where they burned the monastery and the church, and killed monks."
"In the meantime, on 8 December 899, emperor Arnulf died in Regensburg, so the alliance between East Francia and the Principality of Hungary lost its validity. The Hungarian envoys sent from the new home of the Hungarians, the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, to negotiate the renewal of the alliance, were seen as spies by the guardian and councillor of the new king, the 6 year old Louis the Child, Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz and his advisers, and sent home, having achieved nothing. This started a state of war between the two political communities, so the Principality of Hungary needed the Hungarian army from Italy, which, because they became an important task in the conquest of Pannonia, which was planned by the Hungarians. They had to attack the Bavarian province from South West in the same time when another Hungarian army attacked it from East."
"Before the Hungarians left Italy, in the spring of 900, they concluded peace with Berengar, who gave them in exchange for they departure hostages, and money for the peace. After this defeat, or at the latest from 904, Berengar started to pay them tribute regularly, and until his death in 924, and in exchange the Hungarians helped him against every enemies that he had. As Liuprand writes, the Hungarians became Berengar's friends. It seems that, in time, some of the Hungarian leaders became his personal friends."
"On their way back home, the Hungarians accomplished a military performance, which was never even tried by a land army in the history. Having no ships, boats or any kind of water crafts, on 29 June 900, they ""embarked"" on a sea campaign against Venice. As ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon writes that with their horses and ""leather ships"" to attack first the cities from the coast, then also the city of Venice itself. The ""leather ship"" here refer to an animal skin (goat, sheep, maybe cow) tied up to form something like a huge bota bag, filled with air, tied on their horses sides, which helped the warrior and his horse to float, with which the Hungarians and the warriors of other nomadic societies usually used to cross rivers. They first attacked and burned the coastal towns like Equilio, Cittanova, Fine, Capo d'Argine, then tying the filled animal skins to their horses, they crossed the waters of the Lagoon of Venice, and sacked the island town of Chioggia, which was a part of the Dogado (homeland of the Republic of Venice). Then on the day of the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (29 June), on their ""leather ships"", they tried to enter Rialto and Malamocco, but before they reached the islands, on the place called Albiola the doge of Venice Pietro Tribuno met them with the Venetian war fleet, forcing them to retreat. Although they lost this unusual sea battle, the Hungarians achieved something what was never done by a land army: attacking islands lying in the sea. And although the attack from 29 June was unsuccessful, they succeeded in the attack on the island of Chioggia. This attack was not a violation of the agreement with Berengar, because at that time Venice was not part of the Italian kingdom, but was an autonomous republic under Byzantine influence."
"Historians disagree about the route taken by which the army returned to the Hungarian lands. On one hand György Szabados believes that the Hungarian army turned back home from Italy without entering Pannonia, avoiding it from the south, because in his opinion they were exhausted of continuous fighting in Italy in the last year, and were loaded up with plunders, so they would not be capable to accomplish such an important mission. The same opinion had György Györffy too in 1974."
"On the other hand, Gyula Kristó and István Bóna think that the Hungarian army returning from Italy took part in the conquest of Pannonia, but in different ways. Kristó believes that the returning Hungarian army had the task only to plunder the land, weakening the capability of the inhabitants to withstand the final attack, then crossed the Danube, turning home, and after that two new Hungarian armies, coming from East accomplished the occupation. Bóna believes that the returning Hungarian army played an active role in the conquest of Pannonia, coming from the southwest, when other armies coming from east, from the Eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, crossed the Danube, attacking it from the north and east. He thinks that the Hungarian army came back from Italy because they received an order from home to come help in the conquering of Pannonia, accomplishing it with an encircling movement."

"In the Punjab region, it is traditional to offer sweet Vermicelli to the shrines of Gugga Ji and sweet fried bread (mathya ()). He is worshiped in the month of Bhadon especially on the ninth day of that month. Gugga is meant to protect against snake bites and he is venerated in shrines known as marris. The shrines do not conform to any religion and can range from antholes to structures that resemble a Sikh Gurdwara or a Mosque. When worshipping Gugga, people bring noodles as offerings and also leave them in places where snakes reside. People perform a devotional dance while dancing on the legendary songs of bravery sung in his praise."
"On the day of Gugga naumi, when offering the sweet dish, songs are sung which include:"
Punjabi:

= = = Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum = = =
"Khnumhotep (pronunciation: xaˈnaːmaw-ˈħatpew) and Niankhkhnum (pronunciation: nij-daˌnax-xaˈnaːmaw) were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the Manicurists in the Palace of King Nyuserre Ini, sixth pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as ""royal confidants"" in their joint tomb. They are notable for their unusual depiction in Egyptian records, often interpreted as the first recorded same-sex couple, a claim that has met considerable debate."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded same-sex couple in ancient history. The assumed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing. Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were ""Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King"" (see sections Titularies, Banquents and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw-khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset."
"Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes."
"Egyptian records note Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum as the heads manicurists for the royal family, but they may have held a number of different official titles and duties"
"On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the ""m-r pr Sna"" ""overseer of the magazines"" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms"
"Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress,"" responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, ""jrw Snj"" "" hairdressers, who kept him shaven, and an ""m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt"" ""overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners."" The post of ""Xkrt nswt"" ""adorner of the king"" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt. Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep."
"How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier, and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as ""jr ant pr aA"" ""palace manicurists,"" quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger. A door jamb, besides ""TAtj"" ""vizier,"" displays the title ""HAt-a"" ""one whose arm is in front,"" a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the ""m-r"" and ""jrj"" titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. The ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress"" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of ""jrj-pat"" ""hereditary prince,"" another of Allen's honorifics."
"The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist Ahmed Moussa in the necropolis at Saqqara, Egypt in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King Unas. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both theophorics to the creator-god Khnum) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means ""life belongs to Khnum"" and Khnumhotep means ""Khnum is satisfied;"""
"The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under Nyuserre or Menkauhor. No human remains were discovered inside. It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources."
"In a banquet scene, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical Egyptian art, surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs."
"Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall. For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows:"
"USS ""Wildcat"" was a two masted schooner of 48 tons and was part of a naval fleet, the ""West Indies Squadron"", that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the occurrence of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. She was armed with three guns and had a crew of 31. ""Wildcat"" was commanded by Lieutenant Legare' who sailed her to Washington with a dispatch regarding the disposition of the squadron and other matters concerning the war against piracy in the Caribbean. On 28 October 1824 ""Wildcat"" was lost in a gale with all hands while sailing between Cuba and Thompson's Island, West Indies. Approximately 31 drowned."
= = = Saarbahn = = =
"The Saarbahn is a regional Stadtbahn operating on the tram-train principle in the German state of the Saarland. It consists of a core line in Saarbrücken and Riegelsberg operating under tram operating procedures (BOStrab), connected to two lines that are operated under railway operating procedures (EBO), the Lebach–Völklingen railway to the north and the Saarbrücken–Sarreguemines railway in the south. ""Stadtbahn Saar GmbH"" is responsible for the infrastructure of the central section of line, while the outer tracks are operated by the national railway infrastructure companies, DB Netz AG in Germany and Réseau Ferré de France in France. ""Saarbahn GmbH"" is the train operating company for the whole system."
"The route of the new line of the Saarbahn that was opened in central Saarbrücken in 1997 is essentially line 5 of the Saarbrücken tramway, which was closed in 1965. This line ran between Rastpfuhl and Schafbrücke and was the last line of the old metre-gauge network."
", the current network operates on of route, and serves 43 stations."
"The first considerations of building a regional rail network in and around Saarbrücken began in the 1990s. The bus service in central Saarbrücken then ran at such a high density that the vehicles sometimes operated at one-minute intervals. Following the example of the Karlsruhe model, which had operated with great success since 1992, the Saarland began to plan to build a regional Stadtbahn. The core of the concept was the building of an inner-city railway line, while the outer branches would share the existing Deutsche Bahn railway infrastructure. As early as 1992, it borrowed a light rail vehicle from the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn and ran it on the Fürstenhausen–Gersweiler Bahnhof–Saarbrücken Messebahnhof route on the Rossel Valley Railway (""Rosseltalbahn""), south of the Saar."
"Before the opening of the Saarbrücken city centre line, there was a trial operation between Saarbrücken Central Station (""Hauptbahnhof"") and Hanweiler with Saarbahn vehicles. However, as it was still in the Deutsche Bahn timetable, replacing the previously locomotive-hauled trains on this section, it was operated by Deutsche Bahn. This forward operation began on 29 September 1997 and ended on 24 October 1997, the opening day of the new line through the city centre."
"On 24 October 2007, the Saarbrücken Stadtbahn celebrated its tenth train anniversary. Since inception more than 100 million passengers had been carried, almost twice as many as originally planned. Thus, it had become a great success as a model for other cities considering the establishment of a light railway."
"The core of the Saarbahn—the new line between Brebach station and Ludwigstraße—was put into operation on 24 October 1997, after just under two and a half years of construction. Since its opening, there has been a system separation point between Römerkastell and Brebach station. This is a 90-metre-long non-energised section of the overhead line, which is traversed using momentum, while the vehicle's electric system automatically switches to the other system. Saarbahn railcars coming from central Saarbrücken change from 750 volts DC to 15,000 volts AC and run via Kleinblittersdorf to Sarreguemines, Lorraine. The French section from the border station at Hanweiler has been equipped with the German electric system since 1983. The first light rail vehicle that reached Saarguemines was two-system railcar 810 of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), which ran there on 11 September 1993 during a presentation ride."
"The extension in the northerly direction took place in several stages. It was extended to Cottbuser Platz on 31 July 1999, to Siedlerheim on 13 November 2000, to Riegelsberg Süd on 24 September 2001 and to Walpershofen/Etzenhofen on 26 September 2009. Construction of the Riegelsberg Süd–Walpershofen/Etzenhofen section, required the contribution of additional costs of around €630,000 per year (an amount that was until recently disputed) from the city of Saarbrücken, the municipality of Riegelsberg and indirectly from the Saarland. Clearing work was performed on the former route of the Koller Valley Railway (Lebach–Völklingen railway) through Walpershofen and Dilsburg in January and February 2009, the railway overpass in the center of Walpershofen was renewed in 2009/10 and the reactivation of Heusweiler Markt was largely completed in the summer of 2011. This stretch of track was inaugurated on 30 October 2011."
"Although another system separation point between BOStrab and EEO was instituted at Walpershofen in 2011, the electrical system does not change there because the electric system for the Saarbahn on the Koller Valley Railway also runs at 750 volts DC."
"With the exception of a small section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen over which the Saarbahn runs in an east-west direction along the Russenweg (L 267), which had never been used by a railway, the Saarbahn follows two very different historical railway lines:"
"From Saarbrücken through the Köllertaler Wald (Köller valley forest) and Riegelsberg to Riegelsberg-Güchenbach, Saarbahn follows the course of the historical Riegelsberg tramway: an interurban tram line from St.Johann/Saarbrücken via Riegelsberg to Heusweiler, which was opened in 1907. The line broadly followed today's federal highway 268, which also continues directly from Güchenbach to Heusweiler. The line served the mines in Heusweiler-Dilsburg and Von der Heydt. The tramway was replaced by trolleybuses in 1953 and was replaced in turn by diesel-powered buses in 1964."
"After the new section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen, the Saarbahn reaches, at the Walpershofen/Etzenhofen stop, the line of the former Koller Valley Railway, over which it continues north through Walpershofen to its temporary terminus at Heusweiler Markt."
"A extension of the current line, from the current northern terminus, Heusweiler Markt, north to Lebach-Jabach opened for service on 5 October 2014. This extension will expand the Saarbahn line to cover a total of of route."
"Currently the cross-city route is operated as line S1 between Heusweiler Markt and Sarreguemines, with services every 7.5 minutes during the day on the core section between Siedlerheim and Brebach station. Originally, a five-minute interval service was planned for the central area, but this was rejected because it would have led to operational problems. On the sections using rail tracks between Brebach and Kleinblittersdorf and between Heusweiler Markt and Siedlerheim there is a 15-minute interval service and on the Kleinblittersdorf–Sarreguemines section services operate every 30 minutes only in the morning and every 60 minutes at other times."
"In the off peak hour, services operate at 15-minute intervals in the central section, every 30 minutes to Kleinblittersdorf or Siedlerheim and every 60 minutes to Sarreguemines. In the morning peak for professional and school transport and in the afternoon peak, coupled vehicles are used, otherwise single sets are operated. The Saarbahn carries approximately 40,000 passengers daily."
"Currently there are 28 Flexity Link tram-trains in use, which were manufactured by Bombardier in Vienna and Bruges. Six sets were temporarily loaned to Kassel, where they operated trial runs for RegioTram Kassel. From the timetable change in December 2009, three tram-trains were lent to the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe for use on line S9."
"A line is proposed towards Schafbrücke. Another proposal would include an extension via Burbach to Völklingen station, but this plan has been put on hold, as the effects of mining have to be remedied first. Other plans include an extension to the University, to Rotenbühl, to Alt-Saarbrücken, to Forbach and to Eschberg. , no work has been carried out on any of these proposals."

= = = Autos sacramentales = = =
"Autos sacramentales (Spanish ""auto"", ""act"" or ""ordinance""; ""sacramental"", ""sacramental, pertaining to a sacrament"") are a form of dramatic literature which is unique to Spain, though in some respects similar in character to the old Morality plays of England."
"The ""auto sacramental"" may be defined as a dramatic representation of the mystery of the Eucharist. At least this is the definition that would apply to the ""auto"" of the time of Calderón. It does not so well fit, however, those of the preceding century, many of which were sacramental in character only because they were presented during the feast of Corpus Christi. They are usually allegorical, the characters representing, for example, Faith, Hope, Air, Sin, Death, etc. There were some indeed, in which not a single human character appeared, but personifications of the Virtues, the Vices, the Elements, etc."
"The ""auto sacramental"" was always presented in the streets in connection with the celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi. It was preceded by a solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, the houses along the route being decorated in honor of the occasion. In the procession appeared the priests bearing the Host under a splendid canopy, followed by a devout throng, in which, in Madrid, often appeared the king and his court without distinction of rank, and last of all, in beautiful cars, came the actors from the public theatres who were to take part in the performance. The procession usually halted before the house of some dignitary while the priests performed certain religious ceremonies, the multitude kneeling meanwhile as if in church. At the conclusion of these, the auto was given. These performances, and the procession as well, were given with much splendor and at great expense, being limited only by the resources of the particular town in which they took place."
"Religious exhibitions were popular with the public in Spain as early as the 13th century. These typically consisted of simple dialogue, presented at Christmas, Carnival, Good Friday, or Easter during religious festivals. As time progressed, the celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi became larger and with that came the desire for drama surrounding the feast day and honoring the Eucharist became apparent. The first ""autos"" were derived from religious material that already existed, but by the beginning of the 16th century, the first true ""auto"" ""sacramental"", meaning the theme of the play was the mystery of the Eucharist, was presented. It was ""El Auto de San Martin"", by Gil Vicente."
"During the 16th and 17th centuries these ""autos"" continued to appear, being gradually improved and elaborated until brought to their highest state of development by Calderón. He has left about seventy ""autos"", the best known of which are ""The Divine Orpheus"", a work of considerable poetic merit, ""The Devotion to the Mass"", and ""The Captivity of the Ark"". His ""autos"" were the most popular and were the only autos performed in Madrid from 1647 to 1681. These ""autos sacramentales"" produced a great effect on the people. From time immemorial, allegory of every kind had powerfully appealed to them, and these autos took a strong hold on the popular favor, coming as they did during religious festivals, with their music and their splendor, coupled with the fact that they were given at public expense and with the sanction of the Catholic church."
"Citing disrespect of the Eucharist, Charles III declared the presentation and performance of autos prohibited by royal decree in 1765."
"Gil Vicente [c.1465 – 1536/1537]: wrote in Portuguese and Spanish; considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Juan de la Encina; wrote very early ""autos"""
"Juan de la Encina [1468 – 1529]: considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Gil Vicente; in 1496 published book called ""Cancionero"" of eight églogas, the precursor for the ""auto"" ""sacramental""."
"Juan de Timoneda [c.1520 – 1583]: wrote six ""autos"", including ""La Oveja Perdida""; author of the only ""autos"" written in Catalan."
Lope de Vega [1562 –1635]: wrote around 400 autos; 42 surviving text including “The Harvest” and “The Wolf Turned Shepherd”
"José de Valdivielso [1565 – 1638]: author of the book ""Doce autos sacramentales y"" ""dos comedias divinas"", published in 1622; precursor of Calderón de la Barca in the use of allegory."
"Pedro Calderón de la Barca [1600 – 1681]: considered most prolific of the writers of ""autos""; two well-known autos are ""La cena del rey Baltaza,"" or ""Belshazzar's Feast"" and ""El gran teatro del Mundo"", or ""The Great Theater of the World"""

The western part climbs small hilltops, often with a beautiful view of the Trondheimsfjord. The eastern part is almost flat."
"There is lush vegetation along the track, with birch, pine, spruce, Rowan, alder, and hazel, the latter being very common in the western part of the track.

"The Hall of Worthies, or Jiphyeonjeon (; ), was a royal research institute set up by Sejong the Great of the Korean Joseon Dynasty in March 1420. Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation. The Hall of Worthies is well-known for its role in compiling the Hunminjeongeum, the original treatise on Hangul."
"The Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press."
"The Hall of Worthies participated in various scholarly endeavors, one of which was compiling the Hunminjeongeum. Hangul was personally created by Sejong the Great, and revealed by him in 1443. Afterward, King Sejong wrote the preface to the Hunminjeongeum, explaining the origin and purpose of Hangul and providing brief examples and explanations, and then tasked the Hall of Worthies to write detailed examples and explanations. The head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, was responsible for compiling the Hunminjeongeum. The Hunminjeongeum was published and promulgated to the public in 1446."
"Confucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history. This compilation of works would become the book ""Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships"" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later."
"Besides contributing to the Hunminjeongeum and publishing the Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture."
"The Hall of Worthies was disbanded by King Sejo () after many of its members (notably the six martyred ministers) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong. However, a similar organization, the Hongmungwan (), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period."

= = = Eolith = = =
"An eolith (from Greek """"eos"""", dawn, and """"lithos"""", stone) is a chipped flint nodule. Eoliths were once thought to have been artifacts, the earliest stone tools, but are now believed to be geofacts (stone fragments produced by fully natural geological processes such as glaciation)."
"The first eoliths were collected in Kent by Benjamin Harrison, an amateur naturalist and archaeologist, in 1885 (though the name ""eolith"" was not coined until 1892, by J. Allen Browne). Harrison's discoveries were published by Sir Joseph Prestwich in 1891, and eoliths were generally accepted to have been crudely made tools, dating from the Pliocene. Further discoveries of eoliths in the early 20th century – in East Anglia by J. Reid Moir and in continental Europe by Aimé Louis Rutot and H. Klaatsch – were taken to be evidence of human habitation of those areas before the oldest known fossils. The English finds helped to secure acceptance of the hoax remains of Piltdown man."
"Because eoliths were so crude, concern began to be raised that they were indistinguishable from the natural processes of erosion. Marcellin Boule, a French archaeologist, published an argument against the artifactual status of eoliths in 1905, and Samuel Hazzledine Warren provided confirmation of Boule's view after carrying out experiments on flints."
"Although the debate continued for about three decades, more and more evidence was discovered that suggested a purely natural origin for eoliths. This, together with the discovery of genuine early Lower Pleistocene Oldowan tools in East Africa, made support for the artifact theory difficult to sustain."

To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat was created: a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Kahn imprisoned Tsung in the cobalt mines."
"Kung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao created a partnership and friendship between two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Rayden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own."
"With ""Conquest"" immediately following TNT's top-rated program, ""WCW Monday Nitro"", WCW wrestlers Meng and Wrath filmed separate appearances. Former QVC model Dorian John played the barmaid Magda in the episodes ""Twisted Truth"" and ""Quan Chi."""
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the ""Mortal Kombat"" film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Television Distribution distributed the series. The program was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. The Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the ""Mortal Kombat"" property), as New Line's corporate sibling-turned-parent, syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, which aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats of the first-run syndication run. With a lucrative timeslot following ""WCW Monday Nitro"", ""Conquest"" was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the ""MK"" timeline."
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it enjoyed a more successful run on television. Unofficial collections produced in the UK consist of unrelated and edited episodes merged so that each disc contains a theme, and some of the DVDs contain spelling errors on the covers. Several episodes of the series, consisting of one show per disc, were released in Germany; two of the discs feature episodes centered around Kreeya and Sub-Zero. DVDs were also recently released in Portugal, with many spelling errors on the covers. In 2015, Warner Home Video released ""Mortal Kombat: Conquest - Season One"" on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time."
"In 2010, 4thletter! ranked ""Conquest"" as sixth on the list of ""The Top Ten Most Ridiculous Things to Come Out of Mortal Kombat"". In 2011, 1UP.com featured the series in the article ""The Top Ten Times Mortal Kombat Went Wrong"", calling it a ""wire-fu disaster""."
= = = Just'a Lotta Animals = = =
Just'a Lotta Animals is a fictional superhero team that appeared in stories published by DC Comics. The team is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody of the Justice League of America.
"Just'a Lotta Animals originally appeared in the series ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!"" as the name of a superhero comic book written and drawn by Captain Carrot's alter ego, Roger Rodney Rabbit. Various panels of the Just'a Lotta Animals' comic that were shown in the ""Captain Carrot"" series were often parodies of classic Justice League storylines. The team was in fact the original proposal by Zoo Crew creators Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw for a funny animal superhero series for DC, but DC's editor Dick Giordano asked them to create original characters instead. They agreed and created the Zoo Crew, but still ended up introducing the Just'a Lotta Animals team in the series."
"In ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew"" #14 and #15, in a storyline titled ""Crisis On Earth-C!,"" the Just'a Lotta Animals were finally revealed to actually exist, on a parallel Earth named ""Earth-C-Minus"" (as opposed to the world of the Zoo Crew, which was named ""Earth-C""). The two teams united to defeat the villains of the story, Dr. Hoot (an owl mad scientist) and Feline Faust (a cat sorcerer; an analog of Justice League villain Felix Faust)."
"The team's imagery was brought to life by a confused paranormal teenager in the second part of the ""Young Justice: World Without Grownups"" storyline."
"Just'a Lotta Animals lived on the parallel world of Earth-C-Minus, and made its headquarters in an orbiting satellite space station."
"Events and characters on Earth-C-Minus were considered to be fictional to natives of Earth-C, similar to how events and characters of Earth-Two were considered as fictional on Earth-One. Additionally, events and characters on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One. Like Earth-C, the names of characters and locations tended to make heavy use of various animal-based puns."
"After the events of the 1985 miniseries ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"", it was revealed that Earth-C-Minus (and Earth-C) survived intact, as they were actually ""alternate dimensions"" instead of parallel Earths, although the most recent mini-series ""Captain Carrot and the Final Ark"" has suggested that Earth-C is now also considered Earth-26, one of the new 52 parallel Earths in the new DC Multiverse."

"The DC Nation block of programming on Cartoon Network features a variation on the Just'a Lotta Animals in Farm League (identified earlier as the Justice League of Animals). In the initial image released, some variations included Superman as a duck, Batman as a mosquito, Wonder Woman as a mouse, Green Lantern as a cat, Martian Manhunter as a vulture, Cyborg as a flea, B'wana Beast as a bear, Lex Luthor as a hairless monkey, Brainiac as a bull, etc. However, a subsequent preview from San Diego Comic-Con International instead revealed Superman as a manatee named Supermanatee, Batman as a mongoose named Batmongoose (voiced by Diedrich Bader), Wonder Woman as a wombat named Wonder Wombat, The Flash as a fish named The Flish, Green Lantern as a warthog named Green Lamprey, Aquaman as a mandrill named Aquamandrill, Captain Marvel/Billy Batson as a pig named Shazham!/Billy Bacon, Robin as Robin's Egg, Cyborg as a bug named Cybug, Darkseid as a duck named Duckseid, the Joker as a frog named the Croaker, Catwoman as a cat named Cat Cat, Mister Mxyzptlk as a chicken, Solomon Grundy as a rabbit named Solomon Grunny, Two-Face as a bull named Moo-Face, Bizarro as a dog named Bizarfo, Captain Cold as a cod fish named Captain Cod, Sinestro as a hippopotamus named Sinestropotamus, Lex Luthor as a bald-headed liger named Lex Liger, and Ambush Bug as a slug named Ambush Slug."

"Ipatiev House () was a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg (later renamed Sverdlovsk) where the former Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (1868–1918, reigned 1894–1917), his family, and members of his household were executed in July 1918 following the Bolshevik Revolution. Its name is identical to that of the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, from where the Romanovs came to the throne. As an act for the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolutions, it was demolished in 1977 by orders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the local communist soviet government, almost 59 years after the Romanov family execution and 14 years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1990–1991."
"In the 1880s, Ivan Redikortsev, an official involved in the mining industry, commissioned a two-story house to be built on the slope of a prominent hill. The length of the facade was 31 metres. In 1898, the mansion passed to Sharaviev, a gold dealer of tainted reputation. Ten years later, the house was acquired by Nikolai Nikolayevich Ipatiev, a military engineer, who turned the ground floor into his office."
"It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Pyotr Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Ural Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called ""The House of Special Purpose."""
"The Imperial Romanov family moved in on 30 April 1918 and spent 78 days at the house. This household included Tsar Nicholas Romanov, his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, their four daughters, their son and heir Alexei, the Tsarevich (crown prince); their court physician Dr. Yevgeny Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov, and valet Alexei Trupp. They occupied four rooms on the upper story of the Ipatiev House, while their guards were housed on the ground floor. From early July, command of this guard was taken over by Yakov Yurovsky, a senior member of the Ural Soviet."

= = = Boomer Sooner = = =
"""Boomer Sooner"" is the fight song for the University of Oklahoma (OU). The lyrics were written in 1905 by Arthur M. Alden, an OU student and son of a local jeweler in Norman. The tune is taken from ""Boola Boola"", the fight song of Yale University (which was itself borrowed from an 1898 song called ""La Hoola Boola"" by Robert Allen (Bob) Cole and Billy Johnson). A year later, an additional section was appended, borrowed from the University of North Carolina's ""I'm a Tar Heel Born""."
"The phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" refers to the Land Run of 1889, in which the land around the modern university was settled. ""Boomers"" were people who campaigned for the lands to be opened (or tried to enter the lands) before passage of the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889. ""Sooners"" were land thieves who settled before the lands were officially opened, giving them an unfair advantage on finding, fencing, and claiming farm land. If the charge of early entry was proven, they would lose their claimed land."
"The OU marching band plays the fight song when the team takes the field and when the team scores a touchdown, a field goal, makes a big play, or makes a play in general. They also play it along with other fight songs while the Oklahoma defense is on the field to encourage the crowd to get loud. Some fans have informally counted it being played between 70 and 90 times a game."
"ESPN writer Doug Ward has called the combined effect of ""Boomer Sooner"" and OU's horse-drawn Sooner Schooner wagon ""as potent a one-two fight song/mascot punch as you'll find in college football."""
"On October 15, 1983 the University of Oklahoma football team visited Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Sooner squad played poorly at first, and within 10 minutes Oklahoma State was winning by a score of 20-3. A policeman escorted Gene Thrailkill, the Oklahoma band director, off the field for not having a sideline pass. Before he was forced to leave, Thrailkill shouted to the band members, ""I want you to start playing and don't stop 'til the team's ahead!"" The band complied, and played ""Boomer Sooner"" non-stop roughly 300 times. The team responded by scoring 15 unanswered points against Oklahoma State. After an OSU fumble with 1:17 left in the game, Oklahoma scored a field goal to win 21-20. OU coach Barry Switzer awarded the game ball to the band (known as ""The Pride of Oklahoma"") for the non-stop effort and labeled it ""The Day The Pride Won""."
"AEW commentator and Oklahoma native Jim Ross uses the fight song as his entrance theme. He also often uses the phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" to signify a good moment."
"In recent years, ""Boomer Sooner"" has been adopted as a chant at Sooner football and basketball games. One side of Owen Field or the Lloyd Noble Center chants ""Boomer!"" with the other side chanting ""Sooner!"" The chant has frequently been heard at recent Heisman Trophy presentations, led by 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims."
"The tune of the song is also used for Albania's popular national song, ""Shqipëri, atdhe i dashur!"" (""Albania, dear fatherland!""), also known as the Alphabet Hymn. The tune was borrowed by Parashqevi Qiriazi, who penned patriotic lyrics to fit it, after the historic Congress of Manastir which decided the Albanian alphabet."
= = = Larry Tanenbaum = = =
Lawrence M. Tanenbaum (born 1945) is a Canadian businessman and chairman of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). He owns a 25% stake in MLSE through his holding company Kilmer Sports Inc.
"Tanenbaum was born to a Jewish family, son of Max (owner of York Steel) and Anne Tanenbaum. and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Cornell University in 1968."
"The family's patriarch, Abraham Tanenbaum, left Parczew, Poland, north of Lublin, for New York in 1911. Two Toronto-bound friends from the same town persuaded Abraham to join them. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Abraham was driving a horse and cart through residential and industrial areas of Toronto looking for scrap metal. By 1914, just before the war in Europe, Abraham had saved enough to bring his wife, Chippa Sura, and two young sons Joseph and Max to accompany him in Toronto. Abraham prospered and constructed the Runnymede Iron and Steel Company into a major steel fabrication company and real estate empire. His son, Max, who founded his own company, York Steel, had seven children, among them Larry, who studied economics at Cornell University."
"Tanenbaum is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as president and CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction, Kilmer developed into a multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer's road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer's wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited."
"Tanenbaum served as chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada's largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren's activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America's largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As a result of this merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the board and chaired its finance committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA."
"Today, Kilmer's roots in construction are expressed through innovative real estate development and leading edge public private partnerships (P3). Its Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund reclaims contaminated land in the urban context, through sophisticated risk management and optimizing for highest and best use. Its Kilmer Developments is currently managing three P3's: The Quickload Container Examination Facility in Prince Rupert, B.C.; the 20 Ontario Highway Service Centre locations under the ONroute banner, in partnership with HMS Host and Canadian Tire; and in partnership with Dream, designed, financed and constructed the 2015 Pan Am Games Athletes’ Village, which has been converted into condominiums as part of the Canary District Project. Kilmer is also part of the consortium that has acquired the passenger terminal operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport."
"Kilmer has a long history of private equity investment, beginning in 1975 as a significant shareholder of CUC Broadcasting, where Tanenbaum served on the board of directors and the executive committee of the company. At the time of its sale in 1994 CUC was Canada's fifth largest cable company, with operations that included paging, publishing, satellite, and radio broadcasting."
"Most recently, Kilmer, in partnership with Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling out of Kansas, acquired the Coca-Cola bottling and distribution operations for all of Canada. The new operation, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, is owned by Tanbridge Partners LP, of which Tanenbaum is co-chairman."
"Kilmer's other current private equity investments include Chaleur Sawmills Limited Partnership, Fornebu Lumber Company Inc. and Cypress Five Star Inc., the Canadian franchisee of Five Guys Burgers and Blaze Pizza."
"In addition to its direct investing activities, in 2000 Kilmer founded Kilmer Capital Partners Limited, a private equity investment fund manager, which established two funds to provide equity capital to small and mid-market companies. Tanenbaum is chairman of Kilmer Capital. Kilmer Capital's investments have included Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp., McGregor Industries Inc., Unisync Corp. Inc., Vansco Electronics Ltd., Atelka Enterprises Inc., Altasciences Inc., Compact Power Inc. and Tribal Sportswear."
"Tanenbaum recently served as a member of the advisory council, Toronto Board of Trade. He also served as a member of the Ontario Investment and Trade Advisory Council; as a member of the advisory committee, Toronto Prosperity Initiative; and as a member of the independent fiscal review panel of the City of Toronto; and the Mayor's Economic Competitiveness Advisory Committee of the City of Toronto."
"Tanenbaum has had a long-standing interest in the sports and entertainment area and to that end in 1991 he spearheaded the effort to bring an NBA franchise to Toronto. In 1996 an interest was acquired in the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and arena. In 1998 Tanenbaum was an active force in the acquisition of the Toronto Raptors basketball team and the Scotiabank Arena, which, with the Toronto Maple Leafs formed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Tanenbaum is chairman of MLSE, chairman of the board of the National Basketball Association, and a governor and member of the executive committee of the National Hockey League, the NBA, and Major League Soccer (Toronto FC professional soccer club, which MLSE also owns). He is Co-Chair – Toronto 2026 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario."
After World War I it became part of the British mandate territory of Tanganyika. The British administration continued to reserve and exploit forests.
"Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates (about 4% compared to the Tanzanian national average of 2.1%), a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania. Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuel wood."
"70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost. Its ecosystems were significantly disrupted by foreign-controlled logging companies which carried out large-scale deforestation from the 1950s onwards. A sawmill at Tanga processed East Usambara timber, and its output was increased in the 1970s with Finnish development funding. Major land and forest degradation remains a pressing issue."
"There are still many places that attract visitors looking for experiences beyond developed tourist resorts. These include the trade town of Lushoto (German colonial era Wilhelmsthal), the once popular German resort Amani Nature Reserve and farm, and the Mazumbai University Forest, which is considered the last example of a pristine tropical forest in the East Usambaras."

"The New York Peace Society was the first peace society to be established in the United States. It has had several different incarnations, as it has merged into other organizations or dissolved and then been re-created."
"David Low Dodge founded the society in 1815, soon after the end of the War of 1812. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as Gibraltar and Malta, describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on Christian grounds."
"In 1828, the society merged with others in New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts to form the American Peace Society."
"The society was re-formed as an independent organization in 1837. Until 1844, it sought to prevent war against Mexico by advocating negotiation. It then dissolved. An attempt was made to re-create it, but this was short-lived."
"The society was founded anew for the final time in 1906, in the context of the Philippine–American War, the rapid expansion of American influence and military usage abroad and the rise of the Anti-Imperialist League. It was organized by Oscar Straus and Charles Levermore with the support of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie."
"The society was involved in a ""National Arbitration and Peace Conference"" in 1907. During the First World War, the society helped to organize the League to Enforce Peace in opposition to American involvement."
"In 1940, the society merged into the Quaker World Alliance for International Friendship through Religion."
= = = National Awami Party (Wali) = = =
The Wali Khan faction of the National Awami Party was formed after the 1967 split in the original NAP between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan. The Wali Khan faction was later named National Awami Party (NAP) after the separation of East Pakistan.
"The NAP was banned twice during its eight-year-long existence, the first time under Yahya Khans government in 1971 and the second time in 1975 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government. It was then resurrected under the name National Democratic Party, from which in turn was formed the Awami National Party."
"The Party represented left wing views in Pakistan and its core politics was based on the disbanding of the One Unit, restoration of adult franchise (1967–1970), land reforms, protection of tenants' rights, redistribution of wealth through nationalisation, Pakistan becoming a confederacy as well as the holding of fair elections, protection of an independent judiciary and freedom of the press. It contested the 1970 election, winning the second largest number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the largest in Baluchistan, and a handful of seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly. It failed to win any seats in Punjab and Sindh."
"After the division of Pakistan in 1971, NAP formed coalition governments in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on the basis of winning majority of seats in the two provinces. Arbab Sikandar Khan was appointed Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo Governor of Balochistan. Sardar Akhtar Mengal was elected the first Chief Minister of Balochistan and the NAP supported Mufti Mahmud of the JUI as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The party was disbanded in 1975 amidst a government crackdown. It was resurrected in 1976 under the National Democratic Party under Sherbaz Mazari but split in 1979 following disagreements amongst the left wing of the party against the leadership."
"A brief attempt was made to resurrect the Party by Ajmal Khattak under the name National Awami Party of Pakistan in 2000, however the party was routed in the 2002 election and much of its leadership merged back with the ANP."
"On 30 November 1967 the NAP split between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan, ostensibly because Bhashani sided with China while Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, along with Khan Abdul Wali Khan, sided with the USSR in the Sino-Soviet split."
"Following the split, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. Soon after, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by Afzal Bangash, then decided to leave the NAP and establish the Mazdoor Kisan Party."
"The NAP party leadership struggling with a rivalry between Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Mahmudul Haq Usmani for the Presidency. Ultimately the leadership backed Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate. The National Council of the Party met on 30 June and 1 July 1968 at Royal Hotel, Peshawar, with Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President of East Pakistan NAP chairing the first session. Abdul Wali Khan was unanimously elected as President of the party."
Office Bearers
"The National Awami Party was a socialist political party that advocated greater provincial autonomy and the Theory of Four Nationalities. The theory advocated by senior NAP leader Bizenjo stated Pakistan was composed of four distinct ""nations"", the Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Western Punjabi."
"The party contested the 1970 elections from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh and East Pakistan. It did not field any candidates in the Punjab, Nationally it fielded 16 candidates from K-P, three of whom got elected, securing 18.4% of the vote, in Balochistan three out of four candidates were elected but it failed to win any seats from Sindh."
"In 1971, in an attempt to avert a possible showdown between the Military and the people of East Pakistan, on March 23, 1971, Khan, along with other Pakistani politicians, jointly met Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They offered support to Mujeeb in the formation of a government, but it was already too late to break the impasse as Yahya Khan had already decided on a full scale military crackdown. Pakistan's increasing vulnerability and widespread international outrage against the military crackdown eventually created a situation that led to war between Pakistan and India. This war proved disastrous and culminated in Pakistan's armed forces being defeated in East Pakistan and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Shocked by the defeat, Yahya Khan resigned from office and the military. Under General Gul Hassan Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was brought back from America and appointed President."
"During the martial law crackdown against East Pakistan, the National Awami Party under Wali Khan was one of a handful of parties that protested the military operation. In one case, Khan helped a senior East Pakistani diplomat's son escape to Afghanistan from possible internment in West Pakistan. The military government, in retaliation against the protests, banned the party and launched mass arrests of party activists."
"In 1972, as the opposition leader, Wali Khan was contacted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who wanted to lift martial law and set up a new constitution. Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the NAP signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the Tripartite Agreement. The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This led to the formation of National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto."
"In 1972, Wali Khan was elected as Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the NAP made several initiatives to broaden its support across the country. It dropped its demand to rename the then North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunistan, declared Urdu as the provincial language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and espoused federalism with greater autonomy for the provinces. Senior party leader Ghaus Bux Bizenjo advocated that Pakistan consisted of four nationalities and their empowerment equally would prevent the breakup of Pakistan."

"The Agreement among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa (also known as the Tripartite Accord, Three Powers Accord or New York Accords) granted independence to Namibia from South Africa and ended the direct involvement of foreign troops in the Angolan Civil War. The accords were signed on 22 December 1988 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by the Foreign Ministers of People's Republic of Angola (Afonso Van-Dunem), Republic of Cuba (Isidoro Malmierca Peoli) and Republic of South Africa (Roelof F. Botha)."
"In 1981 Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs for newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan, had developed a linkage policy. It tied apartheid South Africa's agreement to relinquish control of Namibia, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, and to retreat from Angola, to Cuba's withdrawing its troops from Angola. On 10 September 1986 Cuban president Fidel Castro accepted Crocker's proposal in principle. The South African government also accepted the principle of linkage; it proposed the concept at the UN 7th Plenary Meeting on 20 September 1986 (the Question of Namibia)."
"The concept was strongly rejected by a Cuban-backed majority, with representatives strongly stating their opposition to the effect of, ""... The UN... Calls upon South Africa to desist from linking the independence of Namibia to irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola as such linkage is incompatible with the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978);..."""
The Angolan and United States governments started bilateral talks in June 1987 while the civil war continued. There is disagreement amongst historians on how the various parties agreed to come to the table:
"In the words of Chester Crocker, ""Watching South Africa and Cuba at the table was like watching two scorpions in a bottle."""
"After refusing direct talks with Cuba, the US agreed to include a Cuban delegation in the negotiations, who joined on January 28, 1988. The three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9 in London. The South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May expecting UN Security Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister Magnus Malan and President P.W. Botha asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only ""if Russia and its proxies did the same."" They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. On 16 March 1988, the South African ""Business Day"" reported that Pretoria was ""offering to withdraw into Namibia – not from Namibia – in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon."" However the UN plenary meeting of 1986 indicates that the South Africans were linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal. The Cuban negotiator, Jorge Risquet, announced that Cuba would stay in Angola until the end of apartheid, probably also as a negotiation ploy. (Apartheid did not end until more than 4 years after Cuba left Angola)."
"The Cubans suggested that the U.S. was worried whether the Cuban forces would stop their advance at the Namibian border. Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, rejected the South African demands, noting that ""South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield."""
"According to the book ""32 Battalion"" by Piet Nortje, during this campaign South Africa introduced its new secret weapons, the G5 and G6 howitzer guns. The cannons can fire a projectile over with a high degree of accuracy. The guns were used to halt the Cuban advance to the south and raised the specter of yet another unaffordable arms escalation between two medium-sized military powers. The South Africans assert that the new weapon raised Cuba's fear of more casualties in a war where Cuban fatalities had outnumbered South African fatalities by a factor 10. Conversely, the Cuban air force held air superiority, as was demonstrated by the bombing of the strategic Calueque complex, and the overflights in 1988 of Cuban Mig-23's of Namibian airspace. According to David Albright, South Africa believed that the discovery of preparations for a nuclear weapon test at the Vastrap facility created an urgency amongst the superpowers to find a solution."
"The negotiations reached a deadlock that was broken by the South African negotiator, Pik Botha, who convinced Jorge Riquet that, in the words of Botha ""...We can both be losers and we can both be winners..."" Pik Botha offered a compromise that would appear to be palatable to both sides while emphasising that the alternative would be detrimental to both sides."
"While the hostilities in Angola continued, the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. Finally all approved an outline agreement of ""Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in South Western Africa"" on 20 July. During the negotiations, the South Africans were asked to release imprisoned ANC activist Nelson Mandela as a sign of goodwill, which was denied. A ceasefire was finally agreed upon on August 8, 1988. Mandela remained in prison until 2 February 1990, when South Africa lifted the ban on activities of the ANC African National Congress."
"The negotiations were finalised in New York with Angola, Cuba and South Africa signing the accord on 22 December 1988. It provided for the retreat of South African forces from Angola, which had already taken place by 30 August; the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia; and Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola within 30 months."
"The agreement followed the American linkage proposal which had also been pushed by South African on numerous occasions in 1984 and in 1986 (the UN plenary meeting). Namibia was to gain independence on terms that South Africa had set out, including multi-party democracy, a capitalist free-market economy, and a transition period."
"The South African Army left Angola by 30 August 1988, before the conditions for Cuba's withdrawal had been agreed. Cuban troops began withdrawing on 10 January 1989, and the withdrawal was finalised in stages one month early on 25 May 1991."
"The Angolan government offered an amnesty to UNITA troops under the premise that UNITA would be integrated into the MPLA under a one-party state economy. That concept was rejected by UNITA. The situation in the country was anything but settled, and civil war continued for more than a decade."
"According to ""Presidents of Foreign Policy"" by Edward R. Drachman and Alan Shank, a series of meetings and accords between UNITA and the MPLA, brokered by various African leaders, failed horribly. UNITA was insulted by MPLA's insistence on a premise of a one-party state. A combination of MPLA dismay of intervention from the USA (backing UNITA and forcing a shift in power) led to the MPLA dropping the one-party state and opening the door to a multi-party democracy, with the inclusion of UNITA as a competing party. After some 18 years of war, that was a tremendous breakthrough."
"The elections were declared ""generally"" free and fair by the UN, with the MPLA gaining just under 50% of the vote. However UNITA, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said that the election had been neither free nor fair. Following the Halloween Massacre, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi directed UNITA forces to take up arms again against the MPLA. However, the US now opposed UNITA, instead pressuring Savimbi to accept the election results. The war ended after Savimbi's death, in 2002."
"In preparation for independence, free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote. Namibia gained independence in March 1990. SWAPO was originally a Marxist party that intended to install a one-party state. The South African government rejected that premise until the fall of the Soviet Union and SWAPO assured that it would support a multi-party democracy with a capitalist, free market economy."
South Africa held onto Namibia's economic port of Walvis Bay for an additional 18 months until it was assured that SWAPO would respect the newly-founded constitution and the principle of a multi-party democracy.
"Osada's placement there was noted in ISU's decision not to continue this dual-grouping policy, because her scores in free skating would have placed her 7th in ""Group A"" in that segment, which would have placed her significantly higher overall. However, she was never given the opportunity to place above 16th in free skate, due to her placement in ""Group B."" By contrast, many strong compulsory figure skaters who were poor free skaters ended up placing high in the end, because they were guaranteed at least a 15th-place finish in free skating, as long as they placed in the top 15 after short program."
"Given the way Osada skated in the 1982–1983 season, many expected her to continue to progress in the world ranks. However, she placed poorly in compulsories at 1983–1984 All Japan Championships, where she finished 4th, costing her the opportunity to compete at the Sarajevo Olympics in 1984. Around this time, Osada experienced a growth spurt, which made her triple jumps less consistent and less dynamic. Although she won a couple of bronze medals at NHK Trophy, she was never able to regain her national title, nor was she able to make the Japanese world or Olympics team. By 1986, she was no longer training seriously, as she shifted her focus to her studies at Hosei University. She retired quietly after the 1989 season."

"David Arthur Gnohéré (born November 20, 1978) is a retired Ivorian-born French professional footballer. His brother, Harlem, is also a footballer."
"Gnohéré's first taste of English football came at Lancashire club Burnley. After a successful trial period at the club, he signed a contract to be a part of Stan Ternent's squad in 2001. 'King Arthur', as he was effectively nicknamed, became a firm fans' favourite at the club with his dominant displays and his excellent runs up the field from defence."
"His finest hour was in a local derby away at Preston North End. He stunned the Lilywhites with two goals, including one from a classy set up from Alan Moore. He was a constant fixture in the Burnley team during the 2001/2002 season, where Burnley looked likely to gain promotion to the Premier League."
"Gnohéré failed to live up to his early form at Burnley in the following seasons and was subsequently released when his contract expired. He joined Queens Park Rangers after an initial loan, but left the club at the end of the 2004/05 season. During his spell at QPR, he scored once in the Football League Trophy against Kidderminster Harriers."
"After a spell out of the game, Gnohéré signed for Oxford United in August 2007. However, after a string of poor performances for the U's and the return of regular defenders from injury, the club decided not to renew his month-to-month contract, and he was released on October 2007."
= = = BglII = = =
"""Bgl""II is a type II restriction endonuclease isolated from certain strains of ""Bacillus globigii""."
"The principal function of restriction enzymes is the protection of the host genome against foreign DNA, but they may also have some involvement in recombination and transposition."
"Like most type II restriction enzymes, ""Bgl""II consists of two identical subunits that form a homodimer around the DNA double helix. Each monomer is 223 amino acids and symmetrically bind both sides of the unique palindromic nucleotide sequence AGATCT, cleaving the scissile phosphodiester bond between the first Adenine and Guanine nucleotides on both strands of the DNA molecule, creating sticky ends with 5' end overhangs."
"Being a type II restriction enzyme, ""Bgl""II does not require ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for its enzymatic function, but only requires association with a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg. Unlike other restriction enzymes of its class, ""Bgl""II has been shown to possess some unique structural characteristics, such as a β-sandwich subdomain, and appears to undergo a unique conformational change upon dimerization, but its overall structure and mechanism of catalysis remain consistent with other type II restriction enzymes."
"Restriction endonucleases play a very important role in modern molecular cloning techniques. Because of their unique recognition/cut sites, restriction enzymes can be used to precisely cut DNA at specific locations in a predictable manner. Once cut, the DNA (usually) possesses so-called ""sticky ends"", which can then allow the DNA fragment to hybridise into a DNA vector. Ligating enzymes are used to covalently link the desired fragment to the vector for subsequent DNA cloning."
"""Bgl""II catalyses phosphodiester bond cleavage at the DNA backbone through a phosphoryl transfer to water. Studies on the mechanism of restriction enzymes have revealed several general features that seem to be true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the phosphodiester bond. Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, as well as a general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O)."
"Although restriction endonucleases show little sequence similarity, crystal structures reveal that they all share a highly similar α/β core consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices, two of which mediate dimerization. This core carries the active site (catalytic center) and the residues that contact DNA in the major groove. ""Bgl""II is unique in that its α/β core is augmented by a β-sandwich subdomain that has several projections that extend outward to grip the DNA, allowing ""Bgl""II to completely encircle the DNA molecule. This atypical feature of ""Bgl""II suggests a unique hinge motion for DNA binding and release."
"Comparative structural studies of the free enzyme vs. the ""Bgl""II-DNA complex showed that the enzyme opens by a dramatic scissor-like motion, accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the α-helices at the dimer interface. These structural studies also revealed that within each monomer a set of residues lowers or raises to alternatively sequester or expose the active site residues. These dramatic differences in structure in the free vs. bound enzyme have yet to be observed in any other restriction endonuclease and may possibly represent a novel mechanism for capturing DNA that may extend to other proteins that encircle DNA."
"Structural studies of endonucleases have revealed a similar architecture for the active site with the residues following the weak consensus sequence Glu/Asp-(X)-Glu/Asp/Ser-X-Lys/Glu. ""Bgl""II's active site is similar to other endonucleases', following the sequence Asp-(X)-Glu-X-Gln. In its active site there sits a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg, that interacts with Asp-84, Val-94, a phosphoryl oxygen, and three water molecules. One of these water molecules, is able act as a nucleophile because of its proximity to the scissile phosphoryl (its orientation being fixed by a hydrogen bond with the side chain amide oxygen of Gln-95) and its contact with the metal cation (which lowers its pK, promoting the water's nucleophilicity)."

"Offit grew up in Baltimore, the son of a shirtmaker. He went to his father's sales meetings and reacted negatively to the tall tales told by salespeople, instead preferring the clean and straightforward practice of science. When he was five years old, he was sent to a polio ward to recover from clubfoot surgery; this experience caused him to see children as vulnerable and helpless, and motivated him through the 25 years of the development of the rotavirus vaccine."
"Offit decided to become a doctor, the first in his family. Offit earned his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his M.D. from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. One of his mentors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was Maurice Hilleman, who developed several of the major vaccines in use today."
"By 2008 Offit had become a leading advocate of childhood immunizations. He was opposed by vaccine critics, many of whom believe vaccines cause autism, a belief that has been rejected by major medical journals and professional societies. He received a death threat and received protection by an armed guard during meetings at the CDC. His 2008 book ""Autism's False Prophets"" catalyzed a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the U.S. He donated the royalties from the book to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit serves on the board of the American Council on Science and Health. In 2015, Dr. Offit appeared in a vaccine awareness video created by Robert Till in which he advocated for teenage vaccinations."
"Offit worked for 25 years on the development of a safe and effective vaccine against rotavirus, which is a cause of diarrhea, and which kills almost 600,000 children a year worldwide, about half as many as malaria kills; most deaths are outside the West. His interest in the disease stemmed from the death of a 9-month-old infant from rotavirus-caused dehydration while under his care as a pediatric resident in 1979."
"Along with his colleagues Fred Clark and Stanley Plotkin, Offit invented RotaTeq, a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Since 2006, RotaTeq has been one of two vaccines currently used against rotavirus."
"In February 2006, RotaTeq was approved for inclusion in the recommended U.S. vaccination schedule, following its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Premarketing studies found that RotaTeq was effective and safe, with an incidence of adverse events comparable to placebo. RotaTeq has been credited (by Peter Hotez) with saving hundreds of lives a day. Offit received an unspecified sum of money for his interest in RotaTeq. Offit was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in 2015."
"In 2002, during a period of fears about bioterrorism, Offit was the only member of the CDC's advisory panel to vote against a program to give smallpox vaccine to tens of thousands of Americans. He later argued on ""60 Minutes II"" and ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" that the risk of harm for people getting the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting smallpox in the U.S. at the time."
"In December 2013, Sarah Erush and Offit declared the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a moratorium on the use of dietary supplements without certain manufacturers' guarantee for quality."
"Offit defines alternative medicine as quackery when it involves unappreciated harm and replacement of conventional therapies that work, with alternative therapies that don't. His books and articles warn against expense and risk to health for recipients of alternative therapies. In 2013 Offit wrote the book ""Do you believe in Magic? – The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine."" Offit states that the purpose of the book ""is to take a critical look at the field of Alternative Medicine – to separate fact from myth."" and that ""There's only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't.""(p. 6) One of Offit's concerns is the scare tactics he says proponents of Alternative Medicine will often use, in a 2010 podcast with the ""Point of Inquiry"" Offit stated ""it is very difficult to unscare people when you scare them."""
Offit has said that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 should be overturned to provide proper oversight and action against supplement providers.
Offit has blamed Rachel Carson for millions of deaths from malaria because of her campaign against DDT.
"Offit is a recipient of numerous awards, including the J. Edmund Bradley Prize for Excellence in Pediatrics from the University of Maryland Medical School, the Young Investigator Award in Vaccine Development from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the 2013 Maxwell Finland Award for Scientific Achievement and a Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health. In 2018, Offit was awarded the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC for his work on the oral rotavirus vaccine and his leadership in promoting immunization."
"In 2011 Offit was honored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization with the 2011 Biotech Humanitarian Award. Offit donated the award’s $10,000 prize to the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Also in 2011, Offit was elected to the Institute of Medicine at the group's annual meeting. In 2013 Offit was presented with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) for ""Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine"". ""Offit is a literal lifesaver... educates the public about the dangers of alternative medicine, may save many, many more."""
"Michael Specter wrote that Offit ""has become a figure of hatred to the many vaccine denialists and conspiracy theorists."" Specter reported that Offit had often been threatened with violence by anti-vaccine advocates, necessitating precautions such as screening Offit's packages for mail bombs and providing guards when Offit attends federal health advisory committee meetings. At a 2008 vaccine activism rally in Washington, D.C., environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. criticized Offit's ties to drug companies, calling him a ""poster child for the term 'biostitute'."""
"Also in 2008, Sharyl Attkisson published an article for CBS News questioning Offit's independence, citing his financial ties to vaccine manufacturers. Offit said he is upfront about the money and that it doesn't affect his decisions. Curt Linderman Sr., the editor of the Autism File blog, wrote online that it would ""be nice"" if Offit ""was dead""."
"Such criticism has provoked statements in Offit's defense. Peter Hotez, a professor and vaccine researcher at George Washington University, has been quoted in a ""Newsweek"" article:"
"Offit has written or co-written several books on vaccines, vaccination and the public, and antibiotics, as well as dozens of scholarly articles on the topic. Isabelle Rapin, a neurology professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, wrote in ""Neurology Today"" about ""Autism's False Prophets"":"
"In ""The Cutter Incident"" (""see"" Cutter Laboratories incident), Offit describes fallout relating to an early poliovirus vaccine tragedy that had the effect of deterring production of already licensed vaccines and discouraging the development of new ones. Offit advocates for the repeal of religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, saying that such exemptions amount to medical neglect."

"Randall v. Orange County Council, 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998), was a case before the Supreme Court of California that established that groups such as the Boy Scouts of America are not considered ""business establishments"" as used in the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act and could not be subject to its provisions. Its companion case was ""Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America"", 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998)."
"Twin brothers Michael and William Randall were Cub Scouts, a membership division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), in Anaheim Hills with Den 4, Pack 519 of the Orange County Council. They were on their way to earning the Bear Badge which included, in one of its four advancement areas, a religious component that asserted the existence of God and required the practice of one's faith as ""taught in your home, church, synagogue, mosque, or religious fellowship,"" as well as a pledge asserting their duty to God which was included in the opinion of the court:"
"We are lucky the people who wrote and signed our constitution were very wise. They understood the need of Americans to worship God as they choose. A member of your family will be able to talk with you about your duty to God. Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. ""I, ____, promise to do my best to do my duty to God and my country."""
"The Randalls stated at their local Cub Scout den meeting that they had a conflict with the religious requirement. The den leader asserted to the children's mother that the requirement was necessary to proceed through the ranks. The Orange County Council agreed with this position. While initially the Orange County Council allowed the Randalls to continue to participate in Scouting activities, it refused to allow them to advance in the ranks until they asserted their duty to God."
"The mother, as guardian ad litem, filed suit against the Orange County Council, alleging that the Council reversed its initial decision and expelled the Randalls from the Boy Scouts."
"The Superior Court for the County of Orange ruled at the initial trial that the BSA was considered a ""business establishment"" under the terms of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act because of the preponderance of the defendants evidence that illustrated the BSA's extensive real estate holdings, revenue-generating interests, and commercial enterprises. The court ordered statutory damages of $250 awarded to the plaintiffs and a ""permanent injunction against [the BSA], preventing it from excluding [the Randalls] from membership or advancement in the organization or in a den, pack, troop, or post based upon [the BSA's] religious beliefs or lack thereof, their refusal to swear an oath or a duty to God, or to use the word ""God"" in any pledge, oath, or promise or vow, or their failure to participate in any religious activities."""
"The BSA appealed the decision to the California Court of Appeal which upheld the core of the decision (that the BSA was subject to the Unruh Civil Rights Act) based on the court's earlier decision in ""Curran"", 147 Cal.App.3d 712 (1986), but reversed the injunction. The Supreme Court of California granted review."
"In a 7-0 ruling, the Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower court based on their decision in ""Curran"", 17 Cal. 4th 670, that the BSA did not qualify under the Unruh Civil Rights Act as the court found it to be a ""charitable organization"" with interests unrelated to the economic benefit of its members, and that it did not have a commercial interest in the activities provided to its members."
"As a sidebar, the Randalls reached the rank of Eagle Scout before being expelled from the BSA as a result of court prohibiting further actions by the BSA regarding their expulsion until the case was resolved."

Danny O'Dwyer from GameSpot gave the game a 9/10, praising its techno and intense soundtrack, entertaining, engaging and challenging gameplay, well-designed controls, striking and vibrant visuals, improved enemy placement, lengthy story, as well as the huge variety of characters, levels and locations. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective. However, he criticized the lack of weapon customization. He summarized the game by saying that ""This is a confident follow-up which improves upon the original in almost every way. This is a tremendously stylish game which entertains throughout, and delights in forcing you out of your comfort zone."
"Chris Carter from Destructoid also awarded the game a 9/10, praising the open-ended gameplay, engrossing story, accessible interface and level-creator, as well as the game for allowing players to utilize creativity and strategy in every level. However, he criticized the poor AI. He summarized the game by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2"" may not be as ""profound"" as its predecessor, but it's still a bloody good time."" Chloi Rad from IGN gave the game an 8.8/10, praising its high replay value, engaging story, sizable maps, rich characters' backstory, character-specific abilities, the improved lock-on system as well as the level-design, which demands players a new and more cautious approach towards dangers. However, she criticized the occasionally frustrating levels. She summarized the review by saying that """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is a great game and a worthy sequel. It's more confident in its style, storytelling ability, and level design than the first game."" Alex Carlson from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4.5/5, praising its seedy and visceral art design and its improvement on its predecessors gameplay, but criticized its adherence to the established formula. He summed up the review saying """"Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"" is purposely discomforting and hypnotically visceral. It's one of the best games released so far this year."""
"Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com gave the game a 7/10, while praising the narrative as well as the brutal violence featured in the game, which he stated ""has tread a fine, sophisticated line between titillation, power, and reflection, an integral part of both narrative and mechanics."", he criticized the oversized maps, as well as the game for being overly difficult, frustrating as enemy attack players where they can't be seen from the camera angle, and restrictive as the game forced players to play a certain way very often. Chris Thursten from PC Gamer gave the game a 57/100, criticizing the meaningless characters, alienating rape scene, rigid playstyle restriction, inconsistent AI, frustrating and unavoidable death as well as technical issues. Yet he still praised the soundtrack, where the ""experience is enormously enhanced by their work"". He summarized the review by saying that ""Restrictive design decisions sap the energy from a series that revels in it, and technical issues deal the killing blow."""
"The demo shown at Rezzed and the 2013 Penny Arcade Expo featured gameplay in the tutorial that had players appear to attempt to assault a woman sexually as the Pig Butcher. The player character lowered his pants and straddled the woman before the scene is interrupted by the director of ""Midnight Animal"", revealing the whole sequence to be a film shoot."
"Video game journalists, including Cara Ellison of ""PC Gamer"", spoke out against the usage of sexual assault imagery. In response, Dennis Wedin stated that Dennaton cut the scene from the demo, and that they were reconsidering putting the scene into the final game. Wedin also stated that they cut the scene short to show that that type of violence is not what the ""Hotline Miami"" series is about."
"On 15 January 2015 it was reported that because of the implied rape scene, the game had been refused classification in Australia, which prohibits sale within the country, effectively preventing its wide release there. In an official statement from Devolver Digital and Dennaton Games the creators mentioned that they have added a cut and uncut option for the slasher-flick level. Dennaton also reconfirmed that the context of the scene is important and that they were ""concerned and disappointed"" by the actions of the Classification Board, stating it stretched the facts in its judgment of the game. The statement concluded with Dennaton confirming that they will not challenge the ruling. Developer Dennaton Games have since suggested that people in Australia interested in the game should pirate it if they are unable to purchase a retail copy."
"With the release of the Nintendo Switch ""Hotline Miami Collection"" in August 2019, the game was no longer banned in Australia, with a new rating MA15+. According to Devolver, they had applied for a International Age Rating Coalition process for the collection as part of the requirement for publishing on the Switch. Though originally denied a rating one time, they successfully obtained the appropriate rating on a second submission. Devolver states that this automated rated may still end up challenged by the Australian board later."

One (Temple) had been a football-only Big East member before entering into full membership in The American. The remaining four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) had previously been members of Conference USA."
"All teams in the American qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded based on conference record and then a tie breaker system was used. Teams seeded 7–10 had to play in the opening round and teams seeded 1–6 received a bye to the second round. Louisville and Cincinnati finished with identical 15-3 records and shared the regular season title.

"From 2004-2006 it had a sister channel 4Sport, but because of hard competition it closed again."
"Today the channel shows old Danish movies from the 1930s and 1940s, speedway, basketball and programs about camping. 60% of the Danish population can see the channel."
Former Minister of Health Torben Lund is the director of the channel.

"Michael Whelan, ""the Poet of Renous"", was born in 1858 in Renous, New Brunswick. He worked as a school teacher, and as a book-keeper for a local mill. He is, however, best known for his poetry celebrating the Miramichi, including the famous Dungarvon Whooper. He died at Chatham, New Brunswick (now Miramichi, New Brunswick) in 1937."
= = = TRAMP complex = = =
"TRAMP complex (Trf4/Air2/Mtr4p Polyadenylation complex) is a multiprotein, heterotrimeric complex having distributive polyadenylation activity and identifies wide varieties of RNAs produced by polymerases.It was originally discovered in ""Saccharomyces"" ""cerevisiae"" by LaCava et al., Vanacova et al. and Wyers et al. in 2005."
It interacts with the exosome complex in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is involved in the 3' end processing and degradation of ribosomal RNA and snoRNAs. The TRAMP complex trims the poly(A) tails of RNAs destined for Rrp6 and the core exosome down to 4-5 adenosines assisting in transcript recognition and exosome complex activation. The substrate specificity of exosomes is improved in the presence of TRAMP complex as it acts as a crucial cofactor and helps in maintaining various activities.
"In this way, TRAMP plays a critical role in ridding the cell of noncoding transcripts generated through pervasive RNA polymerase II transcription, as well as functioning in the biogenesis and turnover of functional coding and noncoding RNAs."
"TRAMP complex also affects various other RNA processes either directly or indirectly. It is involved in RNA export, Splicing, hetero-chromatic gene silencing and helps in maintaining stability of genome."
Pol(A) Polymerases showed various genetic interactions with DNA Topoisomerases Top1p and hence they were called topoisomerase-related function Trf4p and Trf5p due to this interaction with DNA it has an important part in genomic stability. In the cell Trf4p is in higher concentration as compared to Trf5p and also has a stronger effect on the phenotype. Trf4p is present throughout the nucleus while Trf5p is mainly found mainly in nucleolus. The Trf4p structure consists of a central domain and a catalytic domain which is similar to the structure of canonical polymerases.
The non-canonical Poly(A) polymerases (Trf4p or Trf5p) of the TRAMP complex which belong to the Cid1 family do not contain RNA recognition motif (RRM) therefore additional proteins like Air1/Air2 are required by the non-canonical polymerases for polyadenylation.
The zinc knuckle proteins Air1p/Air2p (Arginine methyltransferase-interacting RING-finger protein) are mainly involved in the binding of RNAs. There are five CCHC (C stands for Cysteine and H stands for Histidine) zinc knuckle motifs which are present in between the C and N terminals.
"In Air2p proteins, the fourth and fifth zinc knuckle have different roles. The fourth zinc knuckle have a role in RNA binding while the fifth knuckle is important for protein-protein interactions. Air2p interacts with the central domain of Trf4p and polyadenylation activity of Trf4p is dependent on this interaction as deletion or mutation of the knuckles hinders the polyadenylation activity. Air1p is responsible for inhibiting methylation of Npl3p (a protein which is responsible mRNA export). Air1p/Air2p also direct abnormal mRNPs to TRAMP pathway and bring about their degradation."
"The Ski2 like helicase Mtr4p was discovered during the screening of heat resistant mutants that gather Poly(A) RNA in the nucleus and is mainly involved in unwinding activity. Mtr4p (also called as Dob1p) is an SF2 helicase and belongs to DExH-box RNA helicases family consisting of two RecA like domains. It also consists of WH domain (Winged Helix domain), an Arch domain (also called as stalk and KOW domain [Kyprides, Ouzounis, Woese domain]) and helical bundle domain. The packing of the WH and helical bundle domains on surface of the helicase core results in the formation of a channel for ssRNA."
"Mtr4p requires ATP or dATP hydrolysis for RNA duplex unwinding mediaited by Q-motif. A single-stranded region 3' to the paired region is also essential for the unwinding activity of Mtr4p. Through direct contact with various components of exosome, Mtr4p helps in proper addition of RNA substrates of TRAMP complex to nuclear exosome."
"The difference between non-canonical and canonical Poly(A) Polymerases is that canonical polymerases help in maintaining mRNAs and its activity is regulated by a specific sequence in the mRNA while polyadenylation of non-canonical polymerases uses a different regulated sequence in the RNA and specifies RNAs for degeneration or processing. Canonical polymerases belong to DNA polymerase β superfamily whereas non-canonical polymerases belong to Cid1 family, another main difference is the length of the poly(A) tail; canonical polymerases can add many adenylates thus the RNA produced has longer poly(A) tails while non-canonical polymerases on the other hand can produce RNAs with shorter length of poly(A) tails as they can add only few adenylates."
"The TRAMP complex brings about degradation or processing of various RNAs with the help of 3’->5’ exonuclease complex called the exosome. A hexameric ring of RNase PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain proteins, Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p, Rrp46p and Mtr3p comprises the exosome of ""S. cerevisiae"". The exosome can bring about RNA degradation more efficiently in the presence of Rrp6p with the help of TRAMP complex invitro. Also, RNA degradation is enhanced in the presence of various exosome cofactors which are recruited co-transcriptionally."
"The Ski complex consisting of Ski2p, Ski3p, Ski8p is required by cytoplasmic exosome for all mRNA degradation pathways. The cytoplasmic exosome along with the Ski7p protein attaches to various abnormal ribosomes and mRNAs and brings about their degradation."
"All the components of the TRAMP complex are inter-related to each other. For the activity of Poly(A) polymerases likeTrf4p/Trf5p, zinc knuckle proteins are essential. In similar way RNA degradation brought about by exosomes is stimulated by unwinding activity of Ski2 like helicases and Mtr4p which acts as a cofactor. The unwinding activity of Mtr4p is improved by the Trf4p/Air2p in the TRAMP complex. Mtr4p also has an important role in maintaining and controlling the length of Poly(A) tails. But destruction or absence of Mtr4p results in hyperadenylation and hinders the length of Poly(A) tails."
"A complex formed between Trf5p, Air1p and Mtr4p is called as TRAMP5 complex. In ""S. cerevisiae"" there are two types of TRAMP complexes depending on the presence of polymerases. If Trf4p is present, then the complex is called as TRAMP4 and if Trf5p is present then It is called as TRAMP5."
"RNAs produced by all three polymerases (Pol I, II, III) act as substrates for TRAMP complex. TRAMP complex is involved in processing and surveillance of various RNAs and degrade abnormal RNAs. Different type of RNA substrates include ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs(snRNAs), Long transcripts of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) etc. But the mechanism by which TRAMP complex identifies various substrates is unknown."
The TRAMP complex works more efficiently in RNA processing by engaging Exosome complex exonuclease RrP6 wherein Nab3(RNA binding protein) plays a crucial role.
Post-transcriptional modifications due to various enzymes like methyltransferase Hmt1p (Rmt1p) may have an indirect effect on chromatin maintenance. The chromatin structures are affected when RNA substrates of TRAMP complex are transcribed across the genome. Various TRAMP components interact physically and genetically with various proteins and bring about changes in chromatin and DNA metabolism.
"Components of the TRAMP complex in ""Saccharomyces cerevisiae"" are conserved in other organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.The TRAMP complex components of ""Schizosaccharomyces pombe"" including Cid14p, Air1p, and Mtr4p are functionally similar to the components of TRAMP complex in ""S. cerevisiae""."

"The nested neutron spectrometer (NNS) is a tool used for neutron spectroscopy. The NNS is used to measure the energy spectrum of neutrons in a neutron field. This type of detector is used in both research facilities (for characterization of neutron fields) and workplaces, where neutron radiation maybe encountered, for radiation protection purposes. Due to the difficulty associated with the detection of neutrons, the NNS is one of the few pieces of equipment capable of accurately determining the characteristics of a neutron field."
"The NNS operates under the same principle as a Bonner sphere neutron spectrometer. The sensitive part of the spectrometer is the Helium-3 proportional counter, which detects neutrons through the reaction He(n,p)H. This particular reaction has a significant cross-section only at thermal neutron energies. In order for a higher energy neutrons to be detected their energies must be decreased, or ""moderated"". To slow down neutrons at higher energies the NNS uses different amounts of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The He-3 proportional counter is surrounded by varying amounts of HDPE to sample various energy regions of the neutron field. The standard NNS has seven HDPE cylinders which are nested together, similar to Russian nesting dolls, to measure neutrons of higher and higher energies."
"Shown below are spectra of two standard calibration sources measured by the NNS. The measured spectra (blue) is compared to the ISO standard spectra (red). Both Measurements were made at the NIST low scatter facility in Washington, DC."
= = = Aerarium militare = = =
"The aerarium militare was the military treasury of Imperial Rome. It was instituted by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, as a ""permanent revenue source"" for pensions ""(praemia)"" for veterans of the Imperial Roman army. The treasury derived its funding from new taxes, an inheritance tax and a sales tax, and regularized the ad hoc provisions for veterans that under the Republic often had involved socially disruptive confiscation of property."
"The ""praefecti aerarii militaris"" (singular ""praefectus"") were the three prefects who oversaw the treasury."
"The Imperial biographer and historian Suetonius saw the ""aerarium militare"" as a response to the uncertainty of retired military men in need who might be inclined to support a coup or foment unrest. The professionalizing of the army during the Republic created the new problem of veterans, since earlier in Rome's history male citizens served short-term to confront specific threats or carry out seasonal campaigns, and then returned to their normal occupations. The solution in the late Republic had been to settle veterans in colonies in conquered territory, or on ostensibly public land in Italy that in fact had been used by the aristocracy for personal gain; the redistribution of this land by military commanders such as Marius and Pompeius was resented by the elite as a popularist currying of favor among the lower ranks of society. A state-supported benefit helped redirect the former soldier's loyalty from his immediate commanding officer to the Roman state as a whole. Under Augustus, monetary grants replaced land redistributions, and were better received by the upper classes, who nevertheless complained about new taxes."
"Augustus included the ""aerarium militare"" among the accomplishments in his ""Res Gestae"", the commemorative autobiography published posthumously throughout the Empire. In addressing the Senate on the subject, Augustus had stated his intention to provide for military personnel from enlistment through retirement."
"A soldier earned a one-time ""praemium"" or discharge benefit upon completing his service (sixteen years for the Praetorian Guard, twenty for regular duty in the army). At the end of Augustus's reign, the pension for a Praetorian guard was 20,000 sesterces ""(HS)"", and that of a legionary 12,000. In the 1st century, a legionary's retirement benefit would have amounted to about 12 years of service pay. The ""praemium"" remained stable until the time of Caracalla, who increased it to 20,000 ""HS"" for a legionary and a higher but unrecorded amount for a Praetorian guard."
"When the treasury experienced a shortfall, the emperor might avoid paying pensions by arbitrarily extending the length of military service, in a form of forced retention or ""stop-loss policy""."
"The ""aerarium militare"" was part of an Augustan fiscal initiative that was at first greeted with hostility. In 6 AD, Augustus capitalized the pension fund with 170 million sesterces of his own money, along with voluntary contributions from client kings and cities. The amount was insufficient, and after soliciting proposals on revenue enhancement from senators, all of which he rejected, he finally forced through an inheritance tax of 5 percent ""(vicesima hereditatium)"". Inheritances left to members of the deceased's immediate family were exempted, as were estates below a certain valuation."
"The other source of tax revenue for the military treasury—a sales tax of 1 percent on goods sold at auction ""(centesima rerum venalium)""—is less attested."
"The military treasury was located on the Capitoline Hill at the time of Nero, as attested by a military diploma dating to 65 AD. It is unclear whether it was a physical storehouse for coins brought to the capital in payment of taxes, or an office for paper transactions."
"The treasury was administered by three prefects ""(praefecti aerarii militaris)"", who were former praetors at first chosen by lot for a term of three years. Later they were appointed by the emperor. Their precise duties are unclear, though they were not charged with collecting the taxes. They may have served mainly to provide financial management and security. Each senatorial prefect was assigned two lictors and other staff, but the later imperially-appointed prefects had no lictors. (The lictor was an honorary bodyguard who was part of the civil service of Rome.) The change to appointment by the emperor may have been made as early as the reign of Claudius. The younger Pliny was a prefect of the military treasury appointed by Domitian."

The terminal handles barges and container ships for construction aggregate, clothing, fishing apparel, motor vehicles, agricultural produce, seafood, and consumer goods."
"Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring relocated from Maine to Salem in the 1980s to be closer to the source of products they export and utilize the newly established port facilities. In 1990, they opened the Mid-Atlantic Shipping and Stevedoring Wharf, a small wharf terminal that is also utilized by several other shipping companies and located approximately above the entrance of the Salem River at 128 Tilbury Road on the east side of Barber's Basin marina, to handle bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers. It has of berthing space with water depth. It includes of open storage space and utility connections for refrigerated containers. While the wharf is currently owned by Bermuda International Terminals, it is operated by Mid-Atlantic."

"The Port Inland Distribution Network involves new or expanded transportation systems for redistribution by barge and rail for the shipped goods and containers that are delivered at area ports in an effort to curtail the use of trucks and their burden on the environment, traffic, and highway systems. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), and Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), are involved in initiatives to review and develop this network."
"While it was determined that Salem was not an ideal location within the program for handling container shipping for intermodal freight transport, a private sector service provider began in 2010 the short sea shipping of aggregate products with a barge service between Salem and Tremley Point, Linden on the Arthur Kill in the Port of New York and New Jersey. It addresses a critical missing link in multimodal freight transport between ports in the Delaware Valley and the Northern New Jersey's urban Gateway Region."
America's Marine Highway is a similar US Department of Transportation initiative to capitalize on US waterways for the transport of goods for which NJDOT applied and received approval for review and potential development of their initiative into a federally supported project. Salem would be considered for increased transportation by shipping vessels to customers along the East Coast.

The private docks of the Salem Boating Club, across the river in Pennsville, also serve pleasure craft."
"Delaware River and Bay Authority's Three Forts Ferry Crossing was renamed the Delaware City–Salem Ferry in 2013 to reflect changes in service due to Hurricane Sandy damages. The seasonal service, rather than traveling to Fort Mott, departs from Barber's Basin with service across the river to Delaware City, which has the nearby Fort DuPont State Park, with connecting service to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island effective May 4, 2013 for the summer seasonal service. The ferry returned to serving Fort Mott on its previous route (instead of Salem) in 2015 and is now called the Forts Ferry Crossing."

It is part of the Verizon Droid line, and was announced on 23 July 2013 along with the Droid Ultra and Droid Mini at a joint Motorola and Verizon Wireless press conference."
"The Droid Maxx maintains a similar design shape to its predecessor, the Droid Razr HD, including the Dupont Kevlar unibody form. It included Motorola's proprietary X8 Mobile Computing System, which consists of 8 cores: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro applications processor, 4-core Adreno 320 graphics processor, 1 low-power core for natural language processing, and 1 low-power core for contextual awareness processing to enable the new Touchless control feature. The internal battery was increased in size to 3,500 mAh. The on-screen buttons for back, home, and multitask functions were moved to off-screen capacitive soft-keys below the screen. The Droid Maxx also includes Motorola's Active Notification feature."
"Reception towards the device was mostly positive, with the caveat that the device is only available on the US carrier, Verizon Wireless. Some reviewing outlets called the device ""the best Android device available on Verizon Wireless"". Many others praised Motorola's Active Notification system, which turns on part of the AMOLED screen to ""blink"" notifications to the user, in lieu of a traditional LED notification light. The soft touch kevlar unibody as well as the overall physical design was praised as well. Reviewers were mixed to the device's continued use of a 720p HD resolution at a 5 in (130 mm) screen size, though complimented the AMOLED display's brightness, deep blacks, and its benefits to battery conservation."
"The Droid Maxx runs a mostly stock version of Google's Android mobile operating system, initially shipping with the version 4.2.2 ""Jellybean"". Jellybean 4.2 included various improvements to accessibility, new lock screen features with quick access to the camera, support for wireless display (Miracast), and a new built-in clock application with world clock, stopwatch, and timer. Motorola and Verizon released an update to Android 4.4 ""KitKat"" on 19 December 2013, and an additional update to Android 4.4.4 on 15 July 2014. KitKat brought restyled navigation bars, ""immersive"" full-screen mode, strongNer security, power management and some other minor improvements. Motorola also enhanced its proprietary camera software for better color, exposure, and dynamic range accuracy and included the updated Google Hangouts application which included SMS/MMS messaging functionality. Finally, support for the Square credit card reader was added. The KitKat 4.4.4 update brought further improvements to camera functionality, improved Bluetooth connectivity, and added Isis Mobile Wallet (now called Softcard)."
"The smartphone can share its internet connection over WiFi (hotspot), and can access the Google Play Store, an online distribution platform for the Android OS managed by Google. Users may purchase and download applications developed using the Android SDK, music, movies, television shows, books, and magazine subscriptions."
"The Droid Maxx, like its Moto X sibling, showcases the Google Now function via Touchless Control. By speaking the hot phrase: ""Ok Google Now"" (even while the phone is asleep), the device will launch a voice assistant which taps into Google Now to control the phone and run natural language queries with the Google search engine without requiring physical input from the user. This function makes use of the natural language processor in the X8 system."
"Active Notifications displays relevant notifications to the user while the phone is face-up. The minimalist notifications show on the lock screen as white icons against a black background; power is conserved by not turning on pixels that would display the black background. Furthermore, by use of the Contextual Awareness processor in the X8 system and proximity sensor, the Droid Maxx ""knows"" when it is face-down or in a pocket, and will not display Active Notifications."
"The Droid Maxx user interface consists of three soft keys: back, home, and multitask, lock/power button, and volume rocker keys."
"The construction is a unibody design (no removable panels) and consists of a thin black bezel devoid of any branding surrounding the screen and a DuPont Kevlar sealed back plate in either matte clear or glossy red tint finish. The shape maintains the tapered corner look of the Droid [RAZR] design language.

= = = Pogo mine = = =
The Pogo mine is a gold mine in the state of Alaska. By 31 December 2017 Pogo had produced 3.6 million ounces of gold at a grade of 13.6 g/t. The mine has estimated indicated and inferred mineral resources of 4.15 million ounces of gold at a grade of 14.7 g/t (JORC). It is located northeast of Delta Junction and east of Fairbanks.
"The orebody consists of numerous highly irregular quartz veins, ranging in thickness from with being typical, and ranging in dip from horizontal to vertical with 30-45 degrees being normal. A complex system of faulting offsets the veins both parallel and perpendicular to the strike, resulting in a ""chopped-up"" orebody. Until 2019 the mine utilized drift-and-fill and overhand cut-and-fill mining methods when, under new owner Northern Star Resources, the mining method was changed to longhole stoping. Access to the orebody is via decline and spiral ramp. After blasting, ore is trucked to the central underground ""ore bin"", where it is then fed to a conveyor that takes it out of the mine directly to the mill. Typical daily production is about 2,500 tons of ore yielding approximately 1,000 troy ounces of gold."
"Pogo is notable for its paste backfill system, where 20% of the mine's tailings from which gold has been extracted are mixed with cement and then pumped back underground to support subsequent further excavation. This has the additional environmental benefit of reducing the amount of tailings that need to be stored on surface, minimizing the footprint of the mine's dry-stack tailings storage facility."

"Victor Dalby Lord is a fictional character and patriarch of the Lord family from the American soap opera ""One Life to Live""."
"An original protagonist on the series, Victor is introduced in the first episode as the preeminent mass media magnate of fictional Philadelphia Main Line suburb Llanview, Pennsylvania. Victor was originally and most notably played by actor Ernest Graves. Graves debuted July 15, 1968, and played the role until he left the series and last appeared in March 1974."
"Series creator Agnes Nixon and executive producer Doris Quinlan subsequently recast Victor to Shepperd Strudwick, who first appeared in December 1974 and played the role until the character's initial onscreen death in June 1976."
"Series creator and then-scriptwriter Agnes Nixon originally created the character of Victor Lord based on her father, Harry Eckhardt. She crafted the role in an attempt to understand the reserved, domineering Eckhardt patriarch, an entrepreneur who financially thrived during the Great Depression manufacturing funeral garments."
"Ernest Graves played the role from show's first episode in 1968 through March 1974. Shepperd Strudwick took over the role in December 1974, playing Victor continually through the character's onscreen death June 16, 1976. Tom O'Rourke briefly stepped into the role as a mirage in 1985, and Les Tremayne played the role of Victor in Heaven in 1987. Bill Moor and Terry Caza both appeared in the role in flashbacks from 1994 to 1995. The character was briefly brought back to life 26 years after his original death in January 2003, portrayed by William Stone Mahoney; the resurrection set the soap opera record for the longest span between a character's onscreen death and resurrection. Mahoney went on to play resurrected Victor through his second onscreen death in March 2003, reappearing as a vision for an episode in 2004."
"In the summer of 1968, Victor Lord (Graves) is introduced as the owner of Lord Enterprises founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Main Line newspaper, ""The Banner"", serving the fictional town of Llanview, Pennsylvania. A widower, he is the domineering single father of daughters Victoria or ""Viki"" (originally Gillian Spencer) and Meredith or ""Merrie"" (originally Trish Van Devere). The family inhabits Victor's inherited family estate, Llanfair. His wife, Eugenia Randolph Lord, died while giving birth to Meredith and was, ultimately, unable to produce his desired male heir to his estate (a picture of her hangs above the mantle of the Lord library in early episodes). Victor thereby goes about grooming his eldest child, Viki, to assume the role of running the estate by hiring her as an editor for his newspaper."
"Victoria desperately seeks her father's approval and gleefully assumes the role of heiress to the family fortune. Victor eventually grows weary of Victoria's admiration for one of his star reporters, working class executive editor Joe Riley (Lee Patterson). In the early years, Victor is also unhappy at the growing relationship of his younger daughter, Meredith, with upwardly-mobile doctor Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Jim Storm). He meddles in the personal relationships of his daughters, causing a rift between him and Victoria. In November 1968, unable to reconcile her feelings for Joe and for her father, Victoria develops multiple-personality disorder, manifesting in an alter-ego, ""Niki Smith,"" and begins dating Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini)."
"As Victoria recovers from her first bout with multiple personalities, Victor concedes to the relationships of his white collar daughters to working class gentlemen when he uncovers that he had a long-lost son. Victor embarks on a search for the son he had long yearned for. Viki and Joe first marry in December 1969, and Merrie (Lynn Benesch onward) and Larry (Michael Storm onward) in June 1970. A short time later, Joe apparently dies in a car crash while reporting in California, giving Victor the opportunity to set his widowed daughter up with a suitor more to his liking. With a vacant editor-in-chief position available, Victor replaces Joe with promoted upper-crust writer Steve Burke (Bernie Grant)."
"In 1971, Victoria (Erika Slezak onward) announces her engagement to Steve, which her father approves of; Victor is, however, unhappy when he discovers his continually frail daughter Meredith is seeking to conceive a child with Larry. Merrie is prescribed bedrest and later gives birth to Victor's first onscreen grandchildren, twins (one which dies a childbirth and the other, a grandson named Daniel). In the summer of 1973, in the midst of Victor's search for his son, Meredith is held hostage in the Llanfair carriage house with brother-in-law Vinny when burglars try to steal Victor's prized art collection. A distressed Victor pleads with the robbers to release Meredith during hostage negotiations with Llanview Police Department Lt. Ed Hall (Al Freeman, Jr.). Meredith is viciously assaulted by the thieves, who are killed by the police, and later dies at Llanview Hospital. Victor is devastated by her death, and he (Graves) leaves Llanview in 1974 in search for his heir-presumptive son."
"The hostage crisis of Meredith and Vinny in 1973 saw the introduction of newly minted Dr. Dorian Cramer (originally, Nancy Pinkerton), who Viki dislikes at first sight. Dorian, at first, dates Llanview Hospital co-worker Dr. Mark Toland (Tom Lee Jones), and in the midst of the romance on-the-job in summer 1974. Dorian is suspected of medical malpractice, and all of the hospital board of directors (except for Viki) vote to fire her. Dorian assumes that Viki's was the deciding vote to fire her and vows revenge. When Victor (Strudwick) reappears in December 1974 and suffers a heart attack, and an unemployed Dorian decides to use him to get even with the Lord family."
"Dorian becomes Victor's personal physician in 1975, and the two quickly elope in May. Soon afterward, Tony Harris (George Reinholt) arrives in Llanview, and Dorian quickly realizes he is Victor's long-sought son. Tony quickly becomes friends with Victor, and when Tony uncovers a diary from Viki and Meredith's mother, Eugenia, and realizing Victor to be his estranged father, to the chagrin of a greedy Dorian. Dorian connives and succeeds in creating a rift between Victor and his new son. When Tony and Victor learn of Dorian's scheme, Tony first confronts Dorian, who denies having done anything wrong. On April 30, 1976, when Victor begins questioning Dorian, the ensuing argument leads Victor to have a debilitating stroke which leaves him unable to speak or dictate alterations to his will. Determined to keep her Victor from speaking to anyone, Dorian brings him home and succeeds from keeping everyone away from him. Soon, Victor suffers a second stroke which sends him back to the hospital. Despite his attempts to speak to Viki, Victor apparently dies in June 16, 1976, and Dorian inherits half of his wealth."
"In 1985, Viki commences celebrations of the 50th anniversary of her father's newspaper. During preparations for the celebration, Viki's goddaughter, Tina (Andrea Evans), happens upon a hidden door in the Llanfair library, leading to a secret room. While in the room, Tina stumbles upon a letter written by Victor addressed to Viki, telling of his affair and brief marriage with Viki's former college friend Irene Manning Clayton and the siring of his daughter Tina. When Tina divulges the revelations, Viki reverts to alter-ego ""Niki Smith"" and Tina, for the following year, embarks on a mission to gain what she believes to be rightfully hers as a member of the Lord family. Recovered, Viki later uncovers in 1988 that she had a daughter, Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), while under the hypnosis insisted upon by Victor and delivered by her longtime friend and brother-in-law, Larry. Megan dies of lupus in 1992."
"Viki engages in an extramarital affair in 1993 with writer Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), who authors Victor's biography, ""Lord of ""The Banner"""". While penning the book, Dorian (now, Robin Strasser onward) nervously plots to prevent its publication as Sloan's papers allude to Dorian's complicity in Victor's death, a tale which became a Llanview urban legend in the years following Victor's apparent death. Intrigued by Dorian's intense interest in the book, Viki implores the Llanview Police Department to investigate the circumstances of Victor's death. They comply, leading to the arrest (and conviction, after trial) of Dorian for Victor's murder. When Dorian is sentenced to death by lethal injection, con man David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) arrives in town in 1994, claiming to possess the alleged diary of Viki's late friend and Tina's mother, Irene. Later revealed to be a forgery, the diary claims dead Irene smothered Victor, exonerating Dorian at the eleventh hour. Soon afterward, an actual diary entry from Irene reveals she bore Victor another son, reformed rapist Todd Manning (Roger Howarth)."
"When Viki learns of the initial forgery, Viki, still loyal to her late father, vows to send Dorian back to jail for Victor's death in 1995. Dorian then divulges the source of Viki's multiple personalities—Victor had long molested his eldest daughter Victoria and her repressed memories of the molestation led to the creation of her initial alter-ego, Niki. Victoria then suffered a recurrence of her multiple personality disorder, subsequently releasing several new personalities, who accost Dorian and hold her hostage in Victor's secret room. Upon recovery, Viki comes to terms with her father's inappropriate behaviors."
"Because of the pain she had to endure and dark secrets that were revealed, Viki, who had once worshiped the ground her father walked on and idealized him, now has nothing but contempt, rage, and disgust at Victor's depravity and actions."
"Finally in 2003, following the arrival of Viki's long-lost daughter, Natalie (Melissa Archer), an ailing Victor (William Stone Mahoney) resurfaces. It is during this time when Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) marries Natalie in a plot spearheaded by Victor to kill his granddaughter and harvest her heart, as he was dying of old age and heart disease. Viki foils Victor and Mitch's plot, saving Natalie from impending death. Victor is again rushed to the hospital. Larry tells Victor's present children, Viki and Todd (Howarth), to say their final goodbyes to their dying father. Victor dies on-screen in March 2003, a month before a shocked Dorian returns to Llanview."
"In 2007, during the funeral of Asa Buchanan, Dorian and Viki are trapped together in Asa's wine cellar. The two argue and Dorian tells Viki that she, not Viki, killed Victor. Viki, flabbergasted, reminds Dorian that neither she nor Dorian had killed Victor because he had returned from the dead a few years before. Dorian then plants a seed of doubt in Viki's mind, responding ""if that really was him."" During the episode first aired on November 26, 2008, Viki visits her father's grave, and the date of death shown is ""June 16, 1976"", the date of the episode in which Victor originally died. It was never mentioned onscreen whether or not the Victor who appeared in 2003 was an imposter, and the 2003 storyline is not mentioned again in the series, leading to speculation that it was simply retconned out of continuity."
"In 2011, it was revealed by a back-from-the dead Irene that the man known as Todd (Trevor St. John) since May 2003 was in fact his twin, Victor Lord, Jr. (St. John), and the real Todd Manning (Howarth) had been held hostage by her since his disappearance in March 2003. Victor, Jr. is later seemingly killed on the episode that first aired August 31, 2011. On the original finale January 13, 2012, however, Victor, Jr. is revealed to be alive and being held captive by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick)."
"During an interview with ""TV Guide Canada"" in February 2009, ""Dorian Lord"" actress Robin Strasser, offered a belated explanation for the recent reversal about Victor's murderer:"
"The notion that Dorian is Victor's true murderer is bolstered in the August 16, 2011 episode of ""One Life to Live"". When David Vickers Buchanan mentions that the (albeit forged) entry from Irene Manning's diary cleared Dorian of a murder she did not commit, Dorian comments to herself, ""... or so Viki chooses to believe."""
"From the outset, the original portrayal of Victor Lord by actor Ernest Graves was received as ruthless and overbearing, playing a role introduced as the powerful center of the fictional town of Llanview, and of the lives of his daughters Victoria and Meredith. For his portrayal of a dying Victor, actor Shepperd Strudwick earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1976."
"Leading series actress and onscreen daughter Erika Slezak reflected on Victor's transformation at the 25th anniversary of ""OLTL"" in 1993 recalling, ""Once, Victor Lord was a paragon of virtue, then producer Paul Rauch said, 'let's turn him into a dirty old man who sleeps with young women and keeps pornography in the basement.'"""
= = = Truncated dodecadodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the truncated dodecadodecahedron (or stellatruncated dodecadodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is given a Schläfli symbol t{5/3,5}. It has 120 vertices and 54 faces: 30 squares, 12 decagons, and 12 decagrams. The central region of the polyhedron is connected to the exterior via 20 small triangular holes."
"The name ""truncated dodecadodecahedron"" is somewhat misleading: truncation of the dodecadodecahedron would produce rectangular faces rather than squares, and the pentagram faces of the dodecahedron would turn into truncated pentagrams rather than decagrams. However, it is the quasitruncation of the dodecadodecahedron, as defined by . For this reason, it is also known as the quasitruncated dodecadodecahedron. Coxeter et al. credit its discovery to a paper published in 1881 by Austrian mathematician Johann Pitsch."
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated dodecadodecahedron are all the triples of numbers obtained by circular shifts and sign changes from the following points (where formula_1 is the golden ratio):
"Each of these five points has eight possible sign patterns and three possible circular shifts, giving a total of 120 different points."
"In the process of burial, it is possible that siliciclastic deposits may subsequently be uplifted as a result of a mountain building event or erosion. When uplift occurs, it exposes buried deposits to a radically new environment. Because the process brings material to or closer to the surface, sediments that undergo uplift are subjected to lower temperatures and pressures as well as slightly acidic rain water. Under these conditions, framework grains and cement are again subjected to dissolution and in turn increasing porosity. On the other hand, telogenesis can also change framework grains to clays, thus reducing porosity. These changes are dependent on the specific conditions that the rock is exposed as well as the composition of the rock and pore waters. Specific pore waters, can cause the further precipitation of carbonate or silica cements. This process can also encourage the process of oxidation on a variety of iron bearing minerals."
"Sedimentary breccias are a type of clastic sedimentary rock which are composed of angular to subangular, randomly oriented clasts of other sedimentary rocks. They may form either"
"In the field, it may at times be difficult to distinguish between a debris flow sedimentary breccia and a colluvial breccia, especially if one is working entirely from drilling information. Sedimentary breccias are an integral host rock for many sedimentary exhalative deposits."
"Clastic igneous rocks include pyroclastic volcanic rocks such as tuff, agglomerate and intrusive breccias, as well as some marginal eutaxitic and taxitic intrusive morphologies. Igneous clastic rocks are broken by flow, injection or explosive disruption of solid or semi-solid igneous rocks or lavas."
Igneous clastic rocks can be divided into two classes:
"Clastic metamorphic rocks include breccias formed in faults, as well as some protomylonite and pseudotachylite. Occasionally, metamorphic rocks can be brecciated via hydrothermal fluids, forming a hydrofracture breccia."
"Hydrothermal clastic rocks are generally restricted to those formed by hydrofracture, the process by which hydrothermal circulation cracks and brecciates the wall rocks and fills it in with veins. This is particularly prominent in epithermal ore deposits and is associated with alteration zones around many intrusive rocks, especially granites. Many skarn and greisen deposits are associated with hydrothermal breccias."
"A fairly rare form of clastic rock may form during meteorite impact. This is composed primarily of ejecta; clasts of country rock, melted rock fragments, tektites (glass ejected from the impact crater) and exotic fragments, including fragments derived from the impactor itself."
"Identifying a clastic rock as an impact breccia requires recognising shatter cones, tektites, spherulites, and the morphology of an impact crater, as well as potentially recognizing particular chemical and trace element signatures, especially osmiridium."
= = = Asabiyyah = = =
"ʿAsabiyya or asabiyyah (Arabic: عصبيّة) is a concept of social solidarity with an emphasis on unity, group consciousness and sense of shared purpose, and social cohesion, originally in a context of ""tribalism"" and ""clanism"". It was familiar in the pre-Islamic era, but became popularized in Ibn Khaldun's ""Muqaddimah"" where it is described as the fundamental bond of human society and the basic motive force of history, pure only in its nomadic form. ʿAsabiyya is neither necessarily nomadic nor based on blood relations; rather, it resembles philosophy of classical republicanism. In the modern period, it is generally analogous to solidarity. However, it is often negatively associated because it can sometimes suggest loyalty to one's group regardless of circumstances, or partisanship. Ibn Khaldun also argued that ʿasabiyya is cyclical and directly related to the rise and fall of civilizations: it is most strong at the start of a civilization, declines as the civilization advances, and then another more compelling ʿasabiyyah eventually takes its place to help establish a different civilization."
"Ibn Khaldun describes ""Asabiyyah"" as the bond of cohesion among humans in a group forming community. The bond, Asabiyyah, exists at any level of civilization, from nomadic society to states and empires. Asabiyyah is most strong in the nomadic phase, and decreases as civilization advances. As this Asabiyyah declines, another more compelling Asabiyyah may take its place; thus, civilizations rise and fall, and history describes these cycles of Asabiyyah as they play out."
"Ibn Khaldun argues that each dynasty (or civilization) has within itself the seeds of its own downfall. He explains that ruling houses tend to emerge on the peripheries of great empires and use the much stronger ʿasabiyya present in those areas to their advantage, in order to bring about a change in leadership. This implies that the new rulers are at first considered ""barbarians"" by comparison to the old ones. As they establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax, less coordinated, disciplined and watchful, and more concerned with maintaining their new power and lifestyle. The ʿasabiyya, dissolves into factionalism and individualism, diminishing their capacity as a political unit. Thus, conditions are created wherein a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control, grow strong, and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew. Ibn Khaldun also further states in the ""Muqaddimah"" that ""dynasties have a natural life span like individuals"", and that no dynasty generally lasts beyond three generations of about 40 years each."
"= = = Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre = = ="
Eleanor of Castile (after 1363 – 27 February 1416) was an infanta of Castile and the Queen consort of Navarre.
"She was the daughter of King Henry II of Castile and his wife, Juana Manuel of Castile, from a cadet branch of the Castilian royal house. Eleanor was a member of the House of Trastámara."
"Eleanor was subject to marriage plans with Ferdinand I of Portugal in 1371 however, the King refused the match as he had secretly married noblewoman Leonor Telles de Menezes."
"A betrothal took place in 1373 in Burgos with Prince Charles, heir to his father Charles II of Navarre. The couple were married at Soria in May 1375. A testament dated at Burgos on 29 May 1374, shows that King Henry II bequeathed property to his daughter Eleanor as a part of her dowry."
"However, the newly married royal couple went through certain marital disputes. In 1388, Eleanor asked at a meeting between her husband and her brother John I of Castile, for permission to retire for some time to her homeland of Castile, in order to recover from an illness in the local climate, which she had believed to be best for her health. She took her young daughters, whom she bore her husband during the first thirteen years of their marriage. Eleanor and her children resided in Valladolid and by 1390 she bore two more daughters to Charles. Two years later, she was demanded by her husband to return because they needed to be crowned King and Queen of Navarre as her father-in-law King Charles had died. Eleanor's brother King John supported the request of Charles III. Eleanor did not contend, claiming she was ill-treated in Navarre and believed members of the Navarrese nobility wished to poison her. As a result, Eleanor remained in Castile whilst her husband was crowned in February 1390 in Pamplona. By the end of the 1390s, Eleanor had given her husband six daughters, all surviving infancy but no sons and so for this reason, Eleanor handed her oldest daughter Joanna over to Charles III as she was heiress to the Kingdom."
"0n 9 October 1390, Eleanor's brother John died and was succeeded by his minor son Henry. Charles then again requested Eleanor's return to Navarre however, she refused. Eleanor opposed her nephew's accession and she formed the League of Lillo along with her illegitimate half-brother Fadrique and her cousin Pedro. King Henry opposed the League, he besieged Eleanor in her castle at Roa around mid-1394 and obliged her to return to her husband in February 1395."
"Eleanor then returned to Charles and was very involved in the political life of Navarre. Her relationship with her husband improved and she bore him the long-awaited sons Charles and Louis however, they died young. On 3 June 1403 her coronation as Queen of Navarre took place in Pamplona. Upon several occasions when Charles stayed in France, Eleanor took to the role of regent. She also helped to maintain good relations between Navarre and Castile. As a result of the good relations, members of the Castillian nobility including the Duke of Benavente and members of the powerful families of Dávalos, Mendoza and Zuñiga settled in Navarre."
"Upon the couple's absences, their daughter Joanna acted as regent as she was heiress. Joanna died in 1413 without issue and in the lifetime of both her parents therefore the succession turned to their second daughter Blanche who would eventually succeed as Queen of Navarre upon Charles' death."
There is confusion surrounding Eleanor's death. She is believed to have died at Olite on 27 February 1415 or at Pamplona 5 March 1416. Her husband died in 1425 and they were buried together at Pamplona in the Cathedral of Santa María la Real.
"Eleanor and Charles had eight children, five of their daughters lived to adulthood:"

= = = Japanese swords in fiction = = =
"The katana sword appears in many folk tales as well as legends. This piece of Japanese history not only appears in old folklore, it is also very popular in modern fiction as well as contemporary art pieces such as film and theater. The katana has reached far and wide in the world of fictional stories and can be used to tell tales of wisdom and bravery or evil and treachery. The sword can be seen not only as a tool for the hero but also a tool for the villain."
"Many legends surround Japanese swords, the most frequent being that the blades are folded an immense number of times, gaining magical properties in the meantime. While blades folded hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times are encountered in fiction, there is no record of real blades being folded more than around 20 times. With each fold made by the maker, every internal layer is also folded, and so the total number of layers in a sword blade is doubled at each fold; since the thickness of a katana blade is less than 2 iron atoms, going beyond 20 folds no longer adds meaningfully to the number of layers in the blade. Folding a blade only ten times will therefore create 1024 layers; 20 times will create 1,048,576 layers."
"Furthermore, while heating and folding serves to even out the distribution of carbon throughout the blade, a small amount of carbon is also 'burnt out' of the steel in this process; repeated folding will eventually remove most of the carbon, turning the material into softer iron and reducing its ability to hold a sharp edge. This can be combated with carburization, though it does not produce even carbon distribution, partially defeating the purpose of folding."
"Some swords were reputed to reflect their creators' personalities. Those made by Muramasa had a reputation for violence and bloodshed,"
"while those made by Masamune were considered weapons of peace. A popular legend tells of what happens when two swords made by Muramasa and Masamune were held in a stream carrying fallen lotus petals: while those leaves touching the Muramasa blade were cut in two, those coming towards the Masamune suddenly changed course and went around the blade without touching it."
"Kusanagi (probably a tsurugi, a type of Bronze Age sword which precedes the katana by centuries) is the most famous legendary sword in Japanese mythology, involved in several folk stories. Along with the Jewel and the Mirror, it was one of the three godly treasures of Japan. A common misconception is that Katanas magically sprung into existence in Japan, utterly isolated from the mainland. The technique of folding steel came from the manufacture of the Dao in China, and contact with the mainland would affect how the katana evolved through the centuries. The katana design itself was developed over hundreds of years and the katana design was a development of the Tachi."
"The most common depiction, especially in the Western world, of the Katana is a weapon of unparalleled power, often bordering on the physically impossible. Katanas are often depicted as being inherently ""superior"" to all other weapons possessing such qualities as being impossibly light, nigh-unbreakable and able to cut through nearly anything. By contrast, traditional European weapons are often depicted as clumsy, crude and unwieldy by comparison."
"It is the prime weapon of choice for Japanese heroes in historical fiction set before the Meiji period. Carrying a non-sealed katana is illegal in present-day Japan, but in fiction this law is often ignored or circumvented to allow characters to carry katana as a matter of artistic license. For instance, some stories state that carrying weapons has been permitted due to a serious increase in crimes or an invasion of monsters from other dimensions. With this law in mind, katana are sometimes used for comic relief in anime and manga set in the present, although this is sometimes replaced by the use of a bokken having surprisingly comparable capabilities. In the film """", the main protagonist is permitted to bring her katana on board an airliner; presumably, this is a policy of the fictitious Japanese airline, as other passengers can also be seen carrying swords."
"Due to the renowned quality of the sword and the mysticism surrounding the relationship between the blade and its wielder, the katana appears in various works of fiction, including film, anime, manga, other forms of literature, and computer games. It is frequently used by non-Japanese creators, partly due to its status as an easily recognizable icon of Japan and its high reputation as a formidable weapon in skilled hands. Four well-known appearances in Western culture are Bruce Willis' weapon of opportunity in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", the Bride's signature weapon in ""Kill Bill"" (a film strongly influenced by Japanese samurai movies), the katana used by the main characters in ""Highlander"" and the 1975 Tom Laughlin action/cult Western film ""The Master Gunfighter"". Other iconic appearances for the western audience include a pair of Ninjato carried by the character Leonardo in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchise. Ulrich Stern wields one in the first, second and third seasons of ""Code Lyoko,"" but gains an additional katana in the fourth season and in """"."
"Manga and anime show a prominent feature of katana for specific characters. In the manga ""Bakuman"", the characters while researching on the commonality between the popular manga styles, mentioned Japanese swords are always present in them, including ""InuYasha"", ""One Piece"", ""Bleach"", ""Gin Tama"" and various other examples."
"There are also several manga series that were inspired by the Japanese swords. Kamata Kimiko's ""Katana"" is one such series; it is heavily imbued with the theme of katana with the story plot following an extraordinary teenage boy with the ability to see the 'spirit forms' of swords."
"The sakabatō (逆刃刀) is a type of katana from ""Rurouni Kenshin"", wielded by Himura Kenshin. It is a “reverse-edge sword”, translated in the English-language dub as a “reverse blade sword”. Some companies have created true replicas of the sakabatō."
"The sharpened edge is the inward curved, longer side of the blade – the opposite of a standard katana – making it extremely difficult to kill an opponent; it generally knocks the wielder's enemies ""senseless"" rather than killing them. The only way for the sakabatō to cut is to rotate the hilt by 180 degrees within the hand, thus holding the sword backwards. The sakabatō symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again."
"Video games also provide frequent appearances of the katana, most with unique characteristics. Kaede, the protagonist of the arcade series ""The Last Blade"", Yoshimitsu, the well known ninja from ""Tekken"", and Mitsurugi, the Japanese samurai from the ""Soul"" series also wield Katanas as their default weapons. Katana frequently appear in role-playing video games, such as some ""Elder Scrolls"" games like , , or ""Neverwinter Nights"", as weapons; often faster than a longsword yet less powerful. The browser video game ""Touken Ranbu"" developed by Nitroplus and DMM Games involves the player assuming the role of a sage who has the power to bring historical katana to life. One of the recent appearances of the katana in another video game series is in ""Left 4 Dead 2"", a game made by Valve. In ""Final Fantasy VII"", the character Sephiroth wields a very long katana. Other games in the ""Final Fantasy"" series include a sword called the Masamune, apparently named after the famous Japanese swordsmith. In ""Ninja Gaiden"", protagonist Ryu Hayabusa wields two legendary Japanese swords, the Dragon Sword, a katana which was carved from a Dragon's fang, and the Blade of the Archfiend, a Tachi which was forged from a cursed meteorite. In the ""Devil May Cry"" series, Sparda, the father of protagonist Dante, who is a legendary demon weaponsmith, designed one of his masterpieces Yamato after a traditional Japanese katana, which is then wielded by Dante's twin brother Vergil, who is a master of Iaijutsu."
"In the three video games based on the 2D animated French television show ""Code Lyoko"" (""Get Ready to Virtualize!"", """", and """") Ulrich Stern utilizes his saber to slice and dice monsters."
"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (1987) deals with it twice. In ""Ninja Sword of Nowhere"", an alien spacecraft left a fragment of an alien metal, used to travel between dimensions in a mere microsecond, on Earth thousands of years ago, before a craftsman found the alien metal, forging a Japanese sword. This creates a legend of a sword which allows its owner to show up and disappear whenever he or she wishes. Even ""Sword of Yurikawa"" has a plot with an old Japanese sword."
"The French shows ""Code Lyoko"" and its cancelled sequel """" depict one of its five main characters, Ulrich Stern, with a katana (called ""saber"") as his only weapon on the virtual world of Lyoko and eventually the Cortex region. Usually calling out ""Impact!"" he slashes the programmed monsters of X.A.N.A. in one strike, but can also throw it like a javelin to destroy two or three targets from a distance. At one point, his katana was temporarily modified and upgraded by the false Franz Hopper, capable of charging and emitting a wave of white energy that could wipe out three monsters from a distance. In its fourth season, he is presented with an additional katana, which is easier for him to get a ""close slave."""

"Mangrove Care Forum Bali (MCFB), also known as Forum Peduli Mangrove Bali (FPMB), is formed with the aim to protect, preserve, rehabilitate, replant and educate, as a concerted effort to save the mangroves. Supported by the Artha Graha Peduli Foundation, the team at the Mangrove Care Forum Bali draws from 16 years of experience the foundation has in caring for and operating the Tambling Wildlife Nature Conservation Park, located at South Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, within 356,000 hectares of Tropical Rainforest and 21,600 hectares of Marine Nature Reserve."
"The mangrove forest under the care of The Mangrove Care Forum Bali is located in the Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park, a 1,373.5 hectare mangrove forest at the Benoa Bay Area in Bali. The mangrove forest suffers from severe pollution and misuse, & debris and rubbish from nearby villages. Deforestation of trees and littering its grounds are a common sight. The focus of the Mangrove Care Forum Bali is to involve the communities surrounding the mangrove and enlist regular help to clean up and create a safe environment for plants and marine life to thrive. A further goal is to prevent further abrasion of coastline and to regrow the affected areas to lush mangrove vegetation."
"Initiated by Tomy Winata at the start of 2013, the Mangrove Care Forum Bali is established in partnership with:"
"Cristiano Ronaldo, the famous Portuguese footballer, has been appointed the ambassador for this movement to conserve mangrove by the Mangrove Care Forum Bali. He came on board because of the mangrove forests’ ability to help buffer against tsunamis, a cause he dearly supports after witnessing first-hand the devastation of the tsunamis when he visited Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. He met up with the 8-year-old boy who was found alive after 19 days at sea, dragged out by the unforgiving tsunami, wearing a Portuguese football jersey. survived on puddled water and dried noodles and was reunited with his father and grandfather. His story was later recounted in a book published by Radio 68H ‘Lolos dari Maut Tsunami’."
"The Benoa Bay mangrove forest is both primary and secondary vegetation, meaning parts of it have never been cleared or removed while parts have regrown after the natural and human assisted destruction of the original vegetation. It suffered damage from pollution and construction projects. Mangrove forests can serve as a natural barrier to tidal erosions, and are oxygen providers and a safe haven to many species. The Mangrove Care Forum Bali helps to conserve and nurture life along this coastal sanctuary, and has set 5 key goals in furthering its efforts:"
"The Mangrove Care Forum Bali aims increase community awareness regarding the preservation of the Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park in the long. Education plays a part and the Mangrove Care Forum Bali plans to start an Early Environment Education programme. This activity is targeted at students from elementary level to high school, and plans to reach out to communities around the Benoa Bay area. The methodology and materials of environment education will be adapted to local context (language, case studies and photos) and be part of the regular school curriculum. The Mangrove Care Forum Bali, in collaboration with Universities, Ministry of Forestry and experts in the conservation fields, will develop modules that can be incorporated and accepted by all levels of participants."
"The programme to clean up the beaches had already started in March 2013 with daily activities involving students and the community at large, with the aim of reaching 1,373.5 hectares of mangrove in 5 villages in Benoa Bay."
"Indonesia is an archipelagic country with more than 17,000 islands and 95,181 km of coastline, of which about 6,000 islands are inhabited by over 238 million people. In the 1980s, there are more than 4.2 million hectares of mangroves but half of that coverage has been lost by the end of the 1990s. For centuries, the Indonesian people have relied on the resources provided by the mangroves, for firewood, charcoal, tannin, dyes, food and beverages, medicine, pole and timber. In the early days of commercialization, fishing and charcoal production made the basic economic activities. Now, millions of hectares of mangrove forests are lost to agriculture, oil palm plantations and fish farms, making coastal communities vulnerable to the force of tropical storms and loss of livelihood and products."
"In 2011, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) detected 23 tropical cyclones off the coast, which produced high speed winds, heavy rains, and storm surges that caused flooding and structural damage to buildings and coastal infrastructure. Mangroves are adjacent to major landmasses and big rivers in Indonesia, and mostly found on the coasts of large islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua. The island of Java, where approximately 130 million people live, is particularly vulnerable to tropical storms."
"In 2007, the Indonesian Forestry Ministry established 2 centres for mangrove development. During 2010 and 2011, the centre on the island of Bali planted 8,000 new mangrove trees, and the other centre, in the city of Medan on the island of Sumatra, put in 10,000 new plants. These efforts paled against the continual destruction of the coastal forests in the name of urban development, mainly for agricultural expansion. The realisation and urgency that we need to step up efforts in preserving the mangrove forests is what lead to the formation of the Mangrove Care Forum Bali."
"The Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park is a vast green area located in Benoa Bay. The coast is filled with diversity in nature’s ecosystem, including but not limited to:"
Benoa Bay is a tidal estuary located on the southeast coast of Bali. The estuary is protected by the narrow sandy Benoa Peninsula which protrudes northwards from the southern tip of the harbour and which closes off the entire southern portion of the estuary. Serangan Island which is located to the north partially closes the remainder of the estuary except for a one kilometre navigable stretch of water that separates the southern tip of the island from the Benoa Peninsula. The northern tip of the island is separated from the mainland at high and mid tides by a very shallow straight which is 400 metres at its narrowest point. The entire coastline is protected by an extensive coral reef system that runs continuously apart from a very narrow (200 metre) channel at the harbour entrance at the northern tip of the Benoa Peninsula.
"The human feature of the Bay is the Benoa Port facility located on reclaimed land in the middle of the estuary, and the connecting causeway that stretches 3 kilometres north to the mainland. The causeway being a solid barrier has greatly affected the natural flushing of the bay by tide and stream discharge."
"Benoa Bay is lined with a mangrove forest that has suffered depletion due to development and land reclamation. Estimates are that 50% of the mangrove forest has been lost since 1980 as a result of development. There are many fresh water rivers flowing into the estuary, predominantly those draining the central plains and mountain ranges to the north, and to a lesser extent from the southern Bukit Plateau."
"Benoa Bay suffers from a number of serious environmental problems and in a sense, similar to other estuarine environments, is a focal point for environmental impacts that originate elsewhere in the region. These problems range from eutrophication of the estuary due to nutrient loading through to biological pollution from untreated sewage effluent discharge."
"Three of the fresh water rivers that enter Benoa Bay from the north originate in the agricultural heartland of Bali and reach the estuary after travelling through the highly populated urban centre of Denpasar. Agricultural runoff is particularly high in nutrients from fertilisers and manure from farm animals. In particular crop applications of urea, triple super phosphate and potassium chloride, as well as growth stimulant ZA are common in the catchment area. Fertilisers that are not directly absorbed in the rice fields are carried down through the irrigation system and eventually through rivers and out into the bay. All of the rivers entering the bay have large quantities of excess nutrients and the nutrient loading of the bay is evident with the visible growth of algae and uncharacteristic sea bed grasses."

"If the main verb is a perfect tense, it is usually followed by the historic sequence, but if the meaning is equivalent to an English present perfect (i.e. ""have done""), it may be followed by primary sequence:"
"There are frequent exceptions to the sequence of tenses rule (see Latin tenses#Sequence of tenses rule). For example, verbs in conditional clauses do not usually follow the rule:"
Consecutive clauses also do not always follow the rule:
"Unlike English, when the sentence is an indirect statement (which uses the accusative and infinitive construction in Latin), the sequence of tenses rule does not apply in Latin, and the tense of the infinitive remains unchanged, no matter what the tense of the main verb. The present infinitive is used for a situation contemporaneous with the main verb:"
The perfect infinitive is used for an event or situation earlier than the time of the main verb:
"In Classical Greek, the tenses in subordinate clauses must correspond to those in the superordinate clauses governing them. (However, unlike Latin and Romance languages, the subjunctive mood has no tenses and won't follow the tenses, of course.)"
"A principal tense (present tense, future tense, or perfect tense) in the superordinate clause is followed by a principal tense in the indicative mood or subjunctive mood. Such a principal tense is followed by:"
"A historical tense (imperfect, pluperfect, or aorist) in the superordinate clause is followed by a historical tense in the indicative mood or optative mood. Such a historic tense is followed by:"
"In fact, since Greek tenses express the aspect of the verb, not the time, we don't have the ""Consecutio Temporum"", but the ""Consecutio Modorum"", the sequence of the Moods."
"The set of rules comprising the sequence of tenses (and modes of the main and subordinate clauses) in the Italian language corresponds in general to the ""consecutio temporum"" of the Latin grammar."
To determine the form of the verb in the subordinate clause it is necessary to know:
The various combinations are summarized in four tables (see below).
"If the verb of the main clause is in the past (simple past, imperfect, or past perfect), the verbal forms of the subordinate clause refer to the moment indicated in the main clause and adapt accordingly. The present in the subordinate clase will transform to imperfect, the past will become past perfect, etc.:"
"Despite of the use of the subjunctive, the verbal tenses follow rules similar to the ones of the Indicative mood. The Present Indicative of the subordinate clause will be substituted with the subjunctive present; similarly, the present perfect will be substituted with its correspondent form, that of the past subjunctive and the Past perfect tense with the subjunctive past perfect."
"If the verb of the main clause is in the past tense, the verbal forms of the subordinate will be adapted to that of the main clause:"
= = = Rock-cut architecture = = =
"Rock-cut architecture is the creation of structures, buildings, and sculptures by excavating solid rock where it naturally occurs. Rock-cut architecture is designed and made by man from the start to finish. In India and China, the terms ""cave"" and ""cavern"" are often applied to this form of man-made architecture. However, caves and caverns, that began in natural form, are not considered to be 'rock-cut architecture' even if extensively modified. Although rock-cut structures differ from traditionally built structures in many ways, many rock-cut structures are made to replicate the facade or interior of traditional architectural forms. Interiors were usually carved out by starting at the roof of the planned space and then working downward. This technique prevents stones falling on workers below. The three main uses of rock-cut architecture were temples (like those in India), tombs (like those in Petra, Jordan) and cave dwellings (like those in Cappadocia, Turkey)."
"Some rock-cut architecture, mostly for tombs, is excavated entirely in chambers under the surface of relatively level rock. If the excavation is instead made into the side of a cliff or steep slope, there can be an impressive facade, as found in Lycian tombs, Petra, Ajanta and elsewhere. The most laborious and impressive rock-cut architecture is the excavation of tall free-standing monolithic structures entirely below the surface level of the surrounding rock, in a large excavated hole around the structure. Ellora in India and Lalibela in Ethiopia (built by the Zagwe dynasty) provide the most spectacular and famous examples of such structures."
"Rock-cut architecture, though intensely laborious with ancient tools and methods, was presumably combined with quarrying the rock for use elsewhere; the huge amounts of stone removed have normally vanished from the site. Rock-cut architecture is also said to be cut, hewn, etc., ""from the living rock"". Another term sometimes associated with rock-cut architecture is monolithic architecture, which is rather applied to free-standing structures made of a single piece of material. Monolithic architecture is often rock-cut architecture (e.g. Ellora Kailasanathar Temple) but monolithic structures might be also cast of artificial material, e.g. concrete."
"The Gommateshwara statue (Bahubali), the largest monolithic statue in the world, at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka, India, was built in 983 AD and was carved from a large single block of granite. In many parts of the world there are also rock reliefs, relief sculptures carved into rock faces, outside caves or at other sites."
"Ancient monuments of rock-cut architecture are widespread in several regions of world. Alteration of naturally formed caverns, although distinct from completely carved structures in the strict sense, date back to the neolithic period on several Mediterranean islands e.g. Malta (Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni), Sardinia (Anghelu Ruju, built between 3,000 and 1,500 BCE) and others."
"Large-scale rock-cut structures were built in Ancient Egypt. Among these monuments was the Great Temple of Ramesses II, known as Abu Simbel, located along the Nile in Nubia, near the borders of Sudan about 300 kilometers from Aswan in Egypt. It dates from about the 19th Dynasty (ca. 1280 BCE), and consists of a monumentally scaled facade carved out of the cliff and a set of interior chambers that form its sanctuary."
"In the 8th century, the Phrygians started some of the earliest rock-cut monuments, such as the Midas monument (700 BCE), dedicated to the famous Phrygian king Midas."
"In the 5th century BCE, the Lycians, who inhabited southern Anatolia (now Turkey) built hundreds of rock-cut tombs of a similar type, but smaller in scale. Excellent examples are to be found near Dalyan, a town in Muğla Province, along the sheer cliffs that faces a river. Since these served as tombs rather than as religious sites, the interiors were usually small and unassuming. The ancient Etruscans of central Italy also left an important legacy of rock-cut architecture, mostly tombs, as those near the cities of Tarquinia and Vulci."
The creation of rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel began in the 8th-century BCE and continued through the Byzantine period. The Tomb of Absalom was constructed in the 1st century AD in the Kidron Valley of Jerusalem.
"Rock-cut architecture occupies a particularly important place in the history of Indian Architecture. The earliest instances of Indian rock-cut architecture, the Barabar caves, date from about the 3rd to the 2nd century BCE. They were built by the Buddhist monks and consisted mostly of multi-storey buildings carved into the mountain face to contain living and sleeping quarters, kitchens, and monastic spaces. Some of these monastic caves had shrines in them to the Buddha, bodhisattvas and saints. As time progressed, the interiors became more elaborate and systematized; surfaces were often decorated with paintings, such as those at Ajanta. At the beginning of the 7th century Hindu rock-cut temples began to be constructed at Ellora. Unlike most previous examples of rock-cut architecture which consisted of a facade plus an interior, these temples were complete three-dimensional buildings created by carving away the hillside. They required several generations of planning and coordination to complete. Other major examples of rock-cut architecture in India are at Ajanta and Pataleshwar."
"The Nabataeans in their city of Petra, now in Jordan, extended the Western Asian tradition, carving their temples and tombs into the yellowish-orange rock that defines the canyons and gullies of the region. These structures, dating from 1st century BCE to about 2nd century CE, are particularly important in the history of architecture given their experimental forms. Here too, because the structures served as tombs, the interiors were rather perfunctory. In Petra one even finds a theater where the seats are cut out of the rock."
"The technological skills associated with making these complex structures moved into China along the trade routes. The Longmen Grottoes, the Mogao Caves, and the Yungang Grottoes consist of hundreds of caves many with statues of Buddha in them. Most were built between 460–525 AD. There are extensive rock-cut buildings, including houses and churches in Cappadocia, Turkey. They were built over a span of hundreds of years prior to the 5th century CE. Emphasis here was more on the interiors than the exteriors."
"Another extensive site of rock-cut architecture is in Lalibela, a town in northern Ethiopia. The area contains numerous Orthodox churches in three dimensions, as at Ellora, that were carved out of the rock. These structures, which date from the 12th and 13th centuries CE and which are the last significant examples of this architectural form, ranks as among the most magnificent examples of rock-cut architecture in the world, with both interior and exterior brought to fruition."
"Ancient rock cut tombs, temples and monasteries often have been adorned with frescoes and reliefs. The high resistance of natural cliff, skilled use of plaster and constant microclimate often have helped to preserve this art in better condition than in conventional buildings. Such exceptional examples are the ancient and early medieval frescoes in such locations as Bamyan Caves in Afghanistan with the most ancient known oil paintings in the world from 8th century AD, Ajanta Caves in India with well preserved tempera paintings from 2nd century BCE, Christian frescoes on Churches of Göreme, Turkey and numerous other monuments in Asia, Europe and Africa."
"Nicholas Slonimsky used this operation, non-generalized, to form 1300 scales by multiplying the symmetric tritones, augmented chords, diminished seventh chords, and wholetone scales by the sum of 3 factors which he called interpolation, infrapolation, and ultrapolation . The combination of interpolation, infrapolation, and ultrapolation, forming obliquely infra-interpolation, infra-ultrapolation, and infra-inter-ultrapolation, additively sums to what is effectively a second sonority. This second sonority, multiplied by the first, gives his formula for generating scales and their harmonizations."
"Joseph Schillinger used the idea, undeveloped, to categorize common 19th- and early 20th-century harmonic styles as product of horizontal harmonic root-motion and vertical harmonic structure . Some of the composers' styles which he cites appear in the following multiplication table."
"The approximation of the 12 pitches of Western music by modulus-12 math, forming the Circle of Halfsteps, means that musical intervals can also be thought of as angles in a polar coordinate system, stacking of identical intervals as functions of harmonic motion, and transposition as rotation around an axis. Thus, in the multiplication example above from Hanson, ""p@m"" or ""p/m"" (""perfect 5th at major 3rd"", e.g.: { C E G B }) also means ""perfect fifth, superimposed upon perfect fifth rotated 1/3 of the circumference of the Circle of Halfsteps"". A conversion table of intervals to angular measure (taken as negative numbers for clockwise rotation) follows:"
"This angular interpretation of intervals is helpful to visualize a very practical example of multiplication in music: Euler-Fokker genera used in describing the Just intonation tuning of keyboard instruments . Each genus represents an harmonic function such as ""3 perfect fifths stacked"" or other sonority such as { C G D F }, which, when multiplied by the correct angle(s) of copy, approximately fills the 12TET circumferential space of the Circle of fifths. It would be possible, though not musically pretty, to tune an augmented triad of two perfect non-beating major thirds, then (multiplying) tune two tempered fifths above and 1 below each note of the augmented chord; this is Euler-Fokker genus [555]. A different result is obtained by starting with the ""3 perfect fifths stacked"", and from these non-beating notes tuning a tempered major third above and below; this is Euler-Fokker genus [333]."
"Joseph Schillinger described an operation of ""polynomial time multiplication"" (""polynomial"" refers to any rhythm consisting of more than one duration) corresponding roughly to that of Pitch multiplication above ( ). A theme, reduced to a consistent series of integers representing the quarter, 8th-, or 16th-note duration of each of the notes of the theme, could be multiplied by itself or the series of another theme to produce a coherent and related variation. Especially, a theme's series could be squared or cubed or taken to higher powers to produce a saturation of related material."
"Herbert Eimert described what he called the ""eight modes"" of the twelve-tone series, all mirror forms of one another. The inverse is obtained through a horizontal mirror, the retrograde through a vertical mirror, the retrograde-inverse through both a horizontal and a vertical mirror, and the ""cycle-of-fourths-transform"" or ""Quartverwandlung"" and ""cycle-of-fifths-transform"" or ""Quintverwandlung"" obtained through a slanting mirror . With the retrogrades of these transforms and the prime, there are eight permutations."
"Joseph Schillinger embraced not only contrapuntal inverse, retrograde, and retrograde-inverse—operations of matrix multiplication in Euclidean vector space—but also their rhythmic counterparts as well. Thus he could describe a variation of theme using the same pitches in same order, but employing its original time values in retrograde order. He saw the scope of this multiplicatory universe beyond simple reflection, to include transposition and rotation (possibly with projection back to source), as well as dilation which had formerly been limited in use to the time dimension (via augmentation and diminution) (). Thus he could describe another variation of theme, or even of a basic scale, by multiplying the halfstep counts between each successive pair of notes by some factor, possibly normalizing to the octave via Modulo-12 operation ()."
"Some Z-related chords are connected by ""M"" or ""IM"" (multiplication by 5 or multiplication by 7), due to identical entries for 1 and 5 on the APIC vector ."
= = = Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia = = =
"Peter Krešimir IV, called the Great (, ) was King of Croatia and Dalmatia from 1059 until his death in 1074 or 1075. He was the last great ruler of the Krešimirović branch of the Trpimirović dynasty."
"Under his rule the Croatian realm reached its peak territorially, earning him the sobriquet ""the Great"", otherwise unique in Croatian history. He kept his seat at Nin and Biograd na Moru, however, the city of Šibenik holds a statue of him and is sometimes called ""Krešimir's city"" (Croatian: """"Krešimirov grad"""") because he is generally credited as the founder."
"Peter Krešimir was born as one of two children to king Stephen I (""Stjepan I"") and his wife Hicela, daughter of the Venetian Doge Pietro II Orseolo."
"Krešimir succeeded his father Stephen I upon his death in 1058 and was crowned the next year. It is not known where his coronation took place, but some historians suggest Biograd as a possibility."
"From the outset, he continued the policies of his father, but was immediately requested in letter by Pope Nicholas II first in 1059. and then in 1060 to reform the Croatian church in accordance with the Roman rite. This was especially significant to the papacy in the aftermath of the Great Schism of 1054, when a papal ally in the Balkans was a necessity. This was in accordance with the visit of the papal legate Mainardius in 1060, Kresimir and the upper nobility lent their support to the pope and the church of Rome."
"The lower nobility and the peasantry, however, were far less well-disposed to reforms. The Croatian priesthood was aligned towards Byzantine orientalism, including having long beards and marrying. More so, the ecclesiastical service was likely practiced in the native Slavonic (Glagolitic), whereas the pope demanded practice in Latin. This caused a rebellion of the clergy led by a certain priest named Vuk (""Ulfus""), who was referenced as newcomer to the kingdom in sources. Vuk had presented the demands and gifts of the Croats to the Pope during his stay in Rome, but was told nothing could be accomplished without the consent of the Split see and the king. They protested against celibacy and the Roman Rite in 1063, but they were proclaimed heretical at a synod of 1064 and excommunicated, a decision which Krešimir supported. Krešimir harshly quelled all opposition and sustained a firm alignment towards western Romanism, with the intent of more fully integrating the Dalmatian populace into his realm. In turn, he could then use them to balance the power caused by the growing feudal class. By the end of Krešimir's reign, feudalism had made permanent inroads into Croatian society and Dalmatia had been permanently associated with the Croatian state."
"The income from the cities further strengthened Krešimir's power, and he subsequently fostered the development of more cities, such as Biograd, Nin, Šibenik, Karin, and Skradin. He also had several monasteries constructed, like the Benedictine monasteries of (1060) and ""St Thomas"" (c. 1066) in Biograd, and donated much land to the Church. In 1066, he granted a charter to the new monastery of St.Mary in Zadar, where the founder and first nun was his cousin, the Abbess ""Čika"". This remains the oldest Croatian monument in the city of Zadar, and became a spearhead for the reform movement. During the same year, he gave his nephew Stephen Trpimirović the office of Duke of Croatia, which designated him as his co-ruler and successor."
"In 1067, the northern part of the kingdom was invaded by Ulric I, Margrave of Carniola, who occupied a part of Kvarner and the eastern coast of Istria, the ""March of Dalmatia"". As the king was at that time preoccupied with the liturgical issues and reforms in Dalmatia, these parts were eventually liberated by his ban Demetrius Zvonimir."
"It was for the first time that the high ranking office of ban started to branch during his rule, as multiple bans were for the first time mentioned in 1067. It is known that, apart from the ban of Croatia, the banate of Slavonia existed during this period, which was at this time likely held by Krešimir's successor Demetrius Zvonimir. The city of Šibenik is for the first time mentioned during his rule in 1066, which was his seat for some time and is for these reasons referred as ""Krešimir's city"" in modern times."
"In 1069, he gave the island of Maun, near Nin, to the monastery of ""St. Krševan"" in Zadar, in thanks for the ""expansion of the kingdom on land and on sea, by the grace of the omnipotent God"" (""quia Deus omnipotens terra marique nostrum prolungavit regnum""). In his surviving document, Krešimir nevertheless did not fail to point out that it was ""our own island that lies on our Dalmatian sea"" (""nostram propriam insulam in nostro Dalmatico mari sitam, que vocatur Mauni"")."
"Around 1070, Krešimir was rumored to have murdered his brother Gojslav, who had served as the ban of Croatia until 1070. Eventually, when the rumors reached abroad, Pope Alexander II sent one of his delegates to inquire about the death of Gojslav. Only after the monarch and 12 Croatian župans had taken oath that he did not kill his brother, the Pope symbolically restored the royal power to Krešimir. He made Dmitar Zvonimir, the new Ban of Croatia, and subsequently elevated him as his principal adviser with the title Duke of Croatia."
"In 1069, he had the Byzantine Empire recognize him as supreme ruler of the parts of Dalmatia Byzantium had controlled since the Croatian dynastic struggle of 997. At the time, the empire was at war both with the Seljuk Turks in Asia and the Normans in southern Italy, so Krešimir took the opportunity and, avoiding an imperial nomination as proconsul or eparch, consolidated his holdings as the ""regnum Dalmatiae et Chroatia"". This was not a formal title, but it designated a unified political-administrative territory, which had been the chief desire of the Croatian kings."
"During Krešimir's reign, the Normans from southern Italy first became involved in Balkan politics and Krešimir soon came in contact with them. After the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, where the Seljuk Turks routed the Eastern Imperial army, the Diocleans, Serbs and other Slavs instigated a rebellion of boyars in Macedonia and in 1072, Krešimir is alleged to have lent his aid to this uprising. In 1075, the Normans under Peter II of Trani invaded the Dalmatian possessions of Croatia from southern Italy, most likely at the command of the Pope, who had been in a quarrel with the king of Croatia over papal politics towards his kingdom. During the invasion, the Norman count Amico of Giovinazzo besieged the island of Rab for almost a month (14 April to early May). He failed in his siege of Rab, but he managed to take the island of Cres on 9 May. It was during these clashes that the Croatian king himself was captured by Amico at an unidentified location. In return for liberation, he was forced to relinquish many cities, including both his capitals, as well as Zadar, Split, and Trogir. His followers, such as the Bishop of Cres, also collected a large ransom. However, he was not liberated. Over the next two years, the Republic of Venice expelled the Normans and secured the cities for themselves."
"Near the end of his reign, Peter Krešimir had no sons, but only a daughter, Neda . Peter Krešimir designated Demetrius Zvonimir, as his heir. It is uncertain whether Peter died in a Norman prison during the first half of 1075. According to Johannes Lucius, an usurper, Slavac, succeeded to the throne sometime in 1074 and reigned only for a year before Zvonimir succeeded."
"Krešimir was buried in the church of St. Stephen in Solin, together with the other dukes and kings of Croatia. Several centuries later the Ottoman Turks destroyed the church, banished the monks who had preserved it, and destroyed the graves."
"Krešimir is, by some historians, regarded as one of the greatest Croatian rulers. Thomas the Archdeacon named him ""the Great"" in his work ""Historia Salonitana"" during the 13th century for his significance in unifing the Dalmatian coastal cities with the Croatian state and accomplishing a peak in Croatia's territorial extent. The RTOP-11 of the Croatian navy was named after Krešimir. The city of Šibenik holds a statue of him and some schools in the vicinity are named after Krešimir."

"After the failure of the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, Camerica was forced to close down, and Codemasters was in financial trouble. As a result, many staff left the Oliver twins' software company, Interactive Studios, who were unable to find replacements. ""Dizzy The Adventurer"" was freely bundled with the Aladdin, and three other titles were being developed for it; ""Dreamworld Pogie"", ""Go! Dizzy Go!"" and ""Wonderland Dizzy"". However, after the Aladdin was abandoned, the Oliver twins decided to release all four (when completed) on the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear to bring in some extra revenue. However, Codemasters wasn’t comfortable releasing each as a full priced stand alone title, so forced them to combine the games into a compilation, but only three would fit. They abandoned the non-Dizzy oriented game, ""Dreamworld Pogie"", and intended to release the action game ""Go! Dizzy Go!"" and the two adventure games ""Wonderland Dizzy"" and ""Dizzy The Adventurer"". However Codemasters marketing team informed the Olivers that they couldn’t release two adventure games on the one compilation. They decided that the previously released ""Dizzy The Adventurer"" was the stronger title and didn’t require any further development and, as a replacement for ""Wonderland Dizzy"", the twins included the previously released ""Panic Dizzy""."

= = = Meropeidae = = =
"Meropeidae is a family of tiny scorpionflies within the order Mecoptera with only three living species, commonly referred to as ""earwigflies"" (or sometimes ""forcepflies""). These include the North American ""Merope tuber"", the Western Australian ""Austromerope poultoni"", and the newly discovered South American ""A. brasiliensis"". The biology of these species is essentially unknown, and their larvae have never been seen. The disjunct distribution suggests a common origin before the breakup of the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea. There are two undisputed extinct genera, ""Boreomerope antiqua"" known from an isolated wing found in the Middle Jurassic Itat Formation of Siberia and ""Burmomerope"" with two species from the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber. As such, the extant members of this family can be considered living fossils. These insects are also of interest due to their presumed basal position in the order Mecoptera. ""Thaumatomerope"" with four described species all from the Madygen Formation in Kyrgyzstan has historically sometimes been included within the family, ""Thaumatomerope"" is sometimes excluded from Meropeidae, and instead, is placed within Eomeropidae, or its own monotypic family, ""Thaumatomeropidae.""*"
"The family name was spelt ""Meropidae"" in old literature but this clashes with the homonymous family name in birds for bee-eaters. The spelling of Meropeidae was adopted for the insect family by the ICZN in Opinion 140 of 1943."
= = = Clastic rock = = =
"Clastic rocks are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing minerals and rock. A clast is a fragment of geological detritus, chunks and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering. Geologists use the term clastic with reference to sedimentary rocks as well as to particles in sediment transport whether in suspension or as bed load, and in sediment deposits."
"Clastic sedimentary rocks are rocks composed predominantly of broken pieces or ""clasts"" of older weathered and eroded rocks. Clastic sediments or sedimentary rocks are classified based on grain size, clast and cementing material (matrix) composition, and texture. The classification factors are often useful in determining a sample's environment of deposition. An example of clastic environment would be a river system in which the full range of grains being transported by the moving water consist of pieces eroded from solid rock upstream."
"Grain size varies from clay in shales and claystones; through silt in siltstones; sand in sandstones; and gravel, cobble, to boulder sized fragments in conglomerates and breccias. The Krumbein phi (φ) scale numerically orders these terms in a logarithmic size scale."
"""Siliciclastic"" rocks are clastic noncarbonate rocks that are composed almost exclusively of silicon, either as forms of quartz or as silicates."
"The composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks includes the chemical and mineralogical components of the framework as well as the cementing material that make up these rocks. Boggs divides them into four categories; major minerals, accessory minerals, rock fragments, and chemical sediments."
"Major minerals can be categorized into subdivisions based on their resistance to chemical decomposition. Those that possess a great resistance to decomposition are categorized as stable, while those that do not are considered less stable. The most common stable mineral in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks is quartz (SiO). Quartz makes up approximately 65 percent of framework grains present in sandstones and about 30 percent of minerals in the average shale. Less stable minerals present in this type of rocks are feldspars, including both potassium and plagioclase feldspars. Feldspars comprise a considerably lesser portion of framework grains and minerals. They only make up about 15 percent of framework grains in sandstones and 5% of minerals in shales. Clay mineral groups are mostly present in mudrocks (comprising more than 60% of the minerals) but can be found in other siliciclastic sedimentary rocks at considerably lower levels."
"Accessory minerals are associated with those whose presence in the rock are not directly important to the classification of the specimen. These generally occur in smaller amounts in comparison to the quartz, and feldspars. Furthermore, those that do occur are generally heavy minerals or coarse grained micas (both Muscovite and Biotite)."
"Rock fragments also occur in the composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and are responsible for about 10–15 percent of the composition of sandstone. They generally make up most of the gravel size particles in conglomerates but contribute only a very small amount to the composition of mudrocks. Though they sometimes are, rock fragments are not always sedimentary in origin. They can also be metamorphic or igneous."
"Chemical cements vary in abundance but are predominantly found in sandstones. The two major types are silicate based and carbonate based. The majority of silica cements are composed of quartz, but can include chert, opal, feldspars and zeolites."
"Composition includes the chemical and mineralogic make-up of the single or varied fragments and the cementing material (matrix) holding the clasts together as a rock. These differences are most commonly used in the framework grains of sandstones. Sandstones rich in quartz are called quartz arenites, those rich in feldspar are called arkoses, and those rich in lithics are called lithic sandstones."
"Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are composed of mainly silicate particles derived from the weathering of older rocks and pyroclastic volcanism. While grain size, clast and cementing material (matrix) composition, and texture are important factors when regarding composition, siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are classified according to grain size into three major categories: conglomerates, sandstones, and mudrocks. The term ""clay"" is used to classify particles smaller than .0039 millimeters. However, the term can also be used to refer to a family of sheet silicate minerals. ""Silt"" refers to particles that have a diameter between .062 and .0039 millimeters. The term ""mud"" is used when clay and silt particles are mixed in the sediment; ""mudrock"" is the name of the rock created with these sediments. Furthermore, particles that reach diameters between .062 and 2 millimeters fall into the category of sand. When sand is cemented together and lithified it becomes known as sandstone. Any particle that is larger than two millimeters is considered gravel. This category includes pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Like sandstone, when gravels are lithified they are considered conglomerates."
"Conglomerates are coarse grained rocks dominantly composed of gravel sized particles that are typically held together by a finer grained matrix. These rocks are often subdivided into conglomerates and breccias. The major characteristic that divides these two categories is the amount of rounding. The gravel sized particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded while in breccias they are angular. Conglomerates are common in stratigraphic successions of most, if not all, ages but only make up one percent or less, by weight, of the total sedimentary rock mass. In terms of origin and depositional mechanisms they are very similar to sandstones. As a result, the two categories often contain the same sedimentary structures."
"Sandstones are medium-grained rocks composed of rounded or angular fragments of sand size, that often but not always have a cement uniting them together. These sand-size particles are often quartz but there are a few common categories and a wide variety of classification schemes that classify sandstones based on composition. Classification schemes vary widely, but most geologists have adopted the Dott scheme, which uses the relative abundance of quartz, feldspar, and lithic framework grains and the abundance of muddy matrix between these larger grains."
"Rocks that are classified as mudrocks are very fine grained. Silt and clay represent at least 50% of the material that mudrocks are composed of. Classification schemes for mudrocks tend to vary, but most are based on the grain size of the major constituents. In mudrocks, these are generally silt, and clay."
"According to Blatt, Middleton and Murray mudrocks that are composed mainly of silt particles are classified as siltstones. In turn, rocks that possess clay as the majority particle are called claystones. In geology, a mixture of both silt and clay is called mud. Rocks that possess large amounts of both clay and silt are called mudstones. In some cases the term shale is also used to refer to mudrocks and is still widely accepted by most. However, others have used the term shale to further divide mudrocks based on the percentage of clay constituents. The plate-like shape of clay allows its particles to stack up one on top of another, creating laminae or beds. The more clay present in a given specimen, the more laminated a rock is. Shale, in this case, is reserved for mudrocks that are laminated, while mudstone refers those that are not."
"Siliciclastic rocks initially form as loosely packed sediment deposits including gravels, sands, and muds. The process of turning loose sediment into hard sedimentary rocks is called lithification. During the process of lithification, sediments undergo physical, chemical and mineralogical changes before becoming rock. The primary physical process in lithification is compaction. As sediment transport and deposition continues, new sediments are deposited atop previously deposited beds, burying them. Burial continues and the weight of overlying sediments causes an increase in temperature and pressure. This increase in temperature and pressure causes loose grained sediments become tightly packed, reducing porosity, essentially squeezing water out of the sediment. Porosity is further reduced by the precipitation of minerals into the remaining pore spaces. The final stage in the process is diagenesis and will be discussed in detail below."
"Cementation is the diagenetic process by which coarse clastic sediments become lithified or consolidated into hard, compact rocks, usually through the deposition or precipitation of minerals in the spaces between the individual grains of sediment. Cementation can occur simultaneously with deposition or at another time. Furthermore, once a sediment is deposited, it becomes subject to cementation through the various stages of diagenesis discussed below."
"Eogenesis refers to the early stages of diagenesis. This can take place at very shallow depths, ranging from a few meters to tens of meters below the surface. The changes that occur during this diagenetic phase mainly relate to the reworking of the sediments. Compaction and grain repacking, bioturbation, as well as mineralogical changes all occur at varying degrees. Due to the shallow depths, sediments undergo only minor compaction and grain rearrangement during this stage. Organisms rework sediment near the depositional interface by burrowing, crawling, and in some cases sediment ingestion. This process can destroy sedimentary structures that were present upon deposition of the sediment. Structures such as lamination will give way to new structures associated with the activity of organisms. Despite being close to the surface, eogenesis does provide conditions for important mineralogical changes to occur. This mainly involves the precipitation of new minerals."
"Mineralogical changes that occur during eogenesis are dependent on the environment in which that sediment has been deposited. For example, the formation of pyrite is characteristic of reducing conditions in marine environments. Pyrite can form as cement, or replace organic materials, such as wood fragments. Other important reactions include the formation of chlorite, glauconite, illite and iron oxide (if oxygenated pore water is present). The precipitation of potassium feldspar, quartz overgrowths, and carbonate cements also occurs under marine conditions. In non marine environments oxidizing conditions are almost always prevalent, meaning iron oxides are commonly produced along with kaolin group clay minerals. The precipitation of quartz and calcite cements may also occur in non marine conditions."
"As sediments are buried deeper, load pressures become greater resulting in tight grain packing and bed thinning. This causes increased pressure between grains thus increasing the solubility of grains. As a result, the partial dissolution of silicate grains occurs. This is called pressure solutions. Chemically speaking, increases in temperature can also cause chemical reaction rates to increase. This increases the solubility of most common minerals (aside from evaporites). Furthermore, beds thin and porosity decreases allowing cementation to occur by the precipitation of silica or carbonate cements into remaining pore space."
"In this process minerals crystallize from watery solutions that percolate through the pores between grain of sediment. The cement that is produced may or may not have the same chemical composition as the sediment. In sandstones, framework grains are often cemented by silica or carbonate. The extent of cementation is dependent on the composition of the sediment. For example, in lithic sandstones, cementation is less extensive because pore space between framework grains is filled with a muddy matrix that leaves little space for precipitation to occur. This is often the case for mudrocks as well. As a result of compaction, the clayey sediments comprising mudrocks are relatively impermeable."
"Dissolution of framework silicate grains and previously formed carbonate cement may occur during deep burial. Conditions that encourage this are essentially opposite of those required for cementation. Rock fragments and silicate minerals of low stability, such as plagioclase feldspar, pyroxenes, and amphiboles, may dissolve as a result of increasing burial temperatures and the presence of organic acids in pore waters. The dissolution of frame work grains and cements increases porosity particularly in sandstones."
"This refers to the process whereby one mineral is dissolved and a new mineral fills the space via precipitation. Replacement can be partial or complete. Complete replacement destroys the identity of the original minerals or rock fragments giving a biased view of the original mineralogy of the rock/ Porosity can also be affected by this process. For example, clay minerals tend to fill up pore space and thereby reducing porosity."
"Typically, upcycling creates something new and better from the old or used or disposed items. Process of upcycling requires a blend of factors like environmental awareness, creativity, innovation and hard work and results in a unique sustainable product. Upcycling aims at the development of products truly sustainable, affordable, innovative and creative. For example, downcycling produces cleaning rags from worn T-shirts, whereas upcycling recreates the shirts into a value-added product like unique handmade braided rug."
"There are negative social and environmental impacts at all stages of the fashion product life: materials production and processing, manufacture of garments, retail and marketing, use and maintenance and at the discard phase. For some products, the environmental impact can be greater at the use phase than material production."
"Consumer engagement challenges the ""passive"" mode of ready-to-wear fashion where consumers have few interfaces and little incentive to be active with their garments; to repair, change, update, swap, and learn from their wardrobe. The term ""folk fashion"" has been used in the emphasis on craft engagements with garments where the community heritage of skills are in focus. There are currently many designers trying to find ways that experiment with new models of action that deposes passivity and indifference while preserving the positive social dynamics and sensibilities fashion offers, often in relation to Alvin Toffler's notion of the ""prosumer"" (portmanteau of producer and consumer). Notions of participatory design, open sourcefashion, and fashion hacktivism are parts of such endeavors, mixing techniques of dissemination with empowerment, reenechantment and Paulo Freire's ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed."" An example of such consumer engagement can be Giana Gonzalez and her project ""Hacking Couture"" which has tested such methods across the world since 2006."
"Enhancing the lifespan of products have been yet another approach to sustainability, yet still only in its infancy. Upmarket brands have long supported the lifespan of their products through product-service systems, such as re-waxing of classic outdoor jackets, or repairs of expensive hand-bags, yet more accessible brands do still not offer even spare buttons in their garments. One such approach concerns emotionally durable design, yet with fashion's dependency on continuous updates, and consumer's desire to follow trends, there is a significant challenge to make garments last long through emotional attachment. As with memories, not all are pleasant, and thus a focus on emotional attachment can result in favoring a normative approach to what is considered a good enough memory to manifest emotionally in a garment. Cultural theorist Peter Stallybrass approaches this challenge in his essay on poverty, textile memory, and the coat of Karl Marx."
"Clothing swapping can further promote the reduction, reuse, and recycling of clothing. By reusing clothing that's already been made and recycling clothing from one owner to another, source reduction can be achieved. This moves away from usage of new raw materials to make more clothing available for consumption. Through the method of clothing swapping,an alternative resource for consumers to ultimately save in regards to money and time is provided. It reduces transportation emissions, costs, and the time it takes to drive and search through the chaos of most clothing stores. Swapping clothes further promotes the use of sustainable online shopping and the internet as well as an increase of social bonds through online communication or effective personal communication in ""clothing swap parties"". The EPA states, that by reusing items, at the source waste can be diverted from ending up in landfills because it delays or avoids that item's entry in the waste collection and disposal system."
Examples of online clothing swapping websites include:
"People can opt to donate clothing to charities. In the UK, a charity is a non-profit organization that is given special tax form and distinct legal status. A charity is ""a foundation created to promote the public good"". People donating clothing to charitable organizations in America are often eligible for tax deductions, albeit the donations are itemized."
"Generally, charitable organizations often sell donated clothing rather than directly giving the clothing away. Charities keep 10% of donated clothing for their high quality and retail value for the thrift shops. Charities sell the rest of the donations to textile recycling businesses."
The following is a list of few charitable organizations known for accepting clothing donations.
"An Evangelical Christian-based non-profit organization founded in 1865, United Kingdom."
"A non-profit organization founded in 1902, United States, at Boston, MA. Originally started as an urban outreach"
"A non-profit organization originally named Charity Organization Society, established 1887, United States. Currently a coalition of charitable organizations."
"A non-profit organization founded in 1942, United Kingdom. Formerly Oxfam Committee for Famine Relief. Originally established to mitigate famines in Greece caused by Allied naval blockades during World War II."
"There are ""charities"" that are actually for-profit organizations. These organizations are often multibillion-dollar firms that keep profits accrued from selling donated clothing. Monetary donations are given for public goodwill, but only at relatively few percentages. For example, Planet Aid, a supposedly non-profit organization that collects donated clothing, reportedly gives only 11% of its total income to charities. Such organizations often use drop-off boxes to collect clothes. These drop-off boxes look similar to their non-profit counterparts, which mislead the public into donating their clothes to them. Such public deception prompted backlash, one example where a mayor called for the city's removal of for-profit clothing donation bins. To search for reputable charities, see Charity Navigator's website."
"In layman’s terms, a clothing consignment shop sells clothes that are owned not by the shop’s owner but by the individual who had given (or consigned) the items to the shop for the owner to sell. The shop owner/seller is the consignee and the owner of the items is the consignor. Both the consignor and the consignee receive portions of the profit made from the item. However, the consignor will not be paid until the items are sold. Therefore, unlike donating clothing to charities, people who consign their clothes to shops can make profit."
"According to an ABC News report, charities keep approximately 10% of all the donated clothing received. These clothes tend to be good quality, fashionable, and high valued fabrics that can easily be sold in charities’ thrift shops. Charities sell the other 90% of the clothing donations to textile recycling firms."
"Textile recycling firms process about 70% of the donated clothing into industrial items such as rags or cleaning cloths. However, 20-25% of the second-hand clothing is sold into an international market. Where possible, used jeans collected from America, for example, are sold to low-income customers in Africa for modest prices, yet most end up in landfill as the average US sized customer is several sizes bigger than the global average."
"There is a broad range of organisations purporting to support sustainable fashion, some representing particular stakeholders, some addressing particular issues, and some seeking to increase the visibility of the sustainable fashion movement. They also range from the local to global. It is important to examine the interests and priorities of the organisations."
Educational institutions like National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) is working towards integration of eco-friendly fashion value chain. For training and demonstration NIFT Bhubaneswar has got various natural dye yielding plants and natural fibre yielding plants in the campus. Through their handloom cluster development initiatives the institute is creating awareness and training to the artisans on sustainable fashion.
"There are many factors when considering the sustainability of a material. The renewability and source of a fiber, the process of how a raw fiber is turned into a textile, the impact of preparation and dyeing of the fibers, energy use in production and preparation, the working conditions of the people producing the materials, and the material's total carbon footprint, transportation between production plants, shipping to retail and consumer, how the material will be cared for and washed, the processes of repairs and updates, and what happens to it at the end of life. The indexing of the textile journeys is thus extremely complex."
"Overall, diversity in the overall fiber mix is needed; in 2013 cotton and polyester accounted for almost 85% of all fibers, and thus their impacts were, and continue to be, disproportionately magnified. Also, many fibers in the finished garments are mixed to acquire desired drape, flexibility or stretch, thus affecting both care and the possibility to recycle the material in the end."
"Natural fibers are fibers which are found in nature and are not petroleum-based. Natural fibers can be categorized into two main groups, cellulose or plant fiber and protein or animal fiber. Uses of these fibers can be anything from buttons to eyewear such as sunglasses."
"Other than cotton, the most common plant-based fiber, cellulose fibers include: jute, flax, hemp, ramie, abaca, bamboo (used for viscose), soy, corn, banana, pineapple, beechwood (used for rayon). Alternative fibers such as bamboo (in yarn) and hemp (of a variety that produces only a tiny amount of the psychoactive component found in cannabis) are coming into greater use in so-called eco-fashions."
"Cotton, also known as vegetable wool, is a major source of apparel fiber. Celebrated for its excellent absorbency, durability, and intrinsic softness, cotton accounts for over 50% of all clothing produced worldwide. This makes cotton the most widely used clothing fiber. Cotton is one of the most chemical-intensive crops in the world. Conventionally grown cotton uses approximately 25% of the world's insecticides and more than 10% of the world's pesticides. However, growing and processing this particular fiber crop is largely unsustainable. For every pound of cotton harvested, a farmer uses up 1/3 lb of chemical, synthetic fertilizer. As a whole, the US cotton production makes up 25% of all pesticides deployed in the United States. Worldwide, cotton takes up 2.4% of all arable lands yet requires 16% of the world's pesticides. Furthermore, the cotton hulls contain the most potent insecticide residues. They are often used as cattle feed, which means that consumers are purchasing meat containing a concentration of pesticides. The processing of cotton into usable fibers also adds to the burden on the environment. Manufacturers prefer cotton to be white so that cotton can easily be synthetically dyed to any shade of color. Natural cotton is actual beige brown, and so during processing, manufacturers would add bleach and various other chemicals and heavy metal dyes to make cotton pure white. Formaldehyde resins would be added in as well to form ""easy care"" cotton fabric."
"To reduce the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, companies have produced genetically modified (GMO) cottons plants that are resistant to pest infestations. Among the GMO are cotton crops inserted with the Bt (""Bacillus thuringiensis"") gene. Bt cotton crops do not require insecticide applications. Insects that consume cotton containing Bt will stop feeding after a few hours, and die, leaving the cotton plants unharmed."
"As a result of the use of Bt cotton, the cost of pesticide applications decreased between $25 and $65 per acre. Bt cotton crops yield 5% more cotton on average compared to traditional cotton crops. Bt crops also lower the price of cotton by 0.8 cents per pound."
"However, there are concerns regarding Bt technology, mainly that insects will eventually develop resistance to the Bt strain. According to an article published in Science Daily, researchers have found that members from a cotton bollworm species, ""Helicoverpa zea"", were Bt resistant in some crop areas of Mississippi and Arkansas during 2003 and 2006. Fortunately, the vast majority of other agricultural pests remain susceptible to Bt."
"Micha Peled's documentary exposé Bitter seeds on BT farming in India reveals the true impact of genetically modified cotton on India's farmers, with a suicide rate of over a quarter million Bt cotton farmers since 1995 due to financial stress resulting from massive crop failure and the exorbitantly high price of Monsanto's proprietary BT seed. The film also refutes false claims purported by the biotech industry that Bt cotton requires less pesticide and empty promises of higher yields, as farmers discover the bitter truth that in reality Bt cotton in fact requires a great deal more pesticide than organic cotton, and often suffer higher levels of infestation by Mealybug resulting in devastating crop losses, and extreme financial and psychological stress on cotton farmers. Due to the biotech seed monopoly in India, where Bt cotton seed has become the ubiquitous standard, and organic seed has become absolutely unobtainable, thus cooercing all cotton farmers into signing Bt cotton seed purchase agreements which enforce the intellectual property interests of the biotech multinational corporation Monsanto."
"Organic cotton is grown without the use of any genetically modification to the crops, without the use of any fertilizers, pesticides, and other synthetic agro-chemicals harmful to the land. All cotton marketed as organic in the United States is required to fulfill strict federal regulations regarding how the cotton is grown. This is done with a combination of innovation, science and tradition in order to encourage a good quality of life and environment for all involved."
"Cotton is naturally grown in varieties of colors. Typically, cotton color can come as mauve, red, yellow, and orange hues. The use of naturally colored cotton has long been historically suppressed, mainly due to the industrial revolution. Back then, it was much cheaper to have uniformly white cotton as a raw source for mass-producing cloth and fabric items. Currently, modern markets have revived a trend in using naturally colored cotton for its noted relevance in reducing harmful environmental impacts. One such example of markets opening to these cotton types would be Sally Fox and her Foxfiber business—naturally colored cotton that Fox has bred and marketed. On an additional note, naturally colored cotton is already colored, and thus do not require synthetic dyes during process. Furthermore, the color of fabrics made from naturally colored cotton does not become worn and fade away compared to synthetically dyed cotton fabrics."
"Soy fabrics are derived from the hulls of soybeans—a manufacturing byproduct. Soy fabrics can be blended (i.e. 30%) or made entirely out of soy fibers. Soy clothing is largely biodegradable, so it has a minimal impact on environment and landfills. Although not as durable as cotton or hemp fabrics, soy clothing has a soft, elastic feel. Soy clothing is known as the vegetable cashmere for its light and silky sensation. Soy fabrics are moisture absorbent, anti-bacterial, and UV resistant. However, soy fabrics fell out of public knowledge during World War II, when rayon, nylon, and cotton sales rose sharply."
"Hemp, like bamboo, is considered a sustainable crop. It requires little water to grow, and it is resistant to most pests and diseases. The hemp plant's broad leaves shade out weeds and other plant competitors, and its deep taproot system allows it to draw moisture deep in the soil. Unlike cotton, many parts of the hemp plant have a use. Hemp seeds, for example, are processed into oil or food. Hemp fiber comes in two types: primary and secondary bast fibers. Hemp fibers are durable and are considered strong enough for construction uses. Compared to cotton fiber, hemp fiber is approximately 8 times the tensile strength and 4 times the durability."
"Thousand of performances of William Shakespeare's plays have been staged since the end of the 16th century. While Shakespeare was alive, many of his greatest plays were performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men and King's Men acting companies at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres. Among the actors of these original performances were Richard Burbage (who played the title role in the first performances of ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", ""Richard III"" and ""King Lear""), Richard Cowley, and William Kempe."
"Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1642–1660), when most public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. After the English Restoration, Shakespeare's plays were performed in playhouses, with elaborate scenery, and staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. During this time the texts were ""reformed"" and ""improved"" for the stage, an undertaking which has seemed shockingly disrespectful to posterity."
"Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in ""authentic"" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" was one spectacular example. Such elaborate scenery for the frequently changing locations in Shakespeare's plays often led to a loss of pace. Towards the end of the 19th century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of ""Elizabethan"" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama. In the early 20th century, Harley Granville-Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts, while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging. Both approaches have influenced the variety of Shakespearean production styles seen today."
"The troupe for which Shakespeare wrote his earliest plays is not known with certainty; the title page of the 1594 edition of ""Titus Andronicus"" reveals that it had been acted by three different companies. After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a new company of which Shakespeare was a founding member, at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of ""Henry IV"", Leonard Digges recalling, ""Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room"". When the landlord of the Theatre announced that he would not renew the company's lease, they pulled the playhouse down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first London playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with ""Julius Caesar"" one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"" and ""King Lear""."
"The Globe, like London's other open-roofed public theatres, employed a thrust-stage, covered by a cloth canopy. A two-storey facade at the rear of the stage hid the tiring house and, through windows near the top of the facade, opportunities for balcony scenes such as the one in ""Romeo and Juliet"". Doors at the bottom of the facade may have been used for discovery scenes like that at the end of ""The Tempest"". A trap door in the stage itself could be used for stage business, like some of that involving the ghost in ""Hamlet"". This trapdoor area was called ""hell"", as the canopy above was called ""heaven"""
"Less is known about other features of staging and production. Stage props seem to have been minimal, although costuming was as elaborate as was feasible. The ""two hours' traffic"" mentioned in the prologue to ""Romeo and Juliet"" was not fanciful; the city government's hostility meant that performances were officially limited to that length of time. Though it is not known how seriously companies took such injunctions, it seems likely either that plays were performed at near-breakneck speed or that the play-texts now extant were cut for performance, or both."
"The other main theatre where Shakespeare's original plays were performed was the second Blackfriars Theatre, an indoor theatre built by James Burbage, father of Richard Burbage, and impresario of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. However, neighborhood protests kept Burbage from using the theater for the Lord Chamberlain's Men performances for a number of years. After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new court of King James. Performance records are patchy, but it is known that the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605, including two performances of ""The Merchant of Venice"". In 1608 the King's Men (as the company was then known) took possession of the Blackfriars Theatre. After 1608, the troupe performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean vogue for lavishly staged masques, created new conditions for performance which enabled Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In ""Cymbeline"", for example, Jupiter descends ""in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."" Plays produced at the indoor theater presumably also made greater use of sound effects and music."
"A fragment of the naval captain William Keeling's diary survives, in which he details his crew's shipboard performances of ""Hamlet"" (off the coast of Sierra Leone, 5 September 1607, and at Socotra, 31 March 1608), and ""Richard II"" (Sierra Leone, 30 September 1607). For a time after its discovery, the fragment was suspected of being a forgery, but is now generally accepted as genuine. These are the first recorded amateur performances of any Shakespeare plays."
"On 29 June 1613, the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a performance of ""Henry VIII"". A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man who put out his burning breeches with a bottle of ale. The event pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision. Sir Henry Wotton recorded that the play ""was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony"". The theatre was rebuilt but, like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the Puritans in 1642."
"The actors in Shakespeare's company included Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including ""Richard III"", ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", and ""King Lear"". The popular comic actor Will Kempe played Peter in ""Romeo and Juliet"" and Dogberry in ""Much Ado About Nothing"", among other parts. He was replaced around the turn of the 16th century by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in ""As You Like It"" and the fool in ""King Lear"". Little is certainly known about acting styles. Critics praised the best actors for their naturalness. Scorn was heaped on ranters and on those who ""tore a passion to tatters"", as Hamlet has it. Also with Hamlet, playwrights complain of clowns who improvise on stage (modern critics often blame Kemp in particular in this regard). In the older tradition of comedy which reached its apex with Richard Tarlton, clowns, often the main draw of a troupe, were responsible for creating comic by-play. By the Jacobean era, that type of humor had been supplanted by verbal wit."
"Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1642–1660), when most public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. While denied the use of the stage, costumes and scenery, actors still managed to ply their trade by performing ""drolls"" or short pieces of larger plays that usually ended with some type of jig. Shakespeare was among the many playwrights whose works were plundered for these scenes. Among the drolls taken from Shakespeare were ""Bottom the Weaver"" (Bottom's scenes from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"") and ""The Grave-makers"" (the gravedigger's scene from ""Hamlet"")."
"At the Restoration in 1660, Shakespeare's plays were divided between the two newly licensed companies: the King's Company of Thomas Killigrew and the Duke's Men of William Davenant. The licensing system prevailed for two centuries; from 1660 to 1843, only two main companies regularly presented Shakespeare in London. Davenant, who had known early-Stuart actors such as John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, was the main figure establishing some continuity with earlier traditions; his advice to his actors is thus of interest as possible reflections of original practices."
"On the whole, though, innovation was the order of the day for Restoration companies. John Downes reports that the King's Men initially included some Caroline actors; however, the forced break of the Interregnum divided both companies from the past. Restoration actors performed on proscenium stages, often in the evening, between six and nine. Set-design and props became more elaborate and variable. Perhaps most noticeably, boy players were replaced by actresses. The audiences of comparatively expensive indoor theaters were richer, better educated, and more homogeneous than the diverse, often unruly crowds at the Globe. Davenant's company began at the Salisbury Court Theatre, then moved to the theater at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and finally settled in the Dorset Garden Theatre. Killigrew began at Gibbon's Tennis Court before settling into Christopher Wren's new theatre in Drury Lane. Patrons of both companies expected fare quite different from what had pleased Elizabethans. For tragedy, their tastes ran to heroic drama; for comedy, to the comedy of manners. Though they liked Shakespeare, they seem to have wished his plays to conform to these preferences."
"Restoration writers obliged them by adapting Shakespeare's plays freely. Writers such as William Davenant and Nahum Tate rewrote some of Shakespeare's plays to suit the tastes of the day, which favoured the courtly comedy of Beaumont and Fletcher and the neo-classical rules of drama. In 1681, Tate provided ""The History of King Lear"", a modified version of Shakespeare's original tragedy with a happy ending. According to Stanley Wells, Tate's version ""supplanted Shakespeare's play in every performance given from 1681 to 1838,"" when William Charles Macready played Lear from a shortened and rearranged version of Shakespeare's text. ""Twas my good fortune"", Tate said, ""to light on one expedient to rectify what was wanting in the regularity and probability of the tale, which was to run through the whole a love betwixt Edgar and Cordelia that never changed words with each other in the original""."
"Tate's ""Lear"" remains famous as an example of an ill-conceived adaptation arising from insensitivity to Shakespeare's tragic vision. Tate's genius was not in language – many of his interpolated lines don't even scan – but in structure; his Lear begins brilliantly with the Edmund the Bastard's first attention-grabbing speech, and ends with Lear's heroic saving of Cordelia in the prison and a restoration of justice to the throne. Tate's worldview, and that of the theatrical world that embraced (and demanded) his ""happy ending"" versions of the Bard's tragic works (such as ""King Lear"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"") for over a century, arose from a profoundly different sense of morality in society and of the role that theatre and art should play within that society. Tate's versions of Shakespeare see the responsibility of theatre as a transformative agent for positive change by holding a moral mirror up to our baser instincts. Tate's versions of what we now consider some of the Bard's greatest works dominated the stage throughout the 18th century precisely because the Ages of Enlightenment and Reason found Shakespeare's ""tragic vision"" immoral, and his tragic works unstageable. Tate is seldom performed today, though in 1985, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted a successful production of ""The History of King Lear"" at The Shakespeare Center, heralded by some as a ""Lear for the Age of Ronald Reagan."""
"Perhaps a more typical example of the purpose of Restoration revisions is Davenant's ""The Law Against Lovers"", a 1662 comedy combining the main plot of ""Measure for Measure"" with subplot of ""Much Ado About Nothing"". The result is a snapshot of Restoration comic tastes. Beatrice and Benedick are brought in to parallel Claudio and Hero; the emphasis throughout is on witty conversation, and Shakespeare's thematic focus on lust is steadily downplayed. The play ends with three marriages: Benedick's to Beatrice, Claudio's to Hero, and Isabella's to an Angelo whose attempt on Isabella's virtue was a ploy. Davenant wrote many of the bridging scenes and recast much of Shakespeare's verse as heroic couplets."
"A final feature of Restoration stagecraft impacted productions of Shakespeare. The taste for opera that the exiles had developed in France made its mark on Shakespeare as well. Davenant and John Dryden worked ""The Tempest"" into an opera, ""The Tempest, or The Enchanted Island""; their work featured a sister for Miranda, a man, Hippolito, who has never seen a woman, and another paired marriage at the end. It also featured many songs, a spectacular shipwreck scene, and a masque of flying cupids. Other of Shakespeare's works given operatic treatment included ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (as ""The Fairy-Queen"" in 1692) and Charles Gildon's ""Measure for Measure"" (by way of an elaborate masque.)"
"However ill-guided such revisions may seem now, they made sense to the period's dramatists and audiences. The dramatists approached Shakespeare not as bardolators, but as theater professionals. Unlike Beaumont and Fletcher, whose ""plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage"", according to Dryden in 1668, ""two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare's or Jonson's"", Shakespeare appeared to them to have become dated. Yet almost universally, they saw him as worth updating. Though most of these revised pieces failed on stage, many remained current on stage for decades; Thomas Otway's Roman adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"", for example, seems to have driven Shakespeare's original from the stage between 1680 and 1744. It was in large part the revised Shakespeare that took the lead place in the repertory in the early 18th century, while Beaumont and Fletcher's share steadily declined."
"The 18th century witnessed three major changes in the production of Shakespeare's plays. In England, the development of the star system transformed both acting and production; at the end of the century, the Romantic revolution touched acting as it touched all the arts. At the same time, actors and producers began to return to Shakespeare's texts, slowly weeding out the Restoration revisions. Finally, by the end of the century Shakespeare's plays had been established as part of the repertory outside of Great Britain: not only in the United States but in many European countries."
"In the 18th century, Shakespeare dominated the London stage, while Shakespeare productions turned increasingly into the creation of star turns for star actors. After the Licensing Act of 1737, one fourth of the plays performed were by Shakespeare, and on at least two occasions rival London playhouses staged the very same Shakespeare play at the same time (""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1755 and ""King Lear"" the next year) and still commanded audiences. This occasion was a striking example of the growing prominence of Shakespeare stars in the theatrical culture, the big attraction being the competition and rivalry between the male leads at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Spranger Barry and David Garrick. In the 1740s, Charles Macklin, in roles such as Malvolio and Shylock, and David Garrick, who won fame as Richard III in 1741, helped make Shakespeare truly popular. Garrick went on to produce 26 of the plays at Drury Lane Theatre between 1747 and 1776, and he held a great Shakespeare Jubilee at Stratford in 1769. He freely adapted Shakespeare's work, however, saying of ""Hamlet"": ""I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match."" Apparently no incongruity was perceived in having Barry and Garrick, in their late thirties, play adolescent Romeo one season and geriatric King Lear the next. 18th century notions of verisimilitude did not usually require an actor to be physically appropriate for a role, a fact epitomized by a 1744 production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in which Theophilus Cibber, then forty, played Romeo to the Juliet of his teenaged daughter Jennie."
"Some of Shakespeare's work was performed in continental Europe even during his lifetime; Ludwig Tieck pointed out German versions of ""Hamlet"" and other plays, of uncertain provenance, but certainly quite old. but it was not until after the middle of the next century that Shakespeare appeared regularly on German stages. In Germany Lessing compared Shakespeare to German folk literature. Goethe organised a Shakespeare jubilee in Frankfurt in 1771, stating that the dramatist had shown that the Aristotelian unities were ""as oppressive as a prison"" and were ""burdensome fetters on our imagination"". Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare's work opens ""leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time"". This claim that Shakespeare's work breaks though all creative boundaries to reveal a chaotic, teeming, contradictory world became characteristic of Romantic criticism, later being expressed by Victor Hugo in the preface to his play ""Cromwell"", in which he lauded Shakespeare as an artist of the grotesque, a genre in which the tragic, absurd, trivial and serious were inseparably intertwined."
"Theatres and theatrical scenery became ever more elaborate in the 19th century, and the acting editions used were progressively cut and restructured to emphasize more and more the soliloquies and the stars, at the expense of pace and action. Performances were further slowed by the need for frequent pauses to change the scenery, creating a perceived need for even more cuts in order to keep performance length within tolerable limits; it became a generally accepted maxim that Shakespeare's plays were too long to be performed without substantial cuts. The platform, or apron, stage, on which actors of the 17th century would come forward for audience contact, was gone, and the actors stayed permanently behind the fourth wall or proscenium arch, further separated from the audience by the orchestra (see image at right)."
"Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in ""authentic"" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in "" Antony and Cleopatra"" was one spectacular example. Too often, the result was a loss of pace. Towards the end of the century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of ""Elizabethan"" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama."
"Through the 19th century, a roll call of legendary actors' names all but drown out the plays in which they appear: Sarah Siddons (1755–1831), John Philip Kemble (1757–1823), Henry Irving (1838–1905), and Ellen Terry (1847–1928). To be a star of the legitimate drama came to mean being first and foremost a ""great Shakespeare actor"", with a famous interpretation of, for men, Hamlet, and for women, Lady Macbeth, and especially with a striking delivery of the great soliloquies. The acme of spectacle, star, and soliloquy of Shakespeare performance came with the reign of actor-manager Henry Irving and his co-star Ellen Terry in their elaborately staged productions, often with orchestral incidental music, at the Lyceum Theatre, London from 1878 to 1902. At the same time, a revolutionary return to the roots of Shakespeare's original texts, and to the platform stage, absence of scenery, and fluid scene changes of the Elizabethan theatre, was being effected by William Poel's Elizabethan Stage Society."
"In the early 20th century, Harley Granville-Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts, while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging. Both approaches have influenced the variety of Shakespearean production styles seen today."
The 20th century also saw a multiplicity of visual interpretations of Shakespeare's plays.
"Gordon Craig's design for ""Hamlet"" in 1911 was groundbreaking in its Cubist influence. Craig defined space with simple flats: monochrome canvases stretched on wooden frames, which were hinged together to be self-supporting. Though the construction of these flats was not original, its application to Shakespeare was completely new. The flats could be aligned in many configurations and provided a technique of simulating architectural or abstract lithic structures out of supplies and methods common to any theater in Europe or the Americas."
"The second major shift of 20th-century scenography of Shakespeare was in Barry Vincent Jackson's 1923 production of ""Cymbeline"" at the Birmingham Rep. This production was groundbreaking because it reintroduced the idea of modern dress back into Shakespeare. It was not the first modern-dress production since there were a few minor examples before World War I, but ""Cymbeline"" was the first to call attention to the device in a blatant way. Iachimo was costumed in evening dress for the wager, the court was in military uniforms, and the disguised Imogen in knickerbockers and cap. It was for this production that critics invented the catch phrase ""Shakespeare in plus-fours"". The experiment was moderately successful, and the director, H.K. Ayliff, two years later staged ""Hamlet"" in modern dress. These productions paved the way for the modern-dress Shakespearean productions that we are familiar with today."
"In 1936, Orson Welles was hired by the Federal Theatre Project to direct a groundbreaking production of ""Macbeth"" in Harlem with an all African American cast. The production became known as the Voodoo Macbeth, as Welles changed the setting to a 19th-century Haiti run by an evil king thoroughly controlled by African magic. Initially hostile, the black community took to the production thoroughly, ensuring full houses for ten weeks at the Lafayette Theatre and prompting a small Broadway success and a national tour."
"Other notable productions of the 20th century that follow this trend of relocating Shakespeare's plays are H.K. Ayliff's ""Macbeth"" of 1928 set on the battlefields of World War I, Welles' ""Julius Caesar"" of 1937 based on the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg, and Thacker's ""Coriolanus"" of 1994 costumed in the manner of the French Revolution."
"In 1978, a deconstructive version of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was performed at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The main character walked through the audience toward the stage, acting drunk and shouting sexist comments before he proceeded to tear down (i.e., deconstruct) the scenery. Even after press coverage, some audience members still fled from the performance, thinking they were witnessing a real assault."
"Suppose for the sake of argument, we start by imagining an amount 32 in Envelope A. In order that the reasoning in steps 6 and 7 is correct ""whatever"" amount happened to be in Envelope A, we apparently believe in advance that all the following ten amounts are all equally likely to be the smaller of the two amounts in the two envelopes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 (equally likely powers of 2: Falk and Konold, 1992). But going to even larger or even smaller amounts, the ""equally likely"" assumption starts to appear a bit unreasonable. Suppose we stop, just with these ten equally likely possibilities for the smaller amount in the two envelopes. In that case, the reasoning in steps 6 and 7 was entirely correct if envelope A happened to contain any of the amounts 2, 4, ... 512: switching envelopes would give an expected (average) gain of 25%. If envelope A happened to contain the amount 1, then the expected gain is actually 100%. But if it happened to contain the amount 1024, a massive loss of 50% (of a rather large amount) would have been incurred. That only happens once in twenty times, but it is exactly enough to balance the expected gains in the other 19 out of 20 times."
"Alternatively we do go on ad infinitum but now we are working with a quite ludicrous assumption, implying for instance, that it is infinitely more likely for the amount in envelope A to be smaller than 1, ""and"" infinitely more likely to be larger than 1024, than between those two values. This is a so-called improper prior distribution: probability calculus breaks down; expectation values are not even defined; see Falk and Konold and (1982)."
"Many authors have also pointed out that if a maximum sum that can be put in the envelope with the smaller amount exists, then it is very easy to see that Step 6 breaks down, since if the player holds more than the maximum sum that can be put into the ""smaller"" envelope they must hold the envelope containing the larger sum, and are thus certain to lose by switching. This may not occur often, but when it does, the heavy loss the player incurs means that, on average, there is no advantage in switching. Some writers consider that this resolves all practical cases of the problem."
"But the problem can also be resolved mathematically without assuming a maximum amount. Nalebuff (1989), Christensen and Utts (1992), Falk and Konold (1992), Blachman, Christensen and Utts (1996), Nickerson and Falk (2006), pointed out that if the amounts of money in the two envelopes have any proper probability distribution representing the player's prior beliefs about the amounts of money in the two envelopes, then it is impossible that whatever the amount ""A=a"" in the first envelope might be, it would be equally likely, according to these prior beliefs, that the second contains ""a""/2 or 2""a"". Thus step 6 of the argument, which leads to ""always switching"", is a non-sequitur, also when there is no maximum to the amounts in the envelopes."
"The first two resolutions discussed above (the ""simple resolution"" and the ""Bayesian resolution"") correspond to two possible interpretations of what is going on in step 6 of the argument. They both assume that step 6 indeed is ""the bad step"". But the description in step 6 is ambiguous. Is the author after the unconditional (overall) expectation value of what is in envelope B (perhaps - conditional on the smaller amount, ""x""), or is he after the conditional expectation of what is in envelope B, given any possible amount ""a"" which might be in envelope A? Thus, there are two main interpretations of the intention of the composer of the paradoxical argument for switching, and two main resolutions."
"A large literature has developed concerning variants of the problem. The standard assumption about the way the envelopes are set up is that a sum of money is in one envelope, and twice that sum is in another envelope. One of the two envelopes is randomly given to the player (""envelope A""). The originally proposed problem does not make clear exactly how the smaller of the two sums is determined, what values it could possibly take and, in particular, whether there is a minimum or a maximum sum it might contain. However, if we are using the Bayesian interpretation of probability, then we start by expressing our prior beliefs as to the smaller amount in the two envelopes through a probability distribution. Lack of knowledge can also be expressed in terms of probability."
"A first variant within the Bayesian version is to come up with a proper prior probability distribution of the smaller amount of money in the two envelopes, such that when Step 6 is performed properly, the advice is still to prefer Envelope B, whatever might be in Envelope A. So though the specific calculation performed in step 6 was incorrect (there is no proper prior distribution such that, given what is in the first envelope A, the other envelope is always equally likely to be larger or smaller) a correct calculation, depending on what prior we are using, does lead to the result formula_15 for all possible values of ""a""."
"In these cases it can be shown that the expected sum in both envelopes is infinite. There is no gain, on average, in swapping."
"Though Bayesian probability theory can resolve the first mathematical interpretation of the paradox above, it turns out that examples can be found of proper probability distributions, such that the expected value of the amount in the second envelope given that in the first does exceed the amount in the first, whatever it might be. The first such example was already given by Nalebuff (1989). See also Christensen and Utts (1992)."
"Denote again the amount of money in the first envelope by ""A"" and that in the second by ""B"". We think of these as random. Let ""X"" be the smaller of the two amounts and ""Y=2X"" be the larger. Notice that once we have fixed a probability distribution for ""X"" then the joint probability distribution of ""A,B"" is fixed, since ""A,B"" = ""X,Y"" or ""Y,X"" each with probability 1/2, independently of ""X,Y""."
"The ""bad step"" 6 in the ""always switching"" argument led us to the finding ""E(B|A=a)>a"" for all ""a"", and hence to the recommendation to switch, whether or not we know ""a"". Now, it turns out that one can quite easily invent proper probability distributions for ""X"", the smaller of the two amounts of money, such that this bad conclusion is still true. One example is analysed in more detail, in a moment."
"As mentioned before, it cannot be true that whatever ""a"", given ""A=a"", ""B"" is equally likely to be ""a""/2 or 2""a"", but it can be true that whatever ""a"", given ""A=a"", ""B"" is larger in expected value than ""a""."
"Suppose for example (Broome, 1995) that the envelope with the smaller amount actually contains 2 dollars with probability 2/3 where ""n"" = 0, 1, 2,… These probabilities sum to 1, hence the distribution is a proper prior (for subjectivists) and a completely decent probability law also for frequentists."
"Imagine what might be in the first envelope. A sensible strategy would certainly be to swap when the first envelope contains 1, as the other must then contain 2. Suppose on the other hand the first envelope contains 2. In that case there are two possibilities: the envelope pair in front of us is either {1, 2} or {2, 4}. All other pairs are impossible. The conditional probability that we are dealing with the {1, 2} pair, given that the first envelope contains 2, is"
"and consequently the probability it's the {2, 4} pair is 2/5, since these are the only two possibilities. In this derivation, formula_17 is the probability that the envelope pair is the pair 1 and 2, ""and"" Envelope A happens to contain 2; formula_18 is the probability that the envelope pair is the pair 2 and 4, ""and"" (again) Envelope A happens to contain 2. Those are the only two ways that Envelope A can end up containing the amount 2."
"It turns out that these proportions hold in general unless the first envelope contains 1. Denote by ""a"" the amount we imagine finding in Envelope A, if we were to open that envelope, and suppose that ""a"" = 2 for some ""n"" ≥ 1. In that case the other envelope contains ""a""/2 with probability 3/5 and 2""a"" with probability 2/5."
"So either the first envelope contains 1, in which case the conditional expected amount in the other envelope is 2, or the first envelope contains ""a"" > 1, and though the second envelope is more likely to be smaller than larger, its conditionally expected amount is larger: the conditionally expected amount in Envelope B is"
"which is more than ""a"". This means that the player who looks in Envelope A would decide to switch whatever he saw there. Hence there is no need to look in Envelope A to make that decision."
"This conclusion is just as clearly wrong as it was in the preceding interpretations of the Two Envelopes Problem. But now the flaws noted above do not apply; the ""a"" in the expected value calculation is a constant and the conditional probabilities in the formula are obtained from a specified and proper prior distribution."
"Most writers think that the new paradox can be defused, although the resolution requires concepts from mathematical economics. Suppose formula_20 for all ""a"". It can be shown that this is possible for some probability distributions of ""X"" (the smaller amount of money in the two envelopes) only if formula_21. That is, only if the mean of all possible values of money in the envelopes is infinite. To see why, compare the series described above in which the probability of each ""X"" is 2/3 as likely as the previous ""X"" with one in which the probability of each ""X"" is only 1/3 as likely as the previous ""X"". When the probability of each subsequent term is greater than one-half of the probability of the term before it (and each ""X"" is twice that of the ""X"" before it) the mean is infinite, but when the probability factor is less than one-half, the mean converges. In the cases where the probability factor is less than one-half, <math>E(B|A=a) for all ""a"" other than the first, smallest ""a"", and the total expected value of switching converges to 0. In addition, if an ongoing distribution with a probability factor greater than one-half is made finite by, after any number of terms, establishing a final term with ""all the remaining probability,"" that is, 1 minus the probability of all previous terms, the expected value of switching with respect to the probability that ""A"" is equal to the last, largest ""a"" will exactly negate the sum of the positive expected values that came before, and again the total expected value of switching drops to 0 (this is the general case of setting out an equal probability of a finite set of values in the envelopes described above). Thus, the only distributions that seem to point to a positive expected value for switching are those in which formula_21. Averaging over ""a"", it follows that formula_23 (because ""A"" and ""B"" have identical probability distributions, by symmetry, and both ""A"" and ""B"" are greater than or equal to ""X"")."
"If we don't look into the first envelope, then clearly there is no reason to switch, since we would be exchanging one unknown amount of money (""A""), whose expected value is infinite, for another unknown amount of money (""B""), with the same probability distribution and infinite expected value. However, if we do look into the first envelope, then for all values observed (formula_24) we would want to switch because formula_20 for all ""a"". As noted by David Chalmers (2002), this problem can be described as a failure of dominance reasoning."
"Under dominance reasoning, the fact that we strictly prefer ""A"" to ""B"" for all possible observed values ""a"" should imply that we strictly prefer ""A"" to ""B"" without observing ""a""; however, as already shown, that is not true because formula_23. To salvage dominance reasoning while allowing formula_23, one would have to replace expected value as the decision criterion, thereby employing a more sophisticated argument from mathematical economics."
"For example, we could assume the decision maker is an expected utility maximizer with initial wealth ""W"" whose utility function, formula_28, is chosen to satisfy <math>E(u(W+B)|A=a) for at least some values of ""a"" (that is, holding onto formula_24 is strictly preferred to switching to ""B"" for some ""a""). Although this is not true for all utility functions, it would be true if formula_28 had an upper bound, formula_31, as ""w"" increased toward infinity (a common assumption in mathematical economics and decision theory). Michael R. Powers (2015) provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the utility function to resolve the paradox, and notes that neither formula_32 nor formula_33 is required."
"Some writers would prefer to argue that in a real-life situation, formula_34 and formula_35 are bounded simply because the amount of money in an envelope is bounded by the total amount of money in the world (""M""), implying formula_36 and formula_37. From this perspective, the second paradox is resolved because the postulated probability distribution for ""X"" (with formula_21) cannot arise in a real-life situation. Similar arguments are often used to resolve the St. Petersburg paradox."
"As mentioned above, ""any distribution"" producing this variant of the paradox must have an infinite mean. So before the player opens an envelope the expected gain from switching is ""∞ − ∞"", which is not defined. In the words of David Chalmers (2002), this is ""just another example of a familiar phenomenon, the strange behaviour of infinity"". Chalmers suggests that decision theory generally breaks down when confronted with games having a diverging expectation, and compares it with the situation generated by the classical St. Petersburg paradox."
"However, Clark and Shackel argue that this blaming it all on ""the strange behaviour of infinity"" does not resolve the paradox at all; neither in the single case nor the averaged case. They provide a simple example of a pair of random variables both having infinite mean but where it is clearly sensible to prefer one to the other, both conditionally and on average. They argue that decision theory should be extended so as to allow infinite expectation values in some situations."
The logician Raymond Smullyan questioned if the paradox has anything to do with probabilities at all. He did this by expressing the problem in a way that does not involve probabilities. The following plainly logical arguments lead to conflicting conclusions:
"A number of solutions have been put forward. Careful analyses have been made by some logicians. Though solutions differ, they all pinpoint semantic issues concerned with counterfactual reasoning. We want to compare the amount that we would gain by switching if we would gain by switching, with the amount we would lose by switching if we would indeed lose by switching. However, we cannot both gain and lose by switching at the same time. We are asked to compare two incompatible situations. Only one of them can factually occur, the other is a counterfactual situation—somehow imaginary. To compare them at all, we must somehow ""align"" the two situations, providing some definite points in common."
"James Chase (2002) argues that the second argument is correct because it does correspond to the way to align two situations (one in which we gain, the other in which we lose), which is preferably indicated by the problem description. Also Bernard Katz and Doris Olin (2007) argue this point of view. In the second argument, we consider the amounts of money in the two envelopes as being fixed; what varies is which one is first given to the player. Because that was an arbitrary and physical choice, the ""counterfactual world"" in which the player, counterfactually, got the other envelope to the one he was actually (factually) given is a highly meaningful counterfactual world and hence the comparison between gains and losses in the two worlds is meaningful. This comparison is uniquely indicated by the problem description, in which two amounts of money are put in the two envelopes first, and only after that is one chosen arbitrarily and given to the player. In the first argument, however, we consider the amount of money in the envelope first given to the player as fixed and consider the situations where the second envelope contains either half or twice that amount. This would only be a reasonable counterfactual world if in reality the envelopes had been filled as follows: first, some amount of money is placed in the specific envelope that will be given to the player; and secondly, by some arbitrary process, the other envelope is filled (arbitrarily or randomly) either with double or with half of that amount of money."
"Byeong-Uk Yi (2009), on the other hand, argues that comparing the amount you would gain if you would gain by switching with the amount you would lose if you would lose by switching is a meaningless exercise from the outset. According to his analysis, all three implications (switch, indifferent, do not switch) are incorrect. He analyses Smullyan's arguments in detail, showing that intermediate steps are being taken, and pinpointing exactly where an incorrect inference is made according to his formalization of counterfactual inference. An important difference with Chase's analysis is that he does not take account of the part of the story where we are told that the envelope called Envelope A is decided completely at random. Thus, Chase puts probability back into the problem description in order to conclude that arguments 1 and 3 are incorrect, argument 2 is correct, while Yi keeps ""two envelope problem without probability"" completely free of probability, and comes to the conclusion that there are no reasons to prefer any action. This corresponds to the view of Albers et al., that without probability ingredient, there is no way to argue that one action is better than another, anyway."
"In a 2012 paper on the subject, Bliss argues that the source of the paradox is that when one mistakenly believes in the possibility of a larger payoff that does not, in actuality, exist, one is mistaken by a larger margin than when one believes in the possibility of a smaller payoff that does not actually exist. If, for example, the envelopes contained $5.00 and $10.00 respectively, a player who opened the $10.00 envelope would expect the possibility of a $20.00 payout that simply does not exist. Were that player to open the $5.00 envelope instead, he would believe in the possibility of a $2.50 payout, which constitutes a smaller deviation from the true value; this results in the paradoxical discrepancy."
"Albers, Kooi, and Schaafsma (2005) consider that without adding probability (or other) ingredients to the problem, Smullyan's arguments do not give any reason to swap or not to swap, in any case. Thus, there is no paradox. This dismissive attitude is common among writers from probability and economics: Smullyan's paradox arises precisely because he takes no account whatever of probability or utility."
