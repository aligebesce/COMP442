"Yeah about , just about, yeah ."
"But eh, you'd have to have it sort of written out and more or less ready I think to go."
"All groups are invited to send resolution which may or may not be actually debated but erm, we, we don't normally send one in, but some, some groups they send them in, no, no one 's thinking"
Think the closing dates a few days time isn't it?
Thursday.
"Thursday, yeah."
"Oh, right, so it's very close."
"Got to be ready tonight, if they're to get it."
No.
"Right, erm, so, I think, I think, as far as future events that's all what we need to mention?"
"Now, erm Rose is secretary and she's had things through from er British Section Headquarters and she'll tell us what she's got there."
"Erm  I don't know if this one concerns us, it's about er, a working group for children, do we have, we don't have a working group for children ."
"No, we've never been very close to the  now."
I won't obviously .
"Erm, I've also received information from the Region, erm with lots of events that's coming up in the East Anglian Region, erm, just run through those quickly, er, there is a workshop on  this Thursday at the Courts , erm, there is on Thursday twelfth of March there is er, somebody from the Columbian committee for human rights speaking at an open meeting, that's the fifth  er, Wednesday first of April there is er somebody called Duncan , he's a paediatric surgeon who works part time as a volunteer at the Medical Foundation for the Care and Victims of Torture who will be speaking at St. Mary's and St. Edmunds group, and that, that's Bury St. Edmunds, and then the next East Anglia Regional Meeting is on Saturday May the twenty third at Bury St. Edmunds again."

"Yeah May the twenty third, it's a Saturday two to five pm at the Friends' Meeting House, Bury."
Bank Holiday weekend isn't it?
I don't know.
"But, erm  I think they could instead have  an electric fox, if there's such a thing?"
"Or, a drag  and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all."
Okay.
Yes?
"They say that hunting's for er  er human pleasure, er, I mean personally I've only been to one hunt, and I don't see what all the  the, the, the, the trouble's about because the huntsman is only a spectator, it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down."
"What's better than , gassing, shooting, poisoning?"
Mm.
What's more humane?
So you think hunting's fair enough?
"From my point of view, yeah."
Yes?
Beside you.
"Yes, I I would have to, I'd have to disagree with er, my colleague here."
"Erm, I, it's not the  shooting is, most certainly, as long as it's with a  a qualified marksman"
Mm.
it's most
Mhm.
"definitely less cruel than hunting  because the animal is chased and er, what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's, really is  the idea's quite horrendous to me!"
"And actually, hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes, a a hunt probably erm, kills one an, at a meet  if they're lucky."
"But hunting does maintain jobs, and countryside people often say."
Would anyone like
Mm.
"to talk to, to to that?"
Yes?
Well coming from a rural community
erm  hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the
Yeah.
"economy of the community  and to have suburbia creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been  the foundation of the  of their economy, for many, many years is  almost ridiculous!"
Mhm.
Down there.
I think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart legitimized by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children!
"When children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society, and they see us as one world  we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world, and that includes the animals in it."

Remand prisoners at a top security jail used a thin mobile phone to make threatening calls to court witnesses it was revealed yesterday.
An astonished guard alerted Durham Jail chiefs when he heard a phone ringing in a cell.

Yes?
"I live in the country, I live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm, and there's no co , no message at all from the farmer that  foxes are a pest  it's a misnomer put about by the hunt."
"Fox hunting was started, two hundred, three hundred years ago by the aristocracy because there wasn't enough deer, because the fo the forests were getting obliterated by the same pi , the same people, it was started as an entertainment, it's an entertainment now!"
"And now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing, they're saying it's pest control, they're saying, we do it, it's quick, it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck."
It's not!
"The hunt encourages foxes into their land  they actually build artificial earths, we saw one of Saturday when we were out protesting, the ar , they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them."
A hunt is no good without foxes.

"We've actually helped stop the  oldest hunt in Scotland, in Li Lithgo in Stirlingshire, which ended last year."
We were very successful then and we've now  progressed.
"We go out every single Saturday, weekdays if we can, and we try and stop the  stop the fo , hounds killing the foxes"
So

"so so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in, in Scotland?"
Very!

"well your talking about it now and, and with a degree of emotion, do you still feel it?"
"oh, it was feel , it was so terrifying, you just, you regard every one with suspicion after that."

"how to handle the nerves, I'll say right now and half of you may want to walk out of the room."
I don't have a magic wand I do not have a magic wand that you know take three deep breaths turn round twice and your nerves will disappear yep.
"So if that's what wanting   we've got problems straightaway erm but certainly we will discuss what to do about that yes and to recognise them and to understand why, yes, fine but I don't have a magic wand."

So it's to be clear in what you're saying to be able to explain yourself clearly so it's about clarity
right
"The need to make it clear so that people understand without having to sort of keep coming back and asking again and again, yep, great, thanks."
John
I'm  I'm the senior  south west I currently work  schemes my main aim on the course is er to gain more confidence
"No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us"
Oh

Rubbish
"old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?"
Mm
You know
"that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?"
"And that, and this, you kept getting this er"
"Oh no you, you can use this, but you"
oil through
"don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that."
Oh
"His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can"
Mm
"put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet"
So just use wax to build up the polish
"waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see"
Mm
but you can
"that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to"
"Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?"
That's already done innit?
"Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about"
"He started just after me, yeah"
"one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the"
"I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards  that'll be each one of those holes, he"
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the
yes
or
"well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand"
he will
"No, he did that."
Ah!
"I suppose if you get, when you get there  everything'll be alright."
But  it was your idea of erm  entrances that got me a bit scared.
From the top more  from the top.
Top.
"Yeah, but just sa say, if you come from th the top you, you're like a  a waist thing round you and if you fall off that'll catch you."
So what do you think?
About the entrance?
Can I have a ?
You could come down on the  the first half and I can jump   and that's like   Wrestle Mania.
Mm.
Mm.
But our feet will come down like that.
Put it this way Trace  I am more petrified than  about this than you are.

"Notices for you, first of all those of you who are on the Committee ."
"Any er ideas you've got  you've got, please pass on to the Committee member  Thursday dinner time."
The only other er notice I've got for you is that tomorrow I forgot to put it on the notices  tomorrow we've got a lot of visitors in school  there's about er thirty five of them coming over who are likely to be joining us in the lower sixth next September er  lessons with the lower sixth to find out what erm  what  lessons are like you know okay.
"Now do welcome them, do make them feel at home, especially those of you who are new to the place you will know and remember what it's like when you first come into a strange building that feels like home."
"Okay, so erm do  them and then if they're lost on practical things like they don't know where the toilet is will you help them."
and er
Thank you the only  is that you will have seen  organised  generally supported that although I think we could support it a lot better than we have.
So er think about that and remember
"It's a different format Mr Dexter this time, we're not having maths we're having a ten minute  and that will be followed by a concert ."
"It's a completely different format, so you might  might like to come to that  okay."
Erm  this morning we have er another visitor and  who actually was a teacher and works at  at a very senior position er heading er very interesting projects to technical location educations  and I would like to er introduce you to Mr
Good morning everybody.
It's about er ten years ago nearly that I er stopped being a teacher and when I was a teacher er  up having to do assemblies er it was always something that I did with great reluctance and er was er pleased if I could get other people to do it er it seems rather odd then er that I've actually said yes coming to do er an assembly here today and it's perhaps a sign of mental instability on my part.
I mean
Okay.
let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and  supporters and what have you!
Okay.
"Any others  that, yes?"
"I don't think animals should be ta , used to be tested for cosmetics"
Mhm.
perfumes or  detergents
Mhm.
different things like that.
What about medical research?
"Well, there again, yes, with reservations  because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives, yes."
"Yes, and you get all the animals who are experimented on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying, oh well this this, this causes cancer in rats or  and you, imagine the amount, the huge amounts of  the sub , whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer, and there's no  knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats  causing cancer, will give cancer to humans!"
"I mean,i it's just absolutely ridiculous!"
I'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity
Aha.
"and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals, for cosmetics, toiletry, household product  purposes."
Hasn't that campaign been going for
"Oh many, many years!"
a long time?
Yes!
And we're making progress now.
How?
There are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time.
"Erm  for example, you can grow human skin in a, in a cell culture and use that as a, as a testing er, medium"
Mhm.
instead of a live animal.
"We can  it can use erm  a si similar substance for eye tests  erm, to test  to replace the Jeyes eye test"
Mhm.
which again has been used for a long time on animals.
These tests are very misleading.
"They don't protect bu su er, er the public, they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products."
and they write the lecture for me
they write yeah
they write the lecture as it takes place
yeah
yes
good preparation
Well no there's actually there's a lot of preparation in that isn't there
Well what I do it on is planning
Oh yes
and er control of sub contractors then you get a mixed group from Tarmac er different companies and their conception of what planning is and conception of what controlling sub contractor is
yeah
is totally different so I did the first lecture with what my idea of  to find myself talking to a a contract housing guy whose biggest order was two thousand pounds
right
so I've have them produce the lecture and then we've gone on from like doing
yep
exactly the thing
right
pick out three things and we'll talk about them
"Mm, mm"
and that's how I use visual aids
so it can actually be a stimulus can't it?
so I then find myself doing nothing else but walking around so I go and ask
right
So it forces me
yes
out into the audience
Well that's what you hinted at yesterday as well didn't it?
I mean if if you're here even now you've got your notes down rather than in your hand and and you stand and read but you don't use that or you don't use that then there is that tendency isn't there to?
So the focus of attention switches from people looking at me
"yeah, to the visual aid yes"
to this to actually looking at what they're producing
"right, yes, and that's an important factor that that if you feel everybody's looking at you it is important"
Oh.
"She used to say what Diane, I've never heard of a Diane, after they were married this"
.
"And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me."
"Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he can't really afford he's flying because you spend all his money, when I, when I've been backing him, saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and"
What did you say to dad?did you say that to dad didn't you say it  .
But I thought she was stirring it you see and so did Diane.
What did you tell .
I didn't believe her
"You didn't, you never ."
"But he said, I said it as a joke when she was asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to support and she takes all the money."
"But I said I am the money  I gave him his first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought his first three cars."
.
"I excused myself and went to bed I think  but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say somebody saying a joking sort of way."
"Yeah, good stirring ."
And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in .
"Does, does anybody know what he's doing,."
"Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in"
What machine?
some magic machine.
What machine?
Magic machine?
Yes.
What kind of machine?
"A machine he's designed, I don't know for what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask Vaughan ."
"It's not to, it's not to isolate gamma rays ."
"Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him."
"It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea that, men, men from Mars have ."
"Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody should go and get him some  some treatment, sanitation."
Yes.
"You can get cranks, you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I think they need checking on to make sure that they are  happy with the life they're leading  it bothers me a lot"
So where is he now?
Exactly.
And Oakes I do like your tie.
I'm glad you mentioned that cos it was given to me by the wife of the steeplechase handicap a very important man today cos for more than
She didn't whisper
and Melinda his wife runs Simply Delightful which is wh that's one of the things she has a shop
in Malton and that's something
Didn't whisper anything that's well in today in the Mackeson did she?
No.
What's on today?
It's a busy old day.
Well it's lacing there's racing all over the all over the country and except at Ayr in Scotland it's raining everywhere I'm sorry to say.
"Racing at Ayr up in Scotland where it is dry, Nottingham, Cheltenham where the Mackeson Gold Cup is, big card at Windsor with a lot of runners and finally the all-weather racing at Lingfield."
Well as John said wet and windy everywhere unless you go very far north but those people up at Ayr it's gonna be cold so you can't have everything.
Main meeting as we've said is Cheltenham let's have the news from there .
First race there twelve fifty the going at the moment is good but they have had a quarter of an inch of rain overnight so of course I suppose there's every chance it could go to good to soft by this afternoon.
"Two important non runners there in the twelve fifty, number seven Far Senior and in the two o'clock number thirteen the I wouldn't say old timer but Panto Prince anyway shame he's not going to get a run."
It is raining at the moment and it's gonna be wet and windy but quite mild for the rest of the day.
No hazards but there'll be a good crowd so get there in plenty of time.
"Actually there's a race at eleven thirty it's a running race between members of the Press and the jockeys, people like Peter Scudimore, Deckland Murphy, Ben Newton for the press he could be the dark horse."
It's over hurdles as well that could be good for a laugh especially if er you don't clear them as well as you should do.
Erm
Scu's Scu's for the press.
Scu's running for the press.
Scu's yeah
Yeah
Yeah is that a help or a hindrance ?
I don't  anyway this is just one of the highlights of what has been two marvellous days at the Mackeson meeting sponsored of course by Whitbread and the big race today is the fifty thousand pound Mackeson Gold Cup confirming fifteen runners over two and a half miles.
Panto Prince is out and General Pershing is now new  favourite and clear favourite.
"Neil Doughty eleven to two, Bradbury Star that has to be the favourite easing slightly this seven to one with General Idea."
Just looking at those prices on the screen I suppose Oakes General Pershing is a worthy favourite or is he?
Well it's a very very competitive race I I I suppose he may have the best chance but there are an awful lot with good chances.
I think he's got a great chance.
And just take note of that.
And that's what it looked like in nineteen seventy seven.
"Er one had the gateway, cobbled stone, approach to the railway station."
"Terrible shame in my opinion that that building was demolished, allowed to go to wrack and ruin, er and then then demolished."
"There you have the  er individual walkway th along there, and the entrance along here er up the yard."
The old  sort of double  erm er  goods shed.
"Er and er vehicles would go down, it drops down inside there, and there's planking er at obviously, level erm on either side er of this arch er this erm er wide way er through to the bottom."
And I'll show you a bit more in a little while.
"There is another picture, taken on a different day, showing, again in about nineteen seventy eight."
"Seventy seven seventy eight, the remains of quite a substantial goods shed, for a relatively small place."
"Now I daresay most of you know that, really the population of  or , was pretty static in the er well from eighteen fifty to about nineteen fifty, or even nineteen sixty."
Erm round about three and a quarter thousand.
Very little change.
"They had er seventeen or nineteen pubs, I can never quite remember."
Er for that population.
"Er and er of course a number were closed in the er early part of this century, and more er coming along."
"We've still got about ten or eleven I think, haven't we?"
"Erm really the railway was closed in nineteen fifty nine, for passenger traffic."
Just about the time that Dougie  started er building substantially in the town and doubled to population to its present six and a half thousand or so.
"Er whether or not it would have survived, I I wouldn't know."
"Anyhow that as I say, was the er goods shed."
Er that erm was in use er as I say until the closure.
"Now there's a picture of the station, and you can see that we've got the post, the cobbled entrance, on this on the left hand side was the station master's house, the garden."
You'll notice that the the erm fencing is vertical.
"Erm and that was normal practice until the early part of the century, about nineteen O seven I think it was that the  started using the er forty five degree angles, style."
"But er er vegetable garden, and the lot."
There's over here there's er a passenger station.
Four wheeled coaches er in here.
"Some goods er wagons on that side, erm lovely ladies in the long dresses and so on."
Er on this right hand side you've got erm various advertisements for er Belfast and Northern Ireland and er and sort of er away days and and so on.
Erm various signals.
"The main er sort of booking place, er waiting rooms and so on."
And what's the better deal?
Let's find out.
"And let's start with a basic question, here in this nation of animal lovers, do you think animals deserve a better deal?"
Some animals?
All animals?
Any animals?
Do they deserve a better deal?
"Button one for yes, and button two for no."
This is a descriptive vote because this hundred er  women are not a representative cross section of the whole of Scotland  they're invited to come from various places  and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal.
When you said yes to that which animals did you mean?
And what were you talking about?
Yes?
"I think, a lot of people  see the stray dogs problem as a big problem, certainly if people have decided to  partake of pets, they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets."
Okay so
And I think problems like that  are due to human irresponsibility!
So those animals do have a raw deal!
"Okay, that's one area."
"Who else said yes, and why?"
"Up, yes?"
"I think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal, for example, large wi wild animals that are used in circuses, we haven't got the right, as people, to say that they're here for our entertainment."
What would that better deal be in that case?
"The better deal would be, not being transported up and down the country, and not being made to perform tricks that are  un unnatural to their own  behaviour patterns."
Aha.
Aha.
Any other views?
Yes?
"I think that er  concern should also spread to animals that are hunted pleasure as well, i.e. the stags, deer, foxes, hares, I mean, there's there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment."
Mhm.
Now the better deal there presumably would involve
Not chasing them at all!
not hunting them at all?
No!
Mm.
W what about  Street school?
"Street School, I was th there on only there a year, and the headmaster came in one day, he was another Liberal politician."
"Headmasters were always members of the council, in those days, and they were always tended to be La Liberal or Labour, which I the present Labour would say was very pale pink."
"And the headmaster at er  Street school, Joseph , was a Labour member of council, and Joseph  was tended to be more Liberal."
"He came in one day and asked what M C C stood for, and I've always known a lot of useless information, so I could tell him, so I was then dispatched everyday to the erm radio shop in the High Street, to get the cricket scores in Australia."
"And then he asked me, he said, Well, have you read that notice on the board about er scholarships?"
"I said, Yes, but there's no hope."
"He says, Well, your aunt was a teacher,co you could go teaching."
You're na you're not going down the pit?
"I said No, no-one at home was, Everyone at home had said, You're not going down the pit."
"And he entered me for the scholarship,, and er, I won."
Mm.
"I incurred his displeasure on one occasion, there was a young lady sat on the form in front, we had those, where you sat in pairs, on the iron sort of things."
"She had plaits, and I tied them together, on to th behind the bar, and he he caned me.."
Mm.
"I suppose caning was a a more frequent form of discipline, in those days?"
"Caning was, er yes, erm."
"If you asked for trouble, you got it."
"Would you ev would you ever get any comeback from you your father, if you got told told off at school ?"
"If you got in trouble at school, you got in trouble at home."
No if and buts..
"About going t about getting the Henr scholarship to , had only just opened then ,"
That
hadn't it?
It hadn't er I went when it opened.
"We were er before then there was the , the school just over the wall to  Street, was the  Centre."
"It was a pupil, teacher centre."
"It started life as a technical school, which it was given by subscription, mainly the colliery company, for scientific education."
But used during the day by the Education Committee as a pupil-teacher centre.
"And up till then, you went to you got your scholarship, you went to the tu pupil- teacher training centre and then you became a teacher."
"Erm if you  passed  , erm you did a stint and then you came to  College, Nottingham for your teaching ticket."
Yes.
"Erm, being with the S S P C A, I have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals, but one of the saddest photographs I saw, quite recently was  two monkeys, well they're primates, we are"
Yep.
"part of that family too, and they were in a lab awaiting experimentation and they were  in cages side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands, almost as though, to give each other comfort."
Mhm.
Monkeys feel pain.
"They feel happiness, sadness  and they also have a sense of humour."
Under the nineteen eighty six act
Mm.
"they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office, as well as locally."
"I mean, it's it's  vets etcetera"
Yeah.
Yep.
"are always present in research establishments to ensure  the well being of the animals, and very often there is actually no pain  involved in the research."
"How, how do you know that?"
Well I was told by somebody who's involved in animal
Right.
research!
Right.
"But er, frequently the animals are used  for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed humanly before the research actually takes place."
"But do we find it acceptable that animals should be used, however painless the event."
Well I would rather use an animal any time that my own child!
Up there.
"Er, Switzerland is one country that has banned the use of animals for research, and I think we ought to be going along these lines  that, if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for experimentation."
Mhm.
"And if we were to ban the the process,th erm  we would devise other means for research, would, we would find alternatives."
There.
"Th there'll, there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it."
It's quite
"alright, they move it out of Switzerland  but if we can't have it here we'll have it in Pakistan or somewhere  where they want the money!"
So it won't make any difference  in that
Yes?
That's all from Region.
"Er, I've also received minutes from the Epping Forest from Redbridge Group and they also have a lobbying workshop erm, that's on the second of March, and they're asking if anybody's interested in that."
Is that an evening?
It doesn't actually say
I think it's
"but, er, probably would be."
If you're interested could follow it up.
"They meet in, don't they meet in Leytonstone or was it Wanstead, somewhere in that area."
Wanstead
"Mm, mm."
"was, was, where they help Islington."
Monday mm.
Would you be interested in it?
"Well I might this, this, the time fitting in with the families, they're, they're likely to come back to"
"Okay, well I'll, I put some information not full details ."
Right.
"Erm, actually there wasn't a lot of detailed stuff, there was erm, materials for gr groups and winter sales"
Do you want to pass that over to Aida please?
"which we have a  erm, there's a bit about release policy and procedures for local groups, er, groups can help their prisoner with mummy or other erm relief, erm on the Christmas family particularly and it's, it's explaining you know how they do it and the best ways to go about it."
"Mm, cos there's a special fund available for that, that's particularly why they"
"anyway they explain all about it, if it would, if we need it."
"Er, there's a mandate workshop."
"Oh they, no, sorry,, they're offering still a mandate workshop for the group, erm, sending a trainer"
I'm the trainer.
"you're the trainer, oh well ."
"I've been very bad on this recently, I've really been too busy or tired, but I have got, I have, today I have had arrived oh not today, the last few days, the new mandate workshop, so"
So you've got to read through it and let .
"I was gonna say, having spent some months or years  well ."
"It's all the new bits in about it, yes mind you, there's always, always been a mandate, the mandate workshop was the very first one that's produced, but this is an updated version and changes ."
"Yeah, have there always been workshops , continue workshops on mandate or?"
"Yes, there's always been a mandate workshop?"
Or just when there  reviews?
Mm
"just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down"
Mm
"cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see"
Yeah without a guard on it
without a guard and they won't
"mm, mm"
allow that on this stand
No I can understand that I suppose
"but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing"
"Something to grip it, mm"
We would have to like pull the wood through you see
"what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er"
"Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know"
don't think you'd be very happy you know
"I mean you wouldn't wanna pay  no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth"
"Damaging them, saw, mm"
Well at least we've had a look at the whether we
"right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?"
Well I mean
What are you gonna do?
I don't know
It's impossible to do by hand
No not impossible
with a good saw
Yeah
and about ten irish navvies
One down below and one above huh
mm
"Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the  they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like  I made the cab some cabinets you know."
I want them split down that road
Which way?
he's got  times
Time
"when ready, weight, number of packages, destination, and then haz"
Well done.
Haz will do nicely for me.
"That's what we're really looking for, hazardous"
Yeah.
goods.
Well done.
"Because, how can I say"
"Even, even I take"
"we've, you'll see, I mean there's a, not a very good illustration of a, the hub with the yellow walls of the, the conveyer belt behind you, but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in."
"The more, er er sophisticated erm  wholesale er  distributors now  know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they?"
"And, they may have one display displayed, but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your  you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's illustrating a Flymo  lawn mower or something and, and it'll, er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging, but, a lot of people for pilferage reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate, from our point of view, what's on the package."
But you must know what's in it.
"Just knowing the size and the weight isn't, you might, that's alright, that's only for the price  what's in it is vital  because  if I asked the sales people  from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them?"
"Do reme , can yo , can I, can you guess at how many would say I don't know?"
Major customers.
Half a dozen.
"It's a lo , I, I'd sa , they wouldn't admit it Bill, they might say something like erm  oh it's electronics, but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic."
Would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box.
"You don't put , you shouldn't, but you should know."
You should declare it.
"They should declare if it's hazardous, infectious, infested,i it will, what's word you used?"
Incestuous weren't it?
Incestuous?
Was that a word.
Infested.
"Infested, contaminated"
Yes it is.
or fragile goods.
"Dangerous,haz really, he should declare it, and people don't you know, unless you ask."
Yes.
so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few
Mhm.
years has has  is an experiment.
How do you feel about that?
"I, don't mind being used as a guinea pig because I feel that it'll help people in the future."
Up there.
I believe that we have been given the right to have dominion over animals.
"The point I would like to put over is, I've listened to one or two erm, radio programmes, and television programmes about this and I personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals."
I don't think us  er er  public people really realize what is going on and I think then they would maybe stand up and be
Mm.
"and be counted, but I think we've tended to stand back and just say  well we know it's going on but what is actually being  done to these"
Mhm.
animals?
Yes?
"Yes, we  that lady over said there were guidelines, there were people that go in and inspect, but there are not enough, it is a known fact, that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal  erm, experimentations are taking place  and, I love animals, and alright, yes,yo you can do ex , some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel!"
"That lady up there said that we have experiments, I'm sure, human  experiments , you know, experiments, sorry, on human people"
Mm.
"but, on human beings, but we're not put through the state that animals are!"
We
Mm.
"don't have great lumps made to grown on us, we don't go through she , severe pain."
"And, which company was it that says, to  do something about pain  you first have to create it."
Mm.
"Ah, I mean that's terrible!"
"I was responsible for researching into the, so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty, and it was a real can of worms!"
I was
Yep!
I was sorry I got involved in it at one point!
Erm  cosmetic companies are very devious!
It's what they don't tell you that's important.
"Erm, there is a big problem at the moment with cosmetic labelling, for example, erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean?"
So But  was without a a secondary school
Yes.
"for quite a long period, wasn't it ?"
Yes.
"Yes, until Annie  came,m after the war."
Was?
How did the community feel about that??
They felt strongly
?
"They felt strongly about it, but er  was only twelve minutes away, on the railway, quarter of an hour on the bus."
"And of course, in spite of everything that's being said, the thing about  was that because of the two railway stations you could get anywhere in half or three quarters of an hour."
"You could get to I know Graham  went to , which  is way out, other went up the Kimberley and that area, and other went to Sutton."
And everybody could get home very quickly because of the railway stations that were there.
So did you travel to school on the railways?
"We tr I travelled to school on the railway one bit, when they gave us season tickets, because with a scholarship you got your fares paid."
"And then they started paying your bus fare, at the end of the week, and so I decided I could walk."
". Er fourpence return was two mars bars, and quite a lot of us walked."
Were there many boys from  at  ?
"Oh yes, there were Well, all the  erm boys from up to about the fifth form, in the old pupil-teachers training centre went, er  was formed by joining that and  school, they took boys from there ."
.
"And er then there was the new intake of ourselves, and er there were probably fifty or sixty the first year."
"Erm, only three scholarship, but then of course, you got the er governors free places, which were nearly the same, and then the number who were being paid for."
D s So did you notice any sort of class differences within the school?
"Very little, after the first  week ."
"Erm uniform's a great leveller, or a I I'd never had such marvellous clothes."
"Erm I know a friend of mine, and my ambition, then, was to wear a collar and tie and wear half-shoes, as opposed to a jersey and boots."
"Erm now, of course, we'd wear a jersey and boots quite  happily , but er I did get a grant for clothing because otherwise there was no way of goin of accepting a scholarship."
"And erm the immediate reaction, at home, was to say, Well, you can't go."
"And the headmaster said,quietly, Let's talk about it."
"And er so I had clothes from , and er I learnt what clerical colo clerical grey was,and er, also what house shoes were, erm you know, slippers for wearing in school."
"So tt and of course, the other thing I learnt there was that you had dinner the wrong way round, you didn't have your pudding first, to fill you up.."
"So  What other memories do you have of of , then?"
"coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it?"
yeah
"mm  there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet."
Oh yes the
Erm
the very big lady
"er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled"
Gosh
Sounds drastic doesn't it?
does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it
"Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er"
But I still like
"either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight"
I still like to know how they staple it.
"Yeah  yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er"
It must be an operation or
"Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it?"
"Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples  must be"
"Mm she was, what, what are you doing?"
Stop it
sounds a bit drastic
"Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation  presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to  stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a"
On the concept yep
"more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the"
but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat
That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise
"you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there?"
Yes it's er
"I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales"
Oh yes
Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer?
No
"Yes, but they never do!"
"You might say that about the human animal really, mightn't you?"
Yes
Thank you all very much for a civilized and interesting discussion.
Thank you for joining us.
Goodbye.
"What time do you get there   what, what time did you get there?"
.
.
"No,."
You said this morning  didn't ya?
"Travelling, between Woking and Guildford, or whatever."
"Er, and that, you, you'll  at the town cooking dinner, watching television, talking to my friend, or just roughly what you're doing at that time that conversation took place, okay,at work,form, then make me a cup of tea, she was photo-copying,"
Mm.
"that's what she was, she was doing  ."
There's an awful lot involved though.
", you're usually saying oh it's just, just general ."
Mm.
"Went shopping or whatever, as I say, it, it, it, a couple of days or whatever you feel, if you, if you, if you want to get into it you might find you want to do them all"
Mm.
"but if you, in two days, that"
yeah
"would be grate, okay, and the same thing for next page, this is the day I started which, like maybe tomorrow or next day or when ever you start it Wednesday, I started at ten o'clock in the morning, was I, I was in Woking, what was I doing  nothing just reading a, do whatever you have to put in your whatever you  ,"
yeah
"where you went for a walk, down, went to the shops"
mm.
"or whatever, just let them know roughly what you're doing, cos, all they get is a tape, it gives them an idea of what sort of things were happening at that time, any words they can't pick up  if she's cooking, maybe that's something she was making or whatever, erm, in the  please write the first names and details, why you know them, of all the people speaking on this side of the tape, in order in which they speak on the tape in the first, first instance, right, you know, so now Carla, my husband, myself, Lee and, you don't need to repeat them again after that"
Mm.
"so if you don't, don't want, not worried too much about this, I mean, although we want you to do this, I mean, rather just get the conversation, in, even though you don't do this ."
You want more than that .
The knob on the cooker's been turned.
Thanks for your patience.
That was very kind of you Sir James erm .
"Particular example, remember this is all confidential I I'm told so er er it won't go any further than this  room."

all the time
"So do you think it's something to do with maturity perhaps a child, a child is this wha what do you mean by forgiving?"
"You can forgive or punish at the same time can't you, you can punish somebody and say that is wrong and yet you forgive them, that is you don't hold it against them  but you  later on."
they may get they get sort of get a bad name and perhaps not
No.
No.
"You also have to think of the effect it has on other people, how er if you just let people get away with it, it doesn't mean you hate them, loathe them and damn them  but er you've got to make them realise that  for other people, for everybody."
What do you think er Graham.
what the parents  you know .
one-to-one
Yes .
Martina?
really.
"How then, how then?"
"Christians are supposed to forgive, but what if say it's the mother of somebody who had a child that's been murdered or if somebody has been raped you cannot say that they should forgive you cos they were a Christian."
"There's a lot of talk about forgiving or forgetting isn't there, some people say I can forgive but I can never forget."
Er you might think about some of these parents who have children murdered in the  how much do you think revenge comes into it?
is it?
"It's not that they're in rehabilitation, it's just like seeing  that person is locked away in the prime of their lives  revenge ."
Is this revenge or is this just the stopping other people from suffering really?
Shut up
Anyway
"they ask about school say, but I don't think schools have the authority really to do anything either way about er forgiveness."
"It's like if you fall out with a teacher on the first day of term, if that teacher"
You haven't that chapter for the rest of the year  and say the teacher probably thinks well this child  and
I think forgiveness is  not always
An ideal
forgive thine enemy always remember
"Oh, very happy memories really, we erm we had two or three masters from , erm one was the Sunday School superintendent, again this chapel and the son-in-law of the headmaster of  Street, George Edward ,, as he's known to thousands."
"He must be rolling round, cos he was the maths master, he must be rolling round in his grave, as people say percentage, because he if you said percentage he yelled at you, Percentage of what?"
". Erm but you'd failed him, if you didn't get a distinction in School Certificate maths, or arithmetic."
So h how old were you when you left school?
Sixteen.
"Which was, I mean, very late for those  ?"
No.
No.
"We left er the secondary school, or as they were then, the grammar schools, at sixteen."
You left the other one at fourteen.
"I could have stayed at  Street  till I was fourteen , I could have stayed at  Street until I was fourteen, and then you would've been out."
"And er but at er there you'd got to go for the other two years, and some parents were rather wondering whether that left you late in the queue for a job, because jobs were very difficult."
"Or whether you were going to earn enough, later on."
Mm.
How did you go about finding a job?
"Wrote hundreds of letter,er to the people you wanted to do, because I'd never expected having to find a job, I must admit, because the year before I took School Certificate I had got a Naval a artificer apprenticeship, but then I got kicked in the eye playing rugby, and failed a medical."
"Something I'd never to do, so I had to settle down and get School Certificate, which I got with my matric exemption, and people from  did."
"It er you were taught, and er I ju I'd say it was as liberal a education as you get now, but you'd got to get your maths, you'd got to English, you'd got to get a language, you'd got to get a science, and"
Mm.
it was broadly based.
And so what was the job  found ?
"And eventually I found a job er as assistant to the er clerking to the  rating officer, who had also been a member of t , who was a member of the chapel, and er knew I was looking for a job and er, I hadn't written to him cos I didn't know this one was coming up."
"And so he told you about it, rather than?"
"Yes, he told me, he said Ah well, have you got a job yet?"
"I said No, not yet, erm I'm awaiting replies from so many."
"So I accepted a job with him, and then I got two offers the next day, one with the savings bank, I think it was, and one with someone else.."
And what what payment did you get?
Ten shilling a week.
Would it have been better had you gone to the other jobs?
Or would it have been about the same?
"I don't know erm, probably about the same, then."
It was about it was the same as I'd probably got if I'd have gone to the pit at fourteen..
Fighting has cut off supplies to the refugees.
Save The Children works with organisations like the Red Cross to restore that life line.
Poor children in Jamaica often fall prey to drugs dealers who offer them clothes and shoes in return for carrying drugs.
"Save The Children helps youngsters living and working on the streets, it runs schools where the poorest can get hot meals and lessons."
Just one more example of how Save the Children does just that all round the world.
Yes.
"Those are some of the reasons why I and many others support Save The Children and thank you Patricia Routledge  for talking to us today, it was a pleasure listening to you."
Hello everyone.
Once again it is lovely to see you all.
"Well this is it, next year is our seventy fifth birthday so today is one of our most important meetings we will ever have."
"It'll be a very challenging year for volunteers, I'm sure you'll all agree."
In the past year I've been invited by many of you to meet branch members and to make shop visits all over the United Kingdom.
It's been a privilege to have done this  and I'm overwhelmed by the enthusiasm I've encountered.
"You, Save The Children Fund volunteers, are determined not to let the recession beat you."
The message I've given to London is that volunteers are in very good heart and it doesn't stop there.
The really good thing is that there are a huge variety of plans for our big year.
More of that later.
But what about the last twelve months.
What stories do our figures tell us?
"Well  while we were all delighted about the tremendous increase in income two years ago we were also a little concerned about how we should hold on to it, but we have."
"Last year branch income was on target at seven point eight million pounds, a massive increase on the plateau of five to five and half million pounds we were on before Skip Lunch."
Congratulations to you all.
"And the shops, well there are now one hundred and fifty nine shops."
"Together they have raised five point seven million pounds last year, a wonderful result and thank you all."
I particularly want to highlight the shop cash donations.
We've introduced a new donations box and some shops have special donations secretaries  and many helpers encourage donations too.
What a success story.
"Shop cash donations have gone up from five hundred and sixty three thousand to six hundred and twenty nine thousand, a marvellous increase."
Hello sir.
How you doing?
Not so good.
"No I can't come, I'm dining with er, Charles and a post-grad."
"So  Gerard's his name, erm, remind me to see about, are you free tomorrow at eleven?"
"Yes, Tony's just dropped that on me"
Oh
from a great height.
"No I'll, I'll speak to you, I'll speak to you later."
"Erm, er, clearly if you're a, a net importer of agriculture, you have benefited from other people's protectionism."
"Okay, and you will suffer as a result of liberalization, and by and large those costs, or those benefits that er, reaped at the moment by those countries are very, very small in comparison to the, er, the costs of protectionism to the rest of the world."
Right okay.
"Tell you what we'll do is er, leave it there now."
"I would recommend you do is look in this book, there's a coup a couple of copies of which is, I mean er, is in the library, right."
"Current Issues in Agricultural Economics er, edited by your lord and master, Professor Rayner and also a chap called David Coleman  okay so, Current Issues in Agricultural Economics by A Rayner and D Coleman."
"But if you look at chapter four in that book, we have the title, Agricultural Trade and the GATT."
"Alright, now the first part of this chapter spells out erm, er, developments in agricultural trade, why it's, why it's fallen in relative terms right."
"It then goes on to look at the costs of protectionism so they're, they're looking at erm, the numerical estimates as to how much erm, protectionism costs,not only for domestic producers and consumers and tax payers, but also for third countries."
"It then goes on to look at erm, why agriculture hasn't been included in the GATT up until now, and prospects for a solution within the GATT."
"This er, although it's not on your reading list, erm, the reading list that Bob  gave to you, er, it, it should be."
"It's essential to erm, to what you've been going through in the last, in the last few lectures."
"Readable, full of erm, empirical evidence about costs of agricultural protection, and what's happened to agricultural prices and I re I do recommend that you have a look at it if you, it's an invaluable  if you look at anything, look at, look at this one article."
"And there should be a couple of er, issues of this book in, in the library, okay, right, well thanks very much."
"Have a very good holiday and er,tomorrow there won't be a normal agri-econ lecture, there'll be a special lecture, but it'll be in the same place, same time."
"Hello, Tim  speaking, I was on my way Charles."
"Okay, I'll see you in a minute."
Bye .
"Right, that's it."
Right.
Got well loads of homework tonight.
Got any merit marks today?
Er  one yeah in maths  ooh er
for the class work  look at that homework I got two wrong    and in science  steady  should be  finish.
Try doing that.
"Now  do you think that the campaign th the th , the campaigns against the use in cosmetic testing had anything to do with the changes that were brought in, or do you think advances and responsible er  science would have, would have made those changes anyway?"
"I think inevitably,th the changes would have come because the, the alternatives are better."
Yep.
They are less misleading.
"Ah, but I think the campaign, the public campaign and the pressure that's been put on companies have definitely made quite a, quite a difference."
Yes?
While I agree that there is absolutely no justification for testing for cosmetic purposes at all!
Absolutely
Yes.
none!
I think we would have advanced to the stage we are at had we not used animals in the earlier stages for medical research.
"We're advancing all the time and I think there may came a time we won't use animals at all for medical research, but at, up till now we needed to use animals for medical research."
"I think you've got to be realistic about this whole issue, that  er, obviously seeing the poor furry little bunny suffering for cosmetics!"
Mhm.
Yes!
"I agree, that is wrong!"
"But, if a test on a chimpanzee would save my child's life I'm afraid I'd go for the test on the chimpanzee."
Okay.
Yes?
"Erm I  I think that one of the erm, drawbacks in using animals for any kind of testing is that it sort of precludes in some way using alternatives."
"And I think that, you know people who, they may be trained when they're a studying to"
Mhm.
"use animals, and then go onto to work using animals, and erm  you know, if maybe alternative techniques were introduced at an earlier stage, maybe in their training, they'd be more likely to them on board."
"But, it's almost like it's  the established pattern to use animals to test"
Mhm.
"all sorts of things, and it's gonna take quite a big shifty to get out of that."
Mhm.
Yes?
I agree with what that lady's just said.
"What I find horrible is that  there are so many organisations or  or places all over Great Britain, they're all doing the same sort of tests!"
Can't we  collate our knowledge so that not so many tests are having to be done on all these animals?
Yes?
"erm, sort of relative."
"Yeah, that, that needs something if you actually set up a system and then a business meeting one month and a speaker the next, it puts a lot of pressure on one of us or some of us to, to , erm, this is true."
"Maybe, maybe, maybe if, I think it sounds as if people would, would like that, you know, at least every few months perhaps to have something different"
Yes.
"maybe, maybe, people could just be thinking or, you know if they hear of somebody who might be able to come and give a talk like your friend who, who was very good, erm, you know, we could make a note of it and, or ask people, you know, could talk to talk or something that sort."
"Mm, mm, that sounds a possibility, I think, I think it is interesting to have someone like that you know"
Mm.
"Like we had you know, who could talk about experiences you know, in a, in a particular country where there are human rights and problems, good."
"Right erm, so that's it, is that all the"
.
business?
"Yes, just, just, remind people the next, the next meeting erm, is Tuesday the tenth of March, we always meet on a Tuesday evening and it will be at Ann's house in Harlow, which is , said on the tape ."
Must be of benefit.
.
"Right, er, people can take what bits from tables they want them, or, I've got s , I've got one  put out, erm, shall we open that door a bit, it's getting a bit hot in here, erm, don't know if Mary wants any help out there."
Good.
"Testing, testing."
"Okay right, so what we've been looking at this week is trade in agricultural commodities, and er, possibly a little bit of GATT as well."
"And I believe Bob  has asked you to er, I think, collect some data erm, on trade in wheat and cotton erm, as an example."
We'll come on to that a bit later on.
"But can you just give me, sort of, a brief overview of what's happened to the composition of world trade right, say over the last hundred years or so."
What have been the main features?
"Well the er, proportion agricultural trade has decreased."
"Right, correct, okay, erm what absolute, the absolute values of trade."
"So the relative share of agricultural trade has declined, the relative share of manufacturing trade has increased."
How about in absolute terms?
It's increased.
"Yes, that's right."
All trade has increased.
"Why, why has trade in all commodities, agricultural or non-agricultural increased?"
Better transport links.
I .
"Well John and I are both Chair Person, are Co-Chair at the moment, erm"
"Yeah, we don't, we don't seem to have a Vice Chairman, looking at last years"
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps it was because of that we didn't have it, and the treasurer and the secretary are officially erm, and we do have constitution don't we now of course, so we can look at the constitution and see what it says"
.
"erm, I think what those post were, were erm elected and then the"
Means we've got to produce  .
.
"Right, we, we, we did actually draw, or we not draw, we, we adopted a constitution during the year and the officers that are erm elected are the Chair, the Secretary and the Treasurer, erm and other, together with other such officers, yeah to  to determine by general meeting, erm, so it's really only those three, er and we have sometimes had Advice Chair if there's only been one Chairman haven't we, one Chair person erm  so I think people need to say if they don't wish to carry on the jobs they're doing and if anybody wishes to nominate anyone in a particular post then slip at the bottom of the minutes could be filled in and either brought to meeting or sent back to the Secretary."
"Erm, I think I will give up being Chair this time, I've done it too long, too long, and I've had it John as Co-Chair during the year and I hope that he'll be able to carry on as, as Chair Person, I think really I've done it, done it for long enough erm, and we'll have to ask, we hope, we hope the Treasurer just taken over will carry on"
.
"erm, and if anybody else has any other post they, they're interesting in doing in taking on or, or would like to help with that could be said as well couldn't it?"
Well are we then not going to have another Co-Chair?
"Well it depends how you want to deal with it, I mean erm, this, the, the, the I think it was just my idea last year of, of sort of erm sharing some of the load I think at that point and hoping that someone could perhaps take over, erm, this just says the following should be elected, A, Chair, B, Secretary and C, Treasurer, but erm"
"Well, I, will, you know, I mean, will carry on as Chairman, but I, I'd welcome  competition in the post if anyone's interested"
.
"but, it's unfair saying that I erm, I,continue in my inefficient way if you're all willing to put up with me."
"I think if, if you are going to be the only Chair Person then there should be a, there, there should be a, a Deputy so if you're not able to take the chair, there is somebody else ."
"Perhaps, yeah, yeah, yeah , erm"
Somebody could perhaps sat and
Perhaps that's that's a good idea .
"that, that person ought to be elected as well."
"Mm, what under, that'll be a what Vice Chairman or"
"Well was to be Chairman, was to be  Vice Chair now under these this new ."
Is it in the constitution?
"It isn't in the constitution, no."
No it isn't is it?
.
"No, but you"
.
Mm.
"Not, not very good at drawing up constitutions are we?"
I know I
That's right
the first time I get up well you see I cheat I have it lightly pencilled in
Well that's
You can do that
that's  because that's
you want to start suddenly you find yourself either
I have I tell you I've done that before now and then that one ends up right down in the bottom corner
and it's it's
It just it just takes the edge off it so it is a good tip actually it's just if you've time beforehand is just even as you were saying producing a thought pattern like this even just doing the first level just in pencil.
I've actually seen erm er been in a workshop as a participant where a chap who was excellent at this had what he did was while while the participants were doing some sort of an exercise he was actually making these tiny notes up in the top corner for himself so that when he when he came to the next sort of section that he wanted he'd he'd got he'd got the odd notes just up there in the corner.
So again that's something you can do but yes good tips thank you Jeff
just doing it in pencil lightly in pencil beforehand
Rolf Harris does that
Yeah he does doesn't he yeah that's right
"I don't do it on that, I do it on a big blackboard"
"that's right, that's right yeah there is that but"
well the way I do it is I I try and avoid the lecture lecturer
"yes,"
because I assume the audience knows as much about control and sub contractors as I do
right
but the idea is to to get their ideas  so that you can tell somebody else how you do it on your side then you can tell somebody else
yeah
"the need, I need to change  information"
yeah
it brings out some interesting ideas
I bet it does
and I  the flipchart
yeah
and that's that's the only way  it's amazing we ever get any sort of
right let me just then talk very briefly about this fella.
Now we're fortunate with with this that if I turn it on it's very quiet but if any of you had and I'm sure Jeff you've probably seen it where you get some older machines and the fan in there rattles like mad and there's nothing worse than having that thing rattling all all the day.
.
So that was
Thirty six?
Thirty seven?
"Thirty seven, perhaps ."
"That was during well,th the end of the Depression, really?"
"Well it was still very depressed in the coal trade, you were they were doing this marvellous thing called three on and three off."
"If you worked four, you were worse off than if you worked three, you know, you'd got three days on th er and you got you got three days dole, er unemployment pay."
Mm.
"And er so times were still hard, it wasn't until they, let's say until thirty ei thirty eight, that the depression finished in the coal field, when they started building up from then."
"And of course, this was the time of the means test, when young men from  who er lived at home, their income was taken into account, in assessing how much Dad or Mum couldn't get."
"And er they took themselves off to Coventry and to and to Luton, to the motor trades."
And quite a few went.
What were the?
What
What?
was the sewage conditions and the the water supply like in the thirties in ?
Good..
"Because there'd been arguments about it earlier on in the century, hadn't there?"
"Oh there had, had er it h erm had a marvellous water supply and it had a good sewage it had a good sewage disposal system."
"But erm sewage was to be one of the things I shall never forget, later on."
"Whilst I was working for the council, someone came to ask and we had some new o new officer appointed and he was very worried about getting ca er p permission from the council to launch a sewer scheme that was going to cost a quarter of a million pounds, a very large amount in those days."
"And  the older members of the staff, and there weren't many, I mean the total s council office staff was only about thi was twenty or so, and erm more men were employed outside, than anything."
"And they said, Well you know how to draw up your agenda, and you'll have something that's contentious, in this case it was the supply of stationery from three local stationers, from printi local printers."
"And they argue that half the night, and then er your thing will go through on the nod, if you get it in before t half past nine when they er standing order say the council meeting closes."
Mm.
S so Huck Urban District Council was separate from Nottingham  wasn't it ?
Yes.
Yes.
"Er Nottingham had about three attempts to pinch , and er the last one they were told to put their own house in order, first, because  conditions were so much better than in the city."
"Erm mainly as a result,I I contend, that earlier on the Quaker coal owners encouraged home ownership, has this very high proportion of er owner-occupiers."
"Tt Er in nineteen seventy four, I think, at least about three quarters of them were ."
"But er nevertheless you felt that you wanted to go into Well you were probably to over qualified for going into the pit, weren't you?"
"Never thought about the pit, I'd been There was no question about that, it was something that was not going to last."
"I mean, the pits would be worked out, according to the talk at home, and anyhow, we wanted to live in Dartmouth."
Mm.
So what did you actually do in the rating office?
"Well, I wrote out births, deaths, marriage certificates, and er then measured up houses on the rating side, erm worked them out for evaluations."
"Erm used to go down to weddings, at the register office on a Saturday morning, and hope that they'd turn up without witnesses, because then you had to be  compensated,, for giving your service."
How much would you get for?
"I occasionally got ten shillings, which was more than a week's as much a week's wages."
"Erm but er I learnt to write a fair hand, erm without too many flourishes, which er because I was always told that somebody might be looking at this in a hundred years time, or more."
Mm.
"In going to measure houses, did you have to actually go out and visit houses ?"
"Yes, oh aye I Yes, we You had to measure, and in those days, the councils were grouped in what they called Assessment Committee Areas, and each were wor making sure the other areas were using the same sort of basis."
"And I remember, one afternoon, going out with the whole of the  rating committee, to houses at Eastwood and Beeston, and other places, and m in effect measuring them by counting how many nine inch bricks they were across the front and back, to make sure that, you know, nobody was subsidizing anybody else."
Mm.
"Erm and you went in houses, you saw them."
"You know, learnt about construction."
Mm.
Did you see much of people's living conditions?
"Particularly poor living conditions,?"
"Oh you saw er you'd seen this because er you had friends all over, I mean, the fact that you went to  didn't er tt get rid of all your friends."
Mm.
"Erm you had friends everywh , in all sorts of places, you didn't dally, shall we say, in some of them that might have been a bit smelly."
Mm.
"And others that you wouldn't have gone in anyhow, but they were areas."
"But generally  I saw more living conditions later on, er when er I started rent collecting for the council."
Mm.
"And the rating officer was part time with the council, and one day, a rent collector was taken ill, and then I was given a five shilling bag of copper and told to go and collect these"
When?
When was this?
Er it would be nineteen thirty seven.
Mm.
"If they are selling it abroad, it's international though."
"Mm, ah yes, you can't, any domestic policy has international ramifications, if it affects er, resource allocation and, and demand and agricultural protectionism, like any protectionism will, will er, will reallocate resources, not according to comparative advantage, but according to some erm, some priority, we want to support our agriculture, therefore we'll erm, give agricultural producers a lot of money."
"Now, clearly that's going to dis distort trade because, if we're increasing domestic production   Come in, ah, hi Mervin."
"Sorry, you alright for tomorrow?"
"Yes, I can go to the lecture, but I'm teaching at eleven like yourself."
"I'll er, I'll see you if Win's free at, at eleven."
"Yes, yes, I've been to se I've a couple of people up to sort of promise a hand"
"Yes, is, is, is Tony, is Tony er, busy as well?"
Tony's got a le meeting at ten thirty.
"Ah, which won't finish"
"Fortunately I wasn't expecting to be lecturing, but er,"
Right
I've had to lecture for Paul
"right, well we'll sort, we'll sort something out, but I'll see if Winnie's, I'll see if Winnie's available."
"Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that, yes, yes, okay."
"I mean if the worst comes to the worst, we'll sort of, cancel a lecture, or something"
"Ah, well, it's only a matter of giving them a cup of coffee afterwards."
"Right, okay, I'm sure we can go, we can look after, we can get Robert  in or something"
"Yes, that's right we just get, just grab a couple of people."
Sorry to disrupt your class.
"That's okay, I'll, I'll sort it out anyway, later this afternoon, yes, yes that's right, yes that's it"
"Okay, ten o'clock, eight thirty nine."
Do you want me to introduce us?
"Yes, if, if you want to, just to let the students know"
"Sure, yes"
"who he is, and why he's there."
"That's, that's grand, thanks, Melvin, cheers."
"yes, yes, okay, thanks for everything."
"Erm, right, where was I?"
"Yes, so domestic policies, you know, can not be viewed at in isolation, right."
"All domestic policies will have international implications okay, and it's something that er, governments tend to erm, sort of over overlook when they're arguing the agriculturalists case in, in GATT."
"Then don't you think given that case, we should set up a whole inter international thing, which oversees all the governments?"
"They were, first of all, there were  and  's buses, direct and the  bus."
"And then, of course, come along and er for while there was a competition with chasers over the forest, you know one running either just in front, or just behind the other, sort of thing."
"And then, tt er Reynolds took ove er Reynolds went and er Trent took over and then Duttons went, and Trent took over again."
What about?
Did many people have cars in Hucknall?
"No, very few, erm in  Lane, which is now  in an estate agent's parlance, erm a desirable part of the town, they used to be Mr  the local the solicitor, of Castlegate, and his wife used to drive him to the station, to catch the train to Nottingham."
"She also meet him m met him at lunchtime, because the steam coach used to come out from town, and bring the business men, the wealthier one, out."
Mm.
"And I suppose, seeing as it was so short, it was worth coming home?"
Yes.
In that sort  ?
"Oh yes, er he could er he could still have an hour lunchtime, and er only be out of the office, say, an hour and three quarters."
"Erm moving on a l a little bit, what was your social life at the time?"
"My social life, I suppose, ticked round chapel, then it ticked round er cycling and er walking."
"My brother tt he er had a bicycle and then he joined up, er we did have a hectic time, he could make anything go."
Mm.
"He built a motorbike out of scrap bits he found on the tip, which didn't endear him to Grandma, or anyone else."
"And then joined so he joined the army, and I was left with this bicycle, and a friend of mine said, How about coming with us on Sunday, you can skip chapel this Sunday, and we'll go out er we're going into Derbyshire, and I finished up on Ack's Edge."
"I'd never ridden a bike, hardly, before."
"But then they had a cycling club, at chapel, and so we tended to go Saturdays, and then I started walking and youth hostelling."
"We went youth hostelling for m the sort of the chapel choir, after When you grew up in chapel, then you were either found a job teaching, in the Sunday School, or you went into the choir."
"Well I went in a choir, I could never sing, and I still can't, and er the choir used to go out quite a lot, and er we cycled and we youth-hostelled, even as w or in on working parties, at some of the peak hostels."
"What about erm, you were involved in the amateur dram dramatics  ?"
"Well this er came through the same thing, the Youth Hostels Association, we had a visit from Gyp some German ones who did m play reading in hostels, and er some of ours went back there, and the Youth Hostels Associations, they had a play reading group, and er I joined that."
"As I say, I'd al been in things at chapel, Silas Marner and things, but er this was another thing, and of course, that's where I met my wife, at  er Row, which is the boys' clu was the boys' club's Headquarters."
And er we did one or two plays there and
Mm.
"in the old S St  's Church hall on  Street, which has now gone."
"Would Robin  have acted with you, then?"
"Robin , er William    was at school, one year behind me and I played with him, but Bill wasn't very er big."
"Erm I'm amazed now when I see him on television as to how big he is, because he wasn't as a youngster, and he was fragile and er we ribbed him because, in those days, you had an attache case for a school bag, and your initials were put on it."
"And er, he had the lot, W H M B, you see, and er he wasn't Robin, then."
.
"Er this is erm, er this is the Spring, can't read out what it is, the Spring, this is the great Spring raffle, Amnesty does get quite a lot of money from the raffles, er they start off with just the Christmas one now we have them all through the year I think,"
.
"and they, the first prize is a thousand pounds cash, second prize family holiday cottage in the Isle of Mule and third prize holiday cottage in Norfolk and fourth prize holiday apartment in Cumbria and the, I mean the idea is you take a book and try, if you have a place of work or, or friends that will buy raffle tickets er just try and sell them and er, how much are they? er"
Fifty pence each.
"fifty pence each, right, erm, and er fill in the slips and either bring them back to us or send them off yourself to Headquarters, shall I put, I'll put those out for anybody who feel they could sell them, it all, it all helps to raise money for Amnesty and helps to get them  erm spend the money on the new prisoner's."
"Yeah, I have a complimentary copy of new internationalist  I'm not quite sure why they sent them, but"
"It's on, it's on the  right ."
"Yes , it's, it's got stuff that we could use that's all."
Mm.
"Er, the news letters we get, monthly news letter for groups, er, this one, which is all about what different groups in Britain are doing, can give you ideas ."
"Were not gonna have , were not gonna have quite enough are we this time, I think if perhaps the people who come regularly, erm perhaps could take first, erm I don't know, you, we have ten, is it ten?"
"Yeah, and I've taken one."
Mm.
.
"They are interesting, I mean then, they're, they're, got quite a lot of information on about what's going on"
Yeah
within British Section
Yeah.
anyway.
"I'll erm, the International news letter which has lots of groups and details about people getting killed."
Mm.
What's going on .
"Erm, and then if anyone wants to look at these, look at the er ninety one annual reports"
Haven't seen them.
and these booklets that are .
"Has that recently become ninety one, one?"
"No, we had these two meetings ago, but I bring it with me on meetings for anyone who's  ."
"Yes, and people should tell you if they take it,mm, mm."
"Okay, that's all."
"Right, very good, that's all from Headquarters, right then we move on to then any other business, erm I think mainly it's just the odd verse with arrangements for next meeting, because our next meeting is our own A G M, erm, at, which we erm elect our officers for the next year, er, and there are, are other arrangements to make, erm we sometimes put a little form don't we on the end of the minutes that, people to fill in if they wish to nominate someone, I think we should do that even though very, very rarely gets actually filled in, erm, and we have some post which we have elections for others where we can phone the people who are doing those jobs and, and hope they'll carry on."
"And I think the, the erm, the jobs which are elected are the Chair Person and, do we still have a Vice Chair Person? are you still Vice Chair Person?"
"Your worships, Mr  works for Wallbank aerials in Worley and he works for them as an engineer  his vehicle was  erm  something that he did use for work, but unfortunately as a result of the accident his has been written off and he hasn't yet been able to  er, replace it and so he's having to be erm  er, chauffeured by  the company to do his er  his work."
"Erm  he  was using at that time an R registered Ford Escort  er, which was er, only insured third party, fire and theft."
"He receives for his employment a take home pay of  seventy three pounds per week, he lives with his parents  and pays a board of twenty pounds per week  he's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening  and  at lunchtime on Saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty."
He hasn't any other commitments and he would ask  that  erm  he be allowed to pay the fine at the rate of twenty pounds per week.
"Your worships, those are the circumstances I would ask you to bear in mind that  this man  a ha , has four summonses against him purely as a result of  really ignorance as far as purchasing documents is concerned  they were in order  and  erm  he would of produced them had he  realised what the officer was saying to him and  er, that he would of  realised had he not been suffering the shock, but he was actually sufferance  suffering at the er  at the time of the accident."
I don't think  your worships.
Well Mr   er  pleading guilty to these offenses  and we've listened to what  the solicitor has said on your behalf  the main offence  of having no excise licence you'll be fined seventy five pounds  and be willing to pay eighty pounds thirty three back duty  and ten pounds costs  and for the offenses of failing to produce you'll be fined ten pounds for each of those three offenses.
We will order the fines and costs to be paid at a rate of twenty pounds a week.
"So  I make that a hundred and thirteen  a hundred and twenty three pounds, and the costs are  thirty three pence?"
Erm  a hundred twenty six  thirty three.
"Sorry, you're right!"
"One, two, three"
a
sa
hundred and eight
"One two, three three three sir."
"So do, you understand that er  Mr ?"
Yes.
"You pay out twenty pounds a week the officer of the court is agreed and the address will be given to you by the court usher before you leave  it is your responsibility to make sure that money is paid each and every week, the first payment is due by next Tuesday."
Erm  I'm off sick at the moment  from work so
"so  I won't be able to pay the first payment cos, you know  ain't got no money."
Don't you get any  sick payment or
"Well erm, I've just come up   and  and the accident so  I'm only entitled to money for the first four days."
I see.
And when you are likely to be earning again?
Erm  perhaps anywhere next week.
Well I do think give fourteen days for the first payment sir.
Yes.
You have you fourteen days the first payment  will be twenty pounds a week thereafter.
So by  a fortnight today  there's gotta be a payment in?
Yes.
.
"So a again, the idea of perception comes into it, doesn't it."
"It's it's the way,"
", yes."
"Erm, the person is perceived and and and the perception may not be accurate."
"It it that it may be influences, er, at work there."
"Erm, the the the suggestion was then, that the two young men and the the parable of the prodigal of son, started off as insiders, but in turn, they became outsiders in in in in some way."
"Erm, and the final short paragraph of that section refers to the parable of the lost sheep, er, not necessarily of black  in colour, but deviant in behaviour, figuratively a black sheep."
"I'll leave you to to look up that one, and erm, and and read if you want to do."
A section then on Branwell Bronte.
"A short life, you erm, you you you perhaps will be able to contribute from your knowledge of erm, Bronte, particularly of Branwell Bronte."
"Branwell Patrick Bronte, dates eighteen seventeen to eighteen forty-eight."
Was the only son in a family of six.
"From Mrs Gaskill's life of Charlotte Bronte, and from Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans, companion to the Bronte's."
"It seems clear that Branwell had so much potential, he might have been as successful as his sisters."
What went wrong then.
His sisters also had to bear tragedy.
Branwell was only four when his mother died.
"Before he was nine, two of his sisters, Elizabeth and Maria had also died."
How difficult for an imaginative and a sensitive child.
"He was loved and looked up to by his sisters and aunt, and his father unstintingly spent time, energy and money on him."
"Eventually his sisters, especially Charlotte lost patience with him."
"But when he died, the family was anguished by his loss and his unfulfilled talent."
"He painted, he wrote poetry and stores, but he lacked discipline and become an alcoholic."
Charlotte letters showed how bored she was by her limited home environment.
"Was boredom part of Branwell's trouble, too."
"It was Branwell, who suggested that the Harworth parsonage should publish its own magazine, but after the third issue, it was Charlotte who took over the leadership from him."
"In the short period, when Charlotte was away at school, that's January eighteen thirty-one, to May eighteen thirty-two, he was writing well."
"Essentially a creative person, he was unpredictable, and became self-destructive."
"As an artist, Branwell went to London to seek admission to the Royal Academy Schools, but he lost heart, as soon as he arrived, and never even began."
"He became more and more depressed, and sought consolation in the local pub, where he was soon well known as a talkative character."
"Encouraged by his father and several friends, Branwell acquired an artist's studio in Bradford, where, at first, he made an effort, and cultivated influential friends."
"But, sad to say, talking and drinking got the better of him, and his work deteriorated."
I'm a  I totally disagree
You had a you you you were unfortunate in the way you were treated
with you in the way it is run when you  when I took my allegations to him because that's basically what they're saying it is  I know it's no allegations
"Let's not go into the specifics of the court case just now  David Lightbown, what I want to say to you, do you think it's a case, some people might perhaps unjustifiably but they still would say that those people who are bullied are bullied because they are nonconformists and in the military one has to conform and many people"
Well of course of course they do.
It's what our the Army's all about.
"So if in any way you're different, if you're black or if you're short or if in any way you're different, you're fair game for the bullies perhaps?"
"It's not whether you're black or white, it's not whether you're pink or green, it's how you respond to orders."
And how quickly you respond to orders  situations .
Did you not respond to orders Richard Richard?
It's not a case of black and white did you say?
No.
"It is, it was a case it was a case with me that I was black or white and that's why that's why it hit the press like it did."
"look, look you're you're you're a guy that's been through a lot."
I accept that.
"Yeah, yeah."
But you survived it.
"And you will go on surviving it, you will turn"
"why should I have to survive it?my country too you know,"
I know it's your country too.
And nobody  no no nobody nobody is saying that you were tr
"I was told when I was in my regiment I was told  my country, it wasn't my country that was what I was told."
nobody is saying that
David Lightbown
"you were treated correctly,badly treated ."
"David Lightbown, David Lightbown ."
survivor
David Lightbown one second.
"Now er w w with every respect, to say that he survived it is something of a crass statement, because I remember reading about him thinking isn't this country getting good that we can have a black guardsman, and I remember my own disappointment when I read that he had to leave the regiment."
Let's speak to er Tim er .
"Now Tim er, you were a soldier now you're a social worker."
"We heard earlier on about this this this regimental bath I think they call it, this bath of excreta and urine and bleach and the brigadier and David Lightbown said how rare this was, er did you ever see it?"
I mean you said two years later  change.
"Ah well sure but then the whole lot goes, but, but, but, but, but this was, this was the document, I mean the way this was put forward, this is going to last us through into the foreseeable future."
"Erm  you know,th th th this er er it was a medium term horizon on this at the time."
Are you saying that they didn't mean what they said then?
"And that  I mean cos Mao said that how that you needed to have a moderate policy, that was the correct one"
Absolutely.
"in order to ha to achieve one's goals, are you saying that how look well you've just got to assume that they were wrong  that they didn't mean what they said?"
I mean it's perfectly
Yeah.
legitimate to think that how that they did think that this was a short-term goal in order to achieve their long-term  objectives.
"One, one might argue that  erm one might argue that there is a cynical implication thereupon, one might argue that  but, but in i i in exactly the same way at the moment you might argue that all the assurances they've given on Hong Kong are, are not worth the paper they're written on and, and, and as soon as the, soon as you get through to nineteen ninety seven they'll walk in."
"Er  are, are you saying no that they, they are not  er"
But you see they wouldn't have been able to realize their goals in nineteen forty nine.
"I mean, okay"
Why not?
supposing if they had
"fifty they could, they could have gone  they could have gone"
But could they?
Were th were the peasants ready for it?
Is that what the peasants wanted at that time?
Ah.
Well okay bu but in that sense are you saying that the learning experience was such that the peasant was so conservative and reactionary and so  was all you could do?
Yeah which peasants are you talking about?
Mm.
"Are you talking, saying the peasant, I mean it doesn't mean anything does it, the peasant?"
Mm.
all peasants.
I mean it may just depend upon how secure the
"How, how would you have felt as a poor peasant"
"I mean it really does depend upon how secure they were and how much, how much support,ge genuine support they had of the, the masses as a whole, because if they didn't then there's no way, and people weren't calling for them to establish socialism at that time were they?"
Would they have known what socialism was?
Exactly.
"I mean yeah as you say he's very high personable person, there must be some reason behind it  er and a lot of the theoretical reasons that he says of"
"of ideological progression, maybe he thought that, that, that erm the only, ultimately the only way to capitalis er to communism was through capitalism and he needs to establish a period of capitalism first."
Sure yes.
And that's what sort of Marx said.
So that
Yeah.
yeah but it doesn't mean that they're selling out completely does it because it
Mm.
"it means that it's just, it's a realization of, of the progression of communism  is to establish a capitalist phase."
Okay.
"communism rather a, a weak theory doesn't it?"
It's like saying
"Well Mao would do anything  the Communist Party, let's make it capitalist society."
"No because if you look at Marxist writing it's,i it's, you go through certain stages and you can't achieve"
That's right.
And that's what's happening to us now
"That's just, that's just  but why does it have to happen?"
It doesn't.
If they really wanted they could've just gone straight for it.
If they'd really wanted to.
They wanted to make it work though and they couldn't have made it work unless  they had had the  I mean the right conditions to do so.
You could have you could have made it work.
"You could've made it work if the peasants if the peasants were revolutionary, if the peasants had  changed their value system and weren't  and that  there were very few who were still working within the  economy."
So er
Are are you saying this is all that was possible because the peasant really was a capitalist at heart?
Well it was very likely that this policy was gonna succeed
In what?
"and they was gonna take a bigger risk, in keeping  them in power   so that they can achieve  their longer term ends."
"But sh sh sure they can succ succ they can succeed in creating capitalism, it, it  it, it might succeed in  paving the way for new China's industrialization  but we've gone a long way from any  any ideological position, we've gone a long way from  well what is in the best material benefiting class of the poor peasant now  the poor peasant is not gonna get very much out of this."
"It seems as if a disillusionment, the communists are trying you know, trying policies"
Yeah.
and they're still not bloody work what can we do?
"As, as far as I know I have a committal today."
That's right.
But I would of thought that your solicitor was  to be here  to represent you.
As far as I'm aware my solicitor  has been in contact with Burnley prosecution to have the case  transferred to Birmingham Crown Court.
Well  he has been a bit
if you tried there.
Did you recognise  the chap?
"I'm afraid sir, I have  no knowledge, I haven't certainly myself spoken to anybody  with regard to that, I would of thought the normal procedure would be for him to be committed  to Preston Crown Court and for the Crown Courts thereafter  to sort out the final venue."
I certainly have no knowledge of  of any contact  with regard to the ultimate venue and nothing has been marked on my file.
"Your worships, legal aid was granted er  on the thirteenth of September to affirm   of burglary."
Well obviously they're not here your worship.
Well all I can suggest is the case is  adjourned for the week we'll just have to arrange a solicitor to be here.
I wish for the committal to go along please sir?
I've been stuck up in this place
In that case  of the day sir because the statements have to read out in full.
He doesn't want to be represented is that what you're saying?
What I'm saying sir is to save the inconvenience to the court  is that if I could have my committal  cos I don't wanna be stuck up in this part of the country!
I have a Crown Court appearance in Birmingham  and as far as I'm aware my solicitors  have been in contact with the prosecution in this part of the country to explain the procedure  and as far as I'm aware  the committal this morning was to be committed to Birmingham Crown Court with other offenses.
"Well you've heard the senior prosecutor say that she knows nothing, she"
"Well I don't, I wouldn't have said"
I don't know sir.
Oh!
"I mean, that case then can I take my  my committal to Preston Crown Court, and when I go to Birmingham"
If you're committed to trial in this court you will be committed to Preston.
Well I'll take it
If
now then sir.
if it is to be arranged  and that you're dealt with at another court  Crown Court will have to arrange that.
Well in that case sir can you  get the committee then please?
As of now.
"As I say sir we put this matter down till later in the day, the defendant wi will not appear to be represented therefore the committal will have to be  dealt with by re reading out all the statements."
It can't be done  simply !
"Oh, we're sure they were but er this was the thing with a private collier company where you had er a sort of, not quite chairman, of the colliery sitting there at the top o in the office, watching everybody come and go."
"And er after that, my father went with the rounds with the collieries, where you had to belong to  union to go to them, and  Colliery didn't accept what was called the old union."
Yeah was?
The  Pit was the  Colliery  ?
"Pit as my n Pit was  colliery, then there was , and then, of course, there were the  pits and the  pits, on the edge."
"Er but , Collieries as they became, they didn't acc That was Lancaster, they didn't accept er the old unions, so they erm they belonged Both I can't on Friday night I used to the Methodist's chapel to pay the old union subscription, and to the West  to pay  's."
What was your father and grandfather's attitude to authority in the pit?
"Were they very resentful about, well, these dismissals?"
"Very resentful about that,, but er no, er I think er tt some of the pi It was Er not authority in the pits, they disliked the co-owners, erm one or two, and respected  Pit always had a respectable authority er and ownership, I mean, stemming from the Quaker one."
But er  and the other pits where personalities were involved were not quite so  happy.
"But er the managers and er and the The manager of the pit and then the underviewers, and the rest, they were people who had worked their way up generally, and were accepted."
"So had the idea of the coal owner Er well at the end of the century, the the coal ow owner and liberal MP sort of connections in ?"
"Well  was  pit, was   and er they came to the  family, that was someone at Mansfield, came back to open chapel bazaars, and all sorts of things, and particularly for the adult school."
"Yeah, going on to schools, which w which schools did you attend?"
"I went  Street erm, which was just next door to Grandma's, only over the wall,."
"And er then to  's Street, which was called  School, for a year and then to  's, when it opened in nineteen twenty nine."
"Do you have many memories of your, well, early education?"
"Street, yes, because er you went er you had a marvellous thing called Nature study, come geography, come everything, where you went for walk."
"But equally,the first thing I remember was my number in the infant school, when I was number fifty five, and er there were fifty eight of us in the class, and one lady kept order."
. They were very ordered classes  I'm afraid .
"Was much learnt, or?"
"Yes, oh yes, you learnt quite a lot and er much depended on er the teacher, of course, they weren't as bound as er teachers had been."
Mm.
We heard discussions of that.
"But erm you learnt quite a lot, and you learnt the basics very, very thoroughly."
"I mean, you marched round the playground until you could knew that twelve fourteens were a hundred and sixty eight."
"Which was when the top class in the infants, at seven, got in.."
"Di Was there any sort of education outside school, say, Sunday Schools, or?"
"Sunday Schools, er, mainly was er in best chapel tt tradition, I suppose, of er bible study and also of the social conscience of the Methodist."
"And er to me it presented a great opportunity,I I j I won quite a lot of books."
"I always remember asking for Lawrence In Arabia, as a Sunday School prize."
". And they weren't the Victorian prizes, that I won,I we got them for getting through an exam, because you could write or something, and er tt well, they were quite good books, and it was one way of getting a book."
"Absolutely denied, she'd ever done that."
"Then one day, said she described something she often used to do in childhood, habitually did."
"And she had a special name for it, I can't remember what is was now, but it was an innocuous word, like erm  erm, kneading, or something like that, something you do with your fingers."
"Erm, and  said, okay, that's what you called it in childhood, you called, say kneading, if that's what it was."
"She said, now, supposing you had to look up what you just described, you know, in a dictionary, and find a word that everybody would associate with it."
What word would you find?
"And she said, the woman thought for a minute, and suddenly she gasped when said that's masturbation, isn't it?"
"And  said, yes."
"And she said, but I've always known I did that."
"And, you see, she'd known it, but it had been entered under another word, in her mind."
As she didn't connect it with what everyone else calls masturbation.
"You know, er, that's a horrible thing that other people do."
"She had her own  term for it, and as long as it was purely associated with that term, she never connected it."
And that's quite a typical finding.
"That things remain unconscious, not because you never knew about them, but because they're never brought into the relevant connections with other things that make you conscious of the thing in the sense of seeing what's in it for Mrs  you know,reports."
"So we're not saying it's a question of conscious unconscious, or rigid demarcation where we are actually talking about subtle gradations of consciousness, from complete self conscious awareness at one end, to total loss of all memory of the thing at, at, at the other."
"And everything in the  between, and most stuff is in between, as a matter of fact."
"So I think you're right, it's a very very important, erm, and, and often in life, you can find people switch from one to the other with astonishing speeds."
"I mean, some people have kind of butterfly minds, with butterfly behaviour, and they switch from being one type of person or another type of person almost minute by minute."
You just can't keep up with them.
"I mean what does this, you know, what is, is this?"
"I mean, do  to have this astonishing capacity of switch all the time."
"You just don't know, know where you are with them."
"Well, that was interesting, it was interesting discussion, er, thanks to an excellent paper, we're, we're, we're delighted, and that was first rate."
Who did I say was next week?
Right.
"We look forward to hearing from you next week,."
"Sorry I've got to throw you out on time, but I've got another appointment at four."
"Er,, did you see him about that?"
"Erm, yes I did the only problem"
Yeah.
You don't have a
respect.
I do not think that research has gone as fast as it should!
Mhm.
"And it's going to be a long time before it's going to be possible, so therefore we still have to use animals, I  see no way round it."
Mhm.
And I know that they're using cultures and things but  I still think that we are  a long way from not using animals.
Up there.
"Erm  can I, can I move this conversation on to the"
Yes.
"th th the, the veterinary side?"
Mhm.
"Erm, we've we've covered the fact that animal models don't always reflect the human situation, but if we're going to understand control and eradicate disease in animals, this sort of work must go on."
Could I go back to something the lady here
Yes.
"said about the Animal Procedures Act of nineteen eighty six, erm, I know she's been told about the animals are killed painlessly and that they suffer very little pain, where there's any pain at all, but in fact this act erm which is governed by a committee  only erm  issues guidelines as to what might happen."
No matter how serious an infringement there might be of that act  they are not subject to any sort of criminal offence.
"Sh shall we try and see what the er, what the general feeling on this is?"
Do you think that er  the use of animals in research is ever justified?
"Er, button one for yes, and button two for no."
"Research there being either on behalf of animals themselves, or on behalf of er, of humans."
"Is research on er, the use of animals in research ever justified?"
"And this particular hundred are creeping in with their votes but have decided, seventy fo seventy seven of them say yes, all be it th th th , by far the majority, and twenty three say no."
Could anyone say what the consequences would be if they weren't available for use in er  in the development of human  er  medicines and treatment?
"Well I wouldn't be here because a horse was used for a toxin to provide the anti-toxin for diphtheria  whe , in my days when I was younger there was no toxins as such, vaccination as such and so therefore the horses  were used  for research  to provide the anti-toxins."
"So do you think people who would like to ban the use of animals in research are in, are in cloud cuckoo land do you?"
Yes?
Would any of you twenty three like to defend your position?
Yes?
"Erm, I'm just not sure why any  any person would think that they have more right to life than animals do."
I mean what  what gives you more right to life than an animal does?
Anyone wa
"Just because we have, a so called civilized nation that we live in  that destroys the world, that destroys animals  that destroys the environment we're living in!"
You've got to unite and get in the one  gives us strength to fight them.
Is er how large is your organization?
Nationally.
"Well I er th well I couldn't, I'm not in a position to give the, the total  because the national, the national treasurer would be able to  you see?"
"And as I said, Mrs Mary  she's the national treasurer and has been for over thirty years."
"That woman's now approaching eighty three, eighty four years of age and she's still national treasurer, so it gives you a sort of sample of the, the kind of people they have at the top, who are really  their heart and soul in it."
"pensioner themselves who would sit down and think, now take for instance assuming that I wouldn't be a member of that just so surely a, a senior citizens' club."
"Now you go into a seniors  citizens' club, you enter your name and you get registered in the register, you get your cup of tea and then you get social activity."
"I remember thinking si sit down and say and where do we get this money pay for this tea, and this money pay for the registration."
Where do you get it from?
"A voice says it's solely from my pension,quite able and get enough to give to join the association at less than a penny a week."
Do you find you get a lot of erm resonance from old age pensioners when you ask them to join.
Are a lot of them er quite prepared to fight to get their erm
Oh the the members
"the members who are members of the branches are prepared to fight, but it's not them I'm er I'm  the other people who are er they're gaining from our fight, they're gaining from our fight."
"where we've tried, we've tried to keep a reasonable pension for them."
"But they're not fighting because they've nobody no, national officials to fight for them."
"We, we have the only national organization to f er that goes on to fight for  goes, goes to parliament and fights for them."
Have you had any erm any sort of successes in your campaigns that you've run?
Oh yes oh  well er er  is just across in fact is across the border.
Everyone got free passes over there.
Has that just been in re-instituted lately?
"Yeah, oh aye."
By just .
"It's only within the last couple of year, and then oh no you cannae do a certain of the er it was actually our vice president at the  started the campaign over in Fife, and they won through."
"And there again the  supported the, both the region and their district council."
"And here we have the  calling under er an administration you know who they are and they're hanging their heads every time you speak, you speak to them."
They're ashamed of themselves but they're afraid to admit it.
"They're afraid of, ashamed of themselves and they do  to the old people."
And they're afraid to admit it.
"They've all got somet an, an evasion or a counter argument with you."
And it's general  to fail.
Did anyone see Panorama erm because er Panorama was was almost entirely
I've got it taped.
"devoted to the question of of of road transport and its limitations and erm er although again I mean there was no particular mention to any party other than the Government, erm it it certainly seemed to be taking a very critical view of of road transport and it does seem to be spreading now."
It doesn't seem to be er just a few sort of you know  any more.
Yeah.
Certainly keeps them going on the grounds that eventually there will you know we'll be able to say and this is what we believed this long and you know this is what has been proved to be necessary.
So it's
We can already say that I mean there there obviously there's a lot of talk now about erm  taxation towards towards resource taxes and those sorts of things which the Green Party were saying you know fifteen years ago or something.
And now everyone's talking about it and it's in one way it makes you gnash your teeth that that we're not getting the credit yet
yeah
but in another way it's gotta be given I suppose.
Mm.
One last item for any other business erm I forgot about.
There's a book that goes with names in this campaign.
Erm a policy statement like roads to the future which is what reminded me of it.
And the price has gone down it's only five pounds if
What from twenty five?
Yes  thirty thirty five.
Erm and I was going to say we will get a a boiled down version from with our materials for the campaign.
But I was going to suggest that we order a copy of the book.
Certainly.
Okay we now have seven and a half minutes on affiliation  other groups.
Personally I think we might er defer it because that
Perhaps we could start with an informal chat on the topic and work up to
Yeah can you give us sort of thirty second briefing on what we're supposed to be developing
Right well it came up when War on Want wrote to us and asked us to affiliate and we had a brief chat about it and felt that there are many groups that we could affiliate to.
War on Want almost certainly weren't at the top of the list.
Erm and then I think it was Andy actually who said that erm affiliation is something we could do with considering.
I mean  any groups at all and if so which ones.
That it would be useful for us to affiliate to.
What are the implications of affiliating with somebody  be questioned by that I don't know the answer to.
It depends sometimes he gets the information sometimes it's basically just registering your your approval with them.
"If you're a psychocentric tourist, you're the type of person who's self inhibited."
You're perhaps a little nervous of change  you haven't got really a desire for adventure or anything too challenging.
You prefer well packaged routine holidays in popular tourism destinations and you're looking at the three Ss or four Ss we should say.
So you're looking at a package holiday resort in Spain  in the main.
"Okay, psychocentrics."
"Again, like to be in the crowds."
"The alternative are what we call alocentrics, these are outgoing people with varied interests."
"They're keen to explore, to find new things and they're likely to want independence."
"And in between these two  we also have something called midcentrics who do bits of both, but these are the two extremes."
So all of you in this room are either a psychocentric or probably an alocentric.
The type of person who goes on this holiday is almost certainly gonna be a psychocentric.
"The type of person who goes on this holiday to destinations for example want somewhere unusual  perhaps to India, is more likely to be an alocentric person cos they're getting away from the crowds."
Okay so psychocentrics and alocentrics.
"So this is what Stanley Clog produced, now we're gonna add two more to this, two that you're all familiar with I'm sure, firstly, sunlust people."
People who chase the sun  beach holidays and there's a lust for a tan.
So for example w I can't remember your name  who's the girl next to you?
Michelle.
"Michelle is obviously a sunlust person in that respect and depending on whether she goes to a main package resort in Spain or perhaps a beach in India, she can either be a psychocentric sunlust person or an alocentric sunlust person."
And the alternative to this is wanderlust.
"The person who wants to explore, keep on the move  and typified by some form of touring holiday."
"Okay so now whenever you look at a package holiday brochure, you should be able to identify the market just using two words  sunlust alocentric, wanderlust psychocentric and so on."
"So if you're looking at a touring holiday in Europe  it's wanderlust probably, and if it's an, a coach tour round Europe it's almost certain to be psychocentric."
"If you're looking for a tour around  Borneo and Indonesia, that's away from the crowds so we can say it's an alocentric wanderlust."
"So it's a very simple way, if you like, for us to define markets fairly accurately."
Okay can everybody understand that?
"Sunlust, wanderlust, psychocentrics and alocentrics."
Right well you'll be doing a lot more of this in your marketing.
Er I've got two handouts which I want you to pick up er now.
One is something sp specifically written on the demand for the tourism product after nineteen ninety one.
Try to highlight those factors or the determinants of demand which were gonna be important in buying the tourism products in nineteen ninety two.
And the second is something on tourism decision making.
"This simply gives you, it's only a two page handout, it gives you some idea of the sort of motivations  from what people have written about them."
Er as an original project.
"Erm the  er In eighteen thirty nine, the  the railway came to Nottingham, er from Derby, and er there were three companies, the , the  er Railway I think it was, and the er  Railway or er sorry  Railway."
And they amalgamated in eighteen forty four to become the  Railway.
And er a certain
"George  known as the Railway King was very keen to to get er across into to Lincoln and certainly in various other parts of East Anglia, to sort of spike other people's guns and to erm er to obtain the traffic for his own er benefit, and for his shareholder's benefit perhaps."
"Erm and erm the  Railway, er opened the Nottingham, Newark, Lincoln railway line in eighteen forty six."
"he whole thing was built in a year, quite incredible."
In in those days.
"Erm because it crossed the Trent quite a number of times, and quite a number of trestle er wooden bridges were involved in that construction."
"But the whole lot was done and opened I think it was er in August, eighteen forty six."
"And  one of the say one of the proposals was that there should be this er line from , and through this town, and over to join the er Nottingham, Lincoln line er at ."
"What was built in eighteen forty seven, and opened in eighteen forty seven, was merely a small branch line, of two and a half, three miles, from this town, to , where it say er er made a er a connection and and a small junction there."
There was no station actually at  at that time.
Erm the station was opened er and trains began to run in eighteen forty seven.
But very quickly it was er all all the promises of much traffic.
"Say the town had only got three and a bit thousand people anyhow, three thousand people, erm there was very very little actual passenger traffic."
"Er even in the early eighteen well late eighteen forties, early eighteen fifties."
"And after a matter of a couple of years of use, er the service had already been curtailed, from nine trains down to five per day, erm and er shortly the passenger service was completely withdrawn."
Or at least it was withdrawn as far as er railway engines were concerned.
"They did in fact get a horse erm and er they had a small carriage, er and er a horse made the odd er visit up the line, from time to time."
"Er but erm the So the railway line erm still carried a little bit of er of freight traffic, but erm it wasn't quite abandoned, but even some of the er station buildings were removed erm to er to ."
"So that's that's really what happened, and it wasn't until eighteen sixty, or eighteen fifty eight, fifty nine in time, that the  Railway directors agreed to reopen this branch line, as they'd been basically promised a lot more traffic."
"Erm it was still pretty marginal er but er at least it was opened and erm in eighteen er it carried on until, in eighteen seventy, seventy one, the line was extended back to  or a station roughly halfway between the two."
"Then er through to erm , and on to."
"In those days there wasn't a great deal of of mining, I mean  wasn't open, and er there was a tremendous amount, well there's a fair amount of of traffic agricultural traffic, and I mean one had to accept that virtually everything came in, all coal, road stone, erm  goods required er for well  's who were going at the time, they er they used the railway."
"Erm and the various er food s food stores er again, virtually everything came in."
"And of course in due course er  time er the town had a gas station, erm or a gas, not a gas station, erm  er a gas works ."
Erm and so again coal was was brought in erm for that.
Erm anyhow so that is sort of the background.
"And the railway er it operated, I suppose, pretty marginally, certainly for the rest of er last century."
"Erm in nineteen O two I think it was, I've got the details at home, erm sidings were put in for  's."
They paid a bit and the  Railway paid a bit.
Perhaps if I move on I think we've perhaps got one a little bit bigger.
Oh no.
Erm I'll go back a minute.
"Er there's another little stubby bit of track there, and that er provided er what was termed end loading facilities, er so that erm Er in the old days er the sort of lord of the manor er would have a er horse a horses and carriage."
"Erm and er they had what they call carriage trucks, which were er flat trucks basically, or thereabouts."
"Which could be attached to passenger trains, and the er the actual er gentleman's carriage, er horse-drawn carriage, could be loaded onto this flat truck, and er the er would be transported to be available er at his destin in his or her destination."
"Erm and er it was er it was a ramp basically, er up here, so that one could run straight off that ramp, onto this flat truck."
And that's a that's one of the what that was used for.
"Erm as you I say, initially er it was a single track into the station, over  crossing."
"And erm in between the wars, erm it was made double track, er up towards  over there."
"By just merely putting in an additional point, or turnout, here, er to er to make that say double track."
That's er well that's all there.
That's a er  map I acquired off the Water Board
I think from somewhere.
. Erm the slightly larger erm Engine shed here as I say.
"Erm cattle pens, goods shed, The main station building here, the erm station master's house here."
"A signal box, the platforms on both sides, the smaller building on the North side of the station."
"Erm a weighed a weighing machine, a weighing office over here, and coal offices were situated there."
"Erm I will give a little bit of history of dates, and what things were altered and when in a bit."
"Erm the the railway track, erm once it was extended through to  and I say I'll give you the details on that in a minute, erm went over the er  Road, and then the track that was nearest to er the town, was curved in and joined that other line erm and er went off to to ."
"And there's a book on  engine sheds, and er  engine sheds, which was published some years ago I think by  publishing company, er which gives track plans to help people."
"But  looked at a er at any ordinance survey map, they'd have seen that they got the track plan wrong."
Erm that is that is what it should be.
"Erm some additional sidings,mills over here, some additional sidings were put in, in the early part of this century, and they came off the this track erm just this side of on the left hand side of the level crossing, erm and went er up to a dead end er just along in the right hand side, er over now towards where  factory is."
Erm or bakery.
"And then er they returned the line, or double track round here, er and bringing so goods wagons could be brought round into the sort of unloading area er of  's mill."
Of course 's was a very important customer of the of the railway.
Now let's give a little bit of er of information.
The er there were many railways erm were contemplated in the eighteen thirties and forties and beyond.
"And erm the er there was a Nottingham, Lincoln and Hull line I think, proposed in eighteen thirty."
"Erm  but this line involving ,, er was actually er part of a much bigger scheme that was put forward about eighteen forty, and really involved er a line from near  Cross to , on to , on to , and then up to  and connecting ."
"Basically sort of cutting across country, about twenty eight miles I think it was."
"And the idea here was that one would be for incoming goods, and one would be for empty wagons or the other way round, er going out."
Erm and of course the the wagons as I say would would come up right along side that er road.
Now that's a picture which er many of you will be very familiar of with.
Erm and it shows it's er just about the turn of the century that is.
And er there you have a a s a signal.
"Erm the level crossing gates here, 's Mill on the left hand side, erm a er sort of lean to er over the erm sort of loading bay, or unloading bay there."
"Erm a typical  er signal box and a rather pretty little station master's house, there."
"And that I say that picture has appeared on everything, even on china, I think you can buy some at erm  can't you  even with that on it."
It's a very very well known photograph.
"Again, about the turn of the century, erm looking up towards ."
"The track across here, the crossing  gates."
"Er signal box there, the er lower quadrant signal here."
"There's a round spot on the back which was used before they had er a white er sort of a black erm stripe, er vertical stripe erm on the er on it there."
"You can see at the back here, erm a barrow crossing, er which could be used er to get erm heavy items on a on a wheelbarrow, or trolley, over the tracks er from the platforms."
"Erm various lamps, the station b main station building, the s the subsidiary station building there."
"er in the background there's the engine shed, erm and a few er one or two, there's a loco there I think."
Erm one or two bits and pieces anyhow.
"And on the right hand side, there's the goods shed."
"Erm in nineteen fourteen, erm  's, who had a water turbine er as their sort of main motive power for their er milling operations, erm put in or had had, er not only this line, siding, but they had one put in round the back here, erm because that was to provide coal, for steam boilers which were er put in to augment the water power."
"Erm that later on, the signal box that used to be here was moved over to the other side, that's all that's there for."
And er that shows it later on when that one at the back had been taken out.
"Now erm last century er goods came up er the Trent to  er and er by sailing barge er and er this sort of equipment was used to er to collect er items from the holds of these er barges, erm put on wagons, horse-drawn er and er some steam traction engines, er to be transported around."
There's another picture of one of the barges on the Trent.
A steam one.
Now the great er as you can see that is a just pre-first world war advertisement from  's.
"And erm so they were quite major users of the railway services and indeed, I think that there was at least one clerk, from the railway, employed in  's offices, all day, every day at some time."
"There's a picture of er er flour, going out from  's Mill er latter part of er last century, erm going out to  's bakery in the town."
"A steam lorry that  acquired, in the er early part of the century."
Erm obviously er no erm pneumatic tyres or anything on that but er quite er good old wo work horses they were.
No that was er that's a picture of er  's erm er I think before they took that off they've taken that off haven't they now?
"Erm that was when er it had just been erm, well  before they started erm altering it into flats, and so on."
But you can see that in fact the railway line came round and in front actually just in in the front here.
Well I mean I you know the let's have a discussion.
"I don't think  it's not a not a complete You can't get a headline, Tories divided over rule changes."
You know it's
"I don't know, it's an interesting"
No no I don't believe that.
I think it's perfectly reasonable that the parliamentary party should have those sort of powers.
"And I'll tell you why I think it's reasonable, Because they would only use them seriously in extreme circumstances."
"doesn't matter if I'm not going to name any names but I mean I've seen some people who it's been suggested might stand  two hoots of a flick of a finger whether someone of the sort that I've seen mentioned, stood or not."
You are Are you thinking of Mrs Theresa Gorman there ?
"I'm not going to I'm not I'm not going to be drawn into discussing the names of any particular person, I'm merely saying it would be of no consequence."
It would be a joke.
Erm anyway I don't think it's gonna happen and I don't think it should happen.
Let me make that absolutely clear.
But nor do I think that you should somehow try to cosset the position of the leader of the party.
In the extreme circumstances.
"Cos otherwise, I can tell you what the alternative is, the alternative is the men in grey suits which is a equally arbitrary process and it can as actually concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people o sometimes perhaps unrepresentative of the parliamentary party."
Is John Major unassailable now?
Yes I think er I mean my own view is that he well er erm lead the party at the next election and he'll win it.
Er w I think there's a there's a desperately boring feature about the present political circumstances from the media's point of view.
"And the more you stand back and look at it, the clearer it is."
"Every political leader of an advanced democracy, is in deep trouble, whether it's in America, Japan, France, Germany or Britain."
They're in deep political trouble because the the electorate is simply distanced from the messages they have to put over.
For very obvious reasons.
The electorate is going through a very difficult period.
The economy has got huge problems associated with it.
People's lives are are profoundly affected.
"So when a politician comes and says, Well it's gonna get better, we've gotta try harder, this is the policy we're gonna pursue."
"They're all saying,it's not doing me any good."
And it's not until that economic climate changes that people are l are able to to relate to what the politicians say.
"There's nothing new in any of this, I remember nineteen eighty one."
"But the media can't say that, they can't interpret that because what they've got to do is sell to their readers, a story which the readers want to hear."
And so the media are constantly giving the impression that there's something that the British government should be doing.
"Okay, A gives up two units of reproductive success, a food item to B. This benefits B by three units of reproductive success, whereas it would only benefit A by only two units of reproductive success."
"In arbitrary units, okay."
"Now, clearly, I will favour that, because now, B has a total of thirteen units of reproductive success and A has er, a total of eight units of reproductive success, because it's lost some."
So totals here are thirteen and eight.
Thirteen and eight is twenty one.
"In other words, the total reproductive success that my parental investment has produced is now greater than it was before I started."
"So, since I'm equally related to both, in other words, I have an equal number of genes in both offspring,th this, this transfer has promoted my overall reproductive success."
"Therefore, I as a parent will be selected to want that kind of thing to happen."
Okay.
You with me.
"Now, let's go back to what  and  say and look at it from offspring A's point of view."
"Offspring A looks at it differently, because offspring A says, my sibling B has only got half my genes, therefore I will make sacrifices for B, wherever B R and greater than C as we saw."
"Now, in this case, the, the sacrifice is er, two units of reproductive success, they benefit er B by adding er, one unit of, of reproductive success to it."
"So the cost to me is two, er the benefit to my sibling is one, and the degree of relatedness er, is a half."
"So the sum has to be one, times a half, is greater than two, which it clearly isn't, cos one times a half is a half, and that is less than two."
"In other words, I as the offspring are not gonna want to transfer those two units of reproductive success."
"So when my parent says to me, give those two units of parental investment that I just gave you, to, to offspring B I don't want to, because the benefit to offspring B, or rather the genes I share with offspring B, doesn't compensate sate me for the, for the sacrifice."
I'm losing two units of reproductive success.
"My offspring is gaining one unit, that it wouldn't have had otherwise."
"Erm, and, that is, that is not a good deal as far as my shared genes are concerned."
So the
"Oh, sorry, three, yes."
Okay.
"Yes, you're right, sorry."
cos it two
three times half.
"Sorry, three times a half."
"So, it's three units that I'm giving my siblings."
"Right, three three."
"The total benefit is three units of reproductive success, three times a half again, is one and a half, it's not erm, it's not the  of two."
"If you think about it, er, there are numbers that will, that will make it work."
Larger numbers.
Mm mm .
"Have you ever, ever looked into"
"I'm willing, I'm willing to listen to you!"
"well the , I think these people who concern themselves very much about dictating the do's and don't of fox hunting, if they were to spend a little more time about looking into the research of, how foxes actually live."
"Three hundred thousand foxes are killed annually in this country, either through hunting, which only attributes to a small two point percent, shooting, gassing, snaring, all of which happen during the hunting season as well."
"So I mean, these foxes are still widespread and abundant, they can sustain seventy percent losses, so what human intervention are you doing?"
I mean   ha   how can you say that killing fifteen thousand foxes a year is helping to control foxes?
Up there.
I hunt regularly
Mhm.
"because I breed racehorses, I also am a farmer  so I wear two hats, but I've actually seen foxes sit down we move the  hounds move in,si sit down and scratch in the middle of a field, and then they think ah!"
Right we're off!
"But, in fact from a farmer's point of view they are a su a nuisance, we have a man who co , who supposedly raises pheasants, he traps them, he also trapped my dog and this is him  ah, justified, his justification was  there were too many foxes."
Erm.
"and so therefore, we don't particularly pretend that they are"
Mm.
that hunting justifies the  the end of killing foxes  but it does preserve country life.
"We're going to have to close, alas, because it's been very interesting, and er er er a very diverse, ninety six people think animals should have a better deal, seventy seven think that the use of animals in research is justified at ti , from time to time, and well over seventy"
Except .
think that hunting should be banned.
"And, my final question to you, just out of curiosity is, are you ve , a vegetarian?"
"Button one for yes, button two for no."
"I could of said do you eat animals, but I decided that would be insensitive, to those of you who"
are vegetarians.
"So, in this, very animal loving assembly, I think er, you would agree  er, only twenty one are vegetarians and seventy nine people love animals but they also enjoy  chewing on them from time to time."
Wo would er any of you animal eaters like to say something about that position?
Yes?
"Yes, I would"
"As, as an S S P C A representative."
"and and also as a farmer, if I"
Mhm.
"might say, I'm a beef farmer, erm I enjoy my, my beef very much, my philosophy is  that erm, if we're going to use animals we're going to eat the , their time here should be as humane, they should have as humane treatment as possible, and they should be free from fear, hunger and pain, and when the time comes for them to go they should know  as little about it as possible."
Very good er we may come back to that in a moment.
Thank you.
"But listening to you make that case it's very similar to reading the great debate on franchise reform in this House in the last century, when people said we should be included and that people like us should be able to have the vote and put people into Parliament, it's I mean it was just that you were you were making that plea about pro that the Board should be representative as being like  the group who are benefiting."
You've made very powerfully erm and I'm that's a point that we'll take on board.
"When you talk about this split, fifty-fifty, could we go back that way."
Who elects the Chairman?
"Well  that's er  that's another thing that's happened within the British Steel's er scheme, the Chairman seems to be elected in himself or by the company, it's certainly not e elected by the Trustee Board and er  a and we would like to see"
You mean parachuted in is he?
"Yes, he's certainly parachuted in."
all right.
"But who but, but that's describing what happens, how do you think the Chairman should be elected?"
I think
"Even letting you you've all talked about the you know employers are paying money in and so on, we don't want the schemes wound up, er  if I was the the employer, might I not be concerned if you elected a  a chairman that wasn't  erm favourable to me?"
"Er you might er the company might well be concerned about that point, but er I think if the composition of the Board was er correct, that er that possibly wouldn't arise."
What you mean you'd have blocking mechanisms?
Yes.
"Yes, very good, I see the point."
Thanks.
I see no reason additionally why the independent people on the Board should not act to protect the company in the same way as they're trying to help protect the other members .
"Yes, but your colleague has also made the point that the constitution might have a blocking mechanism so that people, both sides, could be satisfied, wasn't it."
"But Post Office and B T management appoint the Chairman of the Trustees, there are four Trustees appointed by the"
Yes.
"Management, four by the Trade Unions and the Chairman is appointed by the management."
Right.
"No, no, the present  the present one was a  I think he was a Chairman of a big building society before he came into the Post Office and they use these  are on three year terms, but er the previous Post Office one er spent nine years as Chairman, spent three yea three terms of three years."
So they're there for three years?
Yes.
Right and er is it a full-time job the Chairmanship?
"Erm I don't know, I don't think it's erm I mean I I think it occupies er  seventy-five percent  of his time, but it isn't full-time."
"No, I was just thinking,we we're, we're debating the in the Commons at the moment, changing the parole board from having part-time members, to having  salaried full-time ones, which are on limited contracts  and that clearly puts those parole board members in a different position to the Home Secretary and one it's ju you just do it because it's a part-time activity, you may get some expenses that you think is important, and I just wanted to get clear whether the Chairman on a limited contract a large part of their work appointed by the employer."
Thanks.
Our Chairman is appointed by the company and is usually a senior management member.
"So this will actually influence you, because you'll be able to look through the brochures and see which of those groups it's being targeted at."
Erm to give you an example  let me show you this brochure here  this is Page and Moy high prices and clearly that is aimed at A and B.
"Looking at this one  you can see that the whole format's totally different, like the cartoon on the front  and the layout."
And that  who would you say that was aimed at?
"Well it's young people, what sort of occupations?"
Would it appeal to you?
Do you think?
Er  there
Mm yeah I think it would
Yeah.
So we're probably thinking perhaps partly students.
"Er because  people in this age group haven't yet become managers and certainly not professional, we're probably thinking more in terms of the Es and students and perhaps C twos C ones."
These are not cheap holidays so it probably rules out the D category.
So the social class structure is important.
It's also the question of mixing between these groups as well.
It's claimed that people feel uncomfortable if they're plunged into a group of people who are perhaps from a different social class or background say.
In particular in this country and it's also the same in France and Germany.
"We tend to be fairly what we might call gregarious, meaning we like to stay with people of our own type."
"People speaking our own language, people who do similar things to ourselves."
"The final one here again, simply economic."
Again we're back to price and things of that nature.
And then we have the individual psychological factors which go through our heads.
And the things that actually go through our heads we refer very often to as cognitions.
Cognitions.
Our thought processes.
"For example if you went to Nepal, one of your motivations for going there might be to meditate or relax and that would be a cognition."
It's something you would know within your own head.
"We have the various learning processes, how do we learn?"
"That's quite an interesting one, if you consider as students how do you learn  erm  in general you probably don't learn that much in lectures because for example we know from experiments that we all have a limited attention span."
"Basically you will listen for maybe  seven minutes then you switch off for two minutes  then you switch on again and then you try and think well what was I listening to  seven minu well you know, three minutes ago  what was probably said in the last two minutes."
"By the time you've sussed that out, you've missed another five minutes, your brain gets confused so you then switch off again for another three minutes and try and clear everything."
And you're doing this the whole time.
So what do you hope to get out of sightseeing?
Increase your knowledge.
"Right, increase your knowledge."
See different cultures.
"Right, see different cultures."
Anything else?
Take photographs.
Sorry?
Okay.
"Look at nature, get back to nature."
Certainly that's the appeal of Central Parcs.
Anything else?
"See how it feels, the way that they live there."
Okay well that would again tie perhaps more in with culture.
"I mean you can, you're starting to get, if you like, a big list now of motivating factors."
"Er for example all of us in this room, if we went to one destination, we'd probably all come away with a different combination of things that we'd actually got from it."
"It might be education, it might be knowledge, interest can be another one  er relaxation, romance, having a good time  there are a whole se sequence of different reasons."
"There are other reasons as well, things like peace and tranquillity  er time to reflect  er and yeah there are other motivations as well which you, if you like, are kind of negative."
"For example the desire to escape your humdrum existence  back here, er the desire to escape the family, er to have someone moaning at you continually, these are all important factors which add on."
So in effect there are kind of like negative motivating factors which is basically all to do about escape  where you don't care where you go as long as you get away from here.
And then there are the things you get when you actually go to a destination.
"So  again if we look at all of these things across the top  we've got other things influencing across here  when you go on holiday you, each of you in this room, you'll probably have some idea beforehand of what you want to get out of that holiday."
"For example if you go on an overland trip trekking in erm South America, you're clearly looking for something totally different than the person who goes on the sort of typical Club Eighteen to Thirty type holiday."
"Other things which will influence, it's claimed, are things like social class  er again used ex er extensively by marketing people in this country."
"Now you'll be doing this before Christmas, and what it is is there, there are lots of different categories we can use but the standard one is dividing the population into six distinct categories."
"By and large it's according to people's occupations and you start with A which will be professional people, surgeons  solicitors etcetera."
You have B which are managers.
C one which would be office workers.
C two  skilled workers.
"D unskilled workers and E, that would be everybody else."
Okay?
And as students you're in E.
Mm.
It's not such a pragmatic thing then because
"one of things you said earlier on you said when you  do become very radical erm it's, the distinctions between  become blurred"
Mm.
that erm one of the most important things is to keep up your production
Right.
"and therefore if you're gonna er introduce this radical land reform straight away, I mean say  there is no landlord but there's a  peasant, or  I mean unless the Party's ac completely active"
Mm.
and they're gonna get hit.
Right.
And basically what they need to do is create  peasant  economy to increase production as they learn from the land.
Ah right.
"So if you go too radical you're gonna hit production, and you're gonna step back which"
"Right, and are you beginning to say that production is coming to be a more important criteria now?"
Yeah I think so.
Well it certainly has  but there's still kind of elements of
I think especially when they find out that there's not much land to go round as they ash assumed.
"assume that if you give them  a population that owned seventy eight percent of the land and find out  fifty percent of the land , then you, you know, you can't just give land, everyone's not just gonna have land, you have to increase production to make everyone better off."
Mm.
Right.
"So whereas in the north the, in a sense the, the main criteria was mobilization  as you're moving south in the new situation a new criteria is, is production."
"you need, you need, you need mobilization you need"
Yeah.
"support, but then even more you need production."
Yeah.
Right.
"There's also another problem with land reform in  I can't really see how they could implement land reform without reverting to similar sorts of  they used in  which is  defining class distinctions and the chaos that that causes and the problems it causes erm  it is almost as if , if you go back to erm settling of accounts"
Mm.
okay you're erm  you're getting rid of your communist ideas  you're  finding a smoother way to getting erm  to achieving a similar sorts of effects
"hit the top end  get a  cross-section o of, but you still get the same, ultimately the same sorts of results erm by, by erm by adopting that policy whereas if you go  for trying to draw distinctions, you end up erm"
"Right so it's, yes, so, so, so the danger is, is chaos and the movement gets out of hand and"
Right.
Any ideas?
Okay people could well have been using savings.
Redundancy.
Right good.
It's thought that a lot of the spending money for these would have come from redundancy payments when people lost their jobs.
"And that might seem a rather odd way to actually spend some of your redundancy money, but perhaps this leads us on to another area influencing the demand, and that's to do with, if you like, psychology."
Er making yourself feel good even if it's only for a short time.
"If you can imagine someone losing their job, the depression that actually causes, perhaps both within them and with their family, the idea of being able to take them away for a holiday to forget about things might be a good thing at the end of the day."
"The other thing is that of course, going back to the competition with price, these holidays weren't that expensive."
We're not talking about vast sums of money necessarily here.
Are there any other factors which can explain  the taking of these holidays?
The rising cost of holidays in the U K.
"Er okay, it could be the rising cost of holidays in the U K."
"Possibly not so much the cost, what other factors in the list of, of determinants could come into play now?"
Weather.
"Right, climate is always a major consideration."
"Er  in nineteen seventy six for example, we had  the long hot summer as people call it."
"I think we had something like eight and a half months without rain and  there's the feeling, quite often, that when we get a good summer in this country, people assume that the next summer will be just as good."
"And so you can imagine all the people in nineteen seventy six thinking well  you know, there's definitely been a climatic change, we're gonna holiday in the U K in nineteen seventy seven."
Nineteen seventy seven's summer was a total washout and that would tend to push people perhaps more towards guaranteed sunshine in the Mediterranean.
So climate is a key factor.
Anything else?
Okay well let's look at some of the main possible reasons for this in more detail.
The reasons I'm gonna give you were supplied by a guy called Tony .
Tony  is actually a consultant.
He used to be the marketing director of Butlins and obviously these trends were important to him when he was at Butlins because Butlins was actually losing  the market.
So the reasons why.
The first thing  we can say is definitely the strength of the pound.
The pound sterling was very strong against the dollar and relatively strong against currencies like the deutschmark.
"Now bearing in mind what we were saying about exchange rates before the break, if the pound was strong that obviously implied that people wanted to buy sterling, but what goods did they want to buy off us?"
What major good were we producing or did we start producing around nineteen seventy seven?
Which brought a lot of money into the country.
Again trying to get more of this lifestyle into their day to day existence.
Comparative prices are gonna be a motivating factor.
"Competition, the price of alternatives etcetera  and then you only have to look in any travel agent's window to see that that's an important factor today."
"Windows covered in prices, lots of talk about discounts, vouchers, all sorts of things to try and get you to part with your money."
Personal mobility.
Here by the main we're talking about the motor car.
"The advent of the private car has made a greater percentage of the population mobile, we can reach many different areas today by private car."
"And then we've got some factors which I wasn't sure where to put, government regulations  erm  again you'll come on to this later in the year  deregulation of the airlines allowing free competition between airlines and low prices."
"Issuing of passports, currency exchange controls  these can be both enabling and motivating factors."
"And finally, the big one, the impact of the mass media."
Everything from newspapers to television  movies  the lot.
"And so while these things here enable us to leave home, if you like, these things are buzzing round in our head and in marketing these are things we have to look at  in order to, we have to be able to make  product  and then try and assess how will the  tourist or potential tourist respond to this."
What will they think about it.
"And so  just gonna do a diagram now, just look at buying influences."
What are the things which actually are going through someone's head when they buy a product.
"You don't need to list all of these, just the headings are fine."
"We've got both, if you like, cultural motivations in our head."
"Cultural beliefs, values and lifestyles."
say at the top
Er that's just buying behaviour.
Patterns of buying behaviour.
"So the first things going through a buyer's head, or that will influence them, will be the sort of lifestyle they're actually looking for."
"The value they're attaching to this holiday, is it an important element for them?"
Is it the one thing in the year for them.
Are they just doing it quickly as a one off?
What do they expect to get out of the holiday?
Now so far we've talked about things like recharging the batteries.
What other things is people likely to get out of a holiday though?
"Imagine when you go on holiday, what other things are you hoping to get as a result of it?"
A sun tan.
"Right, a sun tan."
Well you're probably only doing that though in order to impress people when you go back.
discipline.
Does that yeah does th that mean that if he's say h he's taunted about his race he sh he should just turn the other cheek and have a stiff upper lip?
Yes.
I do.
"If I was on the streets of Ireland now, and I've been there many occasions and someone said to me, look at that Welsh get there, I would just have to take it."
And I do take it and I have taken it
and I just get on with my job.
But that's
It's a lot easier  It's a lot easier to say that .
"Richard, Richard if you w if you were on the streets of Belfast for example goodness only knows what they would say to you, just because you're British and they'd use the pretext that you're black to to really throw horrendous insults at you."
"Let me tell you, let me tell you one incident er in Northern Ireland."
"Erm we was on patrol, we was going somewhere, we passed er a big factory wall, on the way back er a day later, on the wall was, go home British wog."
What am I meant to do with that?
"Did you though er feel yeah go on, brigadier."
"Er I'd just like to say something actually to to put this in context because this dis discussion which suggests that there's a lot of this goes on, I don't believe that an Army that's got bullying as an endemic thing would be able carry out its role in the Gulf, in the Falklands, in Bosnia now"
That's right
"in the way it has done, and furthermore, every year there's a survey taken in this country, where we look across the country at the public service and we ask people in the community what they think of their public services."
Year after year we come out with a satisfaction rating of over eighty per cent.
"Now the community doesn't feel that we're a load of bullies, the community doesn't feel that we're not doing our job properly and I think that's very very important."
"Well  Robert  here a a barrister, I'll just get the microphone over here, you're a barrister and you've prosecuted quite a lot of, you've been in the army yourself and prosecuted a lot of cases, now h he says that er that the British public love the Army, but from what we're hearing tonight, there's a lot that's rotten to the core?"
Well well can I take issue with the brigadier on one point.
It's true to say that very few cases come to court martial.
"But it's the nature of the offence as such that if a soldier is bullied, he's unlikely if he wants to stay in the Army, to bring it to the attention of the authorities, because he know that afterwards he has then to live with the people who he's complained about."
"And if he does bring it to the attention of the authorities, the problem then arises that in many cases, and I've seen it in my experience, he will be dissuaded"
Yeah.
from taking the matter further.
That does happen.
"How, because"
"We we heard there from R Richard and Andrew, it's a hierarchical bullying as well."
"I I'm sure that's right, I'm sure that's right."
Can I just say one thing about Andrew's point about the S I B.
"In my experience the S I B when they receive these sort of complaints do investigate them very thoroughly, and I'm surprised at his experience."
Or directions?
Erm I think Neil might benefit from knowing what the intro leaflet is.
Right well we call it an intro leaflet because we like misleading agenda items mostly.
What we actually mean is a sort of mini manifesto introduction to the Green Party booklet sixteen pages or so.
Oh yeah it's gone back to being a leaflet it was a booklet last week .
Yes yeah.
Yes so what we mean is an intro booklet sort of A five sixteen or so pages covering ten or fifteen sort of major Green Party policy areas.
Mm.
Er the idea was we'd be able to sell it to people or give it to people depending on whether they had any money or not I suppose  by the Green Party.
If we were really lucky we'd be able to go to conference and try and sell hundreds of them to other Green Parties who might want to do the same.
So we a number of us went away with lists of topics that we were going to write erm two hundred and fifty or so words about.
And we went away clutching bits of  and similar document and things like that.
Erm and so far well I'm certainly willing to confess that I took these away full of good intentions and have have so far carried around this torn up copy of the  Greater London Green Party  for months.
Have they not done similar such publications knocking about the Green Party like catalogues for
"Well we we had our own local manifesto before and the idea, well in in practical terms it was extremely detailed and erm each rewrite was was a very big exercise and just photocopying er it was an extremely large booklet."
So we thought essentially really we're slimming down our own local manifesto.
Right.
Where and actually sort of rather than saying this is our manifesto and you know our policy promises it's lacking excitement on our general policy.
It's also generalizing beyond local council issues.
Mm.
Local manifesto tends to be tied to and attempting to remain more timeless that one or two
Yeah more to sort of statements of principles rather than just a policy  so it lasts a bit.
And I wrote my section.
I'd just like to make this perfectly clear that I did write a draft for work and leisure.
And I even had added colours on this copy.
Yeah and I hope they weren't too harsh.
They were written while I was on a train and probably in a bad mood.
I didn't didn't get the opportunity to explain to you the joke beside behind your writing don't use contractions in written material.
Which is perfectly fair comment except that you've used a contraction.
I knew I'd used  a contraction you know .
So
It does say draft actually.
"And unless you answer that question, you're just pandering to people's emotions."
"Now if you say to me, this is I go back to my work fare, If you're talking about the the young kids of of sixteen or who've left school, haven't got a job and they say, Well I want my my welfare benefit."
"You are entitled to say, Well okay we understand you've got a problem, we know that there's an economic er er difficulty across the world, what are you gonna give us in exchange?"
And Beveridge would have been perfectly happy with that question.
Peter Lilley wouldn't.
Well
"Oth Alright, I won't use the name Peter Lilley if you don't if you prefer I didn't."
Others in the cabinet would not.
Well s s but why so why should
So many of those speeches  Blackpool
Why should we be worried about the existence of a debate in a cabinet.
"I mean this is So n I remember, I used to go to NATO alli er er er di discussions as defence ministers."
"And people would sort of say, There's a division in NATO."
as though it was a crime.
"What was it, it was an alliance of democratic nations."
"If you can't have a debate there, where can you?"
Well if
"If you can't have a debate in cabinet, what's the point off cabinet?"
"I y c Yes, debates in cabinet perhaps, but we're not talking about debates in cabinet, we're talking about speeches made at Blackpool or at fringe meetings of Blackpool, which lead people to believe that the government is moving substantially towards the right."
"Now that's significant, that isn't just a this isn't just a debate about some vague ideological nicety, how many angels on the head of a pin?"
This is fundamental to the way British politics is going .
"Well you should y I I I er these la these these labels are so difficult to fit because if you say, Moving to the right, you then have to show me what policies the government is pursuing and you'll probably find that I either play the part in thinking off  argu arguing for them some years before some of my colleagues."
Well I'm talking about policies that haven't yet been instituted.
I mean
Sure.
"we've got we've got Michael Howard now talking about, Maybe it's better if er if the illegitimate children of single mums erm are adopted, rather than stay with their mothers."
"Well I mean that is i i something that  well to the best off my knowledge, the government has not announced or taken any sort of decision on."
"But the Home Secretary is saying, you know, This is something we will think about ."
"Well I you'll forgive me the disadvantage, I'm not trying to cop out, but the disadvantage of not having been  immediately involved  is that I haven't seen that quotation from Michael ."
Alright but if but you would not approve of that kind of language of that kind of er expression of government intent if that's what it was .
I I I I would I think that would be something that would be controversial.
Er I would like to k to know more about what Michael is saying before I got involved in any discussion of that.
"My guess it's as least long as Samuel Pepys' diary, or will be."
"And I hope that, er, you know, this, all this data will be published, and people will be able to see just what the complete data is."
"And if that's the case, then in the middle of the next century, more will be known about me, than has ever been known about any other human being."
Because I have faithfully stuck to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis.
I have not held back anything.
It's all true and it's all right.
"Of course, my own reputation will be the first victim of this."
I will be universally despised.
"But that's okay, I mean I'm not particularly, I'm not so impressed with the human race that I, I, I think much of their opinion of me anyway."
"But erm, the great pity of course is, that Freud didn't do this."
"It's, I mean, Freud we know, did do a certain analysis."
"My guess is, he must have written an account."
"It's a great pity he didn't preserve any detail, and he looked, er, like all his other papers had been left in the library of Congress until two thousand and twenty five, and then they will all become public."
"Erm, that would have been er, really worth knowing ."
"But as I've said, it will, it will be preserved in my case."
"Erm, it's my great contribution to science, unfortunately I shall be long dead, and many of yo some of you may, I don't know how many of you will still be alive in two thousand and forty six, but if you are, you may see this day."
I won't of course.
"But it's a, it's a problem  that, that you've put your finger on, and this is why I personally think that a lot of this literature is of such a poor quality."
"And certainly this  stuff, I mean, when a person's still alive, how can you possibly know enough?"
"You see, Woodrow Wilson was dead, Bullitt had access to a lot of private material that er, perhaps there's still,I don't know whether it's ever been published."
"And of course, Bullitt had directly observed the man and interacted with him during the critical time at, at the Versailles conference."
"And the whole book is really about er the Versailles conference in a way, isn't it, and about why he behaved the way he did at the time."
"So there's a kind of critical period here, that we have got a lot of information about."
"And in a sense, the book is very one dimensional  in that it follows just this one aspect of Woodrow Wilson's character, the critical one."
"Now of course, in a, in a complete psychoanalysis, if Woodrow Wilson had been going for analysis, then all kinds of other aspects of his life and personality would have opened up."
"And you wouldn't get this concentration on one, this one kind of character defect, which er, admittedly, is a, is a problem with the book and, and can make it look as if it is a kind of character assassination."
character assassination of Wilson?
"Erm, yes, perhaps."
Mm.
"Yes, but Freud does er justify this er meaning, that this is why to form a psychological"
That's
Because of his limitations
"The experience here suggests that a publicly owned operator can provide a better and more efficient service than private enterprise, given the right conditions."
And the same could apply in Britain.
At least a growing number of Tory MPs are coming round to the idea.
The key question is how many Conservative m Ps are on board for the Peyton amendment.
The Tory whips are busy counting heads to work out whether there'll have to be a government retreat.
For a start they can't guarantee the Ulster Unionists'll be on the government tickets this time.
The bill could create an precedent for Irish Rail from the Republic to buy Northern Ireland Railways.
"As for Tory M Ps, some of them prefer to remain anonymous, but On the Record has now found twenty one members who've told the government, they back Peyton."
"On top of that, there's the Buckingham MP George Walden who's likely to abstain on the whole bill."
And there are enough Tory back benchers who's names are in the open to force the government to compromise.
I know that certain of my er West Country colleagues er are uneasy about the bill.
I I detect a very considerable unease in the Home Counties.
"Where as I say, the railway is a very very important issue."
"Erm and I do not detect talking to colleagues say on the right of the party, any great enthusiasm for this measure in the way it's presently er designed."
So I think that er we are in quite a strong position.
you only need a a handful of colleagues with strong views er opposing an issue you immediately create a cliffhanger.
There's very little that the that the chief whip can do to avoid that situation.
"On a matter of importance but divided opinion, like privatization."
But I think there is room for compromise here.
I'd be surprised at the end of the day if er we didn't find a solution that would enable John Macgregor to go forward.
"The privatization bill will probably have to go back to the upper house, whatever happens in the Commons."
Lord Peyton has the right to stick to his guns and he's disinclined to give in after the majority he won last time.
His amendment was carried by thirty eight votes.
"They have voted, contents, one hundred and fifty, not contents, one hundred and twelve."
So the contents have it.
"As far as I know, the all the people who voted er for the amendment, will continue to do so and a great many of of those who voted against it and were quite unaw were not at the time a fully aware of what is proposed, er may well change their mind."
So I think the government would have quite a task on it's hands.
There's certainly a lot of passion about this in the house of lords.
Er the House of lords is not a particularly passionate place but er nevertheless it is capable of strong feelings and er I don't think it it expressed a fairly clear opinion on this occasion.
Er and I think it's likely to hold to it.
"Back at Victoria, passengers who want to travel to Gatwick, now have a choice of fare."
"On the Gatwick express, there's the luxury price."
"Eventually was put on the tramcars as a, a conductor."
Served with them as a conductor er for about approximately four years er and the experiences I had er as a conductor were many and varied er er if you do er recall er the old tramcars er the fares weren't in comparison today.
"I can remember quite vividly the old tramcars running there er day and night, with the last service leaving the outskirts of Edinburgh around about er twelve er eleven thirty and you g have about ten minutes or so to reach the depots which there were many and varied  at this particular time."
"There was depots in Tower Cross, Portobello, Leith, and many other places like that."
But while I  tramcar leaving any suburban area there was always what was known then as a worker's return.
And that worker's return was three pence.
Three pence for a worker's return.
"And it was always on that er tramcar, whichever er suburban district they were leaving, was always a packed car."
Always fully laden.
"Because the conductor always had to wait until such time as the queue was diminished quite a bit and hi his tramcar was full so that the next tramcar come along er coming along, whatever number, was  to be d the same thing happening again."
So the suburban districts then were very well served with the old tramcars.
"And I believe myself today, at present day,the tramcars were coming back again, there would be, could be a way of resolving this matter of going onto different buses."
"I take, for instance, the present day just now where we have, what we term, the old aged pensioner's railcard."
"Now what is to stop, instead of an old age pensioner getting on, with their  ticket, or a thirty pound annual ticket or their quarter quarterly ticket."
"What on earth's to stop, to have a transfer ticket, which could be used on any bus at all."
"So there would b take away this anomaly of old people having to use three buses to get from one end of the town to the other, which means, in actual fact, that each bus they went on to, they paid this ten pence, which if there's three, if they do not turn it twice a week, twice a day, that's sixty pence."
"Now why can't they issue a ticket, transferable ticket  So I don't have to use three buses, all I have to do is I've got one ticket, now that ticket reserved for   particular  ."
Do you think then that the er trams provided a better service for the people than the buses?
"Well we were a better er service, they were a better ser I'm not saying that I think so, I know  they were a better service  don doesn't does n they're not quite  proof, there were  in an tramcar Edinburgh Corporation tramcars were running, they were running at a, a, every year a profit."
"Whereas at the present time, with the buses, it's all deficits."
If that is not proof I .
The one speech for the other surely.
"Was you erm in a union at this time, when you were in the"
"Yes, Transport and General Workers' Union was, yes."
"Did you find that erm there was more advantages in being in the union, when you working on the trams?"
Oh there always is advantages.
If you're a staunch union member there is advantages.
With the proviso that you keep your payments up to date.
And attend your branch meetings.
"Was there any erm disputes or anything at that time on the, on the trams?"
Oh very few and far between.
Very few and far between.
All our  w most of our money does come from  the members themselves as you've seen.
"Er  the er  the breeders' evening  now what happened on this breeders' evening is that the  they run the raffle  then give us our expenses out of it  so that eleven  pound eighty is the is the part of the  raffle proceeds which we need  to, to e to er  for our expenses, you'll see on the other side  erm  that we spent that eleven eighty, six  eighty for  er refreshments and five pound for the rent."
"Er, the rest of it they take  for the er  to keep the breeders'  going  keep ."
Erm
oh yes  excellent.
"er  the  coach to er  to er  Bowness  on the bus we took thirty nine pound  erm  with  discount from last year  people who er bought some last Christmas  we made twenty three pound on that   the library, only thirty pence  course, we've had trouble with the library because  we can't leave it here now  and er  so that's why it's s so low the, the income."
Er six twenty for the sale of badges  fancy some of that was from a previous year.
Yes it was  it was.
I forgot about the sale of badges last year
that's probably two years actually er  income from that.
"sales  that were left over from the open show, three pound thirty  fourteen pound ten for the  collection, now that is  as you see, that is over from last year  last year the table show   so we actually have double the number of entries on the bench this year  which is a healthy sign"
Really  that
and er  hopefully  if we can only just bring enough fish each and every time  erm we'll even get it higher.
"Now as you can see, our main income is our raffles  two hundred and sixty pound, that is an increase of  ooh  seventy five pound on last year."
"Paid a hundred and eighty five last, two hundred and sixty this year."
Er  I'd just like to thank everybody for their generosity  for taking part so .
Erm  we're trying to have beer put on  the price each time now to make it worthwhile  so you get a chance of getting your money back.
"Right that makes a total of seventeen eighty six, sixty one  over the year."
"Erm, right on the expenditure side we have our normal subscriptions for the year, A S  erm the F B A S  which you all know, there's no strangers here who don't know what these are  the A L A  and the Whale and Dolphin er  Preservation Society which we have taken on as a personal thing  in the, in the er  name of the club  because it's cheaper"
"No, it's in my name."
It's in your name but it's on behalf of the club.
"It's on behalf of the club, yeah."
"Because the  the, the club one's getting rather expensive  so we  yeah"
Eighteen pounds.
so we decided to join that for this year.
"The rent for the club room er five pound per go, a hundred and fifteen pound  erm the Christmas social, we spent fif thirty five fifty one on the refreshments and seven eighty nine on the whisky, making a forty three forty expenditure  the club trophies, we spent nineteen pound fifty this year and we saved a lot of money on that this year, we spent about a hundred and thirty to forty last year  erm so we have got a  quite a difference  just trying to find last year's  erm  there they are  trophies, a hundred and sixteen pound we paid last year  so have, we did save a lot of money by doing them ourselves more or less."
"Erm  the inter-club show erm  we had to pay judges  er  two of them  thirty pound, we would normally have got Keith  for nothing, I know that   we had two judges so we had to pay them  er we did like  so that's two fifty pounds and we bought some  we had some old trophies which we were able to buy plates for  to use for that event."
"Erm  postage and stationery eight forty four  raffle tickets  ten thirty eight  raffle prizes, sixteen twenty four,if I'm short."
"Erm  table show judges, we had a table at the beginning of the year when we had the gentleman from Runcorn, what's his name?"
Paul.
Paul came to  came to judge  erm  er that's the only time we've had a judge.
"Er  hundred and forty pound for the coach to Yorkshire  which we got  on the other side, a hundred and six pound back so the  club  er  sponsored that, a hundred and thirty four pound, and thirty four pound."
"That's what it says, it brings up the mud and the refuse."
"That comes from the se , the seabed  churning it up  but the sea is never still, it's tossing and in, as the movement there underneath, although it may appear calm on the surface, but there are times when it's not calm on the surface, it's as rough on top as it is underneath."
"Most of you won't remember the time, and I certainly don't, some of you will, you'll be familiar with the er, healing accounts, seeing pictures on, er either in magazines or on the television news, in in old news reels, of that time when Neville Chamberlain stepped out of an aeroplane, and he's just been to Germany and, and had a meeting with Hitler."
"He comes back with a little piece of paper in his hand waving it, peace in our time."
"The scrap of paper, and you know the,th the result of that, and you know the  conclusion of it all."
"The whole world in, in a matter of months is engulfed in the, in the horrors of the second world war!"
Oh it looked good on the surface  but underneath it was dark and peaceful.
And your life can be like that.
"It looks alright on the surface, you're not going through a hassle at the moment, and our memories are short, fortunately  and once we come into a calm patch  the hassles of yesterday are quickly forgotten."
We were just enjoying the calm and the peace of today.
"But underneath there are those hassles, and those, those agitations."
"And Jesus, he meant to come and bring peace."
"They say peace, it doesn't just go on the top two inches of the surface water, it goes right to the very depths of your life  and keeps ."
"One occasion Jesus said, my peace, to his disciples shortly before he left, my peace I leave with you."
"I don't give, what the world gives, I do it ."
"I don't give something I haven't got, I don't give something I've no right to give, I'm not giving you something just for  , I'm giving you my peace."
And there was never a time when  the life of Jesus is not shaping us.
"You go through all sorts of situations and circumstances  but there is a peace and an equilibrium  it wasn't just on the surface, it was right to the very depths of his being  the whole being."
"But you say, but I am a Christian, I've experienced God's peace, I've accepted Jesus Christ as my saviour."
I love the Lord!
I seek to serve him!
But there are still those raging storms that come.
"There are still those tempests that hit my life and would not be around, and would almost swamp me!"
"Well there is a difference you see, there is a difference."
"And the big difference for these disciples, was that they were not alone."
Though you're going through the storm  but Jesus is in the boat with you.
"There is the difference for the person who has put their trust in God  who has committed their life to Christ  and they will go and you and I will go through those storms, and through those tempests, and be knocked around and be, almost swamped by them  but the thing is we are not alone Jesus Christ, he is in the boat of your life with you."
"He says, I will never leave you."
I will never forsake you.
"Let me come into the book of Hebrews and those words he uses are actually, to be underlined and emphasized."
"Cos in the literary, I will never, never leave you!"
"I will never, never forsake you!"
One major good.
Output.
Okay it begins with O  oil.
Okay?
Very good.
North Sea oil.
North Sea oil came on board and suddenly we had a product which people wanted to buy.
"In order to buy the oil off us, they had to pay sterling and so hence the demand for sterling goes up and suddenly we were viewed as a very rich economy."
"Ironically the price of sterling went up so high that it made it very difficult for us to sell our other manufactured goods and many people are now of the belief that because of the North Sea oil price rises, this had an adverse affect on our economy, making it more difficult for us to sell manufacturing goods  because the pound was very strong against other currencies."
So the strength of the pound caused through North Sea oil was a major factor.
"It meant it, it was very cheap for us to go to places like Florida for our holidays."
"Secondly, there was relatively low inflation abroad, certainly in the main holiday destinations in Europe."
Prices were not going up too fast and again this made it economical for us to visit.
There was also a decline in real air transport cost.
"And by this we mean in terms of things like the cost of fuel, although it did go up again in nineteen seventy nine, but also with respect to new services being offered."
"Er  Laker with his Skytrain, the people's express, we had a lot of new airline operations starting up which offered cheap seats so that the relative cost of flying was coming down."
And the net result of all of these things together is that it narrowed the cost value differentials between U K and overseas holidays.
Overseas holidays now started to look cheaper than actually going abroad.
"Sorry, than actually holidaying in Britain."
"Right, the second factor which Tony  outlined was what was happening in the population and again we've already talked about this."
"Basically there's a decline in the number of children during this period, people under the age of sixteen, by around about eleven percent."
"At the same time, there was a growth in the age group between sixteen and twenty four  of about seven percent."
"And finally, again we've already talked about the elderly  er age groups, there was a growth in the sixty plus age group of about five per cent."
Sir is that  children ?
Yeah.
"Yeah sixteen, under sixteen, then sixteen to twenty four, and then sixty plus."
"Now in this particular period if you were looking at these figures just like this, what would be your automatic reaction in terms of the type of holidays we ought to be providing?"
What sort of holidays should we now start providing during this period?
Which age group?
"Right, sixteen to twenty four."
So can you think of any  er brochures or any companies which were around at that time to take advantage?
Probably the most famous one
"They had, they had witnessed him casting out demons, they had heard his teaching, they were familiar with Jesus, they had every reason to be, to have faith in him, he says, what has happened to your faith?"
"And very soon they were , he said a moment ago they had taken it from Jesus, they were no longer trusting in him, and they started to trust in themselves in their own ability."
"You see, as long as things were happening their faith was riding high."
"As long as the miracles were flowing, as long as the sight er er was given to the blind people, as long as the lame were walking, as long as th the lepers were being cleansed, they had faith ten feet tall!"
Well when you see things like that happening you can afford to have faith ten feet tall!
It's not difficult to believe!
"And yes certainly, you and I can be like that."
"When everything is going fine for us, and God is in quote, blessing us, when our life is flowing smoothly, it's easy then to have faith, it's easy then to trust, but do you know, those disciples in that boat, they were no safer  after Jesus stilled the storm  than beforehand."
"Their safety had not increased one little bit  granted, they were more comfortable  and granted, they were enjoying themselves more, they felt better, but they were no safer."
"During the past two or three generations  there have been, there has been this, this idea of God's favour being expressed in blessing."
"Very often, we'd link that blessing with  material things, the physical things, the healing, the prosperity  you know God's blesses us just because I'm sick, he heals me."
I can't find that in God's word.
It's not there.
That is not an evidence of his blessing.
"You see  if that's how we're to judge blessing  then what are we to say  to people, to men like  C T Stard who  sacrificed  an inheritance that in today's value, just in the early part of this century, but in today's value be worth millions of pounds  to go to the Congo, and to China, and to India?"
"In later le li years leaving his wife behind him cos she was unable to go, and going to serve his God therein, where is the blessing in that if this is how we take God's blessing?"
"Or  what are we gonna say to men like Hudson Taylor there in China buried his wife, and buried his daughter, and son."
And Judson in Burma burying his whole family within a few short years of getting there.
"Men like Jim Elliott who in seek of the taking of good news of the gospel to the  Indians becomes, as a young man, a martyr."
To men like Teddy Hobson who  in his whole life serving the  the  of the Congolese  ends up as a martyr.
He was cannibalized.
Where is God's blessing in that?
If we equate God's blessing with the nice things that happen to us  then they were not blessed!
And they've given far more than but you or I will ever contemplate doing for God!
"And yet, is that blessing?"
Is that what it really means?
Is that what the bible means by being blessed by God?
"Let me read you two or three verses  the bible has to say about blessing, first of all, the verse in the book of Proverbs  Proverbs chapter ten, verse twenty two."
It sets the scene perhaps  for it said  it is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich  and he adds no sorrow to it .
And we read that and we start thinking of richness in the terms of pounds and pence and material possessions.
"Of course, it's nothing to do with that."
"But as Jesus said, a man's life  does not consist in the, in the abundance of the things he possesses, that's not how you gauge your person's richness."
That's correct.
"Yes, so you're privatised?"
That's correct.
Yeah.
"Just to make a party point, is that all right?"
Even accepting the fact that training is desirable I think that the trust law is so complex
I know.
"That it's very, very difficult indeed to be trained to know all the parts of it."
In the last analysis is the innate honesty of a trustee who realises that perhaps something is going right and takes  advice.
"Could we just quickly, who should pay for the training of the trustees, employer or the trust?"
The trust.
The trust?
"The trust, yes."
Pen pension fund.
Very very good.
David?
"Of course the role of the trustees is, is, is  re- affirmed really by Good who er says that there under the under trust or as he sees it, the trustees should remain the legal owners of the fund and I wonder if we can move on to ownership."
"I I think you were all here listening to the erm  pensioners before you were they were talking about their ideas which were also our ideas in our er report on the designated ownership of, of the pension funds and in particular they had a couple of ideas which you may have heard about having the word pension in the in the names, just technical points, er pension in the names of er of the funds and and people who were er giving advice on behalf of them."
I wonder if you could like anybody would like to elaborate on that?
We'll start at the far end.
"Can I, can I just pass for a minute and think on this one and come back."
Mm
I will pass as well temporarily.
Erm
"It's really sorry, it's really the, the question of whether the the the  the pension fund belongs to the trustees or is it  has been found"
"Well erm in our organisation and it was in our submission that we felt that it er it should belong wholly to erm the employer erm it should belong to the beneficiaries as well, because we feel very strongly that the pension is deferred pay, it is deferred salary, and therefore they should have an ownership of part ownership in that fund."
"They pay in six per cent of their salary, why should they be debarred from saying that they own part of those funds."
"We feel that erm you know that they're both very good schemes an and well run, but we still feel that erm the e fund should not be owned entirely er by the employer."
British Steel?
Thank you.
"Well  we consider that er pensions er contributions are deferred pay, including the employers contributions erm that the fund should be held on trust by the trustees and that the employer should have no ownership in it whatsoever."
Very good.
You've done your bit for the universities.
"Oh no, I'd much rather not ."
Oh What a Lovely War is a very favourite film of mine still.
I get very emotional when I see it.
"I don't think I can still yet watch it without weeping — it's such a powerful film of a powerful time, and a terrible time really."
Yes.
I was bitterly disappointed.
"I saw it erm  I ran it — I can't remember why I was running it, oh I think I wanted to look at an actor erm, oh no, it was at a festival and I had to sit through it and I was very disappointed in it, I found it slow and rather obvious and erm a little lacking in bite."
On the other hand its subject matter I found overwhelming.
"One or two sequences worked quite well, but I hope I'm a better director now than I was then."
"Oh some marvellous performances in it, but really it was Joan Littlewood's intrinsic concept which was miraculous really, that's  and really I don't know whether the movie lost a lot as against the play — I think it lost something — the important thing was that millions of people who would never have seen it, had it remained purely as a theatre production, did see what Joan Littlewood had to say, saw her perceptions, her wit, her humanity, and therefore I think it was well worth making."
"And of course Ghandi was your big success, so far, in a sense."
"I mean you got every award going in the universe, just about, for that one."
"How do you feel about that now looking back, are you beginning to get a little bit critical of yourself."
"I hope so, yes."
"Ghandi came at the right time, you know."
"There was a  we need another feeling now, it seems to me."
I'm so sickened by the erm cynicism and scepticism and terrible jingoism that emanates to a large degree from the United States.
It seems to me that our leaders somehow or another have simply got to be persuaded that we are prepared to sacrifice a very great deal erm to secure erm a new attitude.
"That it is inconceivable that after this number of centuries man still believes that ultimately the only way in which problems are solved is by blowing the other chap's head off, which is so lunatic now."
"We've only seen what we've seen just recently in Russia,"
mhm
but I'm digressing.
"Ghandi, I think, in the early eighties epitomised, to a large degree, and attitude of concern about erm violence, and I think that in some large measure the sort of recognition that it gained, particularly in the awards and so on, had a lot to do with its subject matter as against it's actual execution, and I think that if it had been at another time, or if the subject matter hadn't been erm quite as powerful as that old genius's life was, I don't think it would have won the awards."
"I think it was a combination of  it was an okay movie, but it was also a wonderful subject, a wonderful subject."
"I was a very  good movie too, I must say."
"Those two movies had messages, very clear messages coming through."
Now how about A Chorus Line?
It was a challenge.
"I mean many people wrote disparagingly about your attempt, your nerve in taking on a gem of the New York stage and turning it into a British directed movie."
"But erm did that have a message, or was that just a fun thing for you to do?"
Oh in large measure it was just a fun thing to do.
Millions indeed.
Our galaxy is just an ordinary galaxy among many others.
It's part of what's called the local group of galaxies which contains about thirty galaxies.
"It is, in fact, one of the two largest galaxies in that group and nearby, in astronomical terms at least, there are other such groups containing thirty/forty/fifty galaxies maybe, and these galaxies themselves, these groups, are clustered into larger groups and these groups are glustered into even larger groups, so there are clusters of clusters of clusters of galaxies, right out to the furthest reaches of space."
All right.
Let's go back to distances.
"Now you mentioned an astronomical unit, what's that?"
"Yes, well that's just the name the astronomers use for the mean distance, the average distance, of the earth from the sun."
"It's a convenient unit, perhaps a useful way of thinking about it is in terms of the time that light takes about eight minutes to reach us from the sun."
"So what you're saying, in terms of the eight minutes, is that something, an event which happens on the sun, which is visible, takes about eight minutes to reach us."
"Yes, if the sun were to go out now we wouldn't know about it for eight minutes."
"You've talked about many, many galaxies and so forth."
What sort of distance is there involved there?
"Well, the unit that we use there is the light year, which is the distance that light can travel in one year, and the nearest stars are about a light year away."
The furthest galaxies are about three thousand million light years away.
Three thousand million light years — that really is a huge distance.
Yes.
"Now if we try and get some idea of what this distance may correspond to, light travels at what sort of speed?"
"Well, it travels at about three hundred thousand kilometres per second, or if you prefer the normal British units, a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second."
A hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second.
What's the fastest that humans can travel?
"Oh, my goodness."
"In miles per second that's not so easy, but humans have travelled at perhaps a few tens of miles per second in a spacecraft."
A few tens.
"So we're talking about seveal thousands, if not getting closer to millions, of the speed that a human being would possibly travel?"
Yes.
"So if we're talking about something talking about something taking a light year to reach us in terms of light, any possibility of human contact we're talking about millions of years, probably, rather than a few years."
Yes.
"And that's, I think, important because it gives us some concept of how far we would have to go to get there, as it were, apart from seeing it."
"Yes, that's right."
It would be very difficult even to to get to the nearest start.
It would take many thousands of years.
and incur any additional expense
Three three farms and there's only te ten properties altogether in about two hundred yards
"But they're building some more aren't they, building another seven"
"Building some, yeah building some massive houses there"
and a Happy Eater as well
Well that's it
"Do they include that in the scheme, some of them on the rate, I won't bother with that anyway it's not our problem"
yeah
Okay anybody
"I've got one I meant to put on the main agenda and I forgot, and I wrote the agenda ."
"I've been offered the opportunity by er Bob  in training er in force  have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on, the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training, at erm probably at Exeter for those of us that do it and erm I think that perhaps with the the way that the diverse way that our staff's spread out the proper ways of assessing people which I've I've never been shown how to do and I don't think many of us have."
"Erm I mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er Paul was sort of chatting, and he wasn't being unkind he said yes, they'll be dinosaurs because it's a long time since you've had er any training like that."
"What about civilian staff, I have to assess my staff, I haven't had no training."
"yeah, yeah"
"right, yeah"
"I also said that erm my I expressed that the fears that I expressed at this meeting last time about er the fact that Paul and I now supervise civilian staff, er which I've never been sat down and told what the civilians term of contract are and what I can or cannot say or whatever, so erm I feel it will be quite valuable, and brought it for me to see if anybody think it's worthwhile pursuing."
A one day appraisal
"Yes, it's a one day,"
"Just write it on a memo form Paul and send it round with a circulation slip, and those who feel they want to get involved put their name down, probably the quickest way of doing it."
"Right, things are on hold though with assessments aren't they at the moment, cos they"
aren't they always don't they change every ten minutes
I ain't got time to do assessments let alone a one day course.
"Yeah, that's true."
"I think that your two waiting for signature on his desk,"
"You haven't seen mine have you,"
"Well why do you want one, you've just bloody had one"
No it's Derek
"First time he's said anything nice about me, I thought I'll get in while I can"
"Derek, it won't last"
"Right, anyone else want to bring any points up"
"Took me, took me about bloody two days to do your last one"
"Stuart  is having a social event on the eleventh of March for the media and the police, I'll circulate this round with a er slip on it, erm it involves a conducted tour of the police station and some bits and bobs"
But how do we actually learn?
Taking information through your senses.
"Okay you take in  right reading, listening"
From experience.
"From experience  and there are also the occasions very often when you're, if you like, force fed."
When you've got exams you have to learn.
You have to be able to hold it up there and perhaps put it down on paper or apply it.
We also learn from things like television.
"Most of you here, a great deal of your knowledge probably comes from watching television."
"Possibly more nowadays than, for example, from reading as would have been the case in the past."
"This is an interesting one, the interpersonal response."
How do you interact with people when you go abroad?
"Are you the type who wants to go up to, you're on holiday in Spain, go up to a Spaniard  go hola"
"you know, and actually try and hold a conversation with them."
"Are you the type who thinks god there's someone from Spain over there, oh it's alright there's a load of people from my nationality in the bar  and stick with them."
"Are you looking for the interaction where you learn something about the culture from talking to the people or do you want minimal interaction where simply you visit a place, and you stay in your little bubble  or ghetto  with people of your own tour company, you do everything together and you never come into contact with local people."
Erm  two if you like extremes and there's a lot of things in between.
It doesn't incidentally mean that one is good and the other is bad.
"Er a lot of people give the impression that we should all be more interactive, that we should go abroad and speak languages to many of these people, but the people you come into contact with when you go on holiday in Spain, the only Spanish people are likely to be the waiter who served you  and he's serving you as part of his job."
"His job is also to be friendly to you, to smile at you, you know, when you want it, so it's not really an equal relationship."
"It's very difficult, if you like, to develop a true friendship and exchange of ideas."
The waiter very often will tell you what you want to hear.
Yes?
"If you think about that, it's a very difficult situation."
"Attitudes are important, what attitudes do you hold."
"In particular, what prejudices."
Do you have a prejudice against for example eating oily food?
Do you have a prejudice against the French?
Which a lot of English people do.
"Erm prejudices come from all sorts of things, some of them are historical, some of them are generated out of things like football  and arguments in the evening about good teams."
"Prejudices, we're all born with them, they're if you like perceptions which are only changed very often through experience."
"We've then got general motivations themselves, which we listed."
I I quite accept the the M eighteen M sixty two is not the the A one or the M one.
"Erm but erm I I merely pose it as as an indication that erm it is possible for local authorities to erm not open the door to development, speculative development, er if they do not wish to do so erm because it does not ride override existing  structure plan policies."
Erm others have have suggested that it could be handled through the existing .
If if a major proposal came along and the local authority wan district wanted to grasp it with both hands they could use the er existing erm development plan process to do so.
Erm even if it was contrary to existing erm adopted local plan.
All I would say with regard to that is is it would seem to the regional office that consideration of those proposals that were in conflict with a with an approved development plan would be erm more easily facilitated if there was an approved strategic context against which they could be judged.
Erm and it would in in us suggesting to the county council that they consider this policy we had in no way expected it to to to result in in in wholesale de erm development.
But er just a one the exceptional cases.
And as a a facilitating policy erm it in their it it assists all parties in er dealing with er applications that come forward that are contrary to reductive development plan.
Mr Williams.
Thank you sir.
David Williams Scarborough Borough Council.
Could I just clarify my position on this.
Clearly er these are my personal comments because the issue hasn't been debated by the council.
Erm first of all I I'm not in support of an exceptions policy.
Er if there were to be an exceptions policy the suggestion has been made that certain districts perhaps could be identified er as being a suitable location.
Erm if there was to be an exceptions policy er I wouldn't like Scarborough to be excluded from it.
Because er as I say erm if the opportunity came along and er given the unemployment problems in the borough erm it may be that we would wish to take that opportunity.
Erm I mean I I don't see it but if the opportunity came along I think it would be invidious to have a policy which er only allowed those exceptions in certain districts.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
Mr Rudd do you want to come back on something?
Erm I didn't but I I shall.
If you leave it  long enough you get picked on.
Obviously.
Julian Rudd Ryedale District Council.
"In in not supporting the application of such a policy to Ryedale district, I'm not by any means saying that the district council would never support erm such elephants as er as have been referred to."
Merely that we would not support the application of such a policy.
We'd rather deal with each proposal on its particular merits.
Yep.
"Anyone else want to make any comments before I, is this to pick up points or can I"
Chairman yes
And Jesus says so  count the cost of following me.
Now Jesus wasn't saying this to stop people following him.
Not at all!
He wanted them to follow him.
But he did not want them to follow him under any false delusion.
"He didn't want them to follow him thinking that he was just a free ride, a free ticket for all their problems a and difficulties."
"As the bible says, in the world you have you will have persecution, you will have difficulties, you will have problems."
"There are the problems of life which are common to every one of us, whether they're Christian or not Christian, whether we believe in God or not, there are problems and difficulties and, and situations that are, they're the common lot of humanity."
"We all know suffering, we all know grief, we all know bereavement."
"But Jesus says, weigh up the costs, balance the account."
"And so we've said life is  it's gonna bring us problems, it's gonna bring us storms, it's tempests, and some of them are gonna be very, very fierce!"
"But you know, for the person who does not know Jesus Christ as their saviour, for the person who has never committed their life to God  listen to what God says for that person."
"He says, the wicked are like the tossing sea, and you know, as far the bible is concerned, the wicked is not necessarily the man or the woman who does terrible deeds, the wicked is not necessarily who is, who is a murderer, or a child molesterer , or a thief or or or a wife beater or something like that, the wicked is the person who rejects God, who turns their back on God, who says thank you, I can go through my life without, I don't need you, I don't even believe you exist, and even if I do believe you exist I'm gonna do things my way, I'm gonna go through life as I choose."
"And God says the wicked are like the tossing sea, for it cannot be quiet, and it's waters toss up refuse and mud."
There is no peace says my God for the wicked.
That's the word of God through Isaiah the prophet.
There is no peace for the wicked.
For the person who rejects and spurns God.
"Who, wants to go through life by themself.  , doesn't mean to say that all the kind of life is one big storm, not at all!"
"David the psalmist, he could see the wicked, and he said why do they prosper?"
"Why do I have a hard time, and there's the Godless person prospering?"
He said but David only saw the surface.
"And you know, the surface is not all i , you look out on the sea, and it looks like the proverbial mill pond, it's calm, it's  barely a ripple of water but it's not still."
"I remember many years ago, we had friends who had a fishing boat, er herring drifter, and in Fraserburgh the there's a young lad going out with them for a night's fishing  and it was a beautiful summer's night!"
"And the sea was, it was as calm as the mill pond."
I've never been as sea sick in all my life!
"Because you see that surface water,it was only surface water , because when that boat was drifting there was an awful lot of movement."
"It was, it was going from side to side."
It was going up and down.
There was a lot of movement under those first few inches of surface water.
"And that's the picture that, God through Isaiah uses."
"And this particular  it, it maybe  all nice and calm on the surface, but underneath there is a whole maelstrom of, of of agitation."
"She accepts that she then  was confused, she didn't know what to do  erm  she didn't think there was any point in getting out of the car which is what sh she should of done, she should of  tried to make some enquiries about the child  er, but she  er, she looked around shrugged her shoulders and  and then carried on her journey because she didn't think there was anything else  she could do about it."
"And then again, ignorance  er, at what she should subsequently have done  er, then took over because she didn't realise that by having had  er  made contact with an individual  erm  it was necessary for her to report the matter to the police and she just  didn't realise that that was something  that she should have done."
"Your worships, er, there's nothing at all more sinister in the failure to stop and failure to report than  than that,i th that is a a  true record of the er  er er of the  incident as far as Mrs  was concerned  erm  and it is something which  erm  comes about  an accident which came about  probably through the inexperience of the children  er, running across the pedestrian crossing thinking that they have priority  erm  and not having regard to other road users  er, and Mrs   was travelling at slow speed but it was  she was put in a difficult position by the  the way in which the children ran across the road."
"Erm  your worships as far as the personal circumstances are concerned  she is fifty nine years old, she hasn't worked for the last three years she's in receipt of invalidity benefit  similarly her husband who hasn't worked for the last ten or eleven years  er, is on invalidity benefit."
"Erm  she  would ask that and fine that impose today  er, could be paid by her  at the rate of five pounds  per week  erm, she  er  runs a car  her  invalidity income  amounts to forty six pounds fifteen pence per week  and she also receives  a super annuation payment from her former employers Goldeson's Hospital at the rate of a hundred and three pounds per month  but she and her husband  do have to er  to run the home and er, and run the house  er, run run the car  and she would ask that  she'll be allowed to pay at the rate of five pound per week."
Yep..
sit down and watch Mrs .
Oh thank you.
Sit down there.
Well Mrs  you're pleading guilty for these offenses  and we've listened to what Mr  has said on your behalf  and we're going to be as lenient as we can in the circumstances.
"For the offence of failing to stop you'll be fined fifty pounds, you're licence will be endorsed with five penalty points."
For failing to report you'll be fined twenty pounds and your licence will be endorsed  and for failing afford precedence on  the pedestrian on a zebra crossing you'll be fined ten pounds.
You will also be required to pay  ten pounds costs.
That's ninety pounds  and we will  order it be paid at a rate of five pounds a week.
"So Mrs  the court will endorse your licence that means that the fact that you have these offenses er  against your record now  will be entered onto on your driving licence by the court, the court will then send your driving licence to the driving licence centre at Swansea  so that they can er  also record on your driving record."
You'll get your licence back in about three weeks time from the driving licence centre.
You must start paying five pounds a week  by next Tuesday  the court usher will give you the address  of the court  but you must make you send that money every week.
Yes.
Alright?
Right.
You can go now Mrs .
Thank you.
Take care of it.
Mrs ?
Mr  sir.
Is that all?
Yes.
Oh fine.
"Would you deal with an additional matter please your worships  er, not on your list he's only been brought in  almost at the start of the court of this morning."
Carl Robert .
Is he outside or is in he cells?
He's in the cell sir.
It's basically offering people erm rather than becoming members they can become a supporter for five pounds a year of the Green Party for which they get three shortened up beat newsletters and this week it was two sides of A four.
Together with two further appeal letters.
I've just noticed she actually uses the sentence being a Green Party supporter isn't meant to appeal to everyone.
Erm and the meeting felt that it asks it asks for for views from local parties and we felt that the amount of money
they're gonna make you're gonna spend nearly a fiver sending all that out to people and really we should be encouraging people to be members and not to just give us money from time to time.
And in my own role as as the as being on the editorial board of the newsletter erm we need all the effort that we can going in into that really.
There's some justification for having Green Link as a separate publication but even that is is under question in the coming twelve months because our circulation just doesn't warrant all of these publications.
There there we can barely sustain Green World at the moment.
So erm having an extra network and all of the administration that goes with it seems very much a waste of time especially when it creates another tier of of sort of quasar membership.
Funny business.
So er we've gotta sort of
Object.
we don't think this is a very good idea seeing as she's asked.
Okay erm can we move on.
Conference accommodation and finance.
Right erm.
As requested I wrote and asked about self-catering accommodation at the conference and I received a reply saying that there's one house that erm she's come across that she thinks might be particularly suitable for us.
"It's a house for for, where are we, for six people."
In other words it sleeps six erm and the landlady's willing to have one person sleeping on the floor officially.
slot more people in  appropriate.
Erm two single bedrooms and two double bedrooms plus a living room all facilities erm except for sheets and towels.
Which we'd have to take.
What no sheep?
No sheep no.
"Erm it would cost for the four for the four nights of the con conference, that's from the Wednesday night to the Saturday night inclusive, six pounds a night each will almost cover the cost and we've fitted in an extra person on the floor at three pounds a night that would clear the cost completely."
And she said to let her know straight away if we think it might be suitable.
Erm Steve and Mark and I are definitely interested so that's three people so we're looking for another three people to share.
Bearing in mind that if we do have the whole house then people are only coming for a few days or or even one night could no they had somewhere to stay.
Erm and along with this we were thinking about ways to subsidize conference for people and this might be one way to do it for the for York Green Party to pay part of the cost of renting the accommodation.
Erm on the understanding that  for any Green Party members that want to use it over the conference.
That's just a proposal it's an idea.
So there you go.
the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
"The, the association shall be non party and non sectarian , you understand my meaning by that?"
"That we advocate the immediate implementation of the Scottish Old People's Chapter, to strive to maintain and improve the standard of living of pensioners by ensuring that the pension will rise according to the cost of living or er or livings or earnings,which er whichever is the most advantageous ."
"And number, and two,to press for the provision of suitable houses for old people at rents they can afford."
"And social services as may be required to ensure the welfare of the aged, as set out in our declaration of intent."
In cooper in cooperation with bodies on all questions affecting the welfare of pensioners .
That's er br
Is it er was it a very large organization?
"Well we er it's a, it's a national organization in fact, it's, it's all over the country, all over er Scotland."
From as far up as er In er Inverness down to the er borders.
Er  branches  approximately thirty one branches in Edinburgh which I myself er er attend to.
As far as the financial side of things goes.
"And er a g a good er and er, can be er the mi the name itself, the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association is not to be mistaken from er, sometimes it's misread as the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association."
"Now if you use that, that g gives the people the wrong impression that you must be a pensioner before you can join it, but this is not so."
"It's, it's known as the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association."
Not the Scottish Old Age Pensioners' Association.
You can join this association any time after the age of eighteen.
Do you have a lot of er younger members?
"That's what we er we want, that's what we require, because don't forget old people er, in fact our present national treasurer, a Mrs Mary , is now serving as the national treasurer and has done for the last thirty five years."
"Still national treasurer and she's o well over eighty, she's still the national treasurer."
"Board of conference, every year for two, two days conference, and we go to different parts of the country, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, Stirling, you name it, we have conference in."
"It changes every year so we go to these conference and we fight on our declaration of intent, on pensions, pensions reviews, that's er reviewing a pension what we're trying to get  for the government of the day to review the pensions every six months instead of at the present every year."
"are as an instance do that, the present government er last year, in fact since it some over, it was the seventy nine, er nineteen seventy nine."
We were getting paid our pensions on the first week of Nove November.
"Now if anyone like to look at the present day and er pension book, they'll discover that since then, for the last three years, they've done the people of this country out of one week's pension every year."
"They've now, this government has actually made a, a fifty three year or a fifty four week year."
"Is it a very er lobby,"
Ooh yes yes yes.
"We're, I am up at least, anything from ten to twelve times a year up at Lothian regional council or the district council in deputations concerning, anything concerning the Old Age Pensions Associations."
And  has been imposed on old people of er Edinburgh and er .
"So the, they're, the old people have been  been done o out of a lot of money."
"This year in itself, the single person has been done out of two pound ninety pence and er after  the er older ones that's four pound odd."
Did you find wh when you were being bullied or when other people were being physically intimidated that other soldiers would help them or would they just stand by and let it happen?
Basically you'd er just stand back and ha Actually in my platoon of fifty men it happened to me more than it happened to anybody else because I came from Glasgow.
Oh he's a Glasgow hard man let's get him.
I came from a rough area so that's the way it worked.
"So they find your particular weakness, your Achilles heel and th they'd go for that."
"Brigadier, evidently and we've heard lots and lots of these stories, and you've said you think it's the occasional example but you're doing all you can to stamp it out, but evidently the Army is a haven for bullies, sadists and rapists."
"Well it's not of course, that's absolute rubbish and of the cases that we'll have here tonight, each of them if they are true are very very er unfortunate indeed,an and I wouldn't condone any of them if they're true."
"The fact is of course that what we're seeing here is a tiny minority of people, and I could bring thousands of people here tonight who've been in the services, thousands of parents of those people who've been in the services, who would give you a very very different story."
So I think we should get it in perspective.
We're seeing just a few cases and I don't deny the fact that occasionally there are bullies in the Army.
But there's certainly not a haven for bullies or no nor is it endemic in any way at all.
Well some people would claim it is endemic.
Some people would actually claim that there is a culture of bullying within the military infrastructure.
But let's t let's t
Well I would deny that
Well let's talk let's talk to Richard .
Richard er er h these are occasional examples and they're very very rare.
I would disagree with that.
I would disagree with that a lot.
Well what's your experience?
"Well erm apart from my own experience erm I witnessed, I couldn't even m er name as many erm instance of bullying that went on in my regiment  erm and for all different kinds of reasons you know."
Erm in my regiment I was in
You were in the Grenadier Guards?
"I mean I was the on I was the only black guy in the regiment erm for a very long time and erm you know it didn't it doesn't matter what colour you are erm apart from my case, there was if you was erm if you were slow on your runs or you wasn't good at at cleaning your kit you would get bullied."
And it was severe bullying.
And it wasn't a case of just a few beatings and that
it was just disgusting stuff you know.
What sort of stuff?
"Well I mean there was an incidence where erm maybe a guy who didn't clean himself very often they would er a whole group of guys would find it funny to take him into the toilet erm fill a bath up with half with water, put bleach in it erm excrete in it, urinate in it and put him in hit, hit him with ba erm brushes, all kinds of stuff like that."
Let's let's make it clear.
Are these occasional examples that you're
"They weren't occasional at all, not in my regiment, no."
"It was again Aisa Briggs who said now come on, you know, we've helped you with the movie, come and do some work for the university, and I didn't need any encouragement."
"I mean it seemed to me that the whole concept of an Arts Centre of that stature and calibre on campus was simply marvellous — not unique, but of a very remarkable concept — and I became, as you say, Chairman of the Gardener Centre through Aisa Briggs' persuasion."
A very persuasive man.
"Oh very, oh very, yes."
"And since then you've gone your own way and the Gardener Centre's gone its own way and it's, to be honest, gone down and up and down and"
mhm
it's up now — did you know that?
It's
"Well I gather it is, yes."
"The awful thing is that the movies that I've been involved with in the last erm few years have entailed my being abroad a great deal, and I   was made in New York entirely and I was there for six or seven months, and the difficulty is that when you then make the movie and you take it round the world, you're away for another three or four months and so you end up being out of the country for quite a long time, so I've been nothing like as active with the university."
I'm rather ashamed.
I'm a very absentee Pro-Chancellor I'm afraid.
"That was Aisa, too, I might say, who persuaded me into that quite strange position  for an old ham actor to be in, but erm"
"Well you may be an old ham actor, but I note you've picked up about five or six, I think, honourary degrees now."
erm have I?
"Yes, well, yes."
So somebody must think something of you.
"You very humbly describe yourself as an absent Pro-Chancellor, but you have taken a considerable interest in this university over the years, and we've been grateful for it."
How do you perceive the flavour of Sussex?
"It's unique, there's no question about that."
I don't know any university that's quite like it.
I think it's disciplines are extremely interesting.
I love them.
"The whole concept of the various courses here and schools here, I think they work marvellously and I think they're stimulating and I think, from my own point of view, admirable in this breadth of examination and erm investigation and enlightenment, which personally I think is desperately erm important in our current erm communities and that to  specialising too soon erm really can be almost counter-productive."
I think that Sussex in a way perhaps isn't quite as identifiable as it was and I think this doesn't necessarily cause by any particular circumstance or group of individuals or individual or whatever.
"I think to a large degree fashion has something to do with it — the innovatory concept of Sussex was very exciting in the Sixties, it's a bit old had not."
"I think Sussex has got to find a new, new hat, and got to express itself and demonstrate that it is in no sense relying on twenty five years of erm of erm fairly high reputation that the next twenty five years and the next twenty five years after that are just as challenging, perhaps even more so."
"Again, I repeat with this problem of unemployment and so on, and the really obscene level of unemployment in this country at the moment — absolutely shocking I think — and I think the universities have to address themselves to that problem."
Thank you for that.
I'm all in favour.
All I can say is Amen in respect of what you were saying there.
"All right, let's go and talk about films now."
Yeah
Everybody everybody happy well I you just sort of went like that and I wasn't quite sure whether you was sort
it was an early morning
Oh sorry  so that's that's what it's what it's about so what we want to do then over these next two days is to develop the skills of design and delivery and will allow us to do that allow us to improve our performance despite the fact that we do have the nerves and by practice by doing it by putting yourself in the situation where you have to make a presentation and almost as one chap said one time sitting there actually with your  sitting there remembering he said actually volunteer to make presentations to the other people there .
But it's it's about about doing that and about being able to practice and use these skills and techniques so that we can improve performance.
So let's let's look at what we can do then.
"Well okay this morning what I'd like to do in the half hour or so that we've got before lunch is to talk about the skills we need when we actually come up here to deliver then this afternoon we'll look at that feedback from the video and what you did and then we'll move on to the skills of design, the preparation skills."
So when we come up here to make a presentation let's put aside at the moment the content of what we actually say what do we what do we need to think about?
"What are the areas that we need to think about, the skills that we need to develop?"
The way you look
"The way you look, your appearance in a way is what you're saying, yeah"
Your stance
"Your stance, the way you stand that's right, those sorts of things"
Body language
"Body language, yes we'll talk a little bit about body language and take that just a little bit further"
The people who you're delivering to delivering the presentation to and whether they understand
"Right okay, whether they understand yes so how you get the contact with them, yes."
How you maintain their interest and how you get feedback from them.
"Okay let's let's put those sorts of ideas, you turn to page three in the notes you'll see there's a proforma there"
"Okay, so we're going to concentrate on the left hand side for the moment."
The delivery skills thing.
Okay now we talked about things like as Tony said body language er we talked about things like er contact with the audience but what fundamentally are we doing when we stand up here?
Talking
Talking right.
So what's that about?
Well I mean what's er what do we have to think about
Communication
"Yeah, communication in general possibly about breathing about the way we use the voice yes, and of course the words we actually use"
Accent
Accent possibly yeah.
Well we'll talk about that because Joanne you and I er have accents don't we?
Yeah
you could get into a situation which is beyond managerial farms anyway because you've got more capital
Are they gonna have the resources to do that though?
From the government.
Ha?
It's from the gov the government
But where does the government get the money from?
The same place it got the  the erm tt the money for
"twenty er twenty  or something in, in loans."
Well
I dunno
"wouldn't you, and that's what's"
Well yeah
"Right  questions er on that , yeah, okay."
"Erm  going back to your point, we, we are operating within the context of a new democracy, right, which is, is, is broadly a kind of democratic  approach erm I E that it's, it's an indication of a sort of  the bourgeois revolution but within that you're saying it's not just a democratic revolution, it's a new democratic revolution and within that there will be elements of socialism being created."
"So we, we are not just creating capitalism per se we are building in that direction er  but there will be elements of socialism there which we can then build on and take us forward."
"So our, our land reform is going to have to reflect that so you would expect to see elements, perhaps, of socialisms being created."
Okay.
"So, so th th that would be some of the thinking which would lie behind sitting down and, and  and drawing up a, a reform document  a land reform document, in the very late nineteen forties."
"Sh I mean to, to my mind, shouldn't the land ownership possibly  one of the key issues cos that is  if you have land ownership and  then you're just paving the way for the new capitalist society and to, you know,according to Marxist theory  which I think is a pretty dodgy one,they have to go from capitalism to achieve socialism"
Right.
"socialists , which is just a load of rubbish if you ask"
Okay.
"But, but, but, but our experience of the past"
did not get the peasants to support us unless we give them that.
Yeah.
"That's right, so that's what I'm"
"saying if, if"
want to do that
abolish land ownership then it would suggest they're going for a ideologically based
Right.
"land reform, if they don't it's suggesting it's just another means of obtaining power by fragmenting"
"Erm or, or a pragmatic in terms of erm you want to minimize disruption, you actually want to get production going and the way to get production going is to give the peasants  the land themselves."
"Er normal practice for the railway was to have the main er part of the buildings on the town side, and you got a er smaller building on the other side of the tracks over there."
There's er part of the er goods shed over there.
"And we've got lamp house, er signal box and the white gate and er woodwork there."
Now that er merely shows that that is a cattle dock.
"A lot of quite a lot o cattle traffic in those days, agriculture and cattle traffic, and the normal practice er in certainly in the last century, er to avoid disease, was to use a lime wash."
"Er they didn't have the er the normal erm antiseptic washes, which sort of came in later on."
Er  Brothers of  were manufacturers of sheep dips and various disinfectants.
"And of course as I say those those were around, but erm the reason that is  all white, is that it was erm er when the cattle had been got out of the way, they er whacked a fair amount of of lime wash all over things er to er to kill any any nasties there."
Erm here you have a handsome cab.
And that cab you'll see in other photographs we've got.
Erm that plied to the  's Head Hotel.
"Er and again, you'll see on one of the  's photographs I've got, it shows, just to the right hand side as you're looking at the front of the main archway, erm it had the legend, Railway, parcels receiving office."
"So if you wanted to er send parcels via the  Railway, anywhere in the country, Then you could take your parcels into er the  's Head er sort of office there, erm and they were ferried down here."
You didn't actually have to come down er with er to the station to .
"Erm a number of er sort of billboards up here, various signals, erm lamps."
"Quite an interesting picture er and for anybody who is interested in sort of modelling this scene,get is right, er that's a very very valuable photograph."
"Erm it's off a er an ordinary postcard that was produced many many years ago,quite common."
Erm round about nineteen O five I think that was.
Now as you let's have a look at er the track layout of the place.
Erm  want to run to about half past eight or
We'll see how we go.
"Erm coming in from er on the A six one two from , er we've come to over the  level crossing there."
Now this is a er an ordinance survey map of about nineteen fifteen.
"And at that time, single track over that level crossing erm and the track became double as one went up past about Close, isn't it now, over here?"
"Erm  's Meadow, Close, erm and er then we've got the double track runs into the station up here, past the cattle pens which you saw those white things on the photograph, various signal posts, the goods shed, there, erm an engine shed, a small engine shed which was built to accommodate, normally only one loco."
"Erm and a little siding by the er track to accommodate erm a loco which was largely used for er coaling purposes, of the locomotive."
And and on the er here you've got erm siding with that that erm circular object is called a wagon turntable.
"And goods wagons that needed to be unloaded, er would be brought into, er at least unloaded erm er perhaps for the distribution of items in the town, would be brought onto that turntable erm and normally horse, purely a horse hook would be er put on er and swung round, and the wagon, or the wagons, a couple of wagons perhaps, would be taken at right angles into that er goods shed for unloading."
And the there was there was a central say walkway or carriageway down the middle there.
"Er well not quite central, erm and the er s wooden staging inside the goods shed, er was at wagon height."
So the er the items could be loa unloaded straight out of their packages and and whatever.
Erm there was also an interesting erm stubby bit of railway track there.
Okay just a rectangle round three three er things that were the highlights for you yesterday the most important things that er came through to you yesterday.
So  he knows what's coming
the eyes don't ya.
Some a lot of you said yesterday that you don't always get in this formal situation having to stand up in front of people.
But what if you have sort of meetings one to one or even even in three or fours.
So you know when you get in a meeting sometimes you've got a point of view on an agenda item and you think how  where am I gonna get support for for my point of view on the meeting?
Or you know you're in a meeting and the chairman  what's your opinion John on this where you what do you think about this?
"A good way of doing it is the Aldershot method, how to your put your point across very very clearly but also succinctly you know short and to the point."
"So if somebody said to me what what were the highlights for you yesterday, Aldershot method tell them what you tell them  just list them."
So what are the three important things for me yesterday were the Aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience contact so I told them what I'm gonna tell them.
Now I tell them why if you're gonna tell somebody why why your opinion is something the word because is bound to come into the sentence soon.
So I've said I've listed them well the important points for me were the Aldershot method the arousal curve and the  need for audience content.
The Aldershot method was particularly important for me because I realised that it's something we use every day or we see every day er and it emotionally prepares the audience the listener for what I'm going to say.
"Tell them what you're going to tell them before you tell them, and then summarise it at the end and tell them what you told them."
It's emotionally satisfying it's a very important method to get a point across.
The need for arousal  thought well should I be absolutely calm when I'm giving a presentation but I never am so is it right and now understanding that you need a certain level of arousal to be able to perform at all is is satisfying for me because at least I understand the situation now and able to work with it rather than against it .
And audience content when you're making a presentation I feel that's very important because you need to have feedback as to how well things are going.
If you don't look people in the eye if you don't involve them then they're not with you and if the audience aren't with you then the presentation doesn't .
So for me the three points were the Aldershot method er the importance of understanding arousal and the need for audience contact.
Do you see the Aldershot method there you list then expand on each one saying why and then just summarise by listing again.
Yep.
So can we try that just to from a seated position not from from up the front.
The best thing to do because having said that then I might say Mike what's your opinion what was important to you and and pass it on?
So obviously if Mike's been chosen once or he's done it he doesn't want somebody asking him again.
"So just jot down at the side of the page the other eleven names in the room okay everybody's Tony, Mike, Jeff, Sarah, Bob, Rob, Gordon, John, Tom, Joanne, Mike Dave."
Just jot the other people's names down and then obviously when they've been they've said their piece just strike their name through so you don't go and .
"Tony, Mike, Jeff, Sarah, Bob, Rob, Gordon, John, Tom, Joanne, Mike, Dave."
You should have eleven names down there  Are you alright can you see where have you got to Rob
"Rob yeah Gordon, Rob, Gordon  John Joanne Mike and Dave"
okay right  let's  the meeting.
So you've you've got your three points so remember the er the Aldershot just list what they are then expand briefly on them then list them again and then invite somebody else to to give their er their opinions.
Okay?
"It has to be done evenly across the board, in the rural and urban areas, or else we will fight every tooth and nail to make sure that we, our schools that we represent do not suffer."
And I give that clear warning.
"The Labour party in this county, values the role of small rural schools, but we are not prepared to see urban schools suffer to make sure that urb , rural schools are kept open for the sake of being kept open."
"Can I remind members of a fact that in the sake of a county where there are more small schools, there is four percent more spent on education in the south of the county than any other part of Wiltshire."
"Right, erm, I move that we er, having dealt with the F M under a separate motion, that we note the district auditor's report."
Those in favour please say aye.
aye.
And the against  that's carried.
Item seventeen.
.
"Well now, I'll move the recommendations at seventeen and eighteen, but erm, I feel something further is required to try and get er, our officers working with our committees on local agenda twenty-one, and indeed in bringing forward the environmental audit scheme."
"I don't want to have a working party, but I'm wondering if we should lay down some sort of set of timetable and dates."
Mr .
"Thank you manag , er Mr Chairman."
"Er,sorry."
"sorry about that Er, er, erm"
actually I was yeah .
"Erm, it's just on the big print on the bottom of page one, g two."
"Er, what's the point of analysing fuel for it's su , er, diesel fuel for it's sulphur content?"
"It's much more economical both for th , and good for the environment to buy low sulphur fuel."
"Because, you know, it, it's cheaper to run your vehicles on low sulphur diesel, and it is because you don't get the deterioration  in it, and it's better for the, it's better for the atmosphere."
"So I would have thought would be better to buy low sulphur contented diesel rather than analyse it, and in c thirteen, it worries me a little bit, because I believe that the district councils are the drainage authorities with the right about land drainage, and it was taken away from the county council several years ago."
So are we actually putting our feet into what's being done by the district councils over c thirteen.
"I, I totally agree with what they're saying, but I'm just worrying that we're trying to do the job that the district councils are supposed to do."
"I, I, I would wonder if Mr  's questions need to be erm, taken up with the chief public health inspector, because I think that that, or it, that appears to be, or possibly the trading chi=standards, trading standards officer, neither of whom are here."
"Erm, because er, it does seem that erm, though we're not talking about our own fuel, we're talking about testing other people's fuel, and erm, there's an, it's an arcane point about district councils."
Miss .
"Erm, thank you chairman."
"Yes, I mean it's, it's a nice report, but it's erm, it's not very sort of forceful or vigorous, is it?"
"Erm, you know it's saying that motherhood is a good thing, but let's not exert ourselves too greatly to do anything about it."
Erm.
"Oh, sorry I've got sex on the mind."
"I don't think that's a serious problem, but it nonetheless is the fact that this is now the method of measuring  of weighing atoms."
You don't hurl them through space and put them through an electric field and a magnetic field and the rest of it.
The accuracy comes from literally counting the number of atoms in a single crystal of silicone and weighing it.
"Sandy, this is the first of these courses that you've run, and I deliberately said first of these courses — do you have any plans for running future courses?"
It seems a great idea and it's a shame only to have one of them.
I think that'll depend on where the money comes from.
It always looms large.
"These courses are funded by Shell, and we're very grateful for their help."
They're quite expensive at the outset because what we've got to do is pay the lecturers to put a lot of work in on those lectures — it's not a simple thing writing this lecture for a thirteen year old  and we also pay the school teachers for coming along and helping the lecturers.
"Provided Shell were willing, we probably would go ahead next year, although the question you could ask is, having helped a group of thirty six kids in Sussex this year, shouldn't Shell, if they were going to run these master classes, help a group of kids in Westmorland next year, rather than another group down in Sussex next year."
It's very much up in the air about the continuation of these classes.
Remember this is the very first class.
"Between Christmas and New Year, sitting writing the notes for this course, I was very twitchy about how successful it would be, and now quite happy talking to the children and school teachers and listening to the hubbub of questions and pleasure as they do it, that the thing is working."
"It seems to have worked very well, and congratulations Sandy."
Thank you very much for talking to us about it.
That's all that we have time for today.
"My guest today is Sir Richard Attenbrough, or Dickie to his many friends."
"Actor, film maker, entrepreneur, he's a many of many parts, including, for example, an association for the past seventeen or eighteen years with the University of Sussex."
I think it was Oh What a Lovely War that I first remember seeing you round about the university.
Was that your first contact with us?
"Yes, it was."
What I can't actually remember is whether Lovely War preceded  my son and daughter came to Sussex.
I remember Michael.
"And I can't remember — I think Michael must have come after A Lovely War, or maybe contemporary with it, I'm not sure."
"But it was about then — you're absolutely right — about that time, about nineteen sixty nine, nineteen seventy."
"It was simply that we were shooting the picture down in Brighton on the front to a large extent and on the rubbish dump, I remember, which we turned into the fields of northern France, and we needed that terrible phrase from the First World War, cannon fodder."
"We needed young men who were dragooned into the services in the fourteen/eighteen war and erm who never came back, and we needed a lot of them."
And we provided them.
"And the university provided them, greatly goosed on, I might say, by the then Vice Chancellor Aisa Briggs, who was very excited by the project, and that's really how I came to be connected with the university."
"And not many years later than that you were involved with the Gardener Centre in one of its previous incarnations, if I could put it that way."
"Chairman of the Board, weren't you?"
Yes I was.
"I'd like to second Anne's congratulations really, to the, to the men who deal with wasps nest, because they're very usually men who come along!"
They are all men.
They are?
"Well, I know he was a man, I saw him!"
All of them are.
"And, I certainly have taken steps to make sure that I don't get a wasps nest, but in that particular area again, because he begged to point out to me where the wasp was getting access to, a little tiny space above my bedroom window, and that has now been sealed, so hopefully the wasps another year will find a home somewhere else that isn't quite so close to my open bedroom window."
"So perhaps if people were aware of some of the places where wasps can go within their home, they might be able to sort of take those conscious  That wasn't actually what I had"
"Well, be quick then!"
"Nothing, nothing fascinating."
"I just wanted to know what on page forty-two under ‘Water sampling’, what the bracketing figures say four u stroke s, one u stroke s, etcetera meant, and on page forty-three, why under ‘programme and revisiting inspection’ this four one nine p was starred."
I just wondered what those contexts  and you will be bound to be asked it in council if it's not asked now.
"Thank you very much, Diana."
Thank you.
"Chair, we do class as unsatisfactory those samples that the laboratory would covers don't reach certain standards, whatever the standard may be, and that's why we concentrate on that figure that the bathing  unsatisfactory at one particular pool, where there was a serious problem."
"And the starred items, I think the starred items, I'm not sure now, I think, can you help here?"
"No, I'm sorry, Ken."
I'm pretty sure that the
Programmed visits?
"Programmed visits, yes, I think they'll have been debt inspections that have carried out, whereas the higher figures above them are audit, and these are the ones that take more time, and are programmed to deal with everything, you know."
"May I suggest, may I suggest that's put on the report before it goes to council."
"Thank you, Nonnie finally"
"Yes, erm on page forty-one, ‘unsatisfactory samples’, we have six others, erm is there a general category below six, like meat or something like that?"
"If there was a general category, I think it would be put, however."
Yes.
"The category ‘others’, under ‘unsatisfactory samples of food’ six."
"Yes, they could be a range of things, chair, I'll check out what they are and make sure you've got some"
"Okay, Nonnie."
Yes.
"The only other thing I would say is that you've got domiciliary health there on the bottom of page forty-three for the first time, a thing that we certainly asked for on your behalf."
"I suggest that the figures you've got before you are not terribly, terribly useful, and that you do invite domiciliary health to come back to you for three months to talk to you about their work in terms of the visits, the visits that they do."
"It will be a whole lot clearer to you then, but it's there basically because it was asked for, it's inadequate because that was all they could do on the day, having been instructed to provide it."
So I apologize for that.
Well!
It was Peter.
"Oh, yes, Peter, sorry."
"I think it would skip to environment being the prerogative of local authorities, there will be a great variation across the country, and I don't think anybody seriously would expect that to happen about health and safety at work, and I think the same should be true of the environment."
"Right, just to move us on, then, since you're all going to have a go at this at council, yes?"
"Sorry, I just wanted to refer to page eighty-one, erm sixth form conference, thirty-three."
Yes
erm Students will be asked to report back to the next erm sub-committee
Yes they will
"So, shall we have a full report then to the next environment and health protection sub-committee of that report."
Yes.
"Can I just bring you back to the item before us, which is ‘This Common Inheritance’, and ask you to endorse the sub-committees suggestions, i.e. repeat them, as comments from the health committee, with the additions from the vice-chair on environmental protection agency."
"on point more adequately made by the deputy about C O two emission, are there any other comments that people want to make, or are you agreed that we refer back to council as it is?"
"Are we then taking up the point that Liz Spokes made on item one a, on page seven."
Procedurally Nonnie we can't do that till we come to the sub committee.
"Well, so that is how it's going to council."
I think it's a great pity.
Clearly that will not be the case that that's how it goes to council.
"But procedurally, we can amend it when we get to the sub-committee."
Is the sub-committee then going to meet before council.
"No, we have not yet taken the minutes for this sub-committee, I have simply asked you to take it together with this agenda item."
"All I was going to say was that clearly I agree with one thing, but one would assume that as the paper is a really a general outline that we would be seeing specific targets as the agenda's worked through over the next two three years."
"Oh, yes, if the government's still there, I'm sure they'll do that, yes."
Thank you Graham.
"Well, I think they'll be a government still there!"
"No, yours."
Labour!
"Can I then move you on, and we will correct the pollution and control sub committee minutes when we get to them just  and Nonnie."
"Item nine, there's a report for the half year ending on page forty-one, Tony?"
"Yes, chair, erm, I was supposed to give the figures if they'd come out at this time."
You'll notice one or two minor changes.
"You'll notice that instead of complaints signed in what would be technically the paragraph where they talk about service requests, because many of the requests we get from members of the public to provide a service are not necessarily complaints, but they do need our help."
"Yeah, no this happens a lot."
"Brigadier, life is er hard enough in the Army when you're being toughened up for the sort of rigours you have to face on the streets of Belfast for example"
that's just inhuman.
"I couldn't agree more, that offends decency and of course there is a distinction, a complete distinction between toughness of training and in the infantry in particular it's very tough, and bullying."
"But I'd just like to just go back to pick up something that the the lawyer, the barrister said."
And that is that
Pick that up briefly then we wanna talk about James again .
Very quickly.
"Because of course we're looking at the importance of bringing this on right from the time that a man joins as a recruit, and I realize that's when they're very vulnerable indeed, they're unfit probably, they're nervous, they're not a team yet, and we've developed all sorts of things."
"For example, we now brief recruits on their rights and tell them and encourage them to actually come forward with their complaints, we very carefully brief and select our N C Os, we have open days for parents, we bring parents in so that they can feel part of the set up right from the start and  so that their sons join the army and they tell their other friends to make sure they do to."
"We've introduced Women's Royal Volunteer Service people, outside the chain of command so that young soldiers can go along and speak to them"
"And you deal yourself with new recruits and so forth as a sort of P R man, you you deal with new recruits?"
I personally don't deal with recruits but there's as you know there's a depot which er
Sure.
So what are the army saying
"and this is where it really matters and really counts, what are the army saying to new recruits who might be going into the careers' office, army careers' office tomorrow,"
Mhm.
what are they gonna be saying to those new recruits about the dangers of bullying?
They're not gonna be saying anything about the dangers of bullying in the recruiting office .
Well that's that's shocking.
From what we've heard tonight.
Well I don't think it is because you're again you're back to the line that everyone is bullying and I don't believe that everyone is bullying.
"I I don't I don't I don't have any more time, we're just gonna have to leave it on that very er worrying note, but thanks all very much for taking part."
Thank you.
Mm.
And thank you for phoning in.
"Thank you Stephen from Leicestershire, he says that he has seen people tied to posts and set on fire."
It's terrible.
"Erm anonymous, my son joined the paras five years ago and he was bullied, and another anonymous person from Rugby, my two children were in the army and though they weren't bullied they did see horrific things happening to other lads."
"Ian from Earlsbury, I spent fourteen years in the air force,bull bullying has always gone on but only when soldiers didn't conform."
"And someone who's and ex-military policeman called to say, a lot of bullying does go undetected, but i if it was left to the Royal Military Police, bullying would decrease."
And Darren from Stoke on Trent was in the forces for three years and he didn't see any bullying at all.
"Erm, but it's not actually disproportionate."
"The, the amount of money is allocated on a weighted mileage basis so it's to do with the length of mileages in the area and it also reflects the various types of surveys that are done to assess the condition of the, the roads in the various areas, so that's how the money is first divided up on an area basis, but within that all the schemes that are listed here have been promulgated either from such as yourself, from members of the general public, or as a result of our own inspections er and a priority has been assessed to them in a methodical way."
"But, having said that, if you feel, particularly with schemes that you are particularly familiar with, that that one is above or another or we could substitute rather than, there won't be any more money, that's the point I need to stress I think."
"You can make pleas for extra schemes but if you do so I could only suggest that you also accompany it with one that you would rather er is not done, so there are actually replacements rather than additions."
"I'd best, I'd best leave it there."
"Right, I've got Mr  followed by Mr ."
"Chairman  members I, I'll look very hard for, for the words"
"I know you will say and I will support you, that we really don't want members bringing up  detailed points like that at this committee."
was er whether the  please ensure erm looking at carriageway major repairs you see area two tended to  ninety three thousand pounds and that covers a lot of things which might include .
Would it be possible for  areas in area two with that information please?
"Yes, we'll certainly do that."
I'll ask Mr  to get that arranged for you.
Thank you Mr .
Mr .
That you very much Mr  I've got Mr  followed by Mr .
"Thank you erm  I hardly ever comment on these but I just, I wasn't sure what because quite often these things go under another guise, but there are a number of schemes on the  drawing board for investigation as you all know and Mr  will know some of those  they've been around for, for some years."
I thought that they were about to come to fruition.
"I just hope that they aren't completely lost and in particular I'd just mention the  because it's being increasingly used and will be as the bypass comes in into use because access will be restricted to the, the erm roundabout."
It's extremely noisy because the surfacing at one stage just didn't take properly for all sorts of reasons  the traffic along there is increasing quite dramatically and I hope that will be part of those schemes.
"I'm not trying to work something new, it's already around and I just wanted to make sure it's not forgotten."
I'm sure it hasn't been forgotten Mr .
Can I .
Mr .
Thank you Madam Chairman.
Erm I'm not gonna mention that sort of little village in the north that I come from but on page twelve I do notice that  thousand pounds .
This has surprised me a little.
Could you give me just a little clarification on that
Okay thank you Mr .
Mr .
Thank you Chairman.
I think that's probably covered by Mr  's point but we'll seek clarification in a second.
"Erm, please,appalling and have been for many years and er  the whole of the road needs to be done."
And this could be
Yeah.
We are getting on very well with the student green movements.
Both of which are also non-political so that's that's a good step forward.
Erm
We've been concentrating a lot maintain the links with the with the university and the St James .
Erm  a lot of our members who were students in York stay on and and become you know active  or in other parts of the country when they move on.
It's very good good erm good thing for the party and they're usually quite starved of practical campaigning ideas and so we regularly try every at least every year to go and do a tour and erm we've been giving them we we're trying to rope them in on the various activities because they're crying out for
"Poor Steve walking into the meeting at St James and there were about twenty people in the room and you said, This is the  green meeting isn't it ?"
I can't believe it there's too many people.
They're they're both by a fluke at the moment they're both very strong.
They went into a quiet period a few years ago it was very quiet erm but er yes they're they're going strong.
We have informal links or have had  er our main contact has just left.
I've been trying to liaise with the Save our Forests which is  and forestry privatization and technically I'm on the committee.
But my other commitments prevent me from turning up to their committee meetings now so erm I'm sort of stepping back on to I'm just on to their mailing list.
But the orig the whole idea behind that was really to to keep the Green Party's finger on the pulse with that.
Get people along get the information networked and also to to maintain a political presence amongst the people who are writing to to or potentially to vote for us.
Erm because the the national policy is obviously to target the green movement erm as our natural constituency.
Erm and the only way we're going to raise a profile with them is by is by making sure that whenever can we support their actions.
Anybody seen this?
Can I suggest that we wind up the meeting and er.
Yeah thanks for thanks for facilitating Andy that's great.
The  question that most of today's youngsters seem to ask is What was life like in Orkney when you were my age?
Well looking back on it now it seems almost a life time away but it's amazing just how well you can remember those far off days.
I don't think that I shall every forget the day when sugar came off the ration and at last we could make toffee.
Prior to that the only way that you could get sweets was if you had the necessary ration coupons.
"And to this day I shall never be able to understand why so many of my generation, by the time they were in their teens, had a mouthful of dentures because it was not due to eating sweets."
And despite the wartime rationing the general health of the country by the end of World War two had never been better.
However the one dark shadow on our lives in those days was the alarming growth of the number of people with tuberculosis which affected the lungs.
The hospitals were crammed full of the flower of Orkney's youth and many coughed and spluttered their way to an early death.
"However, the arrival on the scene of wonder drugs developed in Britain and America at long last conquered this disease which for decades had struck down young and old."
"Why, why erm, does protectionism reduce trade?"
"Reduces the erm, extra erm, revenue you can get from exporting or, or it intro increases the cost of importing"
"Okay, yes, that's, that's one reason, yes."
Reduced through retaliation.
"Okay, yes, leads to retaliation, anything else?"
Leads to loss of market.
"Mm, yes, leads to loss of market, you know."
"If we're self sufficient due to a policy that subsidizes our farmers, we're not going to want to import anything."
"So those are all reasons why  trade in agricultural goods may have fallen, is protectionism in ari agriculture is second to none."
"There's no industry that's erm, as heavily protected as er, as agriculture on a world scale."
"Okay, so what, so what other effects does protectionism have?"
"It reduces er, trade in agricultural goods, anything else?"
What about prices of agricultural goods.
They go up.
"Sorry, sorry what?"
"Prices of, on the world market."
Right they'd certainly go up in the domestic
Yes
"erm, domestic country, or the country where the protectionism is in place."
"Well, that must reduce trade as well, cos if, if prices are high in the domestic market, they're not going to want to sell them in another market are they?"
"No, yes, that's very, very true, and that's the effect of protectionism, is to increase self sufficiency."
"Alright, however, if you want to sell."
"Yes, it increases self sufficiency, what about the prices of agricultural goods on the world market?"
"The size of the world market in agricultural erm, goods and the volatility of prices on the world market?"
"Aren't agricultural prices subsidized twice, they're subsidized to the farmers, so the farmer gets X for growing it which increases the price automatically on the market, but aren't they subsidized so they can be sold abroad?"
"Yes, that's, that's true."
"So that's  well, before we can go in, launch into this, I mean it's often said that erm, er, well, one of the major reasons why agricultural commodity trade hasn't been included in GATT, like virtually every other er, product has been, is because governments are saying, look this is a domestic policy, it's got nothing to do with international trade, we're supporting our farmers, it's a domestic policy."
"It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with trade."
"Now, clearly that's a very naive way of looking at er, protectionism."
"But that's the main argument why agricultural policies have been allowed to increase in their severity, rather than erm, fall."
"That makes no sense, because they're selling that product abroad, the farm product, many of them are."
"They might be, they might be, yes."
Theresa Smith.
What will be different this time next year?
"Well erm if I'm crystal ball gazing, I would hope that all the women in this country, whatever their colour and whatever their class, would have access to first-class provision for their young children, so that if they wished to work they could actually work in jobs that paid them enough and gave them job satisfaction."
Currently that's true for very few women.
"I would hope  that's a hope  I would hope that enough women who wanted to could actually be in parliament if that's what they wanted, could be runners, could be models."
I would hope that this government would actually be recognising those sorts of aspirations.
Your question about why aren't women angry — maybe people don't express anger until they can see that there is some point in being angry and that being angry actually helps you to change things.
Maybe that's what I would say by this time next year.
Maybe we ought to hope that more people will be angry in ways that actually mean that we can change things.
Do you believe that women feel more empowered or less empowered now than they did last year?
I think that's a very difficult question.
"erm the women that I talk to in groups up and down this county, I think some are angrier than they were, some are  feel more empowered erm if they have  if they've had these sorts of experiences that I was talking about earlier."
"Talking in Leicester this week and last week to groups of black women, some black women are saying I have never thought before about being able to talk about what I am and making up my own mind."
"I think when I meet — and maybe would count them not in hundreds, but in tens — when I meet women who make those sorts of comments and say this time last year I would not have said that, then those sorts of things encourage me very much."
"Ann Mobbs, which way do you think the pendulum's swinging."
"Next year, what do you think will have changed; not what you hope will have changed, but what do you see as practical?"
I don't think there's going to be any  dramatic changes at all really.
I don't think life is like that.
"I mean unless we had erm a change of government, say, and we had a women's ministry where someone was putting a lot of thought into the role of women in our society, and what one could do to improve the position for women, but we haven't got a government that's thinking in those kinds of ways."
Mhm.
And Brenda Thornton.
"erm I, I agree with Ann, not about the government, but I agree that I don't think anything very obvious will have changed in a year erm but I don't think it depends on the government."
Just four years ago I was working in China and I celebrated International Women's Day in China.
In China they have written into the constitution the equality of women in opportunity and everything else.
"So, very exciting, erm and there celebrating there will be the women representing all sorts of different bodies; there were only two men there — why were there only two men?"
Because the two men were the chairmen and all the women had all the lower positions .
"Now, no, erm if there isn't a ministry for women, and if there isn't a government change I don't think that's a bad thing."
"And Barbara Bryan, next year what will be on the cards?"
"I think much the same as is on the cards this year, that women are angry, in my view, erm women are proud of what they're doing."
"Some women, and hopefully more women, will turn that into political action — whether that's demanding a playgroup for  or whether it's demanding that their political leaders were mainly male, pay more attention to women."
They have to keep fighting.
"Well, many thanks indeed for fighting for the last hour on this programme."
Oh yes I don't know about song Chairman but er suppose I'm singing a song of some sort.
Erm I'd like just to re remind the county if I could about the question I did put in my opening er remarks that er we would like some view from them as to whether if their if their strategic exceptions policy isn't er ultimately included in the structure plan they would object to the principle of us er pursuing this sort of approach through our local plan.
Obviously that's in general terms as a matter of principle.
I'd also like to just come back on one point that Mr Feist made about a a two tier approach to employment sites.
Er that in my view won't happen because the I five sites we will still be allocating in and around the main urban areas.
A strategic site if it comes forward would be away from the main urban areas and would only be available for developments that could not otherwise take place on the I five allocations.
Mr Williams.
Thank you sir.
A few brief comments.
"Erm I suppose Scarborough Borough Council er having the most acute unemployment problems in the county er is as interested as anybody else in attracting new investment, but er I do wonder whether this particular approach is the right one."
Erm it seems to me that we've been talking about capturing elephants but er is it really a Trojan horse?
Oh this gets worse.
Erm the the county have have worked er very hard to produce a balanced strategy.
"They they've looked at erm housing and er industrial development, er I wasn't at the discussion yesterday, but clearly they've put a significant effort into deciding what the appropriate level of new industrial development is."
And er with the exceptions policy erm how many exceptions would we allow?
I mean we're told that these erm types of development are few and far between.
Er supposing the economy did take off erm we used up all the industrial land that er had been allocated to the districts.
"Er which  took care of all the the local needs, reduced unemployment, er and we have a lot of these exceptions coming forward."
Er do we then have a situation where the county's strategy's significantly undermined?
We attract a lot of new housing er requirements for new housing development er commuting is patterns have significantly changed.
Erm I just feel it's er it's a dangerous policy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Could I er, David Allenby Harrogate"
Just a moment just a moment Mr Allenby
Could I just respond to that Chairman
Alright yep.
Erm that I think wouldn't be the case.
"If if er I five sites have been taken up and employment needs of districts have been addressed and the county in general have been addressed, then er an inward investment wouldn't provide or offer substantial proven employment benefits."
Those benefits don't need aren't there because there is employment.
So that that consideration would be waived in the balance and clearly erm it wouldn't be right to  those sort of developments.
I don't I don't there is a is a problem in that respect.
Now if I stood here all the time for two days and presented to you just standing here do your eyes move have to move if you're watching me all the time your eyes are fixed aren't they in one position?
Yeah and the problem is that that because you have to look in one position it means that that the whole thing becomes boring and and your interest starts to drift.
But if I'm moving around slightly like this and you're having to follow with your eyes as I'm making my presentation it brings variety to it brings that bit of variety like you said earlier that it brings some interest to it.
"So just just small movements of the feet I'm not talking well there's a classic one I had when I was at college we had a lecturer imagine a big lecture theatre you know two hundred people  and there was there was a board and he presented his lecture like this,plenty of foot movement but he presented his lecture like and he just walked up and down."
Well I mean what do you end up doing if somebody makes a presentation like that.
Give up watching
"You either give up watching or you keep a score don't you, yeah?"
How many times he's gonna walk in the next minute you know let's time.
You don't listen to what he's saying because you know just it just becomes so it takes your attention away.
"But but small movement a little bit of movement around and some people did as we'll see when we look at the video this afternoon, but some people you know grew roots er it becomes that way."
Again it's part of the nervousness yeah I'm gonna put me notes down there and I'm not gonna hold them I you know I don't want to be anywhere away from them so it's all tied up with the preparation as well.
But some movement of the feet er is important to keep variety .
"So that's what  er worked on connection between the cluster of movements and sort of advanced body language if you like and the personality so someone who is perceived as using ja symmetrical palm gestures and open centre line and some movement in the feet is seen more as a as a positive communicator, a more open communicator, and it enhances the quality of the presentation."
Now there was one other thing that was mentioned.
"The third aspect was contact with the audience, yeah."
Audience contact.
Why is it important to have audience contact in your presentation?
Just to make sure that they think that you're talking to them
"Absolutely, so they feel involved don't they?"
They feel involved as part of the presentation.
That helps the audience feel involved but what does it do for you as a presenter?
What can it do?
helps you get your point across
Yes indeed it also gives you some
Gauge the reaction
yeah gauge the reaction some feedback.
Gauge people's reaction you know as I said to you earlier are you with that Mike because of all I had contact and I thought I saw you
I dropped off
"And you dropped off, well that that is the other important thing isn't it because part of the feedback is you know am I interesting everybody you know?"
Are they with me on this or am I boring the pants off them yeah?
And you may then want to adjust the presentation.
So audience contact.
The the first question is this is this thing about nerves isn't it because that's the first feeling you have when you got up get up here is and as  said I'm dry already and I haven't even been up there and done it yet the voice is dry and you know then you feel a bit shaky and all that sort of thing and why do we why do we feel nervous?
a fool of ourselves
Sorry
in case we make a fool of ourselves
Well that's right it's that fear isn't it of of
getting it wrong
lack of confidence
"getting it wrong, it's a lack yes that's right that's right it's it's probably a slightly unusual situation as well isn't it here you this isn't something you do every single day is to stand up."
"Quite so it's about feeling you're going to make a fool of yourself, I mean what's the feeling when you come in and you sit down first thing in the morning you look all round at the other eleven people"
You don't want to stand out
That's right you want to blend in but what's the real feeling what's the thought in your head?
They're all cleverer than you are
"Everybody's better than than yeah, are we I mean you know you've seen you've seen twelve presentations well you've seen eleven presentations plus you've done your own now there is that fear isn't there."
"Everybody's bound to be better than I am, yes."
"There's some sort of standard that we think we ought to have in order to do this thing right and we're we're below everybody else, yes."
"Isn't that true, is that"
yes
the real feeling and we feel we've got to come up to some sort of a standard.
Now when somebody else stood up here if somebody had totally dried up or been so nervous they couldn't do it what would you have felt.
Sorry for them
"Absolutely, we all want want each other to do well don't we?"
And it's it's true in any presentation there's nothing more uncomfortable is there than somebody in the middle of a presentation that you're watching struggling that's right you really feel sorry for them.
So standing up here there aren't eleven twelve people ready to shoot you down are there.
They all want you to do well.
"That's right they're all with me, yeah that's right because you know that you've just been there or you're going to be there yourself."
But this this nervous thing is a very primitive instinct and I'm just coming up to a word I never can pronounce so you're going to have to help me with this one.
This is where I get nervous because I know I've come into a word I know I can't pronounce.
In the br at the back of the brain there is the pi
pituitary
thank you pituitary gland
biology
"well done, I never can get that word out I stumble with it every time and that gets a signal from the brain that says this is a difficult situation this is something I'm not used to this is some I it's very primitive it's it's from the days in the jungle or whatever er a fear of fright over absolute  it's fight or flight, and that's why you start breathing quicker because the blood wants more oxygen because it's ready to run or to fight because the muscles, it is"
If they did the same thing again to you?
Maybe.
Maybe.
and the third time?
"Er  it's very hard to keep on forgiving somebody for hurting you in the same way over and over again and in this particular example, three times and that's it."
Just  just  all right.
Don't  more than three times  all right thank you very much for your help there.
"There is another question, how many times do I forgive somebody."
"Should it be as many as seven times  and Jesus had replied both no, no you should be able to forgive forgive them seven times, it should be seventy times   in other words stop thinking about counting and just get on with the forgiving."
And in the prayer that Jesus
he says that we should say God please forgive us as we forgive others.
So how far do you actually want God to forgive you up to three times and then no more  you know it's  it's that kind of er question that we're asking and that we  that I feel that is something we should be thinking about that how far should a Christian go in forgiving.
It's er all this is a fascinating theory or is it a  question in real life.
"I invite you to think about just how far you should go in forgiving others in daily living, whether it's in here or outside."
Another on the second point about how far a Christian organisation like this school should go in showing forgiveness.
You may be familiar with those sorts of stories which say my convent life was hell with the Sisters of Mercy er that kind of story about er church organisations that absolute  not to show er Christian qualities in the way that they are organised is quite true that often Christian organisations do find it hard to show forgiveness.
"So should a school like this one equip for the realities of unforgiveness of the world outside, or should it be much more generous in the way it shows forgiveness  and can a school be organised so that it does actually reflect Christ's teaching on forgiveness."
Is this  the impossible.
I'll be interested to hear what the teachers have to think about that and like you.
Can we just end with a  a short story about the job that I used to do before I did this one.
"When I went to  the first meeting I had been appointed to the job, I went to the first meeting and there in front of me were lots of people who were managing their own schools  and they were organising how to spend money that they had been allocated."
all sorts of managing business and they had to work together and to hold group organisations.
"The person whom I was going to take over the job from said to me at the end of the meeting well what do you think of that meeting  and I must admit I  the answer and luckily somebody else instructed with some other business and I felt I got off the hook here  but in fact that  got dealt with very quickly and he came back to me and said well what did you think of the meeting  and I had to say to him just one word,was the way I put it."
"Because everybody in that meeting was thinking about blaming other people  they were actually trying to say it's not my fault that thing come in, it's not my fault that things are like this, it's somebody else's fault in a different organisation."
"It's not us, it's them."
and then I had to work with these people and I knew that that was the kind of way that they were operating  and I had to teach them by the way I worked  but in fact it was okay to admit that we do make mistakes.
"We have to admit that each one of us could fail in what we were supposed to be doing and in fact  then we could work together, that we could forgive each other and that we could support each other in our work."
In my present job I still try to keep that going.
We do need to be able to show forgiveness in all the things that we do  but it isn't easy and Jesus devotion to is a great challenge to us as to just how far we can go.
So in your groups now I appreciate it and I have asked .
Erm I'd like you to be considering those two points.
First how far a Christian should go in showing forgiveness and second how far a Christian organisation like this school should go in showing forgiveness.
"Women used seventy five percent effective tags and twenty five percent modal tags, so in general their tags were to show concern rather than to actual seek agreement, so it wasn't showing a lack of power according to this study."
Whereas the men had sixty percent effective tags and forty percent modal which is still the same direction but to a lesser extent.
"Which shows that perhaps a misindica In this situation perhaps the men are seeking agreement rather than the women are, because the women seem to be doing it to actually show concern, rather than to seek agreement, which doesn't Turns a lot of the traditional thing about tag questions on it head."
"pointed out how tag questions  there's only certain structures you can put them in, that were going to direct it rather than proper questions say someone who's asking all proper questions,is he going to use as many tag questions anyway?"
Mhm.
and that sort of the
"that's something else which you might find, a lot of the time in er literature about interaction with children, you might find that er where parents are asking their children to do something, like if they're playing a game, you might find some You'll find that mothers and fathers talk differently to sons and daughters er so you start off with a direct ac action like Put that one there, if they're playing lego or something, straight prom Put that on there down to er Wouldn't it be a good idea to put that on there down to Could you put that on there or Let's put it on there."
"And you find more or more or less forceful ways of of giving directives, and one way of making some things perhaps a bit less forceful is to put a tag question on cos it's sort of adding a sort of pleading note on to it, to ask somebody to do it, I think."
Has anyone read anything about turn-taking in conversation?
Yes.
And how that works.
"sort of there's a model, a conversational model and if it  if it's if it's  conversation is following a model then it's It means that it's running smoothly"
Mhm.
and you erm  you know your next big  and the  mean a  signals as to whether or not it sort of the floor's being offered.
Mhm.
And you've just go to to  generally in single sex conversation it follows the model.
Quite often erm when it's men and women speaking the men will interrupt a little more erm which makes the women fall silent.
Whereas women hardly ever overlapped
Mhm okay.
So in the two things that can happen in conversation to to give it To make it stop running smoothly  are overlapping and interruption and like some of them are quite difficult to tell apart but usually it's If you're transcribing stuff it's fairly obvious.
What's Can you remember what the point in a conversation is where a speaker has a chance to to become a new speaker?
Like it's it's
T R P
transition relevance point?
Yeah that's the thing I was thinking of the T R P like you say the transition relevance point.
I mean that is like a point in the conversation where a change in turn-taking could ha potentially happen.
Now when you get to a T R P what are the three things that can happen?
I don't know if any of the li any of the stuff you read mentioned this or not.
Erm the the  somebody speaking includes erm address someone to make it really obvious who the next speaker's going to be.
Mhm.
"Or it you leave it open and one of the other speakers in the  More than One or more of the other speakers in the conversation could decide to start to talking, or no one could erm start talking  the present speaker at the moment gets another chance to carry on."
"Okay that's right, yeah."
Produce the educational material which is superb.
And I visited both offices and I'm most impressed by the cheerful dedication and sheer hard work and efficiency of the people I've met.
But the people I want to thank most  are you  the volunteers.
People without whom we wouldn't be able to raise so much money.
It's your tireless efforts as fund raisers that enable Save The Children Fund to survive.
If children are to be helped  in the U K and throughout the world then we all have to succeed in persuading people to donate.
"Those who work in our shops, those who arrange events, those who collect  great and small sums of money from companies and from individuals, are all playing a vital part in the continuing work of Save The Children Fund."
"I think we call er the volunteers, or those who run the shops anyway, Sally's Army and that is in my way a tribute to Sally Barker who's chairman of our branches advisory committee and does so much to make sure  that the money does get raised in the field."
It's a chairman's very pleasant duty to thank you all.
"As you will know  we're given large sums of money by governments, the E E C and others, to work in countries in need, to tackle specific tasks."
But the money that comes in that way  never fully covers the expenses involved  in supporting our efforts in those countries.
"The money you raise therefore is extremely important  in enabling the S C F to tackle major, major tasks."
Without that money  we would not carry on and we could not carry out our work effectively.
"I therefore am thanking you not, not just as a courtesy but in order to convey just how important your efforts are and just how important the seventy fifth birthday appeal is going to be next year."
If that succeeds we really will be able to maintain the momentum of the fund and the work that it does throughout the world.
"If we don't raise our targets, we shall stumble  but I'm absolutely confident from all the news that comes in from the field, that we shall raise our targets."
"I know that plans are well advanced throughout the country for a massive collecting effort next year and I want to wish all of you involved all the very best in your efforts  as we approach these days, that's to say donation days, in the coming year."
I'm sure your spirits will rise to the occasion  like the balloons in our logos and the banners at the side here.
Rise  to the occasion.
"But I cannot finish er without also thanking  most warmly, our supreme supporter  in the task of fund raising, her Royal Highness."
"I know you will agree with me, that her example is inspiring to us all."
Save The Children Fund and children throughout the world have every reason to be grateful for her unstinting efforts.
It's not often a chairman has the chance to thank her Royal Highness publicly and I do so with pleasure now.
"And now  to illustrate aspects of Save The Children's Fund and its long term health work, here now is a short video  shot on location in Lesotho in Southern Africa  and in Pennywell in Sunderland."
Thank you.
Save The Children's work is not just about dealing with emergency situations.
It is mainly concerned with long term development.
"Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world, surrounded by South Africa it has few of its own resources."
In places like this poor water supply and sanitation is a major cause of death.
Contaminated water kills more people than any poison.
Nine thousand children a day die from one of six preventable diseases around the world.
To combat these problems needs a concerted and effective approach.
Yet.
Erm what I was trying to do was be candid about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy.
"I think what I imagined erm Miss Whittaker and Chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to I eleven, but it would have to pass this criteria."
"In other words it would have to be job beneficial, it would have to be of strategic importance and and all those other things we've been discussing."
"But I think I had imagined it would it would allow, if it was wanted, it would allow I eleven to be overridden it would be one of the things it would be an exception to."
I think potentially Professor Lock you could be inventing some work for barristers given that Policy I eleven says provision will not be made.
It does doesn't it?
But then if we're exempting ex exceptions policy  except as maybe provided an exception policy  number seven .
.
I can I can see the the trap here.
Erm it maybe that in this alteration the erm it's worth just spending a minute on whether B eight should just be kept out of the frame for the moment and it's something that gets dealt with at a later time when more policies are in play.
"Can I ask would that seriously  if it were limited or by virtue of the panel report having identified this problem we reported that we saw a problem if it included B eight, would that be a problem from the point of view either Harrogate or Selby if B eight was in effect, if not in the policy itself, excluded?"
David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council.
"Erm perhaps I could answer that Chairman by saying that the policy I've suggested from the Humberside structure plan would er would I think cover that er problem in that it starts off by saying, Proposals for industry and commerce that are not in accordance with the relevant policies of this plan will not normally be permitted."
And then put special provision for very large projects.
So there is a recognition there that by the very nature of these erm proposals that they're not going to be in accordance with one or perhaps more policies in the structure plan.
Thank you.
Thank you sir.
Er Terry Heselton Selby District.
Erm I don't think it would would cause us a a tremendous problem.
Erm can I also draw your attention to the to the second erm part of the of the policy that would at least permit that type of development provided it it was able to demonstrate a need to be located in North Yorkshire.
So it's not an absolute exclusion is it?
You're talking about I eleven?
I eleven sorry yes.
Yes it's not it's not absolutely exclusive.
Mr Broughton.
Thank you Chairman.
As I said this morning  doesn't oppose er in principle the idea of of of er an exceptions policy.
But er looking at er Professor Lock's suggestion and the criterion that is set out there I think er a number of people might be interested to have a go at those criteria so to speak.
And certainly from erm my department's point of view we would be looking for er an inclusion of a criterion on the need to avoid higher quality agricultural land.
That's it.
Mr Earle and then Mr Potter.
"I've already said that women in work, that's where they're losing out."
"I think they're losing out more in the workplace than they are in the home, and I'm only generalizing."
"I know that there are many women who have a very rough time at home, but you're asking me if I think men have changed, and I think in that way, domestically, I think they have, but I don't think their attitude has changed in the workplace."
I think that's more or less still the same.
"Barbara Bryant, you were shaking your head there."
"Yes, I'm afraid so."
"I was quite interested in erm a study done by a woman, Mary Bolton, erm the actual work that was done and the sexual division of labour within the home, and in fact she looked at some of the previous studies that had been done and came up with a result that actually erm when men did some it was regarded as a lot, of housework, erm and that when you actually went back to count the number of hours and the number of minutes, you discover that men were doing very, very little."
But if they did anything then that was really regarded as marvellous.
Mhm.
"Yes, I'm not saying that it's perfect and they do their whack, I didn't say that."
I did say that their attitude has changed from a generation ago and I think they are doing more at home than men did a generation ago.
"Yes, I think they tend to say they're doing it for you."
"I mean they're not doing their own housework or clearing up their own rubbish , they're doing it for you."
"But I mean I must admit on the side of some men, it's not actually an individual thing that I totally blame it on, although men, you know, have their responsibilities."
"erm I think we do live in a patriarchal society where, even if, for example , some of the single carers that I interviewed — three were men out of eight or nine — and they had an equally hard deal, because the rules are stacked against people caring for dependents, whether the people who care are men or are women."
"And that's why I say it's not only the individual men who are at fault, it's also the rules of the game whereby we look after dependent erm people within our society."
"Well, Theresa Smith, how do you think men have changed as a result of, of the more upbeat position that women have taken?"
"I think it's very patchy, but I think that there is some evidence that, certainly younger men, younger people and younger men are much more willing to erm accept that there is division of labour within the home and that women equally should be going out to work as men."
That's generally the message from some of the national surveys.
So maybe things are very slow erm but I think there is hope that they are changing.
"Yes, but how would you want men to change."
"Would you want them to be able to express their emotions more intensely and precisely, able to show how they feel?"
Would you like them to be more capable of looking after children.
What is it that you're looking for in terms of change for men?
That's a  I think there's a different  different aspects.
"The way people express emotion is not simply a gender, it's not simply about how men and women behave, it's have how erm people behave in different parts of this country, or between England, say, and France."
"Oh, so you don't think there's any distinction"
"No, I didn't say that."
in emotional expression between men and women.
"No, no, I didn't say that."
"What I did say is that there are differences in emotional expression between people in different countries, just as much as"
Yes.
"I mean you simply can't, you can't guarantee the sunsets for one thing."
"A fourth factor, education."
Er around this period we have the widespread  use of things like colour television  which has now started to appear in everybody's homes  and the beginnings of various holiday programmes.
"So that again, once a week you have a visual image of what different resorts look like, but this time in colour."
"And again we talked last week about the use of colour in photographs in brochures and things, if you like, to reinforce the sunshine element when you're sat in the snow in the winter watching Wish You Were Here or one of the holiday programmes."
Video is probably also an important factor.
A lot of travel companies starting to introduce video.
Very commonplace today  go in to Thomas Cook's there'll be a video running continually with one destination or another or an activity holiday etcetera.
"And a fourth factor, third factor rather, school trips."
"Now again I mentioned this last week, the idea of introducing schoolchildren at a very young age to different countries and different cultures  so that in fact when they come to go on holiday on their own or with a partner  it holds no fear for them  unlike, if you like, senior citizens might do."
And it's plain that this in fact is one of the major reasons explaining why more and more people are actually travelling overseas now.
"The final thing is to do with marketing  and here we've got, in particular, the convenience of the ITs, remember the inclusive tours."
"You go to a travel agent, you pay a cheque and that will cover your accommodation, your meals, your transport, your insurance, it can even cover your entertainment."
Very very easy to purchase.
"If you contrast that with holidaying in Britain, even today relatively few people will be a buy a package holiday in Britain because somehow we think we can do it better ourselves."
"We don't need to buy a package, we can simply lift up the telephone, book our own accommodation, use our own car."
"And obviously that you can do, but it takes time, it's quicker just to walk into a travel agent and pick up a cheap bargain."
Ease of purchase.
Again the fact that you buy a single package very often when you go overseas.
"The tour operators recognizing that people had different demands at this period, were developing specialist markets."
"Club Eighteen Thirty, activity based holidays, holidays to exotic destinations."
"And with, these destinations, you can u use strong promotion."
"If you go past any travel agent's window during the winter, look at what they've got on display."
Invariably it will have palm trees and sunshine.
It has maximum impact when we're trudging through the snow and the rain.
"And the final thing, a factor we've already mentioned, price competition."
"Now these are the reasons that, why Tony  claims the revolution would have taken place around this period."
And these are all re really valid but what I want to do now is start looking more into how a visitor actually thinks.
What influences them inside their heads to actually go for a certain destination.
And how do we actually use this in marketing.
Now we started the morning  by looking at the determinants of demand.
And what I want to do now  is to look at two elements.
He won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time.
Erm it's an adventure and it gives you a sense of freedom.
"I don't want to do anything too energetic, I just like erm the sound of the water on the boat, wind in the sails"
You can be as serious about it as you want to be.
It stops you sitting on the beach and just doing nothing all summer.
and I've been out of there for three hours and loved every minute of it.
You can go from being a total novice to someone who's got a reasonably good idea by the end of one week.
"When you're on your own you will thrive in it, it's a really good feeling."
"All these people have discovered a passion for one of the most popular recreational sports, sailing, and as you can see, you can take it up at any age."
"Now sailing encompasses windsurfing, dinghy sailing and ocean cruising and if you've got millions of pounds to spend you can enter the Fastnet or the Admiral's Cup but whatever level or whatever part of sailing you want to take up, the basic techniques are best learnt in a dinghy or sail boat because it's less expensive and a lot more simple to operate and that's the purpose of this video to learn the most basic techniques as quickly as possible and to be at one with the wind."
Now since I take to water like a duck does to orange sauce I enlisted the help of Suzanne here because if there's any fooling in the water to be done I'd rather she did it and not me.
"That's alright by you, isn't it Suzanne?"
Well it seems just a little bit unfair but I'm sure I could put up with it.
"Well we're in the fabulous surroundings of Menorca and as well as being a wonderful holiday resort, it's also recognized by the Royal Yachting Association as a training centre."
"Now since I've just about learnt the difference between the sharp end and the blunt end of a boat, I've decided to go straight to the top and get some expert advice from the R Y A and who better than the R Y A's national coach John , Hi John."
Hi.
First of all what exactly is the role of the R Y A?
"Well the R Y A is Britain's National Authority for the sport of sailing, simple as that, we look after every aspect of sailing and powerboating but our particular role in training is to set the syllabi pre to the courses, to train the instructors and to make sure the standard of teaching in every centre is up to scratch."
"That beautiful white sail belongs to a Topper, doesn't it?"
Now why do the R Y A specifically recommend these sail boats?
"Well we know that a lot of beginners are put off by the complexity of larger boats and one great advantage of the Topper is that it's so quick to raise and easy to sail, so great for beginners."
The second point is that the Topper's hull is made of polypropylene which is remarkably tough and resilient.
Now that's important for sailing schools dealing with a lot of beginners.
It's also important for the first time buyer.
Right I'm convinced  such a good breed and you very kindly rigged this Topper up for me so well  you won't mind if I take it for a spin will you?
Just hang on a minute.
I know I said it's easy but it's not that easy.
Before you go out there are some important safety considerations we should talk about and the first one is personal preparation.
I think you're having me on now John.
This is the Mediterranean so why am I squeezed into this  number?
"Well in really warm weather a T-shirt and shorts may be enough but as it gets colder so you need to add layers of sweaters, trousers and top the whole thing up with a wind and waterproof spray suit but all that can make you a little clumsy, so the answer for most British sailors is a wetsuit like the ones that you and Suzanne are wearing."
Okay let me do the prog right er  Noel  that's a funny name Noel by the way isn't it?
It's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly .
Mm It's like pulse but not.
Oh oh  er yes.
Is that how you pronounce it?
Erm it it is pronounce to
Not the Noel y yeah okay.
Anyway right so erm head teachers  in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently.
Yes.
Why?
I mean why  why are our children going to school in in pig sties?
Well I think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender.
There were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was was won by the the County's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of of those problems.
Er with the new contracts that started in September erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be.
Erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently hygienic for pupils or teachers to work in.
Oh how disgusting.
And er
That is isn't that disgusting?
It certainly is yes .
That is disgusting yes.
So all these  a lot of these firms are not up to the job why do why don't you sack them people are not up to the job why don't they get sacked?
Well there are monitoring systems which are meant to be in place a and which may be er are not are not effective enough erm.
I mean I've heard representatives for County Council th this week saying that er as far as they were concerned th the standards weren't sufficiently low yet for them t to take action.
"But basically th every time the contract comes up for renewal, what will happen for a company to attempt to win the contract it's got to cut the hours of its employees and its also got to try and c cut the costs erm by cutting pay and that's the way that's the way contracts are won in this situation and as long as that keeps happening then the situation's going to get steadily worse."
What are we going I mean we we've heard also I'm changing the subject now because that was the the sort of political answer I'd expect and er I suppose until I get somebody else come on and say he's talking absolute whatever er I mean I think it is down to the people who live and work with the school.
I think if you all make a mess you should be severely reprimanded quite frankly expect other people to come round and pick up your mess.
Well that's something that a as a teacher we're erm in my school we're constantly saying t to the pupils I mean if they ha they have a they have a certain responsibility t to tidy up after them and t to try and keep their work area tidy that's not the same as er as cleaning at the end of the day as sweeping up all all the dust and and so on.
What about this mum's army of teachers is this going to come to fruition as some point or not?
I don't I don't believe it is erm at the mo well earlier this week a report was published by the National Commission on Education which was er an independent erm Commission that was set up erm and they they've said that basically what we need to be doing is t if we're trying to raise standards is to keep the idea of having an all graduate profess profession followed up by high quality for train training for teachers once they've actually started work.
The problem there is that graduates are so terribly boring and uninteresting people basically aren't they that they find it difficult to impart their er
You would?
I would yes.
"Certainly to the extent that er Richard has experienced it, no."
"But it was a fairly common way of getting people who  perhaps wasn't up to standard or whatever, other recruits would grab them, and as he's described take them into the bathroom ,"
throw them into a bath filled with whatever they chose to erm
So it's a fairly common occurrence?
It happened certainly two or three times during my training.
In your own training you saw it?
Mhm.
Er the so-called regimental bath.
"Now there's another case here we've heard of er of racism, and I mean racism is the pretext very often for for bullying and bruta brutality and intimidation."
And er er Paul  your stepbrother er   he died while he was with his regiment.
What happened to him?
Yes my brother  er joined the Army about two years ago until he took his own life earlier on this summer.
"Erm he started his life er in Vietnam in the violence of Vietnam, and had therefore a lot of violence in his early life, which I think really stayed with him, but when he did join the Army, he was very proud to be doing so, and very proud to be wanting to be part of Britain and serving Britain in whatever way he could."
"And a I would say that actually during the early period in the Army, I think he probably gave as good as he got."
"I mean it was tough, life was tough for him and I know that he faced quite a lot of comments both of racist and other other things ."
he was Vietnamese presumably the comments were of a  racist nature ?
Yes er Yes that's right.
And and he took quite a lot of them but in the time that
Name calling?
"Oh all of that, name calling and and quite a bit more."
"But during that time when things were going well, he managed it."
"I think the thing that worries me most is that later on, he didn't manage it too well, a lot of other things were going wrong in his life, and at that point the name calling continued, and the stuff that maybe wasn't so hurtful early on seemed to become very hurtful then."
"And my main concern and complaint is that the Army, with its its emphasis on being macho, on being strong, on being okay, doesn't allow people to have their own weaknesses and in  's case, I just wish somebody somewhere in authority had spotted that he was a lad in trouble."
"But if you do have pe people will say if you do h have those weaknesses and if er there were times that he could was quite up to the joshing and the name calling, there were times when he wasn't, the very fact that there were times when he wasn't, doesn't that tell you that perhaps the Army wasn't the place for him?"
"Well I don't know about that because I don't think that anybody stays the same all the way through their life, and I don't think there's anybody in life that's strong in every circumstance."
I believe everybody at some point needs support.
"Now one of the problems is in the Army, that if you do need support, it's a sign of weakness, it's a sign of failure, it's almost impossible for you to get the kind of counselling and help that a lot of young lads need, and I think that a lot of young people in the Army today who maybe have got a lot of worries in their soul, and they don't have the courage at the moment or the possibility of getting that help because of the Army culture."
"Sergeant Major , you've been in the Army for about nigh on twenty years now, do you think that a soldier has to be able to cope with that sort of taunting and name calling when he's on the streets of Belfast for example."
"When a soldier goes to Belfast, he is abused,verbally abused"
Yeah
"on the streets, he has to react or or react in a manner that erm really when he's on there, he doesn't he doesn't react to that particular incident that's happening in front of him."
He he must be taught that and he's taught that through his training.
So we have think about making sure that we use or if we use a word and people don't understand it
Explain it
"Explain it, absolutely  Now so that's about words based on geographical variations or regional variations within the country er er something to be avoided but what about in the industry you're in."
Jargon
Jargon.
Absolutely yeah.
Now  there's a word that covers that and that the the choice of words based on on getting it right for the audience particularly in terms of jargon is what is called wordsmith.
"Cho choosing words in if if you think of a parallel with blacksmith, a blacksmith takes base metal and sort of bends it and shapes it to the appropriate shape."
Choosing the right words for the audience particularly based on jargon is what's called wordsmith.
"Now somebody said they got involved in prequalification meetings, yeah."
Mike who might you have as an audience in a prequalification er hang on er prequalification everybody understand prequalification?
Let's make sure we didn't use any term that everybody understands yeah.
understand what
Right exactly because you might you might have the client or a representative of the client as well as architects and people who would so you have to be careful don't you in terms of using the right words.
So your presentation would be
simplified
Simplified that's right.
Where the jargon might arise would be perhaps in response to questions from an architect for instance yes.
Technical yeah the technical people but you have to ensure don't you that with with your audience that you understand who they are but if you don't then you have to keep it to a common denominator.
"Yeah and that's about wordsmith, choosing the right words for the for the appropriate to the audience and of course jargon the industry jargon erm is the thing you've got to watch."
Okay so that's about paralinguistics about the way we use the voice in a presentation and the way we chose the words so that we have effective communication with our audience.
Okay.
Now was it Tony who said about body language yep?
Yep
"Now, body language if we move on to that."
"If you read books on body language then erm that says erm I'm not quite sure what I'm talking about yes, I'm not being truthful and that means that that I'm really not being really very sincere or again I'm unsure."
But what could it also mean?
itchy ear
You've got an itchy ear or an itchy chin absolutely yeah.
That it exactly that.
So body language if you read a lot of the books on body language it takes one single action and it interprets it based on that.
"Now if we take it just one step further, there was a lady well there still is a lady called  and she did some research, what she was trying to look at was the the sort of body language if you like the actions that people er use and associate that to their personality and she looked particularly at people who were open positive communicators truthful I suppose but people who were open communicators and looked at the sort of things they did and also at people who perhaps weren't quite so honest and open and truthful."
So before we start doing anything at all we actually do some identification of trainees.
What do you think this actually involves?
Those that have seen it before.
Oh right.
Or for those who haven't seen it before.
What do you think identifying training is all about?
Yeah.
Yeah.
To find out?
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"Identifying trainees is all about finding out who needs to be trained and what they need to know  and if you remember one of ject objectives we had for the course is, was to, so that by the end of the course you will actually develop a system by identifying the trainees because  this is  sort of hit or miss."
"If they're gonna do training well, then we need some sort of system to find out who knows what  and what people need to learn."
We need some sort of method for finding out what people need to know.
The second part once we know what people need to know  we now need to think about putting together some training which actually satisfies that particular need.
So this next part is called design in training.
"We're slipping into the training jargon here, but all it is is writing, just putting together some material which is, which is just what they need."
"If you haven't done this, if you haven't found out exactly what people need to know, the danger is that when you actually start to put together some material it's very hit or miss isn't it?"
"It could be that you're giving them some stuff that we already know or it could be that you're giving them some stuff which is far too advanced for them, they don't have the basics there."
"Sometimes we know people very well, but it still helps doesn't it if somebody else comes in that there's some sort of system there that somebody else who takes over your section can find out exactly who's received what."
The last point then is delivering the training.
Once we've actually written the session we can then deliver it  and the delivery is generally much more effective if we've put together material which suits their needs perfectly.
"You feel more confident don't you in a group situation if you know exactly what people er er know or what they don't know, cos there's nothing worse isn't there than to go in and thinking they may already know this, I might be going in an  teaching my grandmother to suck eggs here, I'm not sure what they know about this."
You feel much more confident don't you if you know exactly what people need from you.
You go in feeling better and cos you feel better you'll deliver it in a much more effective way.
And the last part is something that a number of you had for your objectives is  and evaluation monitoring and evaluating training.
"Once you've actually delivered it, you then need to find out well was it successful, did we achieve our objectives, did people learn, what we wanted them to learn."
This is the very important part of the training cycle and the cycle is incomplete  cos there's no good investing in time and training is there if we don't know whether we've been
successful or not.
"If we have, great, we find out what else they need to know."
"If they haven't quite got it, then we may need to re-do parts of it."
But we think the training cycle is something that's continuous.
And that's that.
"Okay, right."
Has anyone got any other things to add to that?
No.
"There was a  when we were talking about erm how er women sit there and chatter, it's sort of trivial."
"Said to be trivial erm which meant it isn't erm  book says that erm cos women talk about things like erm children and husband and things,"
Mhm
whereas men talk about cars and stuff like that.
And that's  it's not true at all it's just different it considered.
"Right, and we've got part of this linked in with the stuff you might have done on Sapir-Wharf Hypothesis in the sense that er people talk about different things because they might be relevant to their actual lives."
"Er and of course if you're in one group, you might think that something's trivial and you might denigrate another a group for talking about those things, when in fact that group sees it as an important talk about it might see the thing that the other group hold dear to talk about as something trivial, and to denigrate."
"So yeah, I mean that's definitely something that that comes into it."
Erm what sort of d differences are there in conversational styles?
"I mean it's a thing you might want to talk think about or you night have read about, things like interjections and er interruptions and overlapping."
"and how erm men tend to ignore them, they're like they're not interested and not going to pay any attention."
"Right, do you want to explain that a bit more, about"
"Well things that they  the actually say anything which is sort of a sign that you  listening, understanding but if they delay it, it's say it 's the women that pauses,wanting some sort of  suddenly realizes"
Right.
"that women uses use minimal responses anyway, then then  you know like all males speak a male  didn't use minimal responses"
so it wouldn't be that they interruptions listening necessarily it would just be that wouldn't expect to have to.
"Yeah, right yeah."
Women use women use minim minimal
responses  but when men use them it quite often delay .
"I mean one thing that's mentioned before is about tag questions, which is where you put on question to the end of your sentence, as in Oh don't you agree or Isn't it or you know you know the sort of thing I mean."
"Er now I mean One thing that a lot of the literature says is that this might indicate a power, and another thing that the literature says"
is that it tends to be women who do more of it.
"It does,and say that erm you say that"
Okay.
but I can't remember
"This is one of the things that some studies have shown it to be the case, other studies haven't."
"One thing that might be relevant to this is the fact that er one study came up with two different types of tag question, they call the two different tabs, aka tag question Modal tags and Effective tags."
"Now modal tag is one for seeking agreement whereas an effective tag is one that shows concern to the addressee and according to this study, if you looked and the sheer number of tags, women did use more tags than men, but in actual fact women used a higher proportion of the effective tags than men did."
"Yeah, that's right."
Which isn't really erm compatible with social with communism.
"I don't see how you can argue it is, I don't see how anyone can."
Right.
Erm but it
Shh
It would suggest it's just not a transitory stage.
"But, but but ending feudalism is the first important stance."
"Well that's what they argue, yes."
But I mean feudalism
Okay.
it's hardly communism is it?
"Erm no, but you're, at least you're getting out of feudalism."
Well yeah but  capitalism
But you can't go straight for socialism or communism.
Well that's what they said but why not?
Because
"I mean that's just rubbish, they said you have to go to"
"capitalism and then, then naturally evolve into socialism  communism."
"Well, but we, no we're not saying that, what we're saying is that we  so all we're trying,w w w that they were saying we can't go from  cap er from feudalism to socialism  but we don't want to go just from feudalism to capitalism, we want to go into er if you like a capitalism with socialist characteristics."
"We, we want there to be elements of socialism built into the capitalism we're creating which will allow us to go straight into, to socialism in the future."
Mm
And  supposed to see the  superiority of socialism in this capitalist
what  socialism anyway?
"Well there was a, there was a debate  or something and that's when the committee"
"Erm  I'm not sh w w well would you really have, have, have worried about that at the time?getting out of feudalism  then why  exactly how you're gonna go from there."
"I mean as long you are going  in a way which is setting up  getting through to socialism as soon as possible, I'm not sure  there would be any point in thinking  about those issues until you've got a bit further."
"I mean I'm, I  I dunno."
"I was just, I mean  did they really believe that  it would, it would just lead straight on to socialism?"
"I, I, I think they probably believed that, that, that the best way to get into socialism was to begin to create socialist elements from the start, that would facilitate the move  erm  and once you'd got full control, I mean this is where, where there might be kind of bits  you can say that once, once  we, we need to make these assurances to get us out of feudalism."
"Once we, once we are out of feudalism and once we have political control we can dictate wherever we want to go  and once we've got full control  we will go into socialism."
"But as of, as of nineteen forty eight forty nine, if you'd said  you'd gone into a village, right you guys we're going into socialism, we are gonna create  collective farming  the peasants would have said no."
"Erm   right the open show  fifty nine ninety five for the hire of the hall, much the same as last year, it's keeping pretty well down  er, it's, we paid fifty three eighty last year, but I think because  little bit for a longer time this year."
"Erm  the judges, seventy five  er  and that's ten pound less than last year, maybe because we're struggling to get judges  forty two pound for the trophies  erm    er, fifteen pound for the fish tank  and plates at seventy five forty seven, crisps, eight seventy eight, which we struggled to sell  we think you could sell crisps but we had a struggle."
"Postage, stationery, fourteen O six  raffle tickets, eleven pound, making a total of two thirty twenty six  as against on the other side the income, three ninety six  so we made a hundred and sixty six pound on  on the open show  which is a great  increase on last year because last year we only made  twelve pounds something  twelve pound and a penny we made last year, so this is a great increase."
"the coach to   the breeders' evening  that's what I mentioned before, we paid for the refreshments and the rent  show secretary has only claimed two pounds which is a scandal really  she's probably paid twenty out, twenty pounds"
Yeah  I think so cos she's sitting here smiling.
So Joe doesn't get so many mushy peas.
"Er  champion of champions  we've, I bought some prizes for the champion of champions, and food  er  just to go with the trophies  er Keith  again was our judge and erm  knowing that he doesn't  willingly accept money, he wants to come and do it for nothing  erm  how many proposed that we  buy him something  a bottle to take with him, so we bought him a bottle of wine to take with him and er  that was the three pound."
So that gives us a total  expenditure of seven eighty seven sixty two for the year  and that leaves us with a balance  er of the year and that's nine ninety eight ninety nine pence.
"So we're exceedingly well off really  for the size of the club  and my trip to  Amazon, up the Amazon collecting fish gets nearer and nearer"
Gets nearer every day  You wouldn't get
Erm
"very far on a thousand pound though, would you?"
"Well as I say  I mean we're doing very well  and all the money  and, and you know, ninety percent of the money comes out of the  the er  the members' pockets really  I mean ev even the sub for the open show, we put out a lot of that  even  the stuff  and things like this, so we do provide an awful lot of money."
"Er  we haven't used very much of it this year  I mean I think er  I mentioned a few weeks ago the, the  question of trips out  perhaps in the spring to do fish  and that, we could consider  er  we don't want to just go er  accumulating money for the sake of it  erm, we want to get some benefit out of the money we've got."
"Erm  we may of course go to  Bowness next year  if the circumstances change and we can manage it  that will course cost a fair amount of money  but that remains to be seen, we'll have to wait and see how the club progresses during the year  whether we think we can do it ."
"Right, any questions?"
No?
We don't  them.
We don't  with thousand pound in his back pocket  can't be bad.
"It's coming to the stage soon when we'll have to put it in a building society, get some interest on it."
"I mean  sh shame in the banks  I mean we don't get charges any charges from this bank, I mean if, if you er  put it in some banks you get interest  charge you on your cheques and all sorts of things, it, it's as broad as it's long usually  but er  I mean we are gonna accumulate money, I don't think we should accumulate very much more now, we, we've ample funds for everything we need  er  but it's a question"
"But it's just lying in the bank dormant and it's not making any interest  I know it's not being, I know we're not being charged but"
Trouble is
"building society, I don't know  they do it."
"Maybe you could  the only way we could do it is  er a joint account  and that would be have to be based on trust  you know, a mutual trust between er y your two main people  er y you would just have to trust them  erm  nobody, how do members feel about if you"
That's true.
"Well it's a  and stuff like that, I mean"
But I mean I
the reason I propose  giving   he has to do is come
It's embarrassing.
"and sometimes he, he, he feels it be putting on those"
Yes  yes  and he's such a nice man and he does it so willingly if he can.
"However, because of the way it relates in this work, they are only fifty percent present in my sibling, so any sacrifice of gene me er, it's not my actual inquest for your finding of the problems, the reason is, this is something we did last term  in, in penaltriusm theory, so the others have got an advantage over you, they've already done it this time."
"I'm, I'm not surprised that, erm, you're erm,you you're having problems with it."
"But, it, it ba it's basically the penaltriusm idea that, for example, supposing I sacrifice my life, saving three of my siblings, okay?"
Yeah.
"I lose my life, so a hundred percent of my genes for altruism are wiped out."
Yeah.
"But, I've saved three siblings."
Now each of my siblings has fifty percent of my genes.
"So a hundred and fifty percent of my genes for altruism are saved in three siblings, compared to one hundred percent lost in me."
That's a net gain for gene for altruism.
"Therefore it would be selected, cos that's what natural selection is."
More copies of original.
"So the point I'm making is that  offspring will be prepared to make sacrifices under those conditions, where erm, the R is greater than C. But parents will want offspring to make sacrifices, wherever B is greater than C, and the parent is not concerned with the discount parameter R, but agreed on relatedness, because parents are equally related through their offspring ."
"So any sacrifice by an offspring, that results in a net gain in reproductive success, is good news for the parent."
Because obviously the parents' got genes in all its offspring.
Can you see that?
Yes.
"It's counter  see you, the reason, the reason that this seems difficult to understand at first is we're not used to thinking of it that way."
"And the reason is normally we look at human relationships from one point of view or another, or assume that perspectives are the same, but clearly they're not the same, the perspective of an offspring is not the same as the perspective of, of the parent."
"That was  's basic insight, and it's a very important one."
"As I have said, I'll go over it in the, in the lecture in more detail, but this is key insight."
So does everybody see it now?
"Or at least got hold of the basic  as I have said, the best way to do this, is to sit down with a piece of pencil and paper and work it out yourself."
"Try and do the sums as it were and think it through, and if you do that, I think you'll see that er, it does work out this way  And of course, it gets er, even worse if you consider questions like relatedness through parents, because clearly I may be related to my mother's sister's children, my cousins, er no it's actually nieces, because my mother and her sister share genes, but I'm not er necessarily related erm in the same way, erm, through er, my father's er relatives, for example , because although erm, because my er, my, my relationship between mother's kin and my father's kin is purely through marriage, so they have no joint genetic relatedness."
"So, although I am genetically related to my mother's brother's, or my mother's siblings' children or my father's siblings' children, the fact is, the siblings of both groups are genetically related to each other."
"And that produces further conflict, because the parents now take a different view."
The parents now who they're related to.
But their relatedness is not the same as the child.
"For example, my father is not related to my mother's er sister's children."
"Normally, if we assume, you know, completely non erm non-relatedness of marriage."
So my father doesn't have a kin altruistic interest in me being grouped to my mother's sister's children.
But my mother takes a very different view.
The association will be non party and non sectarian.
One.
"That we advocate the immediate implementation of the Scottish Old People's Chapter to strive to maintain and improve the standard of living of pensioners by ensuring that the pension will rise according to the cost of living or earnings, whichever is er is the most ad advantageous."
Two.
To press for the provision of suitable houses for old people at rents they can afford.
And social services as may be required to ensure the welfare of the aged as set out in the declaration of intent.
To this end we employ all constitutional means in cooperation with similar bodies on all questions affecting the welfare of pensioners .
"That's, that's our aim."
Aim and object of it.
"Where the,le let's say association was first formed on the thirteenth of February nineteen seven, nineteen thirty seven, so you can see by that date  fifty years an established national organization for the whole of Scotland."
What does the er the organization do?
The organiz er organization doing is er fighting in every place where we think that there are o old aged pensioners being in er imposed upon in any way.
"Whether it be welfare, gas bills, housing, you name it and we're in there fighting to, to keep them above the water, their heads above the water."
"You go on about erm some of the experience you've had, some of the  you've met."
"Well I  er er er I've occasionally  thing that was about last ye er year or the year before a as being a member of one of the, one of the lunch clubs."
"Er and er the Lothian region took over the lunch clubs when they took over er this two tier government in Scotland, you know?"
They took over the lunch clubs.
And immediately they started raising the prices of the lunch clubs.
"Well we were up there one time er at the Lothian region and we  to be up and tell that this was imposing higher things on, higher prices on both the bus buses, because they were raising the bus fares at the same time, and they were increasing the lunch club."
"Now the, the pensions when they raised at the same time, because we only  pension raised every year, and we're up there at that particular time at the Lothian region, a full council meeting."
And er we had told them that the q the quality of the food was reasonable.
But the quantity the quantity of the food being issued in lunch clubs was very very u even disgraceful.
I er er I  serve our people with quantity of food that's supposed to be meant to be a dinner for an old  old age person.
"And er they listened very carefully to us, in fact council of Kivanagh actually brought up a sample of the dinner they issued to old people and I, I did notice as soon as they put this sample on the table the opposition  the c Conservatives and they still are, their heads bowed."
They refused to look at it.
"And I would have thought that that was a disgraceful thing to do in a public, in the council  to a, a sample being brought up  and they were afraid to look at it."
"Their heads were actually downcast, they themselves were ashamed of it and yet they would not commit themselves to vote for it."
Will you tell me a little about the erm the campaigns you've  the erm the free erm travel on the buses
"Oh well the, the campaigns er I'm, I'm o I'm only speaking actually about the, down here in Leith  I started my campaign for er the er let's see,campaign for er introd reintroduction of free travel for the elderly."
"The campaign was supposed to start with,a away back in the beginning of September."
"Well I by good luck have had some copies of the petition sent down to me, so I started it, it immediately and I had in the first  they made over one thousand one hundred and twenty five signatures."
In the first day.
"Now you think about News at Ten, bong, you get the headlines"
yeah
"and you get the headlines, and so it prepares you it emotionally prepares you for what's coming."
"Give you headlines and then they start and they go they expand on each headline, don't they?"
"And then at the end they give you the headlines again, they summarise it."
"Absolutely, and it does because it a it what Dave says it's an emotional whole and you start off and you come back to where you started."
"It's a whole a complete, and so it it emotionally prepares with the headlines, tell them what you're gonna tell them then you tell them it and then it satisfies them by coming back to where you started."
So in other words it's about an introduction  an expansion and an end  Now as I've said tomorrow I'll fill in a bit more detail on those so if you leave some some gaps there between those three sections.
So an introduction
"Do you remember what I said about the the er structured thought pattern you've now got in front of you, let me go to mine which is all blank."
The introduction is good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is  I'd like to talk to you about flying and I hope to persuade you to come along on Saturday and take part in some flying.
"And I'm going to talk to you about three things about the safety of flying, about the cost aspects of flying and the enjoyment that you're going to get out of it when you take part."
"And that's my introduction, I've told you what I'm gonna tell you."
"And then expand on it, and so I go into each of these and I go to the  and I say a few words about each of these particular themes."
I won't go all through that again.
"And when I've expanded and I've told you then I then come back to my ending and I say, okay so what I've done I've told you about three aspects of flying, about the safety of it,ab about the costs involved in taking part in flying and about the enjoyment you're gonna get out of flying and I hope that I've persuaded you that you will come along  on Saturday to take part, and that's the ending."
So it's use the red obviously the title and the red's for your introduction to say what you're going to say then say it by using your greens and then say what you've said by going back to the red and coming back to your objective.
Now coming back to the objective I say it leaves you on a high note then rather than the  and that's all I'm gonna say  tell them what you're gonna tell them then tell them then tell them what you've told them.
Okay?
So that in a nutshell is is what it's about.
"So you've all got your structured thought pattern now, yeah?"
yeah
"Right, erm three minutes again so you can spot your timing now, it's under a minute on each of those red things because you've got your introduction and your ending as well, okay?"
"So three minutes, set the clock again as you did before and er one other thing I'd like you to do is as you come up is do something that athletes do huh and that is to er give an affirmation."
Now you may see athletes you know when you see the Olympics there's the the lady with er erm
javelin
"javelin, thank you, there's the lady with the javelin"
then you see or somebody you know looking at the long jump and they're muttering away to themselves.
Well there're not normally saying will you get out the way before I throw this thing or I'll stab you with it.
What they're actually doing is they're affirming to themselves they're verbalising the performance improvement or the performance they're going to give.
"Remember I asked you this morning to just  just after lunch to jot down what it was that you need to improve on just as you're setting the clock just say something like by the end of this talk I'd like you to congratulate me on having moved around a bit more having not put me hands in me pockets, whatever it might be."
Yeah so just an aff an affirmation of of what you intended.
"Now light, presumably erm one of the reasons one chooses a light year as a unit or a distance is because it's a convenient number, but also presumably because it doesn't change very much with any physical factor."
"I mean light is  travels at a pretty constant speed, doesn't it?"
That's right.
In fact the speed of light is now defined to be a constant.
So that's a good starting point.
Yes.
"You've talked about fairly large distances, distances that you couldn't possibly measure with tape measures and using normal methods of measurement, how on earth do you know these distances are the kind you describe?"
That's a very good question.
Light itself can be used as a sort of tape measure.
"For example, for distances within the solar system, distances to the planets and to the sun, we can use radar methods."
I think this is probably familiar to most people.
"A radar beam is one that you send out and it bounces off the thing you're trying to measure the distance of and then the beam comes back and is picked up again and you measure the time between the beam going out and the beam coming back, and that's twice the time it takes for the beam to get to the object and back again."
"So if you know how fast the beam is going, and that's in fact the speed of light, then you know how far away the object is, and you can do this for the planets."
It's been done for Venus and for Mercury about twenty years ago.
How accurately would you be able to make these measurements?
How confident are you that they are correct?
Quite remarkably accurate.
"The basic astronomical unit is, in fact, known to about one part in a million."
So that's radar.
"That'll get you a certain distance, but that pre-supposes you can actually bounce something back, doesn't it?"
That's right.
So what happens if you can't bounce something back?
"Well you can't use that method, and indeed radar can't be used outside the solar system."
"The next method that is used is a method which again is familiar to people on the earth — surveyors use it all the time — and that's what we call triangulation, and the idea there is that if you look at a distant object against an even more distant background, then the apparent direction will depend on where you're standing, and if you move from one end to the other of a baseline, then a distant steeple, for example, will appear to move against the hills on the horizon."
"But, Robert, we on earth must have a very small baseline compared with the big distances we're trying to measure?"
Oh yes.
I'm just trying to give you and idea of how the method works.
"Obviously you can't use any baseline that you can actually travel on foot from one end after the other, but we can use the astronomical unit itself as a baseline because the earth is moving round the sun."
It goes once round the sun every year.
"That's what we mean by the year, and at opposite sides of its orbit a nearby star, for example, will appear to be in different directions relative the background of very much fainter, more distant stars, and we can use that to see how far away it is."
"And that get us up to a certain distance, but even then that method must fail when you get beyond a certain distance."
Oh yes.
We've done this on the proposed East Oxford Education centre.
"I think we can very usefully do this, and iron our way to this."
What we need from you is really a specific proposal about the kinds of groups and individuals that you want us to sit down with.
"You can either do that now, or we can agree in principle that we will take this up."
"Perhaps chair, vice chair, and opposition liaison member if you feel that's suitable."
And call such a meeting.
"I think it will a long way, but you're quite to draw it to us, and to ask us to set out on that road."
Michael?
"Yes, chair."
What sort of people would you involve in this meeting.
"I mean there's a lot of voluntary organisations who are working in this field, I don't know how you would just make sure you got them all."
The resources are pitifully small.
"I mean, I'm involved in doing some statistics for Windmill House, the probation service, and we've found that the sixteen-to-eighteen-year-old provision in the city is very, very small."
I'm sure it's the same for many of the other groups who've got problems.
"But, erm I hope you involve all those sort of organisations in your discussions."
"I would imagine that Shereen would apply the same kind of pattern as you did to the de-toxification centre meeting, Shereen, and I felt that there were a great many people there, a great many interested, including the voluntary interest."
Betty?
"Well, of course, chair, a lot of these problems are arising out of the so-called ‘care in community’."
"I was hoping we'd avoid the political discussion, Betty."
"Well, you know, I mean."
We've a job to do here.
"Well, you know me, I don't normally become political, but let's face it, this is one of the direct results of throwing the money to the community without any after care, and I was particularly concerned, with my other hat on, only last week, that a young man told us his address was now the night shelter."
"Now, because his time at the Bridge had ended, he had nowhere else to go, except to the Nightshelter."
"Now, I thought that was quite inappropriate for a young man like him, who had nowhere else to go, so there are many, many multiple problems for people like this in this city, and anything we can do would be appreciated, but I really don't know where we would stop, there are so many problems."
"I would ask members to be brief, otherwise we shall actually lose matters off this agenda today."
"Liz, and then Patrick."
"Chair, can I suggest that some of the people who are actually involved in this are actually asked themselves rather than agencies that might be working with them, because I think that, that most of the, the sort of people we're talking about are actually very sensitive."
"And they know about what's happening to them, and know that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter about what their behaviour is, it doesn't matter about what happens to them, because nobody cares."
"And I think it's very, very important that they're involved."
"Through the Princes' Trust in the month we actually give grants to something like twenty people, just to get them off the street, because there was nowhere else they could turn to."
"And I think that there's a massive problem that needs to be addressed, and I think we should involve those people themselves, also in looking at what the issues are, it's all very well for people to decide, workers to think that they know what the issues are."
I very often think that that's not the case.
But why is mine slightly different to Howard's?
"You're wearing the summer shorty for greater freedom of movement for your arms and legs but Howard's got the full suit, for more protection in colder weather but they both work on the same principle."
"When the suit is wet, it traps a thin layer of water between the body and the suit and your body quickly warms that up to a comfortable working temperature but if you fall in when the suit is dry, the cold water can be quite a shock and so a good trick in cold weather is to put the wet suit on in a hot shower and then over the top you wear a spray suit again to keep off the wind and to protect the wetsuit."
"Right, so exactly what are you wearing?"
Well if you take this I'll explain.
The dry suit is great for winter sailing because you can wear lots of warm layers underneath and the suit keeps them completely dry by means of watertight seals at the wrists and the neck but you mustn't forget about the extremities either.
In summer you'll need a sun hat to keep the sun off and in winter don't forget that about a third of body heat is lost through the head so a warm woolly hat is great.
Bare feet are asking for trouble and so you need a pair of soft soled shoes which don't slip on the boat.
Is wearing one of these suits going to help me stay afloat in the water?
"No, you should always wear personal buoyancy when going afloat in a small sail boat."
"For larger boats a life jacket like this one is fine, particularly if you are going further offshore but it's too clumsy to wear in a small sail boat like the Topper and so we prefer the buoyancy aid like this one."
"So it's probably just as well that I didn't leap off in your boat because er even in this climate I, I could have ended up pretty cold and miserable especially if I'd fallen in."
"Well the thing is Howard, I don't think you'd have got very far if you hadn't understood how we put the boat together and so I think it's important that we look now into more detail at how to rig the Topper."
"It seems  have done that John's intent on making us a nation of master mariners and under these circumstances, I think I'll adopt the old maritime adage, women and children first, so I'll  it back, John can show you how to rig one of these things, alright, come on."
"Right Suzanne, now we're going to look at the various parts of the Topper and how they fit together."
Right.
We'll start with the hull
Mm.
"one piece unsinkable, all ready to go in the water."
Right.
"And we've got the files, the rudder and the daggerboard."
"Right, then I know  steer the boat, I'm not quite sure what the daggerboards are for."
That slots down into a hole in the middle of the boat but that just stops us drifting sideways.
Oh.
"Then we've got the rig, the mast comes in two parts, the boom, the sail and all the ropes to put them together."
And you're gonna show me exactly how it's been fixed together are you?
That's next.
"First of all we slide the top and the bottom of the mast together, lining up the red dots and then we touch the halyard."
"The end of the halyard goes through the end goes through the end fitting and then we tie a little stopper knot in the end, then we bring the other end of the halyard down and make it up tight on this crease at the bottom of the mast."
That holds the two halves of the mast together
Yes.
while we sleeve it into the sail.
So anything that the landlo er the rich peasant owns and works himself or cultivates by hired labour  you're going to allow to keep.
"And, over and above that, small portions of land rented out by rich peasants shall remain un untouched."
In certain special areas the land rented out by rich peasants may be requisitioned in part or in whole with the approval of the people's government at  level or above.
You  special permission to encroach on all of the  rich peasant's land he rents out.
Why do they use the word requisition instead of confiscate?
Does requisitioning have the same connotations as confiscation?
So they are  they're being harsher on landlords but on the rich peasants they're just taking back the land instead of
"requisition, if you're in the position say   then it's like it's for a common cause"
Mm.
if you take away some of the  land  confiscate's a punishment.
Yeah.
At the end of the day the effect is the same.
"So i it's another, well it may, the effect may be the same but it's another way of drawing distinctions between landlords and rich peasants and you are treating landlords differently from rich peasants."
And then the last  is if the portions of land rented out by rich peasants of a semi-landlord type exceed in size the land held by themselves and by their hired labour the land rented out shall be requisitioned.
"But that would seem to imply that only if a rich peasant rents out more land than he owns and works  either by himself or hired labour, he will be able to keep that  all."
"So a rich peasant will be able to keep all of the land he was working himself, all the land he was working by hired labour and land that he hired, er that he rented out as long as the amount he, he rented out did not exceed all of the land that he worked himself or  used hired labour."
Pretty generous position for rich peasants isn't it?
"That's not clear exactly what that last bit says cos it's not saying like you  all of the land they rent out, but I guess it just means the excess above which"
Right.
"I think if I was a rich peasant I would be using that to argue that you could take my rented land, it was"
Well so would I.
A leftist nut-case might
"Right, yeah but  fine."
"But I mean th there is, if, I mean , that is generous to rich peasants."
It also sort of encourages them to  farm as much land as they can to presumably rent more out.
Yeah.
Right.
"Land and other properties of middle peasants, including well to do middle peasants, shall be protected from infringement."
"So we, we, we're still working to middle peasants being able to earn twenty five or thirty percent of their income from exploitation, either hired labour or renting out land and we won't touch it at all."
"So the, the  the only land that we are taking in  is landlord land  and the land that rich peasants rent out over and above, if er in size larger than the land they are going to continue to work, either themselves or with hired labour."
"Er we're not, we're not touching middle peasants at all, they're sacrosanct."
"So they're still, they were still keeping to their aims of achieving greater equality, it was just not absolute equality  egalitarianism."
"Er the erm er fact of the matter was that er er as has been recorded by those less emotionally charged at that moment, I didn't flounce out of the cabinet."
I had made it quite clear
But you went on telly minutes later.
Oh there was a television camera as you left Downing Street .
You went to a press conference.
Er that was  four o'clock in the afternoon.
No no I mean the the I mean when I've g been drawn er down a road I don't intend to go
"No because the the point I'm trying to make is that it is unrealistic surely for the leader of the party to say to his MPs who aren't delegates after all, but who represent the interests of their constituencies, Shut up, come to me privately if you have any concerns."
That's not realistic is it .
"I I I think he said, First, to me privately."
"In other words, you talk it through, you try to resolve it."
Not dash for the television cameras.
That was the point that I heard him make  in Brighton.
"And and even there will come a time after the private dialogue, where he people have the right."
"I let me give you an example, I've always respected erm Teddy Taylor and John Biffen who have taken the extreme view on Europe."
"Er I think they genuinely believe their case, it's not a case that I believe, but I I've always genuinely respected them for the case they take."
Er so I I don't find it in my in myself to condemn people who as Conservatives take a different view to myself.
"But there has to be a degree of discretion, a degree of responsibility."
"And you cannot have a situation where the the sort of almost the norm is, Any difficult decision the government is gonna have to take, there'll be a dozen colleagues who say, not for us."
I mean I I just do not really understand whether people fully realize the gravity of the economic situation that we face.
"We're gonna have a very difficult set of decisions to take, they're gonna be tough, there's no other government would take these decisions."
"And there is a division within the party isn't there, a real ideological divide within the party over how to deal with that, whether to raise taxes, whether to cut spending further?"
Well this is the what I keep reading about the right left divide.
Well I didn't use that phrase but
First first No you didn't I mean no There's no reason why we shouldn't.
Er every party is a coalition.
"It consists of a whole range of interest groups, a whole range of people with great integrity, but approaching politics from a different point of view."
"And the only basis upon which you can l lead a party of that sort, is to find a pivot th where you around which you can coalesce."
"if ever you get to the stage where the left of the party or the right of the party, either extreme wing, feel that they've got such power, that they can pull the whole thing their way, the danger is that the bits at the other end will snap and that of course is the disunity danger which had absolutely devastated the Labour party, where the left did exactly that and the moderate centre That's if you can call it that, snapped off."
"For the Conservative party which is in essence a party of power, huge historic perspective, huge experience of power, ever to get itself in a position where it's perceived to be struggling to the point of self destruction, would have its political consequences and they would be dire."
"Let's look not so much at the left right divide, but but at the tone of the party."
"Some people say that since you've been away, and the conference illustrated this quite dramatically, particularly the fringe meetings."
In stronger winds the manoeuvre becomes a bit more lively and here it's a good idea to twig the mainsheet to help the boom come across.
There's lots of power in the sail all the time and so you will have to remain agile.
"Change hands, push to where you were sitting, crouch in the middle of the boat and straighten up on the new course."
Two last points before we leave gybing.
"Always check the area you are sailing into to allow for the time when you will be facing battlements but when you crouch in the middle of the boat, do keep an eye on the boom or you'll end up with a nasty bump on the head."
"By the time you've mastered gybing, you can sail in almost any direction and so it's now time to look at the five essentials for sailing well."
"Sail trips, maximum driving power from your route."
"Boat balance, keep the hull flat for maximum speed."
"Before and after trip keep the hull level, don't make waves."
"Daggerboard position, get the right compromise between drive and drag  course wave good, the shortest or fastest distance between two points."
Sail trim isn't simply a question of pulling everything in and forgetting about it as the sail works at its maximum at any one angle to the wind.
"On a beat, that is with the sheet pulled in tightly but as we turn on to a ridge you'll see that we have to ease the sheet out so that the sail stays at the same angle for the wind."
Again moving from a reach towards a rung the boat effectively turns underneath the rig and the sail stays at that same angle.
Boat balance is simply a question of matching the heeling effect of the wind and the sail with your body weight.
"As the wind tries to tip the boat over, so you counter that effect by sitting out."
The aim is to keep the boat flat at all times so that it glides cleanly over the water.
In light weather you either keep the boat upright or heel it very slightly away from the wind so that gravity helps to fill the sail.
When the boat has heeled too far it tries to turn up into the wind and a lot of rudder movement is needed to keep it straight.
"That rudder movement equals braking and so it's slowing you down, it may look impressive being heeled over like this but I'd sail a lot faster if the boat were flat."
"Let's look at that again, when the boat's heeled over that rudder movement causes a lot of turbulence and that's just slowing you down."
"For an off trip is much the same, the idea is to keep the boat flat with the bow skimming slowly across the water without too much bow wave and the water leaving the stern very cleanly."
Again without too much turbulence.
The most common beginner's mistake is to sit too far aft in the boat and that causes a great wrist a tail of  to come up from the trunk .
A far less common problem but one which is much more dramatic is if you put your weight too far forward.
"Not only will this make the boat difficult to steer but if you try doing it too far, you'll start sailing straight under water."
Now for the daggerboard position.
The purpose of the daggerboard is to stop the boat drifting sideways.
"When we're sailing downwind, the wind is simply pushing the boat forward and there's no sideways force, so we don't need the daggerboard."
"We could lift it right out but it's easier just to lift it until it's just below the level of the boom, so that it doesn't foul it when we're gybing."
When beating the sideways force of the wind is at a maximum and so we need the daggerboard right down to get a good grip on the water and stop the boat drifting sideways.
"When reaching it's a compromise between those two extremes, halfway up and halfway down."
"Now to see just how effective a daggerboard is, let's look at these two boats beating."
Or do we dump it?
"What tends to happen is that domestic agricultural production has already been subsidized, alright, it's subsidized again, only to, to be sold on the world market."
"The world market becomes a residual, a residual market as a result, erm, you know, because we're dumping cheap products, you know, and the, the only way we can sell European grain right is to, is to undercut the world market."
"Now, because we're a major player in, in grain markets and most other markets, the European Community, increasing its supply on the world market will have a non-trivial effect on price."
"Prices will come down, right."
"Erm  that's what we observe, is that protectionism leads to a lowering of world, world prices."
What about the volatility?
Does protectionism have an affect on volatility do you think?
"Right, think of it like this, if, if all countries of the world, right, engage in free trade, there is no protection."
Alright.
"Then, the world market, alright, is, is the, is the world, is the world market."
"Everybody trades through this, through this world, world market."
"As a result, if there's a say, bad weather in the northern hemisphere affecting supply, right, that may well be offset by good weather, or average weather in the southern hemisphere, right."
"As a result, erm, prices won't be quite as volatile as they are in the opposite case, alright, when the world market, and virtually nobody, let's assume that virtually nobody uses the world market to trade in, they've all got their own agricultural policies, right, just a few countries trade in the world market, it only takes erm, a, a sort of poor harvest, or a very good harvest in any one of these erm, er, sort of protected countries, in order to get rid of this output, they'll put it on the world market."
"Because the world market is very, very tiny now, because nobody uses it, that will have a massive effect on, on world prices."
"So what you tend to observe is that when protectionism, when everybody protects, or when a lot of people protects, the world market erm, becomes a sink right, for any excess production."
"Right, it becomes a residual market, right."
"You know, if you can't sell it at home, you know, you get rid of it on the world market."
"Now, if the world market is very small, then  The term world market is a bit of a misnomer when er, when most countries protect."
"The world market becomes very, very volatile and er, so protectionism tends to lead to erm, to price volatility and this is one reason why agricultural markets are so volatile."
"Right, it's, it's because world markets are residual markets because there's so much agricultural protectionism."
Okay.
"Right,erm, why bother, why bother about agricultural trade?"
"Marlon, why're we all het up about, about agricultural protectionism?"
What are we going to live on?
Sorry?
"If we don't live off agricultural trade, what are we going to live on?"
We have to keep the track all turned on.
"I mean, vital to life"
"Well  yes, but it only represents two percent of G D P in this country it's, it's insignificant."
"Ah, that's the thing, it's not insignificant."
"Because if you stop agricultural production, you're going to be in big trouble."
Why aren't women more angry?
"Because it's a feminine trait that women are, on the whole, far erm less easily aroused into combat."
erm and
Well Barbara's shaking her head again .
She disagrees with everything you've said on this programme.
"Yes, I mean, I feel very strongly in terms of women's rights, but I think there are obviously a lot of differences between women and you can't generalize women, the same as you can't generalize individual personalities traits on  for men."
"I mean gender is one issue, but it's not the only one, and one of the ones that it seems to me that we've missed out on erm to date, when we're talking about International Women's Day, is race."
"I mean we've talked only about  about women; we've maybe touched on class, and we've not even mentioned the position of black women and the extra discrimination that they face in our society, and in other societies."
erm I
Well how would you characterize that discrimination as extra?
What's the extra dimension?
"Well the evidence is that they will erm much more likely to be in poverty, much more likely to suffer ill-health, their children are much more likely to be erm to have childhood diseases."
"There is an increasing discrimination on my view because of the racism that exists as well as the sexism that exists within our society, and when you say why don't women do more, the odds against women, particularly black or working class women, are very heavy."
"erm we have to continually fight, but to say we have to fight as well for our children and that is, in many ways, you know, the odds start off being stacked against us in my view erm and it is a continual battle."
"Women do need to become much more political, because the rules are defined by men and politics, as in fact has just been pointed out, are defined by men, in subtle ways as well a structural ways, and one of the subtle or not so subtle ways is in fact to insist that parliaments starts that ten o'clock in the morning"
"Yes, that's right."
and who looks after the children?
"Ten o'clock in the evening, sorry."
"That would make a tremendous difference to the opportunities for women to go into parliament, and the kind of women you're talking about."
"It would make it not just a dream, it would make it something that actually was possible to achieve."
"At the moment if you talk to women, the women you've been talking about, about going into parliament, I mean it's a laugh, isn't it?"
"And that's what we've got to change, because they're the sort of women we need coming into parliament."
They're the sort of women who are needed to make the real changes.
"Ann Mobbs, why aren't women much more angry than they appear to be?"
Or maybe I'm misreading them; maybe they are; maybe they're about to boil over.
"I think a lot of women are very angry about erm the way they're treated by society really erm but it's interesting, isn't it, that the kind of erm jobs that erm women have?"
"I mean with this exhibition that we've booked ‘Just the Job’, which is black women erm and the kind of jobs that they've got, a large percentage are carers and erm  and it is the thing that erm women feel that they can do and it erm in a way that it comes out of their role in the home, the caring role, and erm and it's a role that they get sort of erm trapped into and it doesn't pay very much money, as Brenda was saying earlier."
Mhm.
"And one of the reasons why the black women in Liverpool put this exhibition together erm and they tried to pick out different kinds of jobs that women had to show that black women could do those jobs, and they were saying look, there's lots of stereotypes erm about the kinds of jobs that black and Asian women can do that fit in with their personalities, and you know the world is wide open and you are able to do this and you don't have to be erm a singer or a model or erm or erm erm a runner, you know, the whole stereotypes in terms of what black people are good at and they're saying let's break away from this, let's show the kinds of things that we can do and we can do anything that we set our minds to and erm the exhibition is very positive, actually."
It's very nice.
"Well, let's talk about a positive erm approach to this, maybe next year at this time."
What will be different?
So we've got
Er yeah  that's a good one isn't it?
"Just as if , if we are in a sort, team leader or a section head as I've shown, it doesn't mean to say that we hold all the knowledge, we can pass it on to others, who can he pass it on to somebody else  although you ultimately may be responsible for the training of other people, you don't need to do it all yourself do you, but unless you pass on skills, you're gonna make a sort of a quite a vicious circle for yourself aren't ya?"
Yeah.
And how does training do that?
We all like to get things right don't we?
We all like to think we can do things and we can do things well.
It actually helps our morale doesn't it and it sort of helps our confidence.
"I don't know about you, but if I had to sort of pass something on to somebody else to check, if I can see somebody scribbling on it, I, I, I, I feel quite edgy, I hate it, I like to feel that I can do it and I can do it well and that other people don't need to have to amend it."
"There have been a lot of studies done with regard to morale and job satisfaction and it has been shown that, that if people are well trained, they feel a lot more loyalty towards the company cos they feel that somebody's actually taking responsibility for their training and development."
How does that help us in the outside world if people know that we  we give good training?
Yeah we attract a better class of candidate don't we?
"People hear within the market place that, that we give good training, that we do develop people and it does attract good people to join us doesn't it, whereas very few people want to join a company where you go nowhere, where you're not given any training you stay in the same job for ten years and it does nothing for you."
Most of us like to feel that we can join in and we can progress if we want to.
Any others?
If any decided
Yeah.
Yeah.
"We need to sort of plan we need to grow people, develop people."
"Otherwise if we don't invest money and time in training, we're forced to have to go outside to sort of buy in people, because we haven't actually invested in them."
. Any more?
I think those are the  those are the key things that we want to put across really.
"I think the other thing is is about erm   flexible as well, we've got a flexible workforce."
"If people are well trained, you've got lots of people in turn you know when you've got absenteeism or holidays, you've got lots of people who could be slotted to different positions for you and obviously the better trained people are, it does help with the  talent, it makes you more flexible and you've got more people who can possibly go for certain jobs."
"Awful lot of reasons why training i is so important to us an and basically it simply all comes back to our  statement isn't it,it it's to be a sort of feeding insurer to give unsurpassed service."
I mean th there's no way we could do that unless we've got well trained staff.
"We can't compete on the basis, we can't project the profession  if people aren't well trained and people are making  slow and the only way we can overcome that is by taking the time to train people."
"And on a more le local level you're quite right  the better trained people there are, the more they, the happier they feel  the more  work they have, the more job satisfaction they have."
"There is a direct correlation between morale, motivation, job satisfaction and absenteeism and staff turnover, if people are happy they generally want to stay for us they're much more loyal and work harder and  when we're managing an area it becomes a lot easier because we are not having to, people are well trained they do the things right first time, you're not having to correct their mistakes."
"So training is  is essential really, it's fundamental."
"In fact we'll move on quickly now to have a look at, we've looked at why it's so important."
If we spend one or two minutes just thinking about whose responsibility is training?
The one on the left raises the daggerboard and immediately starts to sag off away from the wind.
He is still trying to sail the same course but the boat is just sliding sideways across the water.
"Course made good, means sailing where you want to go as effectively as possible."
"The first thing is to remember is that no daggerboard is completely efficient and so if you try aiming for a goal point, you'll actually end up slightly downwind because the boat would have drifted sideways."
The way to overcome this is to sail slightly high of your intended course and you'll end up in the right place.
This effect is most pronounced when you're beating.
Sailing upwind involves tacking and here you have a wide choice of routes to reach your windward goal point.
You could reach it in two tacks or in many more.
"The route you actually take will be influenced by things like the tide, obstacles like shallow water or other boats and by wind shifts and wind shadows from the land."
"All other things being equal, the most direct route is the best."
"Sailing downwind it seems most logical to head straight for your goal point but in fact, particularly in stronger winds, sailing  downwind can be slightly uncomfortable."
It's better to sail two oblique courses to get down there but this if you choose where to gybe to reach your goal point.
Launching with an offshore wind is a straightforward process.
"First simply lift the boat into the water but don't let go at this point because you'll find that the boat will drift faster than you can swim after it, then you lift the daggerboard here, halfway down because you'll be sailing off wind."
Then lower the rudder for control when you're sailing away and gather the tiller and mainsheet in one hand.
Step in gently and push the boom out to help the boat turn away from the wind.
"As the boat picks up speed, so you can settle gently into the boat to gain control."
"That's it, you're away into deep water and sailing happily."
Returning in an offshore wind is slightly more complicated as you have to beat back towards the beach.
"Look ahead to choose where you want to land and try to judge the depth of water, raising the daggerboard as you come into shallower water."
Make allowance for the fact that you'll be drifting sideways more with the daggerboard up but as you come into shallow water then you can raise the rudder and step ashore.
"Then you can lift the rudder completely, take the daggerboard out and lift, not drag, the boat ashore."
Taking it far enough up the beach so that it doesn't blow away again.
Launching with an onshore wind demands a positive approach.
Walk the boat out until the water is deep enough for you to put the daggerboard down far enough so that you'll be able to sail away.
"Push the rudder down, prepare everything because if you get it wrong you'll be straight back on the beach again and then climb in and sail away."
"Choose the tack which takes you most directly offshore and when you're clear, and only then, it's time to worry about the technique by getting the daggerboard the rest of the way down and sailing efficiently."
Returning with an onshore wind is potentially the most spectacular of the lot.
If you don't do something you'll sail straight up the beach and rip the bottom out of the boat.
"So as you come in raise the daggerboard, lift the rudder and then when you come into shallow water, turn the boat up towards the wind to lose power for the sail and stop before you hit those rocks."
"Then as before, step out to the shallow water, lift out the daggerboard, raise the rudder completely and lift the boat ashore."
"Now we've covered the basic techniques of sailing, the best way of putting them into practice is by sailing round the triangular course and so I've laid out these three marks."
yes
Look directly at them
Well yeah that's eye contact
Well well done  thank you
I got it with the fourth one
Yeah that's right that's right you were just waiting for me to say Tom weren't you yes yes that's fine.
And some of you some of you did that this morning although you may not have realised it er but you said well well like Rob said and er just just making people feel part of it by by using their names and that's exactly the purpose of having these plaques in front and why I asked you to to use erm to put your name on them is so that we can do that.
So that we can use people's names as part of the presentation and yeah yeah you know he actually noticed what I said and that sort of thing.
So they feel really part of er part of it.
Sometimes I've er   Okay so it seems like it seems like a terrific amount to think about while you're standing here doesn't it as well as thinking about what you're actually the content of what you're actually going to say.
But a lot of these things come quite naturally er I hope we'll see on when we look at the video that really I don't think anybody had a major problem with the voice er and the words as well when you're talking about two million pounds  so in terms of the voice I don't believe anybody has any major problems.
There may be one or two when we might just say well perhaps just a little bit more volume but it's not perhaps just er slacken off on the pace a little bit.
So I don't think in terms of paralinguistics anybody here has a major problem.
"But when we come to look at the cluster and the and the audience contact then then you know we may see something a little bit different, Okay but er those are the important aspects things like things like whoops the use of the hands you know several people put their hands in their pockets or put them behind their back or something like that."
Now that is you know what do you do with these things I mean they're a nuisance when it comes to making a presentation.
The secret I find and you may over the next day or day and a half to a couple of days you may well see me just do that occasionally I'll just throw my hands back down to me side.
"If they get in if they start getting in the way the best thing to do is just let them relax to the side and try and forget about them, I know it's difficult to forget about them but just to the conscious effort with the hands is just to put them at the side."
Then as you start to make the point you'll find your hands will come up naturally and bend from the elbows it sounds crazy to say  but if if you suddenly go coo I've got everything in me pocket but
"Just do that that, that's what I find is the best thing to do and then carry on with what you have to say and then the gestures become quite natural because all of this this is is not I'm not trying to"
six pairs of opposites and then expanded by  Okay now that that's fine but how do you move on and where do you move on to in order to get that structured thought pattern?
If you're going to come and stand and present something to somebody there's got to be a reason for it?
"Yes, there must be be a reason and as I'm sure, I mean like like the objective, and then what you can do at this stage in the design process is once you've got the objective then you select those themes or ideas from your what you've done just now to support that objective, so that when you come up my objective is to convince you or my objective is to inform you then the information that you're going to give out supports that objective."
So one thing that was mentioned this morning was somebody wanted to be able to be more persuasive in order to put a point of view across.
If you can clearly state what your objective is what you're trying to persuade the audience to then everything you say supports that and you stand a better chance of being persuasive.
Yes?
"It seems fairly obvious, so what do we do?"
Well we've got to select a number of themes to support a given objective.
How many themes do we select?
So what you've got there is a mass of you've got six twelve words on the first circle and then you've got twenty four words on the outer circle are you gonna dump all that information on to the audience to try and persuade them of your objective?
"There's only so much that anybody's brain can handle at any one time so let's just do a little experiment because there was a chap called George Miller an American psychologist who worked on this idea of what is the capacity of the brain, how many bits of information can the brain hold on to at any given time."
If you turn to page eight  what's that John?
"I'm useless at this,"
"DAMON AND PYTHIAS Mrs. Bhaer was right ; peace was only a temporary lull , a storm was brewing , and two days after Bess left , a moral earthquake shook Plumfield to its centre ."
"Tommy 's hens were at the bottom of the trouble , for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs , he could not have sold them and made such sums ."
"Money is the root of all evil , and yet it is such a useful root that we can not get on without it any more than we can without potatoes ."
"Tommy certainly could not , for he spent his income so recklessly , that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank , and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice , with the name over the door , and a tall chimney , down which the pennies were to go , there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of trap-door in the floor ."
"The house increased in weight so rapidly , that Tommy soon became satisfied with his investment , and planned to buy unheard-of treasures with his capital ."
"He kept account of the sums deposited , and was promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars , on condition that he spent the money wisely ."
"Only one dollar was needed , and the day Mrs. Jo paid him for four dozen eggs , he was so delighted , that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat , who was also laying by money for the long-desired violin ."
"`` I wish I had 'em to put with my three dollars , then I 'd soon get enough to buy my fiddle , '' he said , looking wistfully at the money ."
`` P'raps I 'll lend you some .
"I have n't decided yet what I 'll do with mine , '' said Tommy , tossing up his quarters and catching them as they fell ."
`` Hi !
boys !
come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dan 's got ! ''
called a voice from behind the barn .
"`` Come on , '' said Tommy ; and , laying his money inside the old winnowing machine , away he ran , followed by Nat ."
"The snake was very interesting , and then a long chase after a lame crow , and its capture , so absorbed Tommy 's mind and time , that he never thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night ."
"`` Never mind , no one but Nat knows where it is , '' said the easy-going lad , and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property ."
"Next morning , just as the boys assembled for school , Tommy rushed into the room breathlessly , demanding , `` I say , who has got my dollar ? ''"
`` What are you talking about ? ''
asked Franz .
"Tommy explained , and Nat corroborated his statement ."
"Every one else declared they knew nothing about it , and began to look suspiciously at Nat , who got more and more alarmed and confused with each denial ."
"`` Somebody must have taken it , '' said Franz , as Tommy shook his fist at the whole party , and wrathfully declared that , `` By thunder turtles !"
"if I get hold of the thief , I 'll give him what he wo n't forget in a hurry . ''"
"`` Keep cool , Tom ; we shall find him out ; thieves always come to grief , '' said Dan , as one who knew something of the matter ."
"`` May be some tramp slept in the barn and took it , '' suggested Ned ."
"`` No , Silas do n't allow that ; besides , a tramp would n't go looking in that old machine for money , '' said Emil , with scorn ."
`` Was n't it Silas himself ? ''
said Jack .
"`` Well , I like that !"
Old Si is as honest as daylight .
"You would n't catch him touching a penny of ours , '' said Tommy , handsomely defending his chief admirer from suspicion ."
I 'm sorry on your account ; but you need n't say a word at the cranky places .
I 'll do all the talking ... Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to .
Mrs. Lynde does n't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not .
"She inclines to , when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it ; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it ."
So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde 's eyes .
"Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting , and I expect it will be good , for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family ."
I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla 's aunt .
It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote ` Edgewood Days ' and ` The Rosebud Garden . ' ''
`` Where does Mrs. Morgan live ? ''
`` In Toronto .
"And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer , and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her ."
That seems almost too good to be true -- but it 's something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed . ''
The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact .
"Gilbert Blythe was president , Fred Wright vice-president , Anne Shirley secretary , and Diana Barry treasurer ."
"The `` Improvers , '' as they were promptly christened , were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members ."
"It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season ; but they meant to plan the next summer 's campaign , collect and discuss ideas , write and read papers , and , as Anne said , educate the public sentiment generally ."
"There was some disapproval , of course , and ... which the Improvers felt much more keenly ... a good deal of ridicule ."
Mr. Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club .
Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums .
Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society .
Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill .
Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed .
Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows .
"Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane , an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory , if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it ."
"In spite of ... or perhaps , human nature being what it is , because of ... this , the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall ."
"At the second meeting , in the Barry parlor , Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle and paint the hall ; Julia Bell seconded it , with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike ."
"Gilbert put the motion , it was carried unanimously , and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes ."
"The next thing was to appoint a committee , and Gertie Pye , determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels , boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee ."
"This motion being also duly seconded and carried , Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee , along with Gilbert , Anne , Diana , and Fred Wright ."
The committee chose their routes in private conclave .
"Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road , Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road , and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road ."
"`` Because , '' explained Gilbert to Anne , as they walked home together through the Haunted Wood , `` the Pyes all live along that road and they wo n't give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them . ''"
"`` We 'll try , '' promised Cyrilla with dancing eyes ."
When the door closed behind Mrs. Plunkett the three girls looked at each other .
"`` Cyrilla , that idea of yours was a really truly inspiration , '' said Carol solemnly ."
"`` I believe it was , '' said Cyrilla , thinking of Miss Marshall ."
Dorinda 's Desperate Deed Dorinda had been home for a whole wonderful week and the little Pages were beginning to feel acquainted with her .
"When a girl goes away when she is ten and does n't come back until she is fifteen , it is only to be expected that her family should regard her as somewhat of a stranger , especially when she is really a Page , and they are really all Carters except for the name ."
"Dorinda had been only ten when her Aunt Mary -- on the Carter side -- had written to Mrs. Page , asking her to let Dorinda come to her for the winter ."
"Mrs. Page , albeit she was poor -- nobody but herself knew how poor -- and a widow with five children besides Dorinda , hesitated at first ."
"She was afraid , with good reason , that the winter might stretch into other seasons ; but Mary had lost her own only little girl in the summer , and Mrs. Page shuddered at the thought of what her loneliness must be ."
"So , to comfort her , Mrs. Page had let Dorinda go , stipulating that she must come home in the spring ."
"In the spring , when Dorinda 's bed of violets was growing purple under the lilac bush , Aunt Mary wrote again ."
"Dorinda was contented and happy , she said ."
Would not Emily let her stay for the summer ?
Mrs. Page cried bitterly over that letter and took sad counsel with herself .
"To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for the summer really meant , she knew , to let her stay altogether ."
Mrs. Page was finding it harder and harder to get along ; there was so little and the children needed so much ; Dorinda would have a good home with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother heart to give her up .
In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for the summer -- and Dorinda had never been home since .
"But now Dorinda had come back to the little white house on the hill at Willowdale , set back from the road in a smother of apple trees and vines ."
"Aunt Mary had died very suddenly and her only son , Dorinda 's cousin , had gone to Japan ."
"There was nothing for Dorinda to do save to come home , to enter again into her old unfilled place in her mother 's heart , and win a new place in the hearts of the brothers and sisters who barely remembered her at all ."
Leicester had been nine and Jean seven when Dorinda went away ; now they were respectively fourteen and twelve .
"At first they were a little shy with this big , practically brand-new sister , but this soon wore off ."
Nobody could be shy long with Dorinda ; nobody could help liking her .
"She was so brisk and jolly and sympathetic -- a real Page , so everybody said -- while the brothers and sisters were Carter to their marrow ; Carters with fair hair and blue eyes , and small , fine , wistful features ; but Dorinda had merry black eyes , plump , dusky-red cheeks , and a long braid of glossy dark hair , which was perpetually being twitched from one shoulder to another as Dorinda whisked about the house on domestic duties intent ."
"In a week Dorinda felt herself one of the family again , with all the cares and responsibilities thereof resting on her strong young shoulders ."
"Dorinda and her mother talked matters out fully one afternoon over their sewing , in the sunny south room where the winds got lost among the vines halfway through the open window ."
Mrs. Page sighed and said she really did not know what to do .
"Dorinda did not sigh ; she did not know just what to do either , but there must be something that could be done -- there is always something that can be done , if one can only find it ."
Dorinda sewed hard and pursed up her red lips determinedly .
"`` Do n't you worry , Mother Page , '' she said briskly ."
`` We 'll be like that glorious old Roman who found a way or made it .
I like overcoming difficulties .
"`` I came back for my mother , '' he explained , `` to take her to the Neverland . ''"
"`` Yes , I know , '' Jane said , `` I have been waiting for you . ''"
"When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously , while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy ."
"`` She is my mother , '' Peter explained ; and Jane descended and stood by his side , with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him ."
"`` He does so need a mother , '' Jane said ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"Wendy admitted rather forlornly ; `` no one knows it so well as I. '' `` Good-bye , '' said Peter to Wendy ; and he rose in the air , and the shameless Jane rose with him ; it was already her easiest way of moving about ."
Wendy rushed to the window .
"`` No , no , '' she cried ."
"`` It is just for spring cleaning time , '' Jane said , `` he wants me always to do his spring cleaning . ''"
"`` If only I could go with you , '' Wendy sighed ."
"`` You see you ca n't fly , '' said Jane ."
Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together .
"Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window , watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars ."
"As you look at Wendy , you may see her hair becoming white , and her figure little again , for all this happened long ago ."
"Jane is now a common grown-up , with a daughter called Margaret ; and every spring cleaning time , except when he forgets , Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland , where she tells him stories about himself , to which he listens eagerly ."
"When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter , who is to be Peter 's mother in turn ; and thus it will go on , so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless ."

I THE GRAND TOUR OF THE GARDENS You must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow Peter Pan 's adventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens .
"They are in London , where the King lives , and I used to take David there nearly every day unless he was looking decidedly flushed ."
"No child has ever been in the whole of the Gardens , because it is so soon time to turn back ."
"The reason it is soon time to turn back is that , if you are as small as David , you sleep from twelve to one ."
"If your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one , you could most likely see the whole of them ."
"The Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of omnibuses , over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds up her finger to any one of them it stops immediately ."
She then crosses with you in safety to the other side .
"There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate , but that is the one you go in at , and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons , who sits just outside ."
"This is as near to being inside as she may venture , because , if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment , the balloons would lift her up , and she would be flown away ."
"She sits very squat , for the balloons are always tugging at her , and the strain has given her quite a red face ."
"Once she was a new one , because the old one had let go , and David was very sorry for the old one , but as she did let go , he wished he had been there to see ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The Hump , which is the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run -RSB- The Gardens are a tremendous big place , with millions and hundreds of trees ; and first you come to the Figs , but you scorn to loiter there , for the Figs is the resort of superior little persons , who are forbidden to mix with the commonalty , and is so named , according to legend , because they dress in full fig ."
"These dainty ones are themselves contemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes , and you have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the Gardens when I tell you that cricket is called crickets here ."
"Occasionally a rebel Fig climbs over the fence into the world , and such a one was Miss Mabel Grey , of whom I shall tell you when we come to Miss Mabel Grey 's gate ."
"laughed Jack , adding , with great interest , `` What did the other fellow do ? ''"
"`` He went about fighting other people 's battles , helping the poor , and trying to do good ."
"But he lacked judgment , so he often got into trouble , and was in such a hurry that he did not always stop to find out the wisest way ."
"As when he gave away his best coat to a beggar boy , instead of the old one which he intended to give . ''"
"`` I say , that is n't fair , mother !"
"Neither of them was new , and the boy needed the best more than I did , and I wore the old one all winter , did n't I ? ''"
"asked Jack , who had rather exulted over Frank , and was now taken down himself ."
"`` Yes , you did , my dear ; and it was not an easy thing for my dandiprat to do ."
"Now listen , and I 'll tell you how they both learned to be wiser ."
"The elder prince soon found that the big dragons were too much for him , and set about training his own little one , who now and then ran away with him ."
"Its name was Will , a good servant , but a bad master ; so he learned to control it , and in time this gave him great power over himself , and fitted him to be a king over others . ''"
"`` Thank you , mother ; I 'll remember my part of the moral ."
"Now give Jack his , '' said Frank , who liked the dragon episode , as he had been wrestling with his own of late , and found it hard to manage ."
"`` He had a fine example before him in a friend , and he followed it more reasonably till he grew able to use wisely one of the best and noblest gifts of God -- benevolence . ''"
`` Now tell about the girl .
Was there more to that part of the story ? ''
"asked Jack , well pleased with his moral , as it took Ed in likewise ."
"`` That is the best of all , but it seems as if I never should get to it ."
"After Patience made Lucy sweet and cheerful , she began to have a curious power over those about her , and to work little miracles herself , though she did not know it ."
"The queen learned to love her so dearly she could not let her go ; she cheered up all her friends when they came with their small troubles ; the princes found bright eyes , willing hands , and a kind heart always at their service , and felt , without quite knowing why , that it was good for them to have a gentle little creature to care for ; so they softened their rough manners , loud voices , and careless ways , for her sake , and when it was proposed to take her away to her own home they could not give her up , but said she must stay longer , did n't they ? ''"
"`` I 'd like to see them saying anything else , '' said Frank , while Jack sat up to demand fiercely , -- `` Who talks about taking Jill away ? ''"
"`` Lucy 's mother thought she ought to go , and said so , but the queen told her how much good it did them all to have her there , and begged the dear woman to let her little cottage and come and be housekeeper in the palace , for the queen was getting lazy , and liked to sit and read , and talk and sew with Lucy , better than to look after things . ''"
`` And she said she would ? ''
"cried Jill , clasping her hands in her anxiety , for she had learned to love her cage now ."
`` Yes . ''
"Mrs. Minot had no time to say more , for one of the red slippers flew up in the air , and Jack had to clap both hands over his mouth to suppress the `` hurrah ! ''"
that nearly escaped .
"Frank said , `` That 's good ! ''"
"and nodded with his most cordial smile at Jill who pulled herself up with cheeks now as rosy as the red carnation , and a little catch in her breath as she said to herself , -- `` It 's too lovely to be true . ''"
"`` That 's a first-rate end to a very good story , '' began Jack , with grave decision , as he put on his slipper and sat up to pat Jill 's hand , wishing it was not quite so like a little claw ."
"`` That 's not the end ; '' and Mamma 's eyes laughed more than ever as three astonished faces turned to her , and three voices cried out , -- `` Still more ? ''"
`` The very best of all .
"`` Quite lost , but I did not care , for I made up my mind that it would be best to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again ; and you see I have waited , '' said Mrs. Jo , beginning to pull in the big kite , for it was getting late ."
`` Must we go now ? ''
"`` I must , or you wo n't have any supper ; and that sort of surprise party would not suit you , I think , my chickens . ''"
`` Has n't our party been a nice one ? ''
"asked Tommy , complacently ."
`` Splendid ! ''
answered every one .
`` Do you know why ?
"It is because your guests have behaved themselves , and tried to make everything go well ."
"You understand what I mean , do n't you ? ''"
"`` Yes 'm , '' was all the boys said , but they stole a shamefaced look at one another , as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home , thinking of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves , and things had gone badly on account of it ."
"CHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN July had come , and haying begun ; the little gardens were doing finely and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours ."
"The house stood open from morning till night , and the lads lived out of doors , except at school time ."
"The lessons were short , and there were many holidays , for the Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise , and our short summers are best used in out-of-door work ."
"Such a rosy , sunburnt , hearty set as the boys became ; such appetites as they had ; such sturdy arms and legs , as outgrew jackets and trousers ; such laughing and racing all over the place ; such antics in house and barn ; such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale ; and such satisfaction in the hearts of the worthy Bhaers , as they saw their flock prospering in mind and body , I can not begin to describe ."
"Only one thing was needed to make them quite happy , and it came when they least expected it ."
"One balmy night when the little lads were in bed , the elder ones bathing down at the brook , and Mrs. Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor , he suddenly cried out , `` Oh , my Danny ! ''"
"and pointed to the window , where the moon shone brightly ."
"`` No , lovey , he is not there , it was the pretty moon , '' said his mother ."
"`` No , no , Danny at a window ; Teddy saw him , '' persisted baby , much excited ."
"`` It might have been , '' and Mrs. Bhaer hurried to the window , hoping it would prove true ."
"But the face was gone , and nowhere appeared any signs of a mortal boy ; she called his name , ran to the front door with Teddy in his little shirt , and made him call too , thinking the baby voice might have more effect than her own ."
"No one answered , nothing appeared , and they went back much disappointed ."
"Teddy would not be satisfied with the moon , and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask if Danny was not `` tummin ' soon . ''"
"By and by he fell asleep , the lads trooped up to bed , the house grew still , and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night ."
"Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing , for the big basket was always piled with socks , full of portentous holes , and thinking of the lost boy ."
"She had decided that baby had been mistaken , and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child 's fancy , for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed , and he was busy writing letters ."
It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house .
"As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps , something white caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn ."
"The children had been playing there all the afternoon , and , fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual , Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it ."
"But as she approached , she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief , but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it ."
"She hurried round the hay-cock , and there lay Dan , fast asleep ."
"Ned fell out of a tree , and split his jacket down the back , but suffered no other fracture ."
"Emil and Jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch , and while they were squabbling about it , Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes and fled to the protection of Dan , who was enjoying himself immensely ."
"The crutch was no longer necessary , and he was delighted to see how strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture , full of interesting rocks and stumps , with familiar little creatures in the grass , and well-known insects dancing in the air ."
"But of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which befell Nan and Rob was the most exciting , and it long remained one of the favorite histories of the household ."
"Having explored the country pretty generally , torn three rents in her frock , and scratched her face in a barberry-bush , Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big , black beads on the low , green bushes ."
"Her nimble fingers flew , but still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired , so she kept wandering here and there to search for better places , instead of picking contentedly and steadily as Daisy did ."
"Rob followed Nan , for her energy suited him better than his cousin 's patience , and he too was anxious to have the biggest and best berries for Marmar ."
"`` I keep putting 'em in , but it do n't fill up , and I 'm so tired , '' said Rob , pausing a moment to rest his short legs , and beginning to think huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it ; for the sun blazed , Nan skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper , and the berries fell out of his pail almost as fast as he put them in , because , in his struggles with the bushes , it was often upside-down ."
`` Last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great bouncers ; and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire .
"Let 's go and fill our things quick , and then hide in the cave and let the others find us , '' proposed Nan , thirsting for adventures ."
"Rob consented , and away they went , scrambling over the wall and running down the sloping fields on the other side , till they were hidden among the rocks and underbrush ."
"The berries were thick , and at last the pails were actually full ."
"It was shady and cool down there , and a little spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy cup ."
"`` Now we will go and rest in the cave , and eat our lunch , '' said Nan , well satisfied with her success so far ."
`` Do you know the way ? ''
asked Rob . ''
"` Course I do ; I 've been once , and I always remember ."
Did n't I go and get my box all right ? ''
"That convinced Rob , and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock and stone , and brought him , after much meandering , to a small recess in the rock , where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made ."
"`` Now , is n't it nice ? ''"
"asked Nan , as she took out a bit of bread-and-butter , rather damaged by being mixed up with nails , fishhooks , stones and other foreign substances , in the young lady 's pocket ."
`` Yes ; do you think they will find us soon ? ''
"asked Rob , who found the shadowy glen rather dull , and began to long for more society ."
"`` No , I do n't ; because if I hear them , I shall hide , and have fun making them find me . ''"
`` P'raps they wo n't come . ''
`` Do n't care ; I can get home myself . ''
`` Is it a great way ? ''
"asked Rob , looking at his little stubby boots , scratched and wet with his long wandering ."
"`` It 's six miles , I guess . ''"
"Nan 's ideas of distance were vague , and her faith in her own powers great ."
"`` I think we better go now , '' suggested Rob , presently ."
`` I sha n't till I have picked over my berries ; '' and Nan began what seemed to Rob an endless task .
`` Do n't quarrel about me .
"I shall do well enough , and the scarlet shawl will hide my ugly dress , '' said Merry , from the corner , where she sat waiting for her turn at the mirror ."
"As she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it , and something that she saw in the other room put her own disappointment out of her head ."
"Jill lay there all alone , rather tired with the lively chatter , and the effort it cost her not to repine at being shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting ."
"Her eyes were closed , her net was off , and all the pretty black curls lay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out , while the other rested on the red shawl , as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture ."
"She was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon , and something in the plaintive voice , the solitary figure , went straight to Merry 's gentle heart ."
"`` Poor Jilly ca n't have any of the fun , '' was the first thought ; then came a second , that made Merry start and smile , and in a minute whisper so that all but Jill could hear her , `` Girls , I 'm not going to be the Princess ."
But I 've thought of a splendid one ! ''
`` Who ? ''
"asked the rest , staring at one another , much surprised by this sudden announcement ."
`` Hush !
"Speak low , or you will spoil it all ."
"Look in the Bird Room , and tell me if that is n't a prettier Princess than I could make ? ''"
"They all looked , but no one spoke , and Merry added , with sweet eagerness , `` It is the only thing poor Jill can be , and it would make her so happy ; Jack would like it , and it would please every one , I know ."
"Perhaps she will never walk again , so we ought to be very good to her , poor dear . ''"
"The last words , whispered with a little quiver in the voice , settled the matter better than hours of talking , for girls are tender-hearted creatures , and not one of these but would have gladly given all the pretty things she owned to see Jill dancing about well and strong again ."
"Like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched and brightened every face ; envy , impatience , vanity , and discontent flew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy , and with one accord they all cried , -- `` It will be lovely ; let us go and tell her ! ''"
"Forgetting their own adornment , out they trooped after Merry , who ran to the sofa , saying , with a smile which was reflected in all the other faces , `` Jill , dear , we have chosen another Princess , and I know you 'll like her . ''"
`` Who is it ? ''
"asked Jill , languidly , opening her eyes without the least suspicion of the truth ."
"`` I 'll show you ; '' and taking the cherished veil from her own head , Merry dropped it like a soft cloud over Jill ; Annette added the long plume , Susy laid the white silk dress about her , while Juliet and Mabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa , and Molly tore the last ornament from her turban , a silver star , to shine on Jill 's breast ."
"Then they all took hands and danced round the couch , singing , as they laughed at her astonishment , `` There she is !"
There she is !
Princess Jill as fine as you please !
`` Do you really mean it ?
But can I ?
Is it fair ?
How sweet of you !
Come here and let me hug you all ! ''
"cried Jill , in a rapture at the surprise , and the pretty way in which it was done ."
"The grand scene on the Twenty-second was very fine , indeed ; but the little tableau of that minute was infinitely better , though no one saw it , as Jill tried to gather them all in her arms , for that nosegay of girlish faces was the sweeter , because each one had sacrificed her own little vanity to please a friend , and her joy was reflected in the eyes that sparkled round the happy Princess ."
"`` Oh , you dear , kind things , to think of me and give me all your best clothes !"
"Saint Lucy Saturday was a busy and a happy time to Jack , for in the morning Mr. Acton came to see him , having heard the story overnight , and promised to keep Bob 's secret while giving Jack an acquittal as public as the reprimand had been ."
Then he asked for the report which Jack had bravely received the day before and put away without showing to anybody .
"`` There is one mistake here which we must rectify , '' said Mr. Acton , as he crossed out the low figures under the word `` Behavior , '' and put the much-desired 100 there ."
"`` But I did break the rule , sir , '' said Jack , though his face glowed with pleasure , for Mamma was looking on ."
`` I overlook that as I should your breaking into my house if you saw it was on fire .
"You ran to save a friend , and I wish I could tell those fellows why you were there ."
It would do them good .
"I am not going to praise you , John , but I did believe you in spite of appearances , and I am glad to have for a pupil a boy who loves his neighbor better than himself . ''"
"Then , having shaken hands heartily , Mr. Acton went away , and Jack flew off to have rejoicings with Jill , who sat up on her sofa , without knowing it , so eager was she to hear all about the call ."
"In the afternoon Jack drove his mother to the Captain 's , confiding to her on the way what a hard time he had when he went before , and how nothing but the thought of cheering Bob kept him up when he slipped and hurt his knee , and his boot sprung a leak , and the wind came up very cold , and the hill seemed an endless mountain of mud and snow ."
"Mrs. Minot had such a gentle way of putting things that she would have won over a much harder man than the strict old Captain , who heard the story with interest , and was much pleased with the boys ' efforts to keep Bob straight ."
"That young person dodged away into the barn with Jack , and only appeared at the last minute to shove a bag of chestnuts into the chaise ."
"But he got a few kind words that did him good , from Mrs. Minot and the Captain , and from that day felt himself under bonds to behave well if he would keep their confidence ."
"`` I shall give Jill the nuts ; and I wish I had something she wanted very , very much , for I do think she ought to be rewarded for getting me out of the mess , '' said Jack , as they drove happily home again ."
`` I hope to have something in a day or two that will delight her very much .
"I will say no more now , but keep my little secret and let it be a surprise to all by and by , '' answered his mother , looking as if she had not much doubt about the matter ."
`` That will be jolly .
"You are welcome to your secret , Mamma ."
I 've had enough of them for one while ; '' and Jack shrugged his broad shoulders as if a burden had been taken off .
"In the evening Ed came , and Jack was quite satisfied when he saw how pleased his friend was at what he had done ."
"`` I never meant you should take so much trouble , only be kind to Bob , '' said Ed , who did not know how strong his influence was , nor what a sweet example of quiet well-doing his own life was to all his mates ."
`` I wished to be really useful ; not just to talk about it and do nothing .
"That is n't your way , and I want to be like you , '' answered Jack , with such affectionate sincerity that Ed could not help believing him , though he modestly declined the compliment by saying , as he began to play softly , `` Better than I am , I hope ."
I do n't amount to much . ''
"`` Yes , you do !"
and if any one says you do n't I 'll shake him .
"I ca n't tell what it is , only you always look so happy and contented -- sort of sweet and shiny , '' said Jack , as he stroked the smooth brown head , rather at a loss to describe the unusually fresh and sunny expression of Ed 's face , which was always cheerful , yet had a certain thoughtfulness that made it very attractive to both young and old ."
"`` Soap makes him shiny ; I never saw such a fellow to wash and brush , '' put in Frank , as he came up with one of the pieces of music he and Ed were fond of practising together ."
`` I do n't mean that ! ''
said Jack indignantly .
"`` I wash and brush till you call me a dandy , but I do n't have the same look -- it seems to come from the inside , somehow , as if he was always jolly and clean and good in his mind , you know . ''"
"`` Born so , '' said Frank , rumbling away in the bass with a pair of hands that would have been the better for some of the above-mentioned soap , for he did not love to do much in the washing and brushing line ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
` Preposterous ! '
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a plaything ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
-LSB- Illustration : ` Preposterous ! '
cried Solomon in a rage -RSB- Nor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow 's good-will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by and by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper , and a boot-lace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , ` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , ' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"` Consider , ' he said at last , ` how warm the mud makes the nest . '"
"` Consider , ' cried Mrs. Finch , ` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . '"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"` Try another drink , ' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : For years he had been quietly filling his stocking -RSB- Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"` If , ' said he , ' a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . '"
How the thrushes applauded !
"There was something he wanted very much , but , though he knew he wanted it , he could not think what it was ."
"What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose , but that never struck him , so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment ."
They are reputed to know a good deal .
"There were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk , with their arms round each other 's waists , and he hopped down to address them ."
"The fairies have their tiffs with the birds , but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question , and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him ."
"Another was lolling on a garden-chair , reading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall , and when he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip ."
To Peter 's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him .
"A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them ."
A milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it .
Soon the Gardens were in an uproar .
"Crowds of fairies were running this way and that , asking each other stoutly , who was afraid , lights were extinguished , doors barricaded , and from the grounds of Queen Mab 's palace came the rubadub of drums , showing that the royal guard had been called out ."
"A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk , armed with holly-leaves , with which they jog the enemy horribly in passing ."
"Peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time , but he never thought for a moment that he was the human ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though that had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
"Poor little Peter Pan , he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease forever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"`` Look at your night-gown , if you do n't believe me , '' Solomon said , and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
`` How many of your toes are thumbs ? ''
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"`` Ruffle your feathers , '' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window-ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"`` I think I shall go back to mother , '' he said timidly ."
"`` Good-bye , '' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
`` But I will be cruelly avenged .
"I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton -- she that is to be , '' she added , curtseying ."
"`` Joanna , '' she continued , `` I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight , but he is , let me tell you plainly , the softest-hearted simpleton in England ."
Go to -- ye may do your pleasure with him !
"And now , fool children , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let us all three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir ; for these woods , methinks , are full of peril and exceeding cold . ''"
`` But did my Dick make love to you ? ''
"asked Joanna , clinging to her sweetheart 's side ."
"`` Nay , fool girl , '' returned Alicia ; `` it was I made love to him ."
"I offered to marry him , indeed ; but he bade me go marry with my likes ."
These were his words .
"Nay , that I will say : he is more plain than pleasant ."
"But now , children , for the sake of sense , set forward ."
"Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? ''"
"`` Why , '' said Dick , `` I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have been sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last days , and my poor body is one bruise ."
But how think ye ?
"If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , had fled away , we should have gone about for nothing ."
"'T is but some three short miles to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow is pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we went even as we are ? ''"
"`` Agreed , '' cried Alicia ; but Joanna only pressed upon Dick 's arm ."
"Forth , then , they went , through open leafless groves and down snow-clad alleys , under the white face of the winter moon ; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure ; and their light-minded companion , her own bereavements heartily forgotten , followed a pace or two behind , now rallying them upon their silence , and now drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives ."
"Still , indeed , in the distance of the wood , the riders of Tunstall might be heard urging their pursuit ; and from time to time cries or the clash of steel announced the shock of enemies ."
"But in these young folk , bred among the alarms of war , and fresh from such a multiplicity of dangers , neither fear nor pity could be lightly wakened ."
"Content to find the sounds still drawing farther and farther away , they gave up their hearts to the enjoyment of the hour , walking already , as Alicia put it , in a wedding procession ; and neither the rude solitude of the forest , nor the cold of the freezing night , had any force to shadow or distract their happiness ."
"At length , from a rising hill , they looked below them on the dell of Holywood ."
"The great windows of the forest abbey shone with torch and candle ; its high pinnacles and spires arose very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon ."
"All about it , in the open glade , camp-fires were burning , and the ground was thick with huts ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curved ."
"`` By the mass , '' said Richard , `` there are Lord Foxham 's fellows still encamped ."
The messenger hath certainly miscarried .
"Well , then , so better ."
We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . ''
"But if Lord Foxham 's men still lay encamped in the long holm at Holywood , it was from a different reason from the one supposed by Dick ."
"They had marched , indeed , for Shoreby ; but ere they were half way thither , a second messenger met them , and bade them return to their morning 's camp , to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitives , and to be so much nearer to the main army of York ."
"For Richard of Gloucester , having finished the battle and stamped out his foes in that district , was already on the march to rejoin his brother ; and not long after the return of my Lord Foxham 's retainers , Crookback himself drew rein before the abbey door ."
"Borrowing a rope for a halter , Dan led her home , followed by a party of very sober young gentlemen , for the cow was in a sad state , having strained her shoulder jumping , so that she limped , her eyes looked wild , and her glossy coat was wet and muddy ."
"`` You 'll catch it this time , Dan , '' said Tommy , as he led the wheezing donkey beside the maltreated cow ."
"`` So will you , for you helped . ''"
"`` We all did , but Demi , '' added Jack ."
"`` He put it into our heads , '' said Ned ."
"`` I told you not to do it , '' cried Demi , who was most broken-hearted at poor Buttercup 's state ."
"`` Old Bhaer will send me off , I guess ."
"Do n't care if he does , '' muttered Dan , looking worried in spite of his words ."
"`` We 'll ask him not to , all of us , '' said Demi , and the others assented with the exception of Stuffy , who cherished the hope that all the punishment might fall on one guilty head ."
"Dan only said , `` Do n't bother about me ; '' but he never forgot it , even though he led the lads astray again , as soon as the temptation came ."
"When Mr. Bhaer saw the animal , and heard the story , he said very little , evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of impatience ."
"Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall , and the boys sent to their rooms till supper-time ."
"This brief respite gave them time to think the matter over , to wonder what the penalty would be , and to try to imagine where Dan would be sent ."
"He whistled briskly in his room , so that no one should think he cared a bit ; but while he waited to know his fate , the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger , the more he recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here , the hardship and neglect he had felt elsewhere ."
"He knew they tried to help him , and at the bottom of his heart he was grateful , but his rough life had made him hard and careless , suspicious and wilful ."
"He hated restraint of any sort , and fought against it like an untamed creature , even while he knew it was kindly meant , and dimly felt that he would be the better for it ."
"He made up his mind to be turned adrift again , to knock about the city as he had done nearly all his life ; a prospect that made him knit his black brows , and look about the cosy little room with a wistful expression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr. Bhaer 's if he had seen it ."
"It vanished instantly , however , when the good man came in , and said in his accustomed grave way , `` I have heard all about it , Dan , and though you have broken the rules again , I am going to give you one more trial , to please Mother Bhaer . ''"
"Dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve , but he only said in his gruff way , `` I did n't know there was any rule about bull-fighting . ''"
"`` As I never expected to have any at Plumfield , I never did make such a rule , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , smiling in spite of himself at the boy 's excuse ."
"Then he added gravely , `` But one of the first and most important of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the place ."
"I want everybody and everything to be happy here , to love and trust , and serve us , as we try to love and trust and serve them faithfully and willingly ."
"I have often said that you were kinder to the animals than any of the other boys , and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in you very much , because she thought it showed a good heart ."
"But you have disappointed us in that , and we are sorry , for we hoped to make you quite one of us ."
Shall we try again ? ''
"Dan 's eyes had been on the floor , and his hands nervously picking at the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in , but when he heard the kind voice ask that question , he looked up quickly , and said in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before , `` Yes , please . ''"
"`` Very well , then , we will say no more , only you will stay at home from the walk to-morrow , as the other boys will and all of you must wait on poor Buttercup till she is well again . ''"
`` I will . ''
"`` Now , go down to supper , and do your best , my boy , more for your own sake than for ours . ''"
"Then Mr. Bhaer shook hands with him , and Dan went down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping which Asia had strongly recommended ."
"Dan did try for a day or two , but not being used to it , he soon tired and relapsed into his old wilful ways ."
"Mr. Bhaer was called from home on business one day , and the boys had no lessons ."
"The room was nearly dark , for the lantern burned badly ; they could not laugh loud nor move about much , for Silas slept next door in the shed-chamber , and altogether the party was dull ."
"In the middle of a deal Dan stopped suddenly , and called out , `` Who 's that ? ''"
"in a startled tone , and at the same moment drew the slide over the light ."
"A voice in the darkness said tremulously , `` I ca n't find Tommy , '' and then there was the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from the wing to the main house ."
`` It 's Demi !
"he 's gone to call some one ; cut into bed , Tom , and do n't tell ! ''"
"cried Dan , whisking all signs of the revel out of sight , and beginning to tear off his clothes , while Nat did the same ."
"Tommy flew to his room and dived into bed , where he lay , laughing till something burned his hand , when he discovered that he was still clutching the stump of the festive cigar , which he happened to be smoking when the revel broke up ."
"It was nearly out , and he was about to extinguish it carefully when Nursey 's voice was heard , and fearing it would betray him if he hid it in the bed , he threw it underneath , after a final pinch which he thought finished it ."
"Nursey came in with Demi , who looked much amazed to see the red face of Tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow ."
"`` He was n't there just now , because I woke up and could not find him anywhere , '' said Demi , pouncing on him ."
"`` What mischief are you at now , bad child ? ''"
"asked Nursey , with a good-natured shake , which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly , `` I only ran into Nat 's room to see him about something ."
"Go away , and let me alone ; I 'm awful sleepy . ''"
"Nursey tucked Demi in , and went off to reconnoitre , but only found two boys slumbering peacefully in Dan 's room ."
"`` Some little frolic , '' she thought , and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer , who was busy and worried over little Teddy ."
"Tommy was sleepy , and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask questions , he was snoring in ten minutes , little dreaming what was going on under his bed ."
"The cigar did not go out , but smouldered away on the straw carpet till it was nicely on fire , and a hungry little flame went creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught , then the sheets , and then the bed itself ."
"The beer made Tommy sleep heavily , and the smoke stupified Demi , so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them , and they were in danger of being burned to death ."
"Franz was sitting up to study , and as he left the school-room he smelt the smoke , dashed up-stairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left wing of the house ."
"Without stopping to call any one , he ran into the room , dragged the boys from the blazing bed , and splashed all the water he could find at hand on to the flames ."
"It checked but did not quench the fire , and the children wakened on being tumbled topsy-turvy into a cold hall , began to roar at the top of their voices ."
"Mrs. Bhaer instantly appeared , and a minute after Silas burst out of his room shouting , `` Fire ! ''"
in a tone that raised the whole house .
"A flock of white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall , and for a minute every one was panic-stricken ."
"Then Mrs. Bhaer found her wits , bade Nursey see to the burnt boys , and sent Franz and Silas down-stairs for some tubs of wet clothes which she flung on the bed , over the carpet , and up against the curtains , now burning finely , and threatening to kindle the walls ."
"Most of the boys stood dumbly looking on , but Dan and Emil worked bravely , running to and fro with water from the bath-room , and helping to pull down the dangerous curtains ."
"The peril was soon over , and ordering the boys all back to bed , and leaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again , Mrs. Bhaer and Franz went to see how the poor boys got on ."
"Demi had escaped with one burn and a grand scare , but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched off his head , but a great burn on his arm , that made him half crazy with the pain ."
"Demi was soon made cosy , and Franz took him away to his own bed , where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as cosily as a woman ."
"Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night , trying to ease his misery , and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy with oil and cotton , paregoric and squills , saying to herself from time to time , as if she found great amusement in the thought , `` I always knew Tommy would set the house on fire , and now he has done it ! ''"
When Mr. Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things .
"`` In honour , I do , '' said Dick ."
"`` Hear , then , '' she continued ; `` Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband ."
"Nay , now , no words ! ''"
cried she .
`` They will avail you nothing .
"For see how just it is , that you who deprived me of one home , should supply me with another ."
"And as for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , as we be dear friends , what matters it with which of us ye wed ?"
Not one whit ! ''
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to wed with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for man 's force nor yet for lady 's pleasure ."
"Pardon me if I speak my plain thoughts plainly ; but where a maid is very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . ''"
"`` Dick , '' she said , `` ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word ."
"Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I stole it ."
"And as for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye were not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it was not you that set him there ."
"But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y ' are all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . ''"
"CHAPTER VI -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS -LRB- concluded -RRB- : DICK AND JOAN The horses had by this time finished the small store of provender , and fully breathed from their fatigues ."
"At Dick 's command , the fire was smothered in snow ; and while his men got once more wearily to saddle , he himself , remembering , somewhat late , true woodland caution , chose a tall oak and nimbly clambered to the topmost fork ."
Hence he could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest .
"On the south-west , dark against the horizon , stood those upland , heathy quarters where he and Joanna had met with the terrifying misadventure of the leper ."
And there his eye was caught by a spot of ruddy brightness no bigger than a needle 's eye .
He blamed himself sharply for his previous neglect .
"Were that , as it appeared to be , the shining of Sir Daniel 's camp-fire , he should long ago have seen and marched for it ; above all , he should , for no consideration , have announced his neighbourhood by lighting a fire of his own ."
But now he must no longer squander valuable hours .
"The direct way to the uplands was about two miles in length ; but it was crossed by a very deep , precipitous dingle , impassable to mounted men ; and for the sake of speed , it seemed to Dick advisable to desert the horses and attempt the adventure on foot ."
"Ten men were left to guard the horses ; signals were agreed upon by which they could communicate in case of need ; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder , Alicia Risingham walking stoutly by his side ."
"The men had freed themselves of heavy armour , and left behind their lances ; and they now marched with a very good spirit in the frozen snow , and under the exhilarating lustre of the moon ."
"The descent into the dingle , where a stream strained sobbing through the snow and ice , was effected with silence and order ; and on the further side , being then within a short half mile of where Dick had seen the glimmer of the fire , the party halted to breathe before the attack ."
"In the vast silence of the wood , the lightest sounds were audible from far ; and Alicia , who was keen of hearing , held up her finger warningly and stooped to listen ."
"All followed her example ; but besides the groans of the choked brook in the dingle close behind , and the barking of a fox at a distance of many miles among the forest , to Dick 's acutest hearkening , not a breath was audible ."
"`` But yet , for sure , I heard the clash of harness , '' whispered Alicia ."
"`` Madam , '' returned Dick , who was more afraid of that young lady than of ten stout warriors , `` I would not hint ye were mistaken ; but it might well have come from either of the camps . ''"
`` It came not thence .
"It came from westward , '' she declared ."
"You must know that , while Lucy was busy for others , she was not forgotten , and when she was expecting to lie on her bed through the summer , plans were being made for all sorts of pleasant changes ."
"First of all , she was to have a nice little brace to support the back which was growing better every day ; then , as the warm weather came on , she was to go out , or lie on the piazza ; and by and by , when school was done , she was to go with the queen and the princes for a month or two down to the sea-side , where fresh air and salt water were to build her up in the most delightful way ."
"There , now !"
is n't that the best ending of all ? ''
"and Mamma paused to read her answer in the bright faces of two of the listeners , for Jill hid hers in the pillow , and lay quite still , as if it was too much for her ."
`` That will be regularly splendid !
"I 'll row you all about -- boating is so much easier than riding , and I like it on salt water , '' said Frank , going to sit on the arm of the sofa , quite excited by the charms of the new plan ."
"`` And I 'll teach you to swim , and roll you over the beach , and get sea-weed and shells , and no end of nice things , and we 'll all come home as strong as lions , '' added Jack , scrambling up as if about to set off at once ."
"`` The doctor says you have been doing finely of late , and the brace will come to-morrow , and the first really mild day you are to have a breath of fresh air ."
Wo n't that be good ? ''
"asked Mrs. Minot , hoping her story had not been too interesting ."
`` Is she crying ? ''
"said Jack , much concerned as he patted the pillow in his most soothing way , while Frank lifted one curl after another to see what was hidden underneath ."
"Not tears , for two eyes sparkled behind the fingers , then the hands came down like clouds from before the sun , and Jill 's face shone out so bright and happy it did one 's heart good to see it ."
"`` I 'm not crying , '' she said with a laugh which was fuller of blithe music than any song she sung ."
"`` But it was so splendid , it sort of took my breath away for a minute ."
"I thought I was n't any better , and never should be , and I made up my mind I would n't ask , it would be so hard for any one to tell me so ."
"Now I see why the doctor made me stand up , and told me to get my baskets ready to go a-Maying ."
I thought he was in fun ; did he really mean I could go ? ''
"asked Jill , expecting too much , for a word of encouragement made her as hopeful as she had been despondent before ."
"`` No , dear , not so soon as that ."
"It will be months , probably , before you can walk and run , as you used to ; but they will soon pass ."
"You need n't mind about May-day ; it is always too cold for flowers , and you will find more here among your own plants , than on the hills , to fill your baskets , '' answered Mrs. Minot , hastening to suggest something pleasant to beguile the time of probation ."
`` I can wait .
"Months are not years , and if I 'm truly getting well , everything will seem beautiful and easy to me , '' said Jill , laying herself down again , with the patient look she had learned to wear , and gathering up the scattered carnations to enjoy their spicy breath , as if the fairies hidden there had taught her some of their sweet secrets ."
"`` Dear little girl , it has been a long , hard trial for you , but it is coming to an end , and I think you will find that it has not been time wasted , I do n't want you to be a saint quite yet , but I am sure a gentler Jill will rise up from that sofa than the one who lay down there in December . ''"
"`` How could I help growing better , when you were so good to me ? ''"
"cried Jill , putting up both arms , as Mrs. Minot went to take Frank 's place , and he retired to the fire , there to stand surveying the scene with calm approval ."
`` You have done quite as much for us ; so we are even .
"I proved that to your mother , and she is going to let the little house and take care of the big one for me , while I borrow you to keep me happy and make the boys gentle and kind ."
"That is the bargain , and we get the best of it , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking well pleased , while Jack added , `` That 's so ! ''"
"and Frank observed with an air of conviction , `` We could n't get on without Jill , possibly . ''"
"I do not know if the collops were truly very good , but my heart rose against the sight of them , and I could eat but little ."
"All the while Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie 's stay in the Cage , giving us the very words of the speakers , and rising from his place to show us where they stood ."
"By these , I gathered the Prince was a gracious , spirited boy , like the son of a race of polite kings , but not so wise as Solomon ."
"I gathered , too , that while he was in the Cage , he was often drunk ; so the fault that has since , by all accounts , made such a wreck of him , had even then begun to show itself ."
"We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old , thumbed , greasy pack of cards , such as you may find in a mean inn ; and his eyes brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing ."
"Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like disgrace ; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of others , on the cast of painted pasteboard ."
"To be sure , I might have pleaded my fatigue , which was excuse enough ; but I thought it behoved that I should bear a testimony ."
"I must have got very red in the face , but I spoke steadily , and told them I had no call to be a judge of others , but for my own part , it was a matter in which I had no clearness ."
Cluny stopped mingling the cards .
`` What in deil 's name is this ? ''
says he .
"`` What kind of Whiggish , canting talk is this , for the house of Cluny Macpherson ? ''"
"`` I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour , '' says Alan ."
"`` He is an honest and a mettle gentleman , and I would have ye bear in mind who says it ."
"I bear a king 's name , '' says he , cocking his hat ; `` and I and any that I call friend are company for the best ."
"But the gentleman is tired , and should sleep ; if he has no mind to the cartes , it will never hinder you and me ."
"And I 'm fit and willing , sir , to play ye any game that ye can name . ''"
"`` Sir , '' says Cluny , `` in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure ."
"If your friend would like to stand on his head , he is welcome ."
"And if either he , or you , or any other man , is not preceesely satisfied , I will be proud to step outside with him . ''"
I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake .
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` I am very wearied , as Alan says ; and what 's more , as you are a man that likely has sons of your own , I may tell you it was a promise to my father . ''"
"`` Say nae mair , say nae mair , '' said Cluny , and pointed me to a bed of heather in a corner of the Cage ."
"For all that he was displeased enough , looked at me askance , and grumbled when he looked ."
"And indeed it must be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them , smacked somewhat of the Covenanter , and were little in their place among wild Highland Jacobites ."
"What with the brandy and the venison , a strange heaviness had come over me ; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind of trance , in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the Cage ."
"Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed ; sometimes I only heard voices , or men snoring , like the voice of a silly river ; and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again , like firelight shadows on the roof ."
"I must sometimes have spoken or cried out , for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered ; yet I was conscious of no particular nightmare , only of a general , black , abiding horror -- a horror of the place I was in , and the bed I lay in , and the plaids on the wall , and the voices , and the fire , and myself ."
"The barber-gillie , who was a doctor too , was called in to prescribe for me ; but as he spoke in the Gaelic , I understood not a word of his opinion , and was too sick even to ask for a translation ."
"I knew well enough I was ill , and that was all I cared about ."
I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass .
"But Alan and Cluny were most of the time at the cards , and I am clear that Alan must have begun by winning ; for I remember sitting up , and seeing them hard at it , and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on the table ."
"Take the real one as a model -- please do ; there are more coming , and this will brighten up your room for a day or two . ''"
"As she spoke , Merry cut the stem , and , adding two or three of the great green leaves , put the handsome flower in his hand with so much good-will that he felt as if he had received a very precious gift ."
"Then he said good-night so gratefully that Merry 's hand quite tingled with the grasp of his , and went away , often looking backward through the darkness to where the light burned brightly on the hill-top -- the beacon kindled by an unconscious Hero for a young Leander swimming gallantly against wind and tide toward the goal of his ambition ."
Chapter XVII .
"Down at Molly 's `` Now , my dears , I 've something very curious to tell you , so listen quietly and then I 'll give you your dinners , '' said Molly , addressing the nine cats who came trooping after her as she went into the shed-chamber with a bowl of milk and a plate of scraps in her hands ."
"She had taught them to behave well at meals , so , though their eyes glared and their tails quivered with impatience , they obeyed ; and when she put the food on a high shelf and retired to the big basket , the four old cats sat demurely down before her , while the five kits scrambled after her and tumbled into her lap , as if hoping to hasten the desired feast by their innocent gambols ."
"Granny , Tobias , Mortification , and Molasses were the elders ."
"Granny , a gray old puss , was the mother and grandmother of all the rest ."
"Tobias was her eldest son , and Mortification his brother , so named because he had lost his tail , which affliction depressed his spirits and cast a blight over his young life ."
"Molasses was a yellow cat , the mamma of four of the kits , the fifth being Granny 's latest darling ."
"Toddlekins , the little aunt , was the image of her mother , and very sedate even at that early age ; Miss Muffet , so called from her dread of spiders , was a timid black and white kit ; Beauty , a pretty Maltese , with a serene little face and pink nose ; Ragbag , a funny thing , every color that a cat could be ; and Scamp , who well deserved his name , for he was the plague of Miss Bat 's life , and Molly 's especial pet ."
"He was now perched on her shoulder , and , as she talked , kept peeping into her face or biting her ear in the most impertinent way , while the others sprawled in her lap or promenaded round the basket rim ."
"`` My friends , something very remarkable has happened : Miss Bat is cleaning house ! ''"
"and , having made this announcement , Molly leaned back to see how the cats received it , for she insisted that they understood all she said to them ."
"Tobias stared , Mortification lay down as if it was too much for him , Molasses beat her tail on the floor as if whipping a dusty carpet , and Granny began to purr approvingly ."
"The giddy kits paid no attention , as they did not know what house-cleaning meant , happy little dears !"
"`` I thought you 'd like it , Granny , for you are a decent cat , and know what is proper , '' continued Molly , leaning down to stroke the old puss , who blinked affectionately at her ."
`` I ca n't imagine what put it into Miss Bat 's head .
"I never said a word , and gave up groaning over the clutter , as I could n't mend it ."
"I just took care of Boo and myself , and left her to be as untidy as she pleased , and she is a regular old -- '' Here Scamp put his paw on her lips because he saw them moving , but it seemed as if it was to check the disrespectful word just coming out ."
"`` Well , I wo n't call names ; but what shall I do when I see everything in confusion , and she wo n't let me clear up ? ''"
"asked Molly , looking round at Scamp , who promptly put the little paw on her eyelid , as if the roll of the blue ball underneath amused him ."
"`` Shut my eyes to it , you mean ?"
"I do all I can , but it is hard , when I wish to be nice , and do try ; do n't I ? ''"
asked Molly .
"But Scamp was ready for her , and began to comb her hair with both paws as he stood on his hind legs to work so busily that Molly laughed and pulled him down , saying , as she cuddled the sly kit ."
`` You sharp little thing !
"I know my hair is not neat now , for I 've been chasing Boo round the garden to wash him for school ."
"Then Miss Bat threw the parlor carpet out of the window , and I was so surprised I had to run and tell you ."
"Now , what had we better do about it ? ''"
"The cats all winked at her , but no one had any advice to offer , except Tobias , who walked to the shelf , and , looking up , uttered a deep , suggestive yowl , which said as plainly as words , `` Dinner first and discussion afterward . ''"
"`` Very well , do n't scramble , '' said Molly , getting up to feed her pets ."
"She stood with her hand on the head of a huge , tawny collie dog ; another dog was sitting on his haunches beside her ."
"She was tall , with a great braid of shining chestnut hair , showing ruddy burnished tints where the sunlight struck it , hanging over her shoulder ."
The plain dark dress she wore emphasized the grace and strength of her supple form .
"Her face was oval and pale , with straight black brows and a finely cut crimson mouth -- a face whose beauty bore the indefinable stamp of race and breeding mingled with a wild sweetness , as of a flower growing in some lonely and inaccessible place ."
None of the Rexton girls looked like that .
"Who , in the name of all that was amazing , could she be ?"
"As the thought crossed Alan 's mind the girl turned , with an air of indifference that might have seemed slightly overdone to a calmer observer than was the young minister at that moment and , with a gesture of command to her dogs , walked quickly away into the scrub spruces ."
"She was so tall that her uncovered head was visible over them as she followed some winding footpath , and Alan stood like a man rooted to the ground until he saw her enter the grey house ."
"Then he went homeward in a maze , all thought of sermons , doctrinal or otherwise , for the moment knocked out of his head ."
"She is the most beautiful woman I ever saw , he thought ."
How is it possible that I have lived in Rexton for six months and never heard of her or of that house ?
"Well , I daresay there 's some simple explanation of it all ."
The place may have been unoccupied until lately -- probably it is the summer residence of people who have only recently come to it .
I 'll ask Mrs. Danby .
She 'll know if anybody will .
That good woman knows everything about everybody in Rexton for three generations back .
Alan found Isabel King with his housekeeper when he got home .
His greeting was tinged with a slight constraint .
"He was not a vain man , but he could not help knowing that Isabel looked upon him with a favour that had in it much more than professional interest ."
Isabel herself showed it with sufficient distinctness .
"Moreover , he felt a certain personal dislike of her and of her hard , insistent beauty , which seemed harder and more insistent than ever contrasted with his recollection of the girl of the lake shore ."
Isabel had a trick of coming to the manse on plausible errands to Mrs. Danby and lingering until it was so dark that Alan was in courtesy bound to see her home .
"The ruse was a little too patent and amused Alan , although he carefully hid his amusement and treated Isabel with the fine unvarying deference which his mother had engrained into him for womanhood -- a deference that flattered Isabel even while it annoyed her with the sense of a barrier which she could not break down or pass ."
"She was the daughter of the richest man in Rexton and inclined to give herself airs on that account , but Alan 's gentle indifference always brought home to her an unwelcome feeling of inferiority ."
"`` You 've been tiring yourself out again tramping that lake shore , I suppose , '' said Mrs. Danby , who had kept house for three bachelor ministers and consequently felt entitled to hector them in a somewhat maternal fashion ."
"`` Not tiring myself -- resting and refreshing myself rather , '' smiled Alan ."
`` I was tired when I went out but now I feel like a strong man rejoicing to run a race .
"By the way , Mrs. Danby , who lives in that quaint old house away down at the very shore ?"
I never knew of its existence before . ''
Alan 's `` by the way '' was not quite so indifferent as he tried to make it .
"Isabel King , leaning back posingly among the cushions of the lounge , sat quickly up as he asked his question ."
"`` Dear me , you do n't mean to say you 've never heard of Captain Anthony -- Captain Anthony Oliver ? ''"
"I shall be sure to come to grief , and then every one will say , ' I told you so , ' and that is so provoking ."
I 'd rather keep still a week longer .
Had n't I better ? ''
"His mother smiled and nodded as she said , sewing away at much-abused old Caesar , as if she loved him , `` Do as you think best , dear ."
"I always want you at home , but I do n't wonder you are rather tired of it after this long confinement . ''"
"`` I say , Jill , should I be in your way if I did n't go to school till the first of February ? ''"
"called Jack , laughing to himself at the absurdity of the question ."
`` Not much ! ''
"answered a glad voice from behind the screen , and he knew the sorrowful eyes were shining with delight , though he could not see them ."
"`` Well , I guess I may as well , and get quite firm on my legs before I start ."
"Another week or so will bring me up if I study hard , so I shall not lose my time ."
"I 'll tackle my Latin as soon as it 's ready , mother . ''"
"Jack got a hearty kiss with the neatly covered book , and Mamma loved him for the little sacrifice more than if he had won a prize at school ."
"He did get a reward , for , in five minutes from the time he decided , Jill was singing like a bobolink , and such a medley of merry music came from behind the screen , that it was a regular morning concert ."
"She did not know then that he stayed for her sake , but she found it out soon after , and when the time came did as much for him , as we shall see ."
"It proved a wise decision , for the last part of January was so stormy Jack could not have gone half the time ."
"So , while the snow drifted , and bitter winds raged , he sat snugly at home amusing Jill , and getting on bravely with his lessons , for Frank took great pains with him to show his approbation of the little kindness , and , somehow , the memory of it seemed to make even the detested Latin easier ."
"With February fair weather set in , and Jack marched happily away to school , with Jill 's new mittens on his hands , Mamma nodding from the door-step , and Frank ready to give him a lift on the new sled , if the way proved too long or too rough ."
"`` I shall not have time to miss him now , for we are to be very busy getting ready for the Twenty-second ."
"The Dramatic Club meets to-night , and would like to come here , if they may , so I can help ? ''"
"said Jill , as Mrs. Minot came up , expecting to find her rather low in her mind ."
"`` Certainly ; and I have a basket of old finery I looked up for the club when I was rummaging out bits of silk for your blue quilt , '' answered the good lady , who had set up a new employment to beguile the hours of Jack 's absence ."
"When the girls arrived , that evening , they found Mrs. Chairwoman surrounded by a strew of theatrical properties , enjoying herself very much ."
"All brought such contributions as they could muster , and all were eager about a certain tableau which was to be the gem of the whole , they thought ."
"Jill , of course , was not expected to take any part , but her taste was good , so all consulted her as they showed their old silks , laces , and flowers , asking who should be this , and who that ."
"All wanted to be the `` Sleeping Beauty , '' for that was the chosen scene , with the slumbering court about the princess , and the prince in the act of awakening her ."
"Jack was to be the hero , brave in his mother 's velvet cape , red boots , and a real sword , while the other boys were to have parts of more or less splendor ."
"`` Mabel should be the Beauty , because her hair is so lovely , '' said Juliet , who was quite satisfied with her own part of the Queen ."
"`` No , Merry ought to have it , as she is the prettiest , and has that splendid veil to wear , '' answered Molly , who was to be the maid of honor , cuffing the little page , Boo ."
"`` I do n't care a bit , but my feather would be fine for the Princess , and I do n't know as Emma would like to have me lend it to any one else , '' said Annette , waving a long white plume over her head , with girlish delight in its grace ."
"`` I should think the white silk dress , the veil , and the feather ought to go together , with the scarlet crape shawl and these pearls ."
"That would be sweet , and just what princesses really wear , '' advised Jill , who was stringing a quantity of old Roman pearls ."
"He gave it me at Savannah , when he lay a-dying , like as if I was to now , you see ."
"But you wo n't peach unless they get the black spot on me , or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg , Jim -- him above all . ''"
"`` But what is the black spot , captain ? ''"
I asked .
"`` That 's a summons , mate ."
I 'll tell you if they get that .
"But you keep your weather-eye open , Jim , and I 'll share with you equals , upon my honour . ''"
"He wandered a little longer , his voice growing weaker ; but soon after I had given him his medicine , which he took like a child , with the remark , `` If ever a seaman wanted drugs , it 's me , '' he fell at last into a heavy , swoon-like sleep , in which I left him ."
What I should have done had all gone well I do not know .
"Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor , for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me ."
"But as things fell out , my poor father died quite suddenly that evening , which put all other matters on one side ."
"Our natural distress , the visits of the neighbours , the arranging of the funeral , and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain , far less to be afraid of him ."
"He got downstairs next morning , to be sure , and had his meals as usual , though he ate little and had more , I am afraid , than his usual supply of rum , for he helped himself out of the bar , scowling and blowing through his nose , and no one dared to cross him ."
"On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever ; and it was shocking , in that house of mourning , to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song ; but weak as he was , we were all in the fear of death for him , and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father 's death ."
"I have said the captain was weak , and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength ."
"He clambered up and down stairs , and went from the parlour to the bar and back again , and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea , holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain ."
"He never particularly addressed me , and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences ; but his temper was more flighty , and allowing for his bodily weakness , more violent than ever ."
He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table .
"But with all that , he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering ."
"Once , for instance , to our extreme wonder , he piped up to a different air , a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea ."
"So things passed until , the day after the funeral , and about three o'clock of a bitter , foggy , frosty afternoon , I was standing at the door for a moment , full of sad thoughts about my father , when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road ."
"He was plainly blind , for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose ; and he was hunched , as if with age or weakness , and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed ."
I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure .
"He stopped a little from the inn , and raising his voice in an odd sing-song , addressed the air in front of him , `` Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man , who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country , England -- and God bless King George !"
-- where or in what part of this country he may now be ? ''
"`` You are at the Admiral Benbow , Black Hill Cove , my good man , '' said I. `` I hear a voice , '' said he , `` a young voice ."
"Will you give me your hand , my kind young friend , and lead me in ? ''"
"I held out my hand , and the horrible , soft-spoken , eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise ."
"I was so much startled that I struggled to withdraw , but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm ."
"`` Now , boy , '' he said , `` take me in to the captain . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` upon my word I dare not . ''"
"`` Oh , '' he sneered , `` that 's it !"
"Make Jack own up , whether he can or not ."
Little donkey ! ''
"stormed Frank , who hated rowdies and could not forgive his brother for being seen with one ."
"`` My dear , all boys do foolish things sometimes , even the wisest and best behaved , so do n't be hard on the poor child ."
"He has got into trouble , I 've no doubt , but it can not be very bad , and he earned the money to pay for his prank , whatever it was . ''"
"Mrs. Minot left the room as she spoke , and Frank cooled down as if her words had been a shower-bath , for he remembered his own costly escapade , and how kindly both his mother and Jack had stood by him on that trying occasion ."
"So , feeling rather remorseful , he went off to talk it over with Gus , leaving Jill in a fever of curiosity , for Merry and Molly had dropped in on their way home to break the blow to her , and Frank declined to discuss it with her , after mildly stating that Jack was `` a ninny , '' in his opinion ."
"`` Well , I know one thing , '' said Jill confidentially to Snow-ball , when they were left alone together , `` if every one else is scolding him I wo n't say a word ."
"It 's so mean to crow over people when they are down , and I 'm sure he has n't done anything to be ashamed of , though he wo n't tell . ''"
"Snow-ball seemed to agree to this , for he went and sat down by Jack 's slippers waiting for him on the hearth , and Jill thought that a very touching proof of affectionate fidelity to the little master who ruled them both ."
"When he came , it was evident that he had found it harder to refuse his mother than all the rest ."
"But she trusted him in spite of appearances , and that was such a comfort !"
"For poor Jack 's heart was very full , and he longed to tell the whole story , but he would not break his promise , and so kept silence bravely ."
"Jill asked no questions , affecting to be anxious for the games they always played together in the evening , but while they played , though the lips were sealed , the bright eyes said as plainly as words , `` I trust you , '' and Jack was very grateful ."
"It was well he had something to cheer him up at home , for he got little peace at school ."
"He bore the grave looks of Mr. Acton meekly , took the boys ' jokes good-naturedly , and withstood the artful teasing of the girls with patient silence ."
"But it was very hard for the social , affectionate fellow to bear the general distrust , for he had been such a favorite he felt the change keenly ."
But the thing that tried him most was the knowledge that his report would not be what it usually was .
"It was always a happy moment when he showed it to his mother , and saw her eye brighten as it fell on the 99 or 100 , for she cared more for good behavior than for perfect lessons ."
"Mr. Acton once said that Frank Minot 's moral influence in the school was unusual , and Jack never forgot her pride and delight as she told them what Frank himself had not known till then ."
"It was Jack 's ambition to have the same said of him , for he was not much of a scholar , and he had tried hard since he went back to school to get good records in that respect at least ."
"Now here was a dreadful downfall , tardy marks , bad company , broken rules , and something too wrong to tell , apparently ."
"`` Well , I deserve a good report , and that 's a comfort , though nobody believes it , '' he said to himself , trying to keep up his spirits , as the slow week went by , and no word from him had cleared up the mystery ."
Chapter XIV .
"And Jill Finds It Out Jill worried about it more than he did , for she was a faithful little friend , and it was a great trial to have Jack even suspected of doing anything wrong ."
"School is a child 's world while he is there , and its small affairs are very important to him , so Jill felt that the one thing to be done was to clear away the cloud about her dear boy , and restore him to public favor ."
"`` Ed will be here Saturday night and may be he will find out , for Jack tells him everything ."
"I do hate to have him hectored so , for I know he is , though he 's too proud to complain , '' she said , on Thursday evening , when Frank told her some joke played upon his brother that day ."
"`` I let him alone , but I see that he is n't badgered too much ."
That 's all I can do .
"If Ed had only come home last Saturday it might have done some good , but now it will be too late ; for the reports are given out to-morrow , you know , '' answered Frank , feeling a little jealous of Ed 's influence over Jack , though his own would have been as great if he had been as gentle ."
`` Has Jerry come back ? ''
They paused in shelter of the garden wall to consult on their best course .
The danger was extreme .
"If one of Sir Daniel 's men caught sight of them and raised the view-hallo , they would be run down and butchered instantly ."
"And not only was the town of Shoreby a mere net of peril for their lives , but to make for the open country was to run the risk of the patrols ."
"A little way off , upon some open ground , they spied a windmill standing ; and hard by that , a very large granary with open doors ."
`` How if we lay there until the night fall ? ''
Dick proposed .
"And Lawless having no better suggestion to offer , they made a straight push for the granary at a run , and concealed themselves behind the door among some straw ."
The daylight rapidly departed ; and presently the moon was silvering the frozen snow .
Now or never was their opportunity to gain the Goat and Bagpipes unobserved and change their tell-tale garments .
"Yet even then it was advisable to go round by the outskirts , and not run the gauntlet of the market-place , where , in the concourse of people , they stood the more imminent peril to be recognised and slain ."
This course was a long one .
"It took them not far from the house by the beach , now lying dark and silent , and brought them forth at last by the margin of the harbour ."
"Many of the ships , as they could see by the clear moonshine , had weighed anchor , and , profiting by the calm sky , proceeded for more distant parts ; answerably to this , the rude alehouses along the beach -LRB- although in defiance of the curfew law , they still shone with fire and candle -RRB- were no longer thronged with customers , and no longer echoed to the chorus of sea-songs ."
"Hastily , half-running , with their monkish raiment kilted to the knee , they plunged through the deep snow and threaded the labyrinth of marine lumber ; and they were already more than half way round the harbour when , as they were passing close before an alehouse , the door suddenly opened and let out a gush of light upon their fleeting figures ."
"Instantly they stopped , and made believe to be engaged in earnest conversation ."
"Three men , one after another , came out of the ale-house , and the last closed the door behind him ."
"All three were unsteady upon their feet , as if they had passed the day in deep potations , and they now stood wavering in the moonlight , like men who knew not what they would be after ."
"The tallest of the three was talking in a loud , lamentable voice ."
"`` Seven pieces of as good Gascony as ever a tapster broached , '' he was saying , `` the best ship out o ' the port o ' Dartmouth , a Virgin Mary parcel-gilt , thirteen pounds of good gold money -- '' `` I have bad losses , too , '' interrupted one of the others ."
"`` I have had losses of mine own , gossip Arblaster ."
I was robbed at Martinmas of five shillings and a leather wallet well worth ninepence farthing . ''
Dick 's heart smote him at what he heard .
"Until that moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the loss of the Good Hope ; so careless , in those days , were men who wore arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors ."
"But this sudden encounter reminded him sharply of the high-handed manner and ill-ending of his enterprise ; and both he and Lawless turned their heads the other way , to avoid the chance of recognition ."
"The ship 's dog had , however , made his escape from the wreck and found his way back again to Shoreby ."
"He was now at Arblaster 's heels , and suddenly sniffing and pricking his ears , he darted forward and began to bark furiously at the two sham friars ."
His master unsteadily followed him .
"`` Hey , shipmates ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Have ye ever a penny pie for a poor old shipman , clean destroyed by pirates ?"
"I am a man that would have paid for you both o ' Thursday morning ; and now here I be , o ' Saturday night , begging for a flagon of ale !"
"I 'll watch the door , for I wo n't have any more ridiculous boys tearing in to disturb my lady . ''"
"Mrs. Pecq often called this good neighbor `` my lady '' when speaking of her , for Mrs. Minot was a true gentlewoman , and much pleasanter to live with than the titled mistress had been ."
"Joe scudded away as if the constable was after him , and presently Frank was seen slowly approaching with an unusually sober face and a pair of very dirty hands ."
"`` Thank heaven , he 's safe ! ''"
"and , softly opening the door , Mrs. Pecq actually hustled the young master into the ante-room as unceremoniously as she had hustled Joe ."
"`` I beg pardon , but the parlor is full of company , and that fool of a Joe came roaring in with a cock-and-bull story that gave me quite a turn ."
"What is it , Mr. Frank ? ''"
"she asked eagerly , seeing that something was amiss ."
"He told her in a few words , and she was much relieved to find that no harm had been done ."
"`` Ah , the danger is to come , '' said Frank , darkly , as he went away to wash his hands and prepare to relate his misdeeds ."
"It was a very bad quarter of an hour for the poor fellow , who so seldom had any grave faults to confess ; but he did it manfully , and his mother was so grateful for the safety of her boy that she found it difficult to be severe enough , and contented herself with forbidding any more visits to the too charming No. 11 ."
`` What do you suppose will be done to me ? ''
"asked Frank , on whom the idea of imprisonment had made a deep impression ."
"`` I do n't know , dear , but I shall go over to see Mr. Burton right after tea ."
He will tell us what to do and what to expect .
Gus must not suffer for your fault . ''
"`` He 'll come off clear enough , but Joe must take his share , for if he had n't opened that confounded switch , no harm would have been done ."
"But when I saw the way clear , I actually could n't resist going ahead , '' said Frank , getting excited again at the memory of that blissful moment when he started the engine ."
"Here Jack came hurrying in , having heard the news , and refused to believe it from any lips but Frank 's ."
"When he could no longer doubt , he was so much impressed with the daring of the deed that he had nothing but admiration for his brother , till a sudden thought made him clap his hands and exclaim exultingly , -- `` His runaway beats mine all hollow , and now he ca n't crow over me !"
Wo n't that be a comfort ?
The good boy has got into a scrape .
Hooray ! ''
"This was such a droll way of taking it , that they had to laugh ; and Frank took his humiliation so meekly that Jack soon fell to comforting him , instead of crowing over him ."
"Jill thought it a most interesting event ; and , when Frank and his mother went over to consult Mr. Burton , she and Jack planned out for the dear culprit a dramatic trial which would have convulsed the soberest of judges ."
"His sentence was ten years ' imprisonment , and such heavy fines that the family would have been reduced to beggary but for the sums made by Jill 's fancy work and Jack 's success as a champion pedestrian ."
"They found such comfort and amusement in this sensational programme that they were rather disappointed when Frank returned , reporting that a fine would probably be all the penalty exacted , as no harm had been done , and he and Gus were such respectable boys ."
"What would happen to Joe , he could not tell , but he thought a good whipping ought to be added to his share ."
"Of course , the affair made a stir in the little world of children ; and when Frank went to school , feeling that his character for good behavior was forever damaged , he found himself a lion , and was in danger of being spoiled by the admiration of his comrades , who pointed him out with pride as `` the fellow who ran off with a steam-engine . ''"
"But an interview with Judge Kemble , a fine of twenty-five dollars , and lectures from all the grown people of his acquaintance , prevented him from regarding his escapade as a feat to boast of ."
"He discovered , also , how fickle a thing is public favor , for very soon those who had praised began to tease , and it took all his courage , patience , and pride to carry him through the next week or two ."
"The lads were never tired of alluding to No. 11 , giving shrill whistles in his ear , asking if his watch was right , and drawing locomotives on the blackboard whenever they got a chance ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but however , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else .
"`` Oh , you darling , oh , you sweet , oh , you love ! ''"
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm fight was waning too , but it was still there ."
"`` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! ''"
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , `` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , '' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"Lock-out Time It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
"They usually pretend to be flowers , because the court sits in the Fairies ' Basin , and there are so many flowers there , and all along the Baby Walk , that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention ."
"They dress exactly like flowers , and change with the seasons , putting on white when lilies are in and blue for blue-bells , and so on ."
"They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all , as they are partial to a bit of colour , but tulips -LRB- except white ones , which are the fairy-cradles -RRB- they consider garish , and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days , so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them ."
"When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively , but if you look and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still , pretending to be flowers ."
"Then , after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies , they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure ."
"The Fairy Basin , you remember , is all covered with ground-ivy -LRB- from which they make their castor-oil -RRB- , with flowers growing in it here and there ."
"Most of them really are flowers , but some of them are fairies ."
"You never can be sure of them , but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way , and then turn round sharply ."
Down there by the lake was a primitive wilderness where man was as naught and man-made doctrines had no place .
There one might walk hand in hand with nature and so come very close to God .
"Many of Alan 's best sermons were written after he had come home , rapt-eyed , from some long shore tramp where the wilderness had opened its heart to him and the pines had called to him in their soft , sibilant speech ."
"With a half guilty glance at the futile sermon , he took his hat and went out ."
"The sun of the cool spring evening was swinging low over the lake as he turned into the unfrequented , deep-rutted road leading to the shore ."
"It was two miles to the lake , but half way there Alan came to where another road branched off and struck down through the pines in a northeasterly direction ."
He had sometimes wondered where it led but he had never explored it .
Now he had a sudden whim to do so and turned into it .
"It was even rougher and lonelier than the other ; between the ruts the grasses grew long and thickly ; sometimes the pine boughs met overhead ; again , the trees broke away to reveal wonderful glimpses of gleaming water , purple islets , dark feathery coasts ."
"Still , the road seemed to lead nowhere and Alan was half repenting the impulse which had led him to choose it when he suddenly came out from the shadow of the pines and found himself gazing on a sight which amazed him ."
Before him was a small peninsula running out into the lake and terminating in a long sandy point .
Beyond it was a glorious sweep of sunset water .
"The peninsula itself seemed barren and sandy , covered for the most part with scrub firs and spruces , through which the narrow road wound on to what was the astonishing ; feature in the landscape -- a grey and weather-beaten house built almost at the extremity of the point and shadowed from the western light by a thick plantation of tall pines behind it ."
It was the house which puzzled Alan .
"He had never known there was any house near the lake shore -- had never heard mention made of any ; yet here was one , and one which was evidently occupied , for a slender spiral of smoke was curling upward from it on the chilly spring air ."
"It could not be a fisherman 's dwelling , for it was large and built after a quaint tasteful design ."
The longer Alan looked at it the more his wonder grew .
The people living here were in the bounds of his congregation .
How then was it that he had never seen or heard of them ?
He sauntered slowly down the road until he saw that it led directly to the house and ended in the yard .
Then he turned off in a narrow path to the shore .
He was not far from the house now and he scanned it observantly as he went past .
"The barrens swept almost up to its door in front but at the side , sheltered from the lake winds by the pines , was a garden where there was a fine show of gay tulips and golden daffodils ."
"No living creature was visible and , in spite of the blossoming geraniums and muslin curtains at the windows and the homely spiral of smoke , the place had a lonely , almost untenanted , look ."
When Alan reached the shore he found that it was of a much more open and less rocky nature than the part which he had been used to frequent .
The beach was of sand and the scrub barrens dwindled down to it almost insensibly .
"To right and left fir-fringed points ran out into the lake , shaping a little cove with the house in its curve ."
"Alan walked slowly towards the left headland , intending to follow the shore around to the other road ."
As he passed the point he stopped short in astonishment .
The second surprise and mystery of the evening confronted him .
A little distance away a girl was standing -- a girl who turned a startled face at his unexpected appearance .
"Alan Douglas had thought he knew all the girls in Rexton , but this lithe , glorious creature was a stranger to him ."
"But presently the little troop began again to move forward , and came next to a very open , heathy portion of the way , where but a single tongue of forest ran down to join the road ."
"They were but just abreast of this , when an arrow shone flying ."
"One of the men threw up his arms , his horse reared , and both fell and struggled together in a mass ."
"Even from where the boys lay they could hear the rumour of the men 's voices crying out ; they could see the startled horses prancing , and , presently , as the troop began to recover from their first surprise , one fellow beginning to dismount ."
A second arrow from somewhat farther off glanced in a wide arch ; a second rider bit the dust .
"The man who was dismounting lost hold upon the rein , and his horse fled galloping , and dragged him by the foot along the road , bumping from stone to stone , and battered by the fleeing hoofs ."
"The four who still kept the saddle instantly broke and scattered ; one wheeled and rode , shrieking , towards the ferry ; the other three , with loose rein and flying raiment , came galloping up the road from Tunstall ."
From every clump they passed an arrow sped .
"Soon a horse fell , but the rider found his feet and continued to pursue his comrades till a second shot despatched him ."
"Another man fell ; then another horse ; out of the whole troop there was but one fellow left , and he on foot ; only , in different directions , the noise of the galloping of three riderless horses was dying fast into the distance ."
All this time not one of the assailants had for a moment shown himself .
"Here and there along the path , horse or man rolled , undespatched , in his agony ; but no merciful enemy broke cover to put them from their pain ."
The solitary survivor stood bewildered in the road beside his fallen charger .
"He had come the length of that broad glade , with the island of timber , pointed out by Dick ."
"He was not , perhaps , five hundred yards from where the boys lay hidden ; and they could see him plainly , looking to and fro in deadly expectation ."
"But nothing came ; and the man began to pluck up his courage , and suddenly unslung and bent his bow ."
"At the same time , by something in his action , Dick recognised Selden ."
"At this offer of resistance , from all about him in the covert of the woods there went up the sound of laughter ."
"A score of men , at least , for this was the very thickest of the ambush , joined in this cruel and untimely mirth ."
Then an arrow glanced over Selden 's shoulder ; and he leaped and ran a little back .
Another dart struck quivering at his heel .
He made for the cover .
"A third shaft leaped out right in his face , and fell short in front of him ."
"And then the laughter was repeated loudly , rising and reechoing from different thickets ."
"It was plain that his assailants were but baiting him , as men , in those days , baited the poor bull , or as the cat still trifles with the mouse ."
"The skirmish was well over ; farther down the road , a fellow in green was already calmly gathering the arrows ; and now , in the evil pleasure of their hearts , they gave themselves the spectacle of their poor fellow-sinner in his torture ."
"Selden began to understand ; he uttered a roar of anger , shouldered his cross-bow , and sent a quarrel at a venture into the wood ."
"Chance favoured him , for a slight cry responded ."
"Then , throwing down his weapon , Selden began to run before him up the glade , and almost in a straight line for Dick and Matcham ."
The companions of the Black Arrow now began to shoot in earnest .
"But they were properly served ; their chance had past ; most of them had now to shoot against the sun ; and Selden , as he ran , bounded from side to side to baffle and deceive their aim ."
"Best of all , by turning up the glade he had defeated their preparations ; there were no marksmen posted higher up than the one whom he had just killed or wounded ; and the confusion of the foresters ' counsels soon became apparent ."
"It was high time , for I now began to be tortured with thirst ."
"The glow of the sun from above , its thousandfold reflection from the waves , the sea-water that fell and dried upon me , caking my very lips with salt , combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache ."
"The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing , but the current had soon carried me past the point , and as the next reach of sea opened out , I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts ."
"Right in front of me , not half a mile away , I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail ."
"I made sure , of course , that I should be taken ; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought , and long before I had come to a conclusion , surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder ."
"The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs , and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver ."
"When I first sighted her , all her sails were drawing ; she was lying a course about north-west , and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage ."
"Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward , so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase ."
"At last , however , she fell right into the wind 's eye , was taken dead aback , and stood there awhile helpless , with her sails shivering ."
"`` Clumsy fellows , '' said I ; `` they must still be drunk as owls . ''"
And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping .
"Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack , sailed swiftly for a minute or so , and brought up once more dead in the wind 's eye ."
Again and again was this repeated .
"To and fro , up and down , north , south , east , and west , the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes , and at each repetition ended as she had begun , with idly flapping canvas ."
It became plain to me that nobody was steering .
"And if so , where were the men ?"
"Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her , I thought , and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain ."
The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate .
"As for the latter 's sailing , it was so wild and intermittent , and she hung each time so long in irons , that she certainly gained nothing , if she did not even lose ."
"If only I dared to sit up and paddle , I made sure that I could overhaul her ."
"The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me , and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage ."
"Up I got , was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray , but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself , with all my strength and caution , to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA ."
"Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail , with my heart fluttering like a bird , but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves , with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face ."
"I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner ; I could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about , and still no soul appeared upon her decks ."
I could not choose but suppose she was deserted .
"If not , the men were lying drunk below , where I might batten them down , perhaps , and do what I chose with the ship ."
For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me -- standing still .
"She headed nearly due south , yawing , of course , all the time ."
"Each time she fell off , her sails partly filled , and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again ."
"I have said this was the worst thing possible for me , for helpless as she looked in this situation , with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck , she still continued to run away from me , not only with the speed of the current , but by the whole amount of her leeway , which was naturally great ."
"But now , at last , I had my chance ."
"The breeze fell for some seconds , very low , and the current gradually turning her , the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern , with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day ."
"Deep silence reigned , for that threat quelled the most impatient member , and Joe prosed on , using all the arguments he had ever heard , and paying off several old scores by sly hits of a personal nature , as older orators often do ."
`` It is clear to my mind that boys would get on better without any girls fooling round .
"As for their being as smart as we are , it is all nonsense , for some of 'em cry over their lessons every day , or go home with headaches , or get mad and scold all recess , because something ` is n't fair . '"
"No , sir ; girls ai n't meant to know much , and they ca n't ."
Wise folks say so and I believe 'em .
"Have n't got any sisters myself , and I do n't want any , for they do n't seem to amount to much , according to those who do have 'em . ''"
"Groans from Gus and Ed greeted the closing remarks of the ungallant Joe , who sat down , feeling that he had made somebody squirm ."
"Up jumped Grif , the delight of whose life was practical jokes , which amiable weakness made him the terror of the girls , though they had no other fault to find with the merry lad ."
"`` Mr. Chairman , the ground I take is this : girls have not the strength to go to college with us ."
"They could n't row a race , go on a lark , or take care of themselves , as we do ."
"They are all well enough at home , and I like them at parties , but for real fun and go I would n't give a cent for them , '' began Grif , whose views of a collegiate life were confined to the enjoyments rather than the studies of that festive period ."
"`` I have tried them , and they ca n't stand anything ."
"They scream if you tell them there is a mouse in the room , and run if they see a big dog ."
"I just put a cockroach in Molly 's desk one day , and when she opened it she jumped as if she was shot . ''"
"So did the gentlemen of the club , for at that moment half-a-dozen fire-crackers exploded under the chair Grif had left , and flew wildly about the room ."
"Order was with difficulty restored , the mischievous party summarily chastised and commanded to hold his tongue , under penalty of ejectment from the room if he spoke again ."
"Firmly grasping that red and unruly member , Grif composed himself to listen , with his nose in the air and his eyes shining like black beads ."
"Ed was always the peace-maker , and now , when he rose with his engaging smile , his voice fell like oil upon the troubled waters , and his bright face was full of the becoming bashfulness which afflicts youths of seventeen when touching upon such subjects of newly acquired interest as girls and their pleasant but perplexing ways ."
`` It seems to me we have hardly considered the matter enough to be able to say much .
But I think that school would be awfully dry and dismal without -- ahem !
-- any young ladies to make it nice .
"I would n't give a pin to go if there was only a crowd of fellows , though I like a good game as well as any man ."
"I pity any boy who has no sisters , '' continued Ed , warming up as he thought of his own , who loved him dearly , as well they might , for a better brother never lived ."
"`` Home would n't be worth having without them to look after a fellow , to keep him out of scrapes , help him with his lessons , and make things jolly for his friends ."
"I tell you we ca n't do without girls , and I 'm not ashamed to say that I think the more we see of them , and try to be like them in many ways , the better men we shall be by and by . ''"
`` Hear !
hear ! ''
"cried Frank , in his deepest tone , for he heartily agreed to that , having talked the matter over with his mother , and received much light upon things which should always be set right in young heads and hearts ."
"And who can do this so wisely and well as mothers , if they only will ?"
"Feeling that his sentiments had been approved , and he need not be ashamed of the honest color in his cheeks , Ed sat down amid the applause of his side , especially of Jack , who pounded so vigorously with his crutch that Mrs. Pecq popped in her head to see if anything was wanted ."
"`` No , thank you , ma'am , we were only cheering Ed , '' said Gus , now upon his legs , and rather at a loss what to say till Mrs. Pecq 's appearance suggested an idea , and he seized upon it ."
`` My honored friend has spoken so well that I have little to add .
"The first peep of morning , then , showed us this horrible place , and I could see Alan knit his brow ."
"`` This is no fit place for you and me , '' he said ."
`` This is a place they 're bound to watch . ''
"And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side , in a part where the river was split in two among three rocks ."
It went through with a horrid thundering that made my belly quake ; and there hung over the lynn a little mist of spray .
"Alan looked neither to the right nor to the left , but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and knees to check himself , for that rock was small and he might have pitched over on the far side ."
"I had scarce time to measure the distance or to understand the peril before I had followed him , and he had caught and stopped me ."
"So there we stood , side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray , a far broader leap in front of us , and the river dinning upon all sides ."
"When I saw where I was , there came on me a deadly sickness of fear , and I put my hand over my eyes ."
"Alan took me and shook me ; I saw he was speaking , but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind prevented me from hearing ; only I saw his face was red with anger , and that he stamped upon the rock ."
"The same look showed me the water raging by , and the mist hanging in the air : and with that I covered my eyes again and shuddered ."
"The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips , and forced me to drink about a gill , which sent the blood into my head again ."
"Then , putting his hands to his mouth , and his mouth to my ear , he shouted , `` Hang or drown ! ''"
"and turning his back upon me , leaped over the farther branch of the stream , and landed safe ."
"I was now alone upon the rock , which gave me the more room ; the brandy was singing in my ears ; I had this good example fresh before me , and just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once , I should never leap at all ."
"I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth , with that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of courage ."
"Sure enough , it was but my hands that reached the full length ; these slipped , caught again , slipped again ; and I was sliddering back into the lynn , when Alan seized me , first by the hair , then by the collar , and with a great strain dragged me into safety ."
"Never a word he said , but set off running again for his life , and I must stagger to my feet and run after him ."
"I had been weary before , but now I was sick and bruised , and partly drunken with the brandy ; I kept stumbling as I ran , I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me ; and when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a number of others , it was none too soon for David Balfour ."
"A great rock I have said ; but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at the top , both some twenty feet high , and at the first sight inaccessible ."
"Even Alan -LRB- though you may say he had as good as four hands -RRB- failed twice in an attempt to climb them ; and it was only at the third trial , and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone , that he secured a lodgment ."
"Once there , he let down his leathern girdle ; and with the aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock , I scrambled up beside him ."
"Then I saw why we had come there ; for the two rocks , being both somewhat hollow on the top and sloping one to the other , made a kind of dish or saucer , where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden ."
"All this while Alan had not said a word , and had run and climbed with such a savage , silent frenzy of hurry , that I knew that he was in mortal fear of some miscarriage ."
"Even now we were on the rock he said nothing , nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face ; but clapped flat down , and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter scouted all round the compass ."
"The dawn had come quite clear ; we could see the stony sides of the valley , and its bottom , which was bestrewed with rocks , and the river , which went from one side to another , and made white falls ; but nowhere the smoke of a house , nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round a cliff ."
Then at last Alan smiled .
"`` Ay '' said he , `` now we have a chance ; '' and then looking at me with some amusement , `` Ye 're no very gleg * at the jumping , '' said he ."
* Brisk .
"At this I suppose I coloured with mortification , for he added at once , `` Hoots !"
small blame to ye !
"To be feared of a thing and yet to do it , is what makes the prettiest kind of a man ."
"Hook , of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared ."
"He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men , and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace ."
"As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them , and as dogs they obeyed him ."
"In person he was cadaverous and blackavized , and his hair was dressed in long curls , which at a little distance looked like black candles , and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance ."
"His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not , and of a profound melancholy , save when he was plunging his hook into you , at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly ."
"In manner , something of the grand seigneur still clung to him , so that he even ripped you up with an air , and I have been told that he was a raconteur of repute ."
"He was never more sinister than when he was most polite , which is probably the truest test of breeding ; and the elegance of his diction , even when he was swearing , no less than the distinction of his demeanour , showed him one of a different caste from his crew ."
"A man of indomitable courage , it was said of him that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood , which was thick and of an unusual colour ."
"In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II. , having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts ; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once ."
But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw .
"Let us now kill a pirate , to show Hook 's method ."
Skylights will do .
"As they pass , Skylights lurches clumsily against him , ruffling his lace collar ; the hook shoots forth , there is a tearing sound and one screech , then the body is kicked aside , and the pirates pass on ."
He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth .
Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted .
Which will win ?
"On the trail of the pirates , stealing noiselessly down the war-path , which is not visible to inexperienced eyes , come the redskins , every one of them with his eyes peeled ."
"They carry tomahawks and knives , and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil ."
"Strung around them are scalps , of boys as well as of pirates , for these are the Piccaninny tribe , and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons ."
"In the van , on all fours , is Great Big Little Panther , a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress ."
"Bringing up the rear , the place of greatest danger , comes Tiger Lily , proudly erect , a princess in her own right ."
"She is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies , coquettish , cold and amorous by turns ; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife , but she staves off the altar with a hatchet ."
Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise .
The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing .
"The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging , but in time they will work this off ."
"For the moment , however , it constitutes their chief danger ."
"The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows , and soon their place is taken by the beasts , a great and motley procession : lions , tigers , bears , and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them , for every kind of beast , and , more particularly ; all the man-eaters , live cheek by jowl on the favoured island ."
"Their tongues are hanging out , they are hungry to-night ."
"When they have passed , comes the last figure of all , a gigantic crocodile ."
We shall see for whom she is looking presently .
"The crocodile passes , but soon the boys appear again , for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace ."
Then quickly they will be on top of each other .
"I now saw there must be a hole , and clapped my hand to the place in a great hurry ."
But this was to lock the stable door after the steed was stolen .
I had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty pounds ; now I found no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver shilling .
"It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after , where it lay shining on a piece of turf ."
"That made a fortune of three pounds and four shillings , English money , for a lad , the rightful heir of an estate , and now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands ."
"This state of my affairs dashed me still further ; and , indeed my plight on that third morning was truly pitiful ."
"My clothes were beginning to rot ; my stockings in particular were quite worn through , so that my shanks went naked ; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual soaking ; my throat was very sore , my strength had much abated , and my heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat , that the very sight of it came near to sicken me ."
And yet the worst was not yet come .
"There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid , which -LRB- because it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound -RRB- I was much in the habit of frequenting ; not that ever I stayed in one place , save when asleep , my misery giving me no rest ."
"Indeed , I wore myself down with continual and aimless goings and comings in the rain ."
"As soon , however , as the sun came out , I lay down on the top of that rock to dry myself ."
The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I can not tell .
"It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance , of which I had begun to despair ; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh interest ."
"On the south of my rock , a part of the island jutted out and hid the open ocean , so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon that side , and I be none the wiser ."
"Well , all of a sudden , a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers aboard of it , came flying round that corner of the isle , bound for Iona ."
"I shouted out , and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my hands and prayed to them ."
"They were near enough to hear -- I could even see the colour of their hair ; and there was no doubt but they observed me , for they cried out in the Gaelic tongue , and laughed ."
"But the boat never turned aside , and flew on , right before my eyes , for Iona ."
"I could not believe such wickedness , and ran along the shore from rock to rock , crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach of my voice , I still cried and waved to them ; and when they were quite gone , I thought my heart would have burst ."
All the time of my troubles I wept only twice .
"Once , when I could not reach the yard , and now , the second time , when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries ."
"But this time I wept and roared like a wicked child , tearing up the turf with my nails , and grinding my face in the earth ."
"If a wish would kill men , those two fishers would never have seen morning , and I should likely have died upon my island ."
"When I was a little over my anger , I must eat again , but with such loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control ."
"Sure enough , I should have done as well to fast , for my fishes poisoned me again ."
"I had all my first pains ; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow ; I had a fit of strong shuddering , which clucked my teeth together ; and there came on me that dreadful sense of illness , which we have no name for either in Scotch or English ."
"I thought I should have died , and made my peace with God , forgiving all men , even my uncle and the fishers ; and as soon as I had thus made up my mind to the worst , clearness came upon me ; I observed the night was falling dry ; my clothes were dried a good deal ; truly , I was in a better case than ever before , since I had landed on the isle ; and so I got to sleep at last , with a thought of gratitude ."
The next day -LRB- which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine -RRB- I found my bodily strength run very low .
"But the sun shone , the air was sweet , and what I managed to eat of the shell-fish agreed well with me and revived my courage ."
"I was scarce back on my rock -LRB- where I went always the first thing after I had eaten -RRB- before I observed a boat coming down the Sound , and with her head , as I thought , in my direction ."
I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly ; for I thought these men might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my assistance .
"But another disappointment , such as yesterday 's , was more than I could bear ."
"Next to his daughter , Balancin loved hunting , and it was his custom to spend several mornings every week chasing the boars which abounded in the mountains a few miles from the city ."
"One day , rushing downhill as fast as he could go , he put his foot into a hole and fell , rolling into a rocky pit of brambles ."
"The king 's wounds were not very severe , but his face and hands were cut and torn , while his feet were in a worse plight still , for , instead of proper hunting boots , he only wore sandals , to enable him to run more swiftly ."
"In a few days the king was as well as ever , and the signs of the scratches were almost gone ; but one foot still remained very sore , where a thorn had pierced deeply and had festered ."
"The best doctors in the kingdom treated it with all their skill ; they bathed , and poulticed , and bandaged , but it was in vain ."
"The foot only grew worse and worse , and became daily more swollen and painful ."
"After everyone had tried his own particular cure , and found it fail , there came news of a wonderful doctor in some distant land who had healed the most astonishing diseases ."
"On inquiring , it was found that he never left the walls of his own city , and expected his patients to come to see him ; but , by dint of offering a large sum of money , the king persuaded the famous physician to undertake the journey to his own court ."
"On his arrival the doctor was led at once into the king 's presence , and made a careful examination of his foot ."
` Alas !
"your majesty , ' he said , when he had finished , ` the wound is beyond the power of man to heal ; but though I can not cure it , I can at least deaden the pain , and enable you to walk without so much suffering . '"
"` Oh , if you can only do that , ' cried the king , ' I shall be grateful to you for life !"
Give your own orders ; they shall be obeyed . '
"` Then let your majesty bid the royal shoemaker make you a shoe of goat-skin very loose and comfortable , while I prepare a varnish to paint over it of which I alone have the secret ! '"
"So saying , the doctor bowed himself out , leaving the king more cheerful and hopeful than he had been for long ."
"The days passed very slowly with him during the making of the shoe and the preparation of the varnish , but on the eighth morning the physician appeared , bringing with him the shoe in a case ."
"He drew it out to slip on the king 's foot , and over the goat-skin he had rubbed a polish so white that the snow itself was not more dazzling ."
"` While you wear this shoe you will not feel the slightest pain , ' said the doctor ."
"` For the balsam with which I have rubbed it inside and out has , besides its healing balm , the quality of strengthening the material it touches , so that , even were your majesty to live a thousand years , you would find the slipper just as fresh at the end of that time as it is now . '"
The king was so eager to put it on that he hardly gave the physician time to finish .
"He snatched it from the case and thrust his foot into it , nearly weeping for joy when he found he could walk and run as easily as any beggar boy ."
` What can I give you ? '
"he cried , holding out both hands to the man who had worked this wonder ."
"` Stay with me , and I will heap on you riches greater than ever you dreamed of . '"
"But the doctor said he would accept nothing more than had been agreed on , and must return at once to his own country , where many sick people were awaiting him ."
"So king Balancin had to content himself with ordering the physician to be treated with royal honours , and desiring that an escort should attend him on his journey home ."
"For two years everything went smoothly at court , and to king Balancin and his daughter the sun no sooner rose than it seemed time for it to set ."
"Now , the king 's birthday fell in the month of June , and as the weather happened to be unusually fine , he told the princess to celebrate it in any way that pleased her ."
"Diamantina was very fond of being on the river , and she was delighted at this chance of delighting her tastes ."
"She would have a merry-making such as never had been seen before , and in the evening , when they were tired of sailing and rowing , there should be music and dancing , plays and fireworks ."
"At the very end , before the people went home , every poor person should be given a loaf of bread and every girl who was to be married within the year a new dress ."
"The great day appeared to Diamantina to be long in coming , but , like other days , it came at last ."
"Even after she was gone , we had nothing to say , as indeed nothing was enough for such a kindness ."
Only Alan stood a great while upon the shore shaking his head .
"`` It is a very fine lass , '' he said at last ."
"`` David , it is a very fine lass . ''"
"And a matter of an hour later , as we were lying in a den on the sea-shore and I had been already dozing , he broke out again in commendations of her character ."
"For my part , I could say nothing , she was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and fear : remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance ; and fear lest we should have anyway involved her in the dangers of our situation ."
"CHAPTER XXVII I COME TO MR. RANKEILLOR The next day it was agreed that Alan should fend for himself till sunset ; but as soon as it began to grow dark , he should lie in the fields by the roadside near to Newhalls , and stir for naught until he heard me whistling ."
"At first I proposed I should give him for a signal the `` Bonnie House of Airlie , '' which was a favourite of mine ; but he objected that as the piece was very commonly known , any ploughman might whistle it by accident ; and taught me instead a little fragment of a Highland air , which has run in my head from that day to this , and will likely run in my head when I lie dying ."
"Every time it comes to me , it takes me off to that last day of my uncertainty , with Alan sitting up in the bottom of the den , whistling and beating the measure with a finger , and the grey of the dawn coming on his face ."
I was in the long street of Queensferry before the sun was up .
"It was a fairly built burgh , the houses of good stone , many slated ; the town-hall not so fine , I thought , as that of Peebles , nor yet the street so noble ; but take it altogether , it put me to shame for my foul tatters ."
"As the morning went on , and the fires began to be kindled , and the windows to open , and the people to appear out of the houses , my concern and despondency grew ever the blacker ."
"I saw now that I had no grounds to stand upon ; and no clear proof of my rights , nor so much as of my own identity ."
"If it was all a bubble , I was indeed sorely cheated and left in a sore pass ."
"Even if things were as I conceived , it would in all likelihood take time to establish my contentions ; and what time had I to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket , and a condemned , hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country ?"
"Truly , if my hope broke with me , it might come to the gallows yet for both of us ."
"And as I continued to walk up and down , and saw people looking askance at me upon the street or out of windows , and nudging or speaking one to another with smiles , I began to take a fresh apprehension : that it might be no easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer , far less to convince him of my story ."
"For the life of me I could not muster up the courage to address any of these reputable burghers ; I thought shame even to speak with them in such a pickle of rags and dirt ; and if I had asked for the house of such a man as Mr. Rankeillor , I suppose they would have burst out laughing in my face ."
"So I went up and down , and through the street , and down to the harbour-side , like a dog that has lost its master , with a strange gnawing in my inwards , and every now and then a movement of despair ."
"It grew to be high day at last , perhaps nine in the forenoon ; and I was worn with these wanderings , and chanced to have stopped in front of a very good house on the landward side , a house with beautiful , clear glass windows , flowering knots upon the sills , the walls new-harled * and a chase-dog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home ."
"Well , I was even envying this dumb brute , when the door fell open and there issued forth a shrewd , ruddy , kindly , consequential man in a well-powdered wig and spectacles ."
"I was in such a plight that no one set eyes on me once , but he looked at me again ; and this gentleman , as it proved , was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight up to me and asked me what I did ."
* Newly rough-cast .
"I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business , and taking heart of grace , asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor ."
"`` Why , '' said he , `` that is his house that I have just come out of ; and for a rather singular chance , I am that very man . ''"
"`` Then , sir , '' said I , `` I have to beg the favour of an interview . ''"
"`` I do not know your name , '' said he , `` nor yet your face . ''"
"`` My name is David Balfour , '' said I. `` David Balfour ? ''"
"he repeated , in rather a high tone , like one surprised ."
"`` And where have you come from , Mr. David Balfour ? ''"
"he asked , looking me pretty drily in the face ."
"`` I have come from a great many strange places , sir , '' said I ; `` but I think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private manner . ''"
"And even as it was , I had paid for it pretty dear , not only in past sufferings , but in my present case ; being clothed like a beggar-man , scarce able to walk , and in great pain of my sore throat ."
"I have seen wicked men and fools , a great many of both ; and I believe they both get paid in the end ; but the fools first ."
"CHAPTER XV THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON : THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL The Ross of Mull , which I had now got upon , was rugged and trackless , like the isle I had just left ; being all bog , and brier , and big stone ."
"There may be roads for them that know that country well ; but for my part I had no better guide than my own nose , and no other landmark than Ben More ."
I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the island ; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or six at night .
"It was low and longish , roofed with turf and built of unmortared stones ; and on a mound in front of it , an old gentleman sat smoking his pipe in the sun ."
"With what little English he had , he gave me to understand that my shipmates had got safe ashore , and had broken bread in that very house on the day after ."
"`` Was there one , '' I asked , `` dressed like a gentleman ? ''"
"He said they all wore rough great-coats ; but to be sure , the first of them , the one that came alone , wore breeches and stockings , while the rest had sailors ' trousers ."
"`` Ah , '' said I , `` and he would have a feathered hat ? ''"
"He told me , no , that he was bareheaded like myself ."
"At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat ; and then the rain came in my mind , and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm 's way under his great-coat ."
"This set me smiling , partly because my friend was safe , partly to think of his vanity in dress ."
"And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow , and cried out that I must be the lad with the silver button ."
"`` Why , yes ! ''"
"said I , in some wonder ."
"`` Well , then , '' said the old gentleman , `` I have a word for you , that you are to follow your friend to his country , by Torosay . ''"
"He then asked me how I had fared , and I told him my tale ."
"A south-country man would certainly have laughed ; but this old gentleman -LRB- I call him so because of his manners , for his clothes were dropping off his back -RRB- heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity ."
"When I had done , he took me by the hand , led me into his hut -LRB- it was no better -RRB- and presented me before his wife , as if she had been the Queen and I a duke ."
"The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse , patting my shoulder and smiling to me all the time , for she had no English ; and the old gentleman -LRB- not to be behind -RRB- brewed me a strong punch out of their country spirit ."
"All the while I was eating , and after that when I was drinking the punch , I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune ; and the house , though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of holes as a colander , seemed like a palace ."
"The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber ; the good people let me lie ; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road , my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and good news ."
"The old gentleman , although I pressed him hard , would take no money , and gave me an old bonnet for my head ; though I am free to own I was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this gift of his in a wayside fountain ."
"Thought I to myself : `` If these are the wild Highlanders , I could wish my own folk wilder . ''"
"I not only started late , but I must have wandered nearly half the time ."
"True , I met plenty of people , grubbing in little miserable fields that would not keep a cat , or herding little kine about the bigness of asses ."
"The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion , and the people condemned to the Lowland habit , which they much disliked , it was strange to see the variety of their array ."
"Some went bare , only for a hanging cloak or great-coat , and carried their trousers on their backs like a useless burthen : some had made an imitation of the tartan with little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife 's quilt ; others , again , still wore the Highland philabeg , but by putting a few stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like a Dutchman 's ."
"All those makeshifts were condemned and punished , for the law was harshly applied , in hopes to break up the clan spirit ; but in that out-of-the-way , sea-bound isle , there were few to make remarks and fewer to tell tales ."
"They seemed in great poverty ; which was no doubt natural , now that rapine was put down , and the chiefs kept no longer an open house ; and the roads -LRB- even such a wandering , country by-track as the one I followed -RRB- were infested with beggars ."
And here again I marked a difference from my own part of the country .
"We set forth accordingly by this itinerary ; and for the best part of three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of wild rivers ; often buried in mist , almost continually blown and rained upon , and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine ."
"By day , we lay and slept in the drenching heather ; by night , incessantly clambered upon break-neck hills and among rude crags ."
"We often wandered ; we were often so involved in fog , that we must lie quiet till it lightened ."
A fire was never to be thought of .
"Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold meat that we had carried from the Cage ; and as for drink , Heaven knows we had no want of water ."
"This was a dreadful time , rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of the weather and the country ."
"I was never warm ; my teeth chattered in my head ; I was troubled with a very sore throat , such as I had on the isle ; I had a painful stitch in my side , which never left me ; and when I slept in my wet bed , with the rain beating above and the mud oozing below me , it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my adventures -- to see the tower of Shaws lit by lightning , Ransome carried below on the men 's backs , Shuan dying on the round-house floor , or Colin Campbell grasping at the bosom of his coat ."
"From such broken slumbers , I would be aroused in the gloaming , to sit up in the same puddle where I had slept , and sup cold drammach ; the rain driving sharp in my face or running down my back in icy trickles ; the mist enfolding us like as in a gloomy chamber -- or , perhaps , if the wind blew , falling suddenly apart and showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying aloud ."
The sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round .
"In this steady rain the springs of the mountain were broken up ; every glen gushed water like a cistern ; every stream was in high spate , and had filled and overflowed its channel ."
"During our night tramps , it was solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys , now booming like thunder , now with an angry cry ."
"I could well understand the story of the Water Kelpie , that demon of the streams , who is fabled to keep wailing and roaring at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller ."
"Alan I saw believed it , or half believed it ; and when the cry of the river rose more than usually sharp , I was little surprised -LRB- though , of course , I would still be shocked -RRB- to see him cross himself in the manner of the Catholics ."
"During all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity , scarcely even that of speech ."
"The truth is that I was sickening for my grave , which is my best excuse ."
"But besides that I was of an unforgiving disposition from my birth , slow to take offence , slower to forget it , and now incensed both against my companion and myself ."
"For the best part of two days he was unweariedly kind ; silent , indeed , but always ready to help , and always hoping -LRB- as I could very well see -RRB- that my displeasure would blow by ."
"For the same length of time I stayed in myself , nursing my anger , roughly refusing his services , and passing him over with my eyes as if he had been a bush or a stone ."
"The second night , or rather the peep of the third day , found us upon a very open hill , so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down immediately to eat and sleep ."
"Before we had reached a place of shelter , the grey had come pretty clear , for though it still rained , the clouds ran higher ; and Alan , looking in my face , showed some marks of concern ."
"`` Ye had better let me take your pack , '' said he , for perhaps the ninth time since we had parted from the scout beside Loch Rannoch ."
"`` I do very well , I thank you , '' said I , as cold as ice ."
Alan flushed darkly .
"`` I 'll not offer it again , '' he said ."
"`` I 'm not a patient man , David . ''"
"`` I never said you were , '' said I , which was exactly the rude , silly speech of a boy of ten ."
"Alan made no answer at the time , but his conduct answered for him ."
"Henceforth , it is to be thought , he quite forgave himself for the affair at Cluny 's ; cocked his hat again , walked jauntily , whistled airs , and looked at me upon one side with a provoking smile ."
The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country of Balquhidder .
"It came clear and cold , with a touch in the air like frost , and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars bright ."
"The streams were full , of course , and still made a great noise among the hills ; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the Kelpie , and was in high good spirits ."
"As for me , the change of weather came too late ; I had lain in the mire so long that -LRB- as the Bible has it -RRB- my very clothes `` abhorred me . ''"
"Just forward of the main-mast I stopped , drew a pistol from my pocket , took a cool aim , though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me , and drew the trigger ."
"The hammer fell , but there followed neither flash nor sound ; the priming was useless with sea-water ."
I cursed myself for my neglect .
"Why had not I , long before , reprimed and reloaded my only weapons ?"
"Then I should not have been as now , a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher ."
"Wounded as he was , it was wonderful how fast he could move , his grizzled hair tumbling over his face , and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury ."
"I had no time to try my other pistol , nor indeed much inclination , for I was sure it would be useless ."
"One thing I saw plainly : I must not simply retreat before him , or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows , as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern ."
"Once so caught , and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity ."
"I placed my palms against the main-mast , which was of a goodish bigness , and waited , every nerve upon the stretch ."
"Seeing that I meant to dodge , he also paused ; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine ."
"It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove , but never before , you may be sure , with such a wildly beating heart as now ."
"Still , as I say , it was a boy 's game , and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh ."
"Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair , and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long , I saw no hope of any ultimate escape ."
"Well , while things stood thus , suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck , staggered , ground for an instant in the sand , and then , swift as a blow , canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay , in a pool , between the deck and bulwark ."
"We were both of us capsized in a second , and both of us rolled , almost together , into the scuppers , the dead red-cap , with his arms still spread out , tumbling stiffly after us ."
"So near were we , indeed , that my head came against the coxswain 's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle ."
"Blow and all , I was the first afoot again , for Hands had got involved with the dead body ."
"The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on ; I had to find some new way of escape , and that upon the instant , for my foe was almost touching me ."
"Quick as thought , I sprang into the mizzen shrouds , rattled up hand over hand , and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees ."
"I had been saved by being prompt ; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight ; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine , a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment ."
"Now that I had a moment to myself , I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol , and then , having one ready for service , and to make assurance doubly sure , I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning ."
"My new employment struck Hands all of a heap ; he began to see the dice going against him , and after an obvious hesitation , he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds , and with the dirk in his teeth , began slowly and painfully to mount ."
"It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him , and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up ."
"Then , with a pistol in either hand , I addressed him ."
"`` One more step , Mr. Hands , '' said I , `` and I 'll blow your brains out !"
"Dead men do n't bite , you know , '' I added with a chuckle ."
He stopped instantly .
"I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think , and the process was so slow and laborious that , in my new-found security , I laughed aloud ."
"At last , with a swallow or two , he spoke , his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity ."
"In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth , but in all else he remained unmoved ."
"`` Jim , '' says he , `` I reckon we 're fouled , you and me , and we 'll have to sign articles ."
"She had swung round to the ebb -- her bow was now towards me -- the only lights on board were in the cabin , and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window ."
"The ebb had already run some time , and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand , where I sank several times above the ankle , before I came to the edge of the retreating water , and wading a little way in , with some strength and dexterity , set my coracle , keel downwards , on the surface ."
"23 The Ebb-tide Runs THE coracle -- as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her -- was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight , both buoyant and clever in a seaway ; but she was the most cross-grained , lop-sided craft to manage ."
"Do as you pleased , she always made more leeway than anything else , and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at ."
Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was `` queer to handle till you knew her way . ''
Certainly I did not know her way .
"She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go ; the most part of the time we were broadside on , and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide ."
"By good fortune , paddle as I pleased , the tide was still sweeping me down ; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway , hardly to be missed ."
"First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness , then her spars and hull began to take shape , and the next moment , as it seemed -LRB- for , the farther I went , the brisker grew the current of the ebb -RRB- , I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold ."
"The hawser was as taut as a bowstring , and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor ."
"All round the hull , in the blackness , the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream ."
One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the tide .
"So far so good , but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser , suddenly cut , is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse ."
"Ten to one , if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor , I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water ."
"This brought me to a full stop , and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me , I should have had to abandon my design ."
But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west .
"Just while I was meditating , a puff came , caught the HISPANIOLA , and forced her up into the current ; and to my great joy , I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp , and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water ."
"With that I made my mind up , took out my gully , opened it with my teeth , and cut one strand after another , till the vessel swung only by two ."
"Then I lay quiet , waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind ."
"All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin , but to say truth , my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear ."
"Now , however , when I had nothing else to do , I began to pay more heed ."
"One I recognized for the coxswain 's , Israel Hands , that had been Flint 's gunner in former days ."
"The other was , of course , my friend of the red night-cap ."
"Both men were plainly the worse of drink , and they were still drinking , for even while I was listening , one of them , with a drunken cry , opened the stern window and threw out something , which I divined to be an empty bottle ."
But they were not only tipsy ; it was plain that they were furiously angry .
"Oaths flew like hailstones , and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows ."
"But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while , until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result ."
"On shore , I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees ."
"Someone was singing , a dull , old , droning sailor 's song , with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse , and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer ."
"I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words : `` But one man of her crew alive , What put to sea with seventy-five . ''"
And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning .
"But , indeed , from what I saw , all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on ."
Keep your head down . ''
"But Silver , from the other boat , looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me ; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done ."
"The crews raced for the beach , but the boat I was in , having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned , shot far ahead of her consort , and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind ."
"`` Jim , Jim ! ''"
I heard him shouting .
"But you may suppose I paid no heed ; jumping , ducking , and breaking through , I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer ."
14 The First Blow I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in .
"I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows , bulrushes , and odd , outlandish , swampy trees ; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating , sandy country , about a mile long , dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees , not unlike the oak in growth , but pale in the foliage , like willows ."
"On the far side of the open stood one of the hills , with two quaint , craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun ."
I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration .
"The isle was uninhabited ; my shipmates I had left behind , and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls ."
I turned hither and thither among the trees .
"Here and there were flowering plants , unknown to me ; here and there I saw snakes , and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top ."
Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle .
"Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees -- live , or evergreen , oaks , I heard afterwards they should be called -- which grew low along the sand like brambles , the boughs curiously twisted , the foliage compact , like thatch ."
"The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls , spreading and growing taller as it went , until it reached the margin of the broad , reedy fen , through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage ."
"The marsh was steaming in the strong sun , and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze ."
"All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes ; a wild duck flew up with a quack , another followed , and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air ."
I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen .
"Nor was I deceived , for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice , which , as I continued to give ear , grew steadily louder and nearer ."
"This put me in a great fear , and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there , hearkening , as silent as a mouse ."
"Another voice answered , and then the first voice , which I now recognized to be Silver 's , once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream , only now and again interrupted by the other ."
"By the sound they must have been talking earnestly , and almost fiercely ; but no distinct word came to my hearing ."
"At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down , for not only did they cease to draw any nearer , but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp ."
"And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business , that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes , the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils , and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage , under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees ."
"I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly , not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders ."
"Crawling on all fours , I made steadily but slowly towards them , till at last , raising my head to an aperture among the leaves , I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh , and closely set about with trees , where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation ."
The sun beat full upon them .
"Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground , and his great , smooth , blond face , all shining with heat , was lifted to the other man 's in a kind of appeal ."
"`` Mate , '' he was saying , `` it 's because I thinks gold dust of you -- gold dust , and you may lay to that !"
"If I had n't took to you like pitch , do you think I 'd have been here a-warning of you ?"
"All 's up -- you ca n't make nor mend ; it 's to save your neck that I 'm a-speaking , and if one of the wild uns knew it , where 'd I be , Tom -- now , tell me , where 'd I be ? ''"
"I 'd have had you but for that there lurch , but I do n't have no luck , not I ; and I reckon I 'll have to strike , which comes hard , you see , for a master mariner to a ship 's younker like you , Jim . ''"
"I was drinking in his words and smiling away , as conceited as a cock upon a wall , when , all in a breath , back went his right hand over his shoulder ."
"Something sang like an arrow through the air ; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang , and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast ."
"In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment -- I scarce can say it was by my own volition , and I am sure it was without a conscious aim -- both my pistols went off , and both escaped out of my hands ."
"They did not fall alone ; with a choked cry , the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water ."
"27 `` Pieces of Eight '' OWING to the cant of the vessel , the masts hung far out over the water , and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the surface of the bay ."
"Hands , who was not so far up , was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks ."
He rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good .
"As the water settled , I could see him lying huddled together on the clean , bright sand in the shadow of the vessel 's sides ."
A fish or two whipped past his body .
"Sometimes , by the quivering of the water , he appeared to move a little , as if he were trying to rise ."
"But he was dead enough , for all that , being both shot and drowned , and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter ."
"I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick , faint , and terrified ."
The hot blood was running over my back and chest .
"The dirk , where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast , seemed to burn like a hot iron ; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me , for these , it seemed to me , I could bear without a murmur ; it was the horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that still green water , beside the body of the coxswain ."
"I clung with both hands till my nails ached , and I shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril ."
"Gradually my mind came back again , my pulses quieted down to a more natural time , and I was once more in possession of myself ."
"It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk , but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me , and I desisted with a violent shudder ."
"Oddly enough , that very shudder did the business ."
"The knife , in fact , had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether ; it held me by a mere pinch of skin , and this the shudder tore away ."
"The blood ran down the faster , to be sure , but I was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt ."
"These last I broke through with a sudden jerk , and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds ."
"For nothing in the world would I have again ventured , shaken as I was , upon the overhanging port shrouds from which Israel had so lately fallen ."
"I went below and did what I could for my wound ; it pained me a good deal and still bled freely , but it was neither deep nor dangerous , nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm ."
"Then I looked around me , and as the ship was now , in a sense , my own , I began to think of clearing it from its last passenger -- the dead man , O'Brien ."
"He had pitched , as I have said , against the bulwarks , where he lay like some horrible , ungainly sort of puppet , life-size , indeed , but how different from life 's colour or life 's comeliness !"
"In that position I could easily have my way with him , and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead , I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave , tumbled him overboard ."
"He went in with a sounding plunge ; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface ; and as soon as the splash subsided , I could see him and Israel lying side by side , both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water ."
"O'Brien , though still quite a young man , was very bald ."
"There he lay , with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both ."
I was now alone upon the ship ; the tide had just turned .
The sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck .
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"Then Balna said to her sisters, ""Do you not see that girl watching us?"
"Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us."""
"But the other sisters said, ""Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit."" And calling her to them, they gave her one of the pomeloes."
"No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went home and said to her mother, ""I do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted."""
"The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, ""What can I do for you?"" She answered, ""There is only one thing that will make my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure my headache."" So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well."
"Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry very bitterly."
"Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: ""I cannot tell how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!"""
"And her daughter said, ""I will watch."""
"Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and said, ""See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very unfortunate for us."""
"The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it."
"The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she next day pretended to be very, very ill in fact, at the point of death and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: ""Only one thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it."" He replied, ""Yes, whatever it is, I will do it."" She then said, ""To save my life, you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death will be my life."" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters."
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.
"Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them, and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: ""It is better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother."""
"He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well."
"Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder."
"It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Prince said to his brothers: ""Stop, I think I hear some one crying and calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the sound, and find out what it is."""
So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.
"At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her."
"So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him, and married her."
And the second took the second;
And the third took the third;
And the fourth took the fourth;
And the fifth took the fifth;
And the sixth took the sixth;
"And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna."
"And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful Princesses."
"About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest."
"They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back."
"Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him; and they went away, but they also did not return."
"And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed."
"One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below, there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, ""You cannot go into the palace the Raja's sons have all gone away; we think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your begging."" But he said, ""I am a holy man, you must let me in."""
"Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin."
"It looked odd to the English, of course, to see him come into the royal presence, and, leaning his wet umbrella up against the throne, ask the king, ""How's trade?"""
"Franklin never put on any frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head. He used to say, frequently, that a king to him was no more than a seven-spot."
"He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary War, but he couldn't do it."
"Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and had given it permission to come, and it came."
"He also went to Paris, and got acquainted with a few crowned heads there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris, and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. They also promised him the county printing; but he said, No, he would have to go back to America or his wife might get uneasy about him. Franklin wrote ""Poor Richard's Almanac"" in 1732 to 1757, and it was republished in England."
"Franklin little thought, when he went to the throne-room in his leather riding-clothes and hung his hat on the throne, that he was inaugurating a custom of wearing groom clothes which would in these days be so popular among the English."
"Dr. Franklin entered Philadelphia eating a loaf of bread and carrying a loaf under each arm, passing beneath the window of the girl to whom he afterwards gave his hand in marriage."
"Nearly everybody in America, except Dr. Mary Walker, was once a poor boy."
CHAPTER XVI.
THE CRITICAL PERIOD.
"Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold on the 10th of May led two small companies to Ticonderoga, a strong fortress tremendously fortified, and with its name also across the front door. Ethan Allen, a brave Vermonter born in Connecticut, entered the sally-port, and was shot at by a guard whose musket failed to report. Allen entered and demanded the surrender of the fortress."
"""By whose authority?"" asked the commandant."
"""By the authority of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,"""
"said Allen, brandishing his naked sword at a great rate."
"""Very well,"" said the officer: ""if you put it on those grounds, all right, if you will excuse the appearance of things. We were just cleaning up, and everything is by the heels here."""
"""Never mind,"" said Allen, who was the soul of politeness. ""We put on no frills at home, and so we are ready to take things as we find them."""
"The Americans therefore got a large amount of munitions of war, both here and at Crown Point."
"General Washington was now appointed commander-in-chief of all the troops at the second session of the Continental Congress. On his arrival at Boston there were only fourteen thousand men. He took command under the historic elm at Cambridge. He was dressed in a blue broadcloth coat with flaps and revers of same, trimmed with large beautiful buttons. He also wore buff small-clothes, with openings at the sides where pockets are now put in, but at that time given up to space. They were made in such a way as to prevent the naked eye from discovering at once whether he was in advance or retreat. He also wore silk stockings and a cocked hat."
"The lines of Dryden starting off ""Mark his majestic fabric"" were suggested by his appearance and general style. He always dressed well and rode a good horse, but at Valley Forge frosted his feet severely, and could have drawn a pension, ""but no,"" said he, ""I can still work at light employment, like being President, and so I will not ask for a pension."""
"Each soldier had less than nine cartridges, but Washington managed to keep General Gage penned up in Boston, and, as Gage knew very few people there, it was a dull winter for him."
"The boys of Boston had built snow hills on the Common, and used to slide down them to the ice below, but the British soldiers tore down their coasting-places and broke up the ice on the pond."
"They stood it a long time, rebuilding their playground as often as it was torn down, until the spirit of American freedom could endure it no longer. They then organized a committee consisting of eight boys who were noted for their great philosophical research, and with Charles Sumner Muzzy, the eloquent savant from Milk Street, as chairman, the committee started for General Gage's head-quarters, to confer with him regarding the matter."
"In the picture Mr. Muzzy is seen addressing General Gage. The boy in the centre with the colored glasses is Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who discovered and first brought into use the idea of putting New Orleans molasses into Boston brown bread. To the left of Mr. Cobb is Mr. Jehoab Nye, who afterwards became the Rev. Jehoab Nye and worked with heart and voice for over eight of the best years of his life against the immorality of the codfish-ball, before he learned of its true relations towards society."
"Above and between these two stands Whomsoever J. Opper, who wrote ""How to make the Garden Pay"" and ""What Responsible Person will see that my Grave is kept green?"" In the background we see the tall form of Wherewithal G. Lumpy, who introduced the Pompadour hair-cut into Massachusetts and grew up to be a great man with enlarged joints but restricted ideas."
"Charles Sumner Muzzy addressed General Gage at some length, somewhat to the surprise of Gage, who admitted in a few well-chosen words that the committee was right, and that if he had his way about it there should be no more trouble."
"Charles was followed by Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who spoke briefly of the boon of liberty, closing as follows: ""We point with pride, sir, to the love of freedom, which is about the only excitement we have. We love our country, sir, whether we love anything else much or not. The distant wanderer of American birth, sir, pines for his country. 'Oh, give me back,' he goes on to say, 'my own fair land across the bright blue sea, the land of beauty and of worth, the bright land of the free, where tyrant foot hath never trod, nor bigot forged a chain. Oh, would that I were safely back in that bright land again!'"""
"Mr. Wherewithal G. Lumpy said he had hardly expected to be called upon, and so had not prepared himself, but this occasion forcibly brought to his mind the words also of the poet, ""Our country stands,"" said he, ""with outstretched hands appealing to her boys; from them must flow her weal or woe, her anguish or her joys. A ship she rides on human tides which rise and sink anon: each giant wave may prove her grave, or bear her nobly on. The friends of right, with armor bright, a valiant Christian band, through God her aid may yet be made, a blessing to our land."""
"General Gage was completely overcome, and asked for a moment to go apart and think it over, which he did, returning with an air which reminded one of ""Ten Nights in a Bar-Room."""
"""You may go, my brave boys; and be assured that if my troops molest you in the future, or anywhere else, I will overpower them and strew the Common with their corses."
"An effort was made to get up a fight between the French fleet and the English at Newport for the championship, but a severe storm came up and prevented it."
"In July the Wyoming Massacre, under the management of the Tories and Indians, commanded by Butler, took place in that beautiful valley near Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania."
"This massacre did more to make the Indians and Tories unpopular in this country than any other act of the war. The men were away in the army, and the women, children, and old men alone were left to the vengeance of the two varieties of savage. The Indians had never had gospel privileges, but the Tories had. Otherwise they resembled each other."
"In 1779 the English seemed to have Georgia and the South pretty well to themselves. Prevost, the English general, made an attack on Charleston, but, learning that Lincoln was after him, decided that, as he had a telegram to meet a personal friend at Savannah, he would go there. In September, Lincoln, assisted by the French under D'Estaing, attacked Savannah. One thousand lives were lost, and D'Estaing showed the white feather to advantage. Count Pulaski lost his life in this fight. He was a brave Polish patriot, and his body was buried in the Savannah River."
"The capture of Stony Point about this time by ""Mad Anthony Wayne"" was one of the most brilliant battles of the war."
"Learning the countersign from a negro who sold strawberries to the British, the troops passed the guard over the bridge that covered the marsh, and, gagging the worthy inside guard, they marched up the hill with fixed bayonets and fixed the enemy to the number of six hundred."
"The countersign was, ""The fort is won,"" and so it was, in less time than it takes to ejaculate the word ""scat!"" Wayne was wounded at the outset, but was carried up the hill in command, with a bandage tied about his head. He was a brave man, and never knew in battle what fear was. Yet, strange to say, a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale."
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CLOSE OF THE REVOLUTION.
"The atrocities introduced into this country by the Tories and Indians caused General Sullivan to go out against the measly enemy, whip him near Elmira, and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the Genesee country, where the Indian women were engaged in farming while their men-folks attended to the massacre industry."
The weak point with the Americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy.
"A navy costs money, and the Colonists were poor. In 1775 they fitted out several swift sailing-vessels, which did good service. Inside of five years they captured over five hundred ships, cruised among the British isles, and it is reported that they captured war-vessels that were tied to the English wharves."
"Paul Jones had a method of running his vessel alongside the enemy's, lashing the two together, and then having it out with the crew, generally winning in a canter. His idea in lashing the two ships together was to have one good ship to ride home on. Generally it was the one he captured, while his own, which was rotten, was allowed to go down. This was especially the case in the fight between the Richard and the Serapis, September 23, 1779."
"In 1780 the war was renewed in South Carolina. Charleston, after a forty days' siege, was forced to surrender. Gates now took charge of the South, and also gave a sprinting exhibition at Camden, where he was almost wiped off the face of the earth. He had only two troops left at the close of the battle, and they could not keep up with Gates in the retreat. This battle and the retreat overheated Gates and sowed the seeds of heart-disease, from which he never recovered. He should have chosen a more peaceful life, such as the hen-traffic, or the growth of asparagus for the market."
"Benedict Arnold has been severely reproached in history, but he was a brave soldier, and possibly serving under Gates, who jealously kept him in the background, had a good deal to do with the little European dicker which so darkened his brilliant career as a soldier."
"Unhappy man! He was not well received in England, and, though a brilliant man, was forced to sit in a corner evening after evening and hear the English tell his humorous stories as their own."
"The Carolinas were full of Tories, and opposition to English rule was practically abandoned in the South for the time, with the exception of that made in a desultory swamp-warfare by the partisan bands with such leaders as Marion, Sumter, and Pickens."
Two hundred thousand dollars of Continental money was the sum now out.
"Forty dollars of it would buy one dollar's worth of groceries; but the grocer had to know the customer pretty well, and even then it was more to accommodate than anything else that he sold at that price."
"The British flooded the country with a counterfeit that was rather better-looking than the genuine: so that by the time a man had paid six hundred dollars for a pair of boots, and the crooked bills had been picked out and others substituted, it made him feel that starting a republic was a mighty unpopular job."
"General Arnold had married a Tory lady, and lived in Philadelphia while recovering from his wounds received at Quebec and Saratoga. He was rather a high roller, and ran behind, so that it is estimated that his bills there per month required a peach-basket-full of currency with which to pay them, as the currency was then quoted. Besides, Gates had worried him, and made him think that patriotism was mostly politics. He was also overbearing, and the people of Philadelphia mobbed him once. He was reprimanded gently by Washington, but Arnold was haughty and yet humiliated. He got command of West Point, a very important place indeed, and then arranged with Clinton to swap it for six thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds and a colonelcy in the English army."
"Major André was appointed to confer with Arnold, and got off the ship Vulture to make his way to the appointed place, but it was daylight by that time, and the Vulture, having been fired on, dropped down the river. André now saw no way for him but to get back to New York; but at Tarrytown he was met by three patriots, who caught his horse by the reins, and, though André tried to tip them, he did not succeed. They found papers on his person, among them a copy of Punch, which made them suspicious that he was not an American, and so he was tried and hanged as a spy. This was one of the saddest features of the American Revolution, and should teach us to be careful how we go about in an enemy's country, also to use great care in selecting and subscribing for papers."
"In 1781, Greene, who succeeded Gates, took charge of the two thousand ragged and bony troops. January 17 he was attacked at Cowpens by Tarleton. The militia fell back, and the English made a grand charge, supposing victory to be within reach. But the wily and foxy troops turned at thirty yards and gave the undertaking business a boom that will never be forgotten."
"Morgan was in command of the Colonial forces. He went on looking for more regulars to kill, but soon ran up against Cornwallis the surrenderer."
"General Greene now joined Morgan, and took charge of the retreat. At the Yadkin River they crossed over ahead of Cornwallis, when it began for to rain. When Cornwallis came to the river he found it so swollen and restless that he decided not to cross. Later he crossed higher up, and made for the fords of the Dan at thirty miles a day, to head off the Americans. Greene beat him, however, by a length, and saved his troops."
"The writer has seen the place on the Yadkin where Cornwallis decided not to cross. It was one of the pivotal points of the war, and is of about medium height."
"A fight followed at Guilford Court-House, where the Americans were driven back, but the enemy got thinned out so noticeably that Cornwallis decided to retreat. He went back to Washington on a Bull Run schedule, without pausing even for feed or water. Cornwallis was greatly agitated, and the coat he wore at the time, and now shown in the Smithsonian Institution, shows distinctly the marks made where the Colonists played checkers on the tail."
"The battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, also greatly reduced the British forces at that point."
"Arnold conducted a campaign into Virginia, and was very brutal about it, killing a great many people who were strangers to him, and who had never harmed him, not knowing him, as the historian says, from ""Adam's off ox."""
"From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to Boston for her groceries."
"The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult."
"Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done."
"One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft; though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack."
"Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation."
"""Be you a witch?"" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to the records now on file in the State-House at Boston."
"""No, your honor,"" was the reply."
"""Officer,"" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, ""take her out on the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails with a pair of hot pincers, and then see what she says."""
"It was quite common to examine lady witches in the regular court and then adjourn to the tennis-court. A great many were ducked by order of the court and hanged up by the thumbs, in obedience to the customs of these people who came to America because they were persecuted."
"Human nature is the same even to this day. The writer grew up with an Irishman who believed that when a man got wealthy enough to keep a carriage and coachman he ought to be assassinated and all his goods given to the poor. He now hires a coachman himself, having succeeded in New York city as a policeman; but the man who comes to assassinate him will find it almost impossible to obtain an audience with him."
"If you wish to educate a man to be a successful oppressor, with a genius for introducing new horrors and novelties in pain, oppress him early in life and don't give him any reason for doing so. The idea that ""God is love"" was not popular in those days. The early settlers were so stern even with their own children that if the Indian had not given the forefather something to attract his attention, the boy crop would have been very light."
"Even now the philosopher is led to ask, regarding the boasted freedom of America, why some measures are not taken to put large fly-screens over it."
CHAPTER VI.
THE EPISODE OF THE CHARTER OAK.
The Colonies of Maine and New Hampshire were so closely associated with that of Massachusetts that their history up to 1820 was practically the same.
"Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims, say two years or thereabouts, Gorges and Mason obtained from England the grant of a large tract lying between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers. This patent was afterwards dissolved, Mason taking what is now New Hampshire, and Gorges taking Maine. He afterwards sold the State to Massachusetts for six thousand dollars. The growth of the State may be noticed since that time, for one county cost more than that last November."
"In 1820 Maine was separated from Massachusetts. Maine is noted for being the easternmost State in the Union, and has been utilized by a number of eminent men as a birthplace. White-birch spools for thread, Christmas-trees, and tamarack and spruce-gum are found in great abundance. It is the home of an industrious and peace-loving people."
Bar Harbor is a cool place to go to in summer-time and violate the liquor law of the State.
"The Dutch were first to claim Connecticut. They built a trading-post at Hartford, where they swapped bone collar-buttons with the Indians for beaver-and otter-skins. Traders from Plymouth who went up the river were threatened by the Dutch, but they pressed on and established a post at Windsor."
"In 1635, John Steele led a company ""out west"" to Hartford, and Thomas Hooker, a clergyman, followed with his congregation, driving their stock before them. Hartford thus had quite a boom quite early in the seventeenth century. The Dutch were driven out of the Connecticut Valley, and began to look towards New York."
"Soon after this the Pequod War broke out. These Indians had hoped to form an alliance with the Narragansetts, but Roger Williams prevented this by seeing the Narragansett chief personally. Thus the Puritans had coals of fire heaped on their heads by their gentle pastor, until the odor of burning hair could be detected as far away as New Haven."
"The Pequods were thus compelled to fight alone, and Captain Mason by a coup d'état surrounded their camp before daylight and entered the palisades with the Indian picket, who cried out ""Owanux! Owanux!"""
"meaning ""Englishmen. Englishmen."" Mason and his men killed these Pequods and burned their lodges to the ground. There has never been a prosperous Pequod lodge since. Those who escaped to the forest were shot down like jack-rabbits as they fled, and there has been no Pequoding done since that time."
"The New Haven Colony was founded in 1638 by wealthy church members from abroad. They took the Bible as their standard and statute. They had no other law. Only church members could vote, which was different from the arrangements in New York City in after-years."
"The Connecticut Colony had a regular constitution, said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people, framed for the people by the people. It was at once prosperous, and soon bought out the Saybrook Colony."
"In 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above colonies and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them. It amounted to a duly-authenticated independence. A quarter of a century afterwards Governor Andros, in his other clothes and a reigning coat of red and gold trimmings, marched into the Assembly and demanded this precious charter."
"and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered, “I am fishing.” The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said, “It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.” The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own."
"They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen."
"When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, “Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant’s hut.” One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, “Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,” and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, “Good God! where am I?” He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, “My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.” Tears rose to the King’s eyes and he said, “Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,” and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living."
95 Old Hildebrand
"Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, “Listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. I’ll tell you what; on Wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and if you only complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately.”"
"“I will manage it,” said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said, “I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear the parson’s sermon that he is going to preach to-day.” On that the peasant said, “Ah, my child, do not do it—thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look, I will go to the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell thee everything the parson says.”"
"“Well,” said the woman, “go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that thou hearest.” So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer."
"Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, “Hurrah! dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well! The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster,” and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly."
"But now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs. “May you be blessed,” said the gossip, “where are you off to so fast?”"
"“To all eternity, my friend,” said the peasant, “my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson’s sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage.” “But listen, gossip,” said the egg-merchant to the peasant, “are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that? Don’t you know what it means? The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.”"
“My word!” said the peasant. “How I’d like to know if that’s true!”
"“Come, then,” said the gossip, “I’ll tell you what to do. Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself.” So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home."
"When they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there. “It is I, gossip,” said the egg-merchant, “give me shelter this night; I have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it, for it is dark already.”"
"“Indeed, my friend,” said the woman, “thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me, but as thou art here it can’t be helped, come in, and take a seat there on the bench by the stove.” Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said, “Listen, my dear friend, thou canst sing beautifully; sing something to me.” “Oh,” said the woman, “I cannot sing now, in my young days indeed I could sing well enough, but that’s all over now.”"
"“Come,” said the parson once more, “do sing some little song.”"
"On that the woman began and sang,"
“I’ve sent my husband away from me To the Göckerli hill in Italy.”
"Thereupon the parson sang,"
"“I wish ’twas a year before he came back, I’d never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.”"
Hallelujah.
"Then the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,"
"“What art thou doing, my Hildebrand dear, There on the bench by the stove so near?”"
Hallelujah.
"And then the peasant sang from his basket,"
"“All singing I ever shall hate from this day, And here in this basket no longer I’ll stay.”"
Hallelujah.
"And he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house."
96 The Three Little Birds
"About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, “If I do not get that one, I will have none.” Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King’s right hand, “Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.”"
"These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said, “Yes,” and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax."
"But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"Sherman's army of sixty thousand, after a month's rest at Savannah, started north to unite with Grant in the final blow. ""Before it was terror, behind it ashes."""
"Columbia was captured February 17, and burned, without Sherman's authority, the night following. Charleston was evacuated the next day."
"Johnston was recalled to take command, and opposed the march of Sherman, but was driven back after fierce engagements at Bentonville and Averysboro. On March 25 Lee decided to attack Grant, and, while the latter was busy, get out of Richmond and join Johnston, but when this battle, known as the attack on Fort Steadman, was over, Grant's hold was tighter than ever."
"Sheridan attacked Lee's rear with a heavy force, and at Five Forks, April 1, the surprised garrison was defeated with five thousand captured. The next day the entire Union army advanced, and the line of Confederate intrenchments was broken. On the following day Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, but Mr. Davis was not there. He had gone away. Rather than meet General Grant and entertain him when there was no pie in the house, he and the Treasury had escaped from the haunts of man, wishing to commune with nature for a while. He was captured at Irwinsville, Georgia, under peculiar and rather amusing circumstances."
"He was never punished, with the exception perhaps that he published a book and did not realize anything from it."
"Lee fled to the westward, but was pursued by the triumphant Federals, especially by Sheridan, whose cavalry hung on his flanks day and night."
"Food failed the fleeing foe, and the young shoots of trees for food and the larger shoots of the artillery between meals were too much for that proud army, once so strong and confident."
Let us not dwell on the particulars.
"As Sheridan planted his cavalry squarely across Lee's path of retreat, the worn but heroic tatters of a proud army prepared to sell themselves for a bloody ransom and go down fighting, but Grant had demanded their surrender, and, seeing back of the galling, skirmishing cavalry solid walls of confident infantry, the terms of surrender were accepted by General Lee, and April 9 the Confederate army stacked its arms near Appomattox Court-House."
"The Confederate war debt was never paid, for some reason or other, but the Federal debt when it was feeling the best amounted to two billion eight hundred and forty-four million dollars. One million men lost their lives."
Was it worth while?
"In the midst of the general rejoicing, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre, April 14. The assassin was captured in a dying condition in a burning barn, through a crack in the boarding of which he had been shot by a soldier named Boston Corbett. He died with no sympathetic applause to soothe the dull, cold ear of death."
"West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, and Nevada in 1864."
"The following chapters will be devoted to more peaceful details, while we cheerfully close the sorrowful pages in which we have confessed that, with all our greatness as a nation, we could not stay the tide of war."
CHAPTER XXIX.
"TOO MUCH LIBERTY IN PLACES AND NOT ENOUGH ELSEWHERE. THOUGHTS ON THE LATE WAR WHO IS THE BIGGER ASS, THE MAN WHO WILL NOT FORGIVE AND FORGET, OR THE MAWKISH AND MOIST-EYED SNIVELLER WHO WANTS TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME?"
"When Patrick Henry put his old cast-iron spectacles on the top of his head and whooped for liberty, he did not know that some day we should have more of it than we knew what to do with. He little dreamed that the time would come when we should have more liberty than we could pay for."
"When Mr. Henry sawed the air and shouted for liberty or death, I do not believe that he knew the time would come when Liberty would stand on Bedloe's Island and yearn for rest and change of scene."
"It seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways. We have more liberty than we have money. We guarantee that every man in America shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense, and the less of an American he is the more liberty he can have. Should he desire to enjoy himself, all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer. The more I study American institutions the more I regret that I was not born a foreigner, so that I could have something to say about the management of our great land. If I could not be a foreigner, I believe I should prefer to be a policeman or an Indian not taxed."
"I am often led to ask, in the language of the poet, ""Is civilization a failure, and is the Caucasian played out?"""
"Almost every one can have a good deal of fun in America except the American. He seems to be so busy paying his taxes that he has very little time to vote, or to mingle in society's giddy whirl, or to mix up with the nobility. That is the reason why the alien who rides across the United States in the ""Limited Mail"" and writes a book about us before breakfast wonders why we are always in a hurry. That also is the reason why we have to throw our meals into ourselves with such despatch, and hardly have time to maintain a warm personal friendship with our families."
"We do not care much for wealth, but we must have freedom, and freedom costs money. We have advertised to furnish a bunch of freedom to every man, woman, and child who comes to our shores, and we are going to deliver the goods whether we have any left for ourselves or not."
"What would the great world beyond the seas say to us if some day the blue-eyed Oriental, with his heart full of love for our female seminaries and our old women's homes, should land upon our coasts and crave freedom in car-load lots but find that we were using all the liberty ourselves? But what do we want of liberty, anyhow? What could we do with it if we had it? It takes a man of leisure to enjoy liberty, and we have no leisure whatever. It is a good thing to keep in the house for the use of guests, but we don't need it for ourselves."
"Therefore we have a statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, because it shows that we keep Liberty on tap winter and summer. We want the whole broad world to remember that when it gets tired of oppression it can come here to America and oppress us. We are used to it, and we rather like it. If we don't like it, we can get on the steamer and go abroad, where we may visit the effete monarchies and have a high old time."
"The sight of the Goddess of Liberty standing there in New York harbor night and day, bathing her feet in the rippling sea, is a good thing. It is first-rate. It may also be productive of good in a direction that many have not thought of. As she stands there day after day, bathing her feet in the broad Atlantic, perhaps some moss-grown alien landing on our shore and moving toward the Far West may fix the bright picture in his so-called mind, and, remembering how, on his arrival in New York, he saw Liberty bathing her feet with impunity, he may be led in after-years to try it on himself."
More citizens and less voters will some day be adopted as the motto of the Republic.
"One reference to the late war, and I will close. I want to refer especially to the chronic reconciler who when war was declared was not involved in it, but who now improves every opportunity, especially near election-time, to get out a tired olive-branch and make a tableau of himself. He is worse than the man who cannot forgive or forget."
"The growth of reconciliation between the North and the South is the slow growth of years, and the work of generations. When any man, North or South, in a public place takes occasion to talk in a mellow and mawkish way of the great love he now has for his old enemy, watch him. He is getting ready to ask a favor. There is a beautiful, poetic idea in the reunion of two contending and shattered elements of a great nation."
"There is something beautifully pathetic in the picture of the North and the South clasped in each other's arms and shedding a torrent of hot tears down each other's backs as it is done in a play, but do you believe that the aged mothers on either side have learned to love the foe with much violence yet? Do you believe that the crippled veteran, North or South, now passionately loves the adversary who robbed him of his glorious youth, made him a feeble ruin, and mowed down his comrades with swift death? Do you believe that either warrior is so fickle that he has entirely deserted the cause for which he fought? Even the victor cannot ask that."
"The shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced at the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the town for ever. The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down. When he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there, and pecked his eyes out. In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger, for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him."
108 Hans the Hedgehog
"There was once a countryman who had money and land in plenty, but how rich soever he was, one thing was still wanting in his happiness he had no children. Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children. At last he became angry, and when he got home he said, “I will have a child, even if it be a hedgehog.” Then his wife had a child, that was a hedgehog in the upper part of his body, and a boy in the lower, and when she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, “See, there thou hast brought ill-luck on us.” Then said the man, “What can be done now? The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him.”"
"The woman said, “And we cannot call him anything else but Hans the Hedgehog.”"
"When he was christened, the parson said, “He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes.” So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, “If he would but die!” He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. “A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,” said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, “And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?” “Dear father,” he said, “do bring me bagpipes.” When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans the Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, “Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again.” On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom. So Hans the Hedgehog descended from the tree, and said he would show the way if the King would write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the royal courtyard as soon as he arrived at home. Then the King thought, “I can easily do that, Hans the Hedgehog understands nothing, and I can write what I like.” So the King took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done it, Hans the Hedgehog showed him the way, and he got safely home. But his daughter, when she saw him from afar, was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him, and kissed him. Then he remembered Hans the Hedgehog, and told her what had happened, and that he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home, to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse, and made beautiful music, but that instead of writing that he should have what he wanted, he had written that he should not have it. Thereupon the princess was glad, and said he had done well, for she never would have gone away with the Hedgehog."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, looked after his asses and pigs, and was always merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes."
"Now it came to pass that another King came journeying by with his attendants and runners, and he also had lost his way, and did not know how to get home again because the forest was so large. He likewise heard the beautiful music from a distance, and asked his runner what that could be, and told him to go and see. Then the runner went under the tree, and saw the cock sitting at the top of it, and Hans the Hedgehog on the cock. The runner asked him what he was about up there?"
"“I am keeping my asses and my pigs; but what is your desire?” The messenger said that they had lost their way, and could not get back into their own kingdom, and asked if he would not show them the way."
"Then Hans the Hedgehog got down the tree with the cock, and told the aged King that he would show him the way, if he would give him for his own whatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace. The King said, “Yes,” and wrote a promise to Hans the Hedgehog that he should have this. That done, Hans rode on before him on the cock, and pointed out the way, and the King reached his kingdom again in safety. When he got to the courtyard, there were great rejoicings. Now he had an only daughter who was very beautiful; she ran to meet him, threw her arms round his neck, and was delighted to have her old father back again."
"She asked him where in the world he had been so long. So he told her how he had lost his way, and had very nearly not come back at all, but that as he was travelling through a great forest, a creature, half hedgehog, half man, who was sitting astride a cock in a high tree, and making music, had shown him the way and helped him to get out, but that in return he had promised him whatsoever first met him in the royal court-yard, and how that was she herself, which made him unhappy now."
"But on this she promised that, for love of her father, she would willingly go with this Hans if he came."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, took care of his pigs, and the pigs multiplied until they became so many in number that the whole forest was filled with them. Then Hans the Hedgehog resolved not to live in the forest any longer, and sent word to his father to have every stye in the village emptied, for he was coming with such a great herd that all might kill who wished to do so. When his father heard that, he was troubled, for he thought Hans the Hedgehog had died long ago. Hans the Hedgehog, however, seated himself on the cock, and drove the pigs before him into the village, and ordered the slaughter to begin. Ha!"
"but there was a killing and a chopping that might have been heard two miles off! After this Hans the Hedgehog said, “Father, let me have the cock shod once more at the forge, and then I will ride away and never come back as long as I live.” Then the father had the cock shod once more, and was pleased that Hans the Hedgehog would never return again."
"Hans the Hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom. There the King had commanded that whosoever came mounted on a cock and had bagpipes with him should be shot at, cut down, or stabbed by everyone, so that he might not enter the palace. When, therefore, Hans the Hedgehog came riding thither, they all pressed forward against him with their pikes, but he spurred the cock and it flew up over the gate in front of the King’s window and lighted there, and Hans cried that the King must give him what he had promised, or he would take both his life and his daughter’s. Then the King began to speak his daughter fair, and to beg her to go away with Hans in order to save her own life and her father’s. So she dressed herself in white, and her father gave her a carriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together with gold and possessions. She seated herself in the carriage, and placed Hans the Hedgehog beside her with the cock and the bagpipes, and then they took leave and drove away, and the King thought he should never see her again. He was however, deceived in his expectation, for when they were at a short distance from the town, Hans the Hedgehog took her pretty clothes off, and pierced her with his hedgehog’s skin until she bled all over. “That is the reward of your falseness,” said he, “go your way, I will not have you!” and on that he chased her home again, and she was disgraced for the rest of her life."
"Hans the Hedgehog, however, rode on further on the cock, with his bagpipes, to the dominions of the second King to whom he had shown the way. This one, however, had arranged that if any one resembling Hans the Hedgehog should come, they were to present arms, give him safe conduct, cry long life to him, and lead him to the royal palace."
"But when the King’s daughter saw him she was terrified, for he looked quite too strange. She remembered however, that she could not change her mind, for she had given her promise to her father. So Hans the Hedgehog was welcomed by her, and married to her, and had to go with her to the royal table, and she seated herself by his side, and they ate and drank. When the evening came and they wanted to go to sleep, she was afraid of his quills, but he told her she was not to fear, for no harm would befall her, and he told the old King that he was to appoint four men to watch by the door of the chamber, and light a great fire, and when he entered the room and was about to get into bed, he would creep out of his hedgehog’s skin and leave it lying there by the bedside, and that the men were to run nimbly to it, throw it in the fire, and stay by it until it was consumed. When the clock struck eleven, he went into the chamber, stripped off the hedgehog’s skin, and left it lying by the bed. Then came the men and fetched it swiftly, and threw it in the fire; and when the fire had consumed it, he was delivered, and lay there in bed in human form, but he was coal-black as if he had been burnt. The King sent for his physician who washed him with precious salves, and anointed him, and he became white, and was a handsome young man. When the King’s daughter saw that she was glad, and the next morning they arose joyfully, ate and drank, and then the marriage was properly solemnized, and Hans the Hedgehog received the kingdom from the aged King."
"When several years had passed he went with his wife to his father, and said that he was his son. The father, however, declared he had no son he had never had but one, and he had been born like a hedgehog with spikes, and had gone forth into the world. Then Hans made himself known, and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom."
"My tale is done, And away it has run To little August’s house."
109 The Shroud
"There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who was so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without liking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world. Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took him to himself; and for this the mother could not be comforted, and wept both day and night. But soon afterwards, when the child had been buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and when morning came it disappeared. As, however, the mother would not stop crying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its head, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, “Oh, mother, do stop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry because of all thy tears, which fall upon it.” The mother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more. The next night the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and said, “Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave.” Then the mother gave her sorrow into God’s keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in its little bed beneath the earth."
110 The Jew Among Thorns
"There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: He was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it. Moreover, he never complained, but was contented with everything, and always merry."
"When a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said to himself, “That is the cleverest way; for I shall save something, and he will not go away, but stay quietly in my service.” The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done it the first; and when at the end of this, likewise, he received no wages, he made himself happy, and still stayed on."
"When the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out. Then at last the servant said, “Master, for three years I have served you honestly, be so good as to give me what I ought to have, for I wish to leave, and look about me a little more in the world.”"
"“Yes, my good fellow,” answered the old miser; “you have served me industriously, and, therefore, you shall be cheerfully rewarded;” And he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, “There, you have a farthing for each year; that is large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from few masters.”"
"The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, “Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!” So on he went, up hill and down dale; and sang and jumped to his heart’s content. Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to him, “Whither away, merry brother? I see you do not carry many cares.” “Why should I be sad?” answered the servant; “I have enough; three years’ wages are jingling in my pocket.”"
"“How much is your treasure?” the dwarf asked him. “How much? Three farthings sterling, all told.” “Look here,” said the dwarf, “I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread.”"
"And as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, “Take them in the name of Heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it.”"
"Then the little man said, “As I see you have a good heart I grant you three wishes, one for each farthing, they shall all be fulfilled.”"
"“Aha?” said the servant, “you are one of those who can work wonders!"
"Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for a gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle, which when I play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance; thirdly, that if I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it.”"
"“All that shall you have,” said the dwarf; and put his hand into the bush, and only think, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready, just as if they had been ordered. These he gave to the servant, and then said to him, “Whatever you may ask at any time, no man in the world shall be able to deny you.”"
"Many a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be, after all, too little. Then it came into his mind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, “I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back.” And as the last word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back, and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled. Then he really did feel warm. He began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home, to think of something really large for his last wish. But when he arrived there and opened the parlour-door, he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle, crying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it. So he said, “Do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on earth for thee, only stay where thou art.” She, however, called him a fool, and said, “What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle? Thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off.” So whether he would or not, he was forced to let his third wish be that she should be quit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately the wish was fulfilled. So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death."
"88 The Singing, Springing Lark"
"There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them. Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, “Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.” The father said, “Yes, if I can get it, you shall have it,” kissed all three, and set out. Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child. Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark. “Aha, you come just at the right moment!” he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature. But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled. “He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark,” he cried, “will I devour.” Then the man said, “I did not know that the bird belonged to thee. I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life.” The lion said, “Nothing can save thee, unless thou wilt promise to give me for mine own what first meets thee on thy return home; and if thou wilt do that, I will grant thee thy life, and thou shalt have the bird for thy daughter, into the bargain.” But the man hesitated and said, “That might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.” The servant, however, was terrified and said, “Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?” Then the man allowed himself to be over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home."
"When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy. The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, “My dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear. In return for it, I have been obliged to promise thee to a savage lion, and when he has thee he will tear thee in pieces and devour thee,” and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might. But she consoled him and said, “Dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to thee safely.” Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest. The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle."
"When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime. One day he came and said, “To-morrow there is a feast in thy father’s house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if thou art inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct thee.” She said, “Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,” and went thither, accompanied by the lions."
"There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live."
"But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest. When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, “This time I will not be alone, thou must come with me.” The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves. She said, “Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of thee, and guard thee from all light.” So they went away together, and took with them their little child as well. She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed. The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by this apartment, a ray about the breadth of a hair fell on the King’s son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant, and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white dove was sitting there. The dove said to her, “For seven years must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will show thee the way, and if thou followest the trace thou canst release me.” Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her the way."
"So she went continually further and further in the wide world, never looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they were so far from it! Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared. And as she thought to herself, “In this no man can help thee,” she climbed up to the sun, and said to him, “Thou shinest into every crevice, and over every peak, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?” “No,” said the sun, “I have seen none, but I present thee with a casket, open it when thou art in sorest need.” Then she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon appeared; she then asked her, “Thou shinest the whole night through, and on every field and forest, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?”"
"“No,” said the moon, “I have seen no dove, but here I give thee an egg, break it when thou art in great need.” She thanked the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it, “Thou blowest over every tree and under every leaf, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?” “No,” said the night wind, “I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.” The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the south wind said, “I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the dragon, however, is an enchanted princess.” The night wind then said to her, “I will advise thee; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form. After that, look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing thyself, with thy beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home. Here is a nut for thee, when thou are above the center of the sea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if thou forgettest to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”"
"Then she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said."
"She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both of them regained their human shapes. But when the princess, who had before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off with her. There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken. She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and said, “Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock crows, until I find him,” and she went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together; there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but she said, “God still helps me,”"
"and opened the casket that the sun had given her. A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself. So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment. The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale? “Not for money or land,” answered she, “but for flesh and blood.”"
"The bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said, “Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.” The bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught. When it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said, “I have followed after thee for seven years. I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for thee, and have helped thee against the dragon; wilt thou, then quite forget me?” But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress. And as that even had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept. While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her; she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old hen’s wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world! Then she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window. The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale. “Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”"
"The bride said, “Yes,” intending to cheat her as on the former evening."
"But when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been? On this the page told all; that he had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night. The prince said, “Pour out the draught by the bed-side.” At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and cried, “Now I really am released! I have been as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled to forget thee, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right time.” Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death."
89 The Goose-Girl
"There was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter. When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver; and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart. She likewise sent her maid in waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of the King’s daughter was called Falada, and could speak. So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled, then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said, “Dear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way.”"
"So they took a sorrowful leave of each other; the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to her bridegroom. After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and take my cup which thou hast brought with thee for me, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to drink.” “If you are thirsty,” said the waiting-maid, “get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water, I don’t choose to be your servant.” So in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup. Then she said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the three drops of blood answered, “If thy mother knew, her heart would break.” But the King’s daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again. She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup,” for she had long ago forgotten the girl’s ill words. But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, “If you wish to drink, drink as you can, I don’t choose to be your maid.” Then in her great thirst the King’s daughter alighted, bent over the flowing stream, wept and said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the drops of blood again replied, “If thy mother knew this, her heart would break.” And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her trouble. The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless. So now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, the waiting-maid said, “Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will do for thee” and the princess had to be content with that. Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say one word of this to any one at the royal court, and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada saw all this, and observed it well."
"The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered the royal palace. There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and thought she was his consort. She was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing below. Then the old King looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was? “I picked her up on my way for a companion; give the girl something to work at, that she may not stand idle.” But the old King had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, “I have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.” The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese. Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young King, “Dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favour.” He answered, “I will do so most willingly.” “Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way.” In reality, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the King’s daughter. Then she succeeded in making the King promise that it should be done, and the faithful Falada was to die; this came to the ears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her. There was a great dark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning and evening she had to pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nail up Falada’s head on it, so that she might see him again, more than once. The knacker’s man promised to do that, and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway."
"Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway, she said in passing,"
"“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”"
"Then the head answered,"
"“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!"
"If this your tender mother knew, Her heart would surely break in two.”"
"Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geese into the country. And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down and unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it and delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then she said,"
"“Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say, Blow Conrad’s little hat away, And make him chase it here and there, Until I have braided all my hair, And bound it up again.”"
"And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad’s hat far away across country, and he was forced to run after it. When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and he could not get any of it. Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak to her, and thus they watched the geese until the evening, and then they went home."
"Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway, the maiden said,"
"“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”"
"Falada answered,"
"“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!"
"If this your tender mother knew, Her heart would surely break in two.”"

It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"

_Swallow_. On this occasion no less than 267 pirates were accounted for.
The finding of the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of
Admiralty for trying of pirates was as follows:
Acquitted                                 74
Executed                                  52

"A number of the prisoners signed a ""humble petition"" begging that, as"
"they, being ""unhappily and unwisely drawn into that wretched and"
"detestable Crime of Piracy,"" they might be permitted to serve in the Royal"
"African Company in the country for seven years, in remission of their"
"crimes. This clemency was granted to twenty of the prisoners, of which"
Scot was one.
even good Frank Villiers has hazarded a reverent guess at his friend's
"great secret--but to the uninstructed, what does she seem?"
"Nothing but a WOMAN, MOST PURE WOMANLY; a woman whose influence on all"
"is strangely sweet and lasting,--whose spirit overflows with tenderest"
"sympathy for the many wants and sorrows of mankind,--whose voice charms"
"away care,--whose smile engenders peace,--whose eyes, lustrous and"
"thoughtful, are unclouded by any shadow of sin,--and on whose serene"
beauty the passing of years leaves no visible trace. That she is fair
"and wise, joyous, radiant, and holy is apparent to all,--but only the"
"Poet, her lover and lord, her subject and servant, can tell how truly"
his Edris is not so much sweet woman as most perfect Angel! A Dream of
Heaven made human! ... Let some of us hesitate ere we doubt the
"Miracle; for we are sleepers and dreamers all,--and the hour is close"
at hand when--we shall Wake.

CHAPTER XV
THE JOURNEY HOME--THE FISHING AND WORKING OF THE KALOMA SHELL
I
The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by following exactly
the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu. In each inhabited
"island, in every village, where a halt had previously been made,"
"they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of Sanaroa,"
"in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited. Some"
"Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the talo'i"
gifts from those intermediate partners are also collected on the
return journey. In each of these villages people are eager to hear
about the reception which the uvalaku party have received in Dobu;
"the yield in valuables is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between"
the present occasion and previous records.
"No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there"
would be very little indeed to say about the return journey but for
two important incidents; the fishing for spondylus shell (kaloma)
"in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the display and comparison of the yield of"
Kula valuables on Muwa beach.
advantageously used on muscular strains and where an external stimulant
is indicated.
LIQUOR AMMONII ACETATIS--SOLUTION OF AMMONIUM ACETATE

"of the salt, together with small amounts of acetic acid and carbon"
dioxide.
"DERIVATION.--Ammonium carbonate is gradually added to cold, dilute"
acetic acid until the latter is materialized.
"PROPERTIES.--A clear, colorless liquid, mildly saline and acidulous"
"taste, and an acid reaction."
Incompatible with acids and alkalies.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.;"
"dogs, 2 to 6 drs."
"ACTIONS.--Diaphoretic, antipyretic, mild stimulant, mild diuretic, mild"
expectorant and stomachic.
"USES.--Its uses are recommended in febrile and inflammatory attacks,"
"especially in influenza, distemper, etc., combined with other medicines,"
improves the appetite; can be used externally as a refrigerant over
swollen and inflamed tendons.

"52. A Petition of Right, under The Petitions of Right Act, 1860, may, if"
"the Suppliant thinks fit, be intituled in the High Court of Admiralty,"
in case the Subject Matter of the Petition or any material part thereof

"Crown, or would be cognizable in a Prize Court within Her Majesty's"
Dominions if the same were a Matter in dispute between private Persons.

"_Repeal of Acts, and Saving Clauses._"
Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:
“I don’t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth’s work is a snap better
than Caroline Baddlesmere’s; and he’s prigged a lot of her ideas----”
"Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque literary"
"attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long fingers,"
"legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the thirties, and,"
"rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:"
"“My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that Caroline"
Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man’s humour--to say nothing of
that certain something of subtle atmosphere that is called genius....
You really ought not to give me the trouble of reiterating these simple
truths.... You compel me to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker
on a race-course----”
"He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering in"
Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte--Andrew in very much crushed and
"wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably shabby, Doome well"
groomed.
Bartholomew Doome laughed:
"“Yes,” said he, “yes, yes--I heard what Aubrey was saying; but Aubrey"
"is a poet, not a critic.”"
Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.
But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte. He smote
him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:
"For my part, I would unhesitatingly give to boys and girls an element"
of strong romance in the stories which are told them even before they
are twelve. Miss Sewell says:
"“The system that keeps girls in the schoolroom reading simple stories,"
"without reading Scott and Shakespeare and Spenser, and then hands them"
"over to the unexplored recesses of the Circulating Library, has been"
shown to be the most frivolizing that can be devised.” She sets forward
"the result of her experience that a good novel, especially a romantic"
"one, read at twelve or fourteen, is really a beneficial thing."
At present many of the children from the elementary schools get their
first idea of love (if one can give it such a name) from vulgar
"pictures displayed in the shop windows, or jokes on marriage culled"
"from the lowest type of paper, or the proceedings of a divorce-court."
What an antidote to such representation might be found in the story of
"Hector and Andromache,"
"Siegfreid and Brunhild,"
"Dido and Æneas,"
"Orpheus and Eurydice,"
St. Francis and St. Clare.
One of the strongest elements we should introduce into our stories for
children of all ages is that which calls forth love of beauty. And the
"beauty should stand out, not necessarily only in delineation of noble"
"qualities in our heroes and heroines, but in beauty and strength of"
language and form.
In this latter respect the Bible stories are of such inestimable
"Minna--she raved over the judicial murder of this Belgian heroine,"
"who was shot, as was Edith Cavell, for nothing more than assisting"
young Belgians to escape from German-occupied Belgium.
"She witnessed the air-raids of the Allies, when only comforting"
"papers were dropped on Brussels city, but bombs on the German"
aerodromes outside; and she also saw the Germans turn their guns
from the aeroplanes--which soared high out of their reach or skimmed
"below range--on to thickly-inhabited streets of the poorer quarters,"
to teach them to cheer the air-craft of the Allies!
"She beheld--or she was told of--many acts of rapine, considered"
cruelty and unreasoning ferocity on the part of German officials or
soldiers; yet saw or heard of acts and episodes of unlooked-for
"kindness, forbearance and sympathy from the same hated people. Von"
"Giesselin, after all, was a not uncommon type; and as to Minna von"
"Stachelberg, she was a saint of the New Religion, the Service of"
Man.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BOMB IN PORTLAND PLACE
Mrs. Rossiter said to herself in 1915 that she had scarcely known a
"happy day, or even hour, since the War began. In the first place"
Michael had again shown violence of temper with ministers of state
"over the release from prison of ""that"" Miss Warren--""a convict doing"
"a sentence of hard labour."" And then, when he had got her released,"
"singing. In his first Preface to the _Geystliches Gesangbücklin_, 1525,"
he wrote:
"These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason than"
because I wished to provide our young people (who both will and ought
to be instructed in music and other sciences) with something whereby
"they might rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, and in their"
"stead learn something wholesome, and so apply themselves to what is"
"good with pleasure, as becometh the young."
"The period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with Luther,"
"1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750."
"Bach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using many"
of them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original
"chorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and"
composed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use
today.
"The German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home and"
"school, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in our"
Mennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of material
in all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve and
"emphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the _Hymnary_,"
"a special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales."

CHAPTER XVI
THE CAMBRIAN
"THE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,"
"called the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has"
come down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first
"volume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the"
globe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the
"earlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed"
"have suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and"
"have been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the"
pre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate
the formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of
"the Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the"
history of the continents.
"Paleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured"
"by the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions"
of years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms
were very great. It is according to the successive stages in the
advance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five
"systems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the"
"DEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three"
"systems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they"
alike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;
"while the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and"

ALL THERE WAS TO TELL.
The custom in New Lindsey was that every Monday during the session of
"Parliament the Executive Council should meet at Government House, and,"
"under the presidency of the Governor, formally ratify and adopt the"
arrangements as to the business of the coming week which its members had
"decided upon at their Cabinet meetings. It is to be hoped that, in these"
"days, when we all take an interest in our Empire, everybody knows that"
"the Executive Council is the outward, visible, and recognised form of"
"that impalpable, unrecognised, all-powerful institution, the Cabinet,"
"consisting in fact, though not in theory, of the same persons, save that"
"the Governor is present when the meeting is of the Council, and absent"
"when it is of the Cabinet--a difference of less moment than it sounds,"
"seeing that, except in extreme cases, the Governor has little to do but"
"listen to what is going to be done. However, forms doubtless have their"
"value, and at any rate they must be observed, so on this Monday morning"
"the Executive Council was to meet as usual, although nobody knew where"
"the Cabinet would be that time twenty-four hours. Lady Eynesford, who"
"wanted her husband to drive her out, thought the meeting under the"

"substance, as acetanilid, boric acid, etc."
PREVENTIVE or PROPHYLACTIC.--A medicine or method that tends to prevent
"disease, as quinine for the prevention of malaria, vaccine, hygienics,"
etc.
PROTECTIVE.--A substance used for protecting the parts to which it is
"applied, as collodion, etc."
"PUNGENT.--Any substance producing a sharp, pinching, penetrating effect,"
as ammonia.
PURGATIVE.--A medicine causing copious evacuations of the bowels. (See
Cathartics.)
PUSTULANT.--A medicine which irritates and gives rise to the formation
"of pustules, as cantharides, croton oil, etc."
"RECUPERATIVE.--A medicine which restores health and energy, as extract"
"of malt, cod liver oil, etc."
REFRIGERANT.--A medicine or agent having cooling properties or the power
"of lowering internal or external temperature, as potassium nitrate,"
"aconite, cold water, etc."
"RELAXANT.--A substance which causes relaxation of muscular tissues, as"
"chloroform, chloral, etc."
REPARATIVE.--A substance used to restore debilitated tissues of the

Appendix V.
"Since I have recorded this incident of my lecture in Chicago, it is"
peculiarly fitting and pleasant to be able to give the following
extract from the review of the first edition of this book printed in the
_Chicago Times_. No great daily paper would have dared to print such a
comment a few years ago. To-day it is stated as a matter quite beyond
controversy:
"""She takes considerable pains to show _what one would think"
"need scarcely be insisted upon in our day_, that the morals of"
"civilization--morals in general, indeed--are not at all based in or"
"dependent upon religion, certainly not on Christianity, since the"
"so-called 'golden rule' the highest principle of morality, antedates"
"Christianity a thousand years."""
ADDRESS TO THE CLERGY AND OTHERS.
Up to the present time I have tried to reply personally to each one
"who has favored me with a letter of thanks, criticism, or praise of the"
"little book, ""Men, Women, and Gods, and Other Lectures,"" just published,"
"dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very seldom given internally;"
"hypodermically, one-half this dose. By inhalation, same as given"
internally. It should be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.
"ACTIONS.--It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly dilates the"
arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats; causes a sense of
"fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall of blood pressure due to"
"dilation of the arterioles, lowering of temperature; when the vapor is"
applied direct to muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely
arrests its functional activity; it depresses the nervous system and
unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause death by respiratory failure.
USES.--Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its being inhaled;
"spasmodic asthma, used either internally, hypodermically or best by"
"inhalation; in strychnine poisoning, angina pectoris in tetanus, and as"
a heart stimulant. It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about
recovery from deep chloroform and anesthesia.
ANISUM--ANISE
"ORIGIN.--The anise plant is a native of Egypt and the Levant, but has"
been introduced in various parts of that continent. It is also
cultivated occasionally in the gardens of this country. The fruit is
"abundantly produced in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence it"
"is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central and Southern Russia."
"DESCRIPTION.--Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5 m. m. long; carpels"
usually cohering and attached to a slender pedicel; grayish or
"acquire no intelligence sitting down in Robat, whereas, if he came"
"with me, he would get all he wanted at first hand!"
I set myself to pick up all the information I could about the
"conditions of British ""influence"" in this part of Persia, and on"
the borders of Afghanistan. To make it in any way clear why we had
any influence here at all we must revert to the old fear of the
"threatened advance of Russia on India, in the days before Russia"
became our ally in the Great War.
Slowly and gradually Russia had been extending her influence in the
Pamirs until her outposts on the Oxus River were only eight marches
"from Chitral. Evidently, as a wide counter, strategic move, the"
Indian Government had sought to increase its own influence with
Persia and Afghanistan by pushing forward her outposts to Robat and
Nasaratabad.
"Consequently, at the time of which I am writing, Robat, Nasaratabad"
and Birjand were held lightly by chains of small posts composed
entirely of Indian troops and some local levies commanded by British
"officers. Our lines of communication running from Birjand to Nushki,"
"a distance of about six hundred miles, were held, in widely scattered"
"posts, by only one battalion of Indian Infantry and one regiment of"
Indian Cavalry and four mountain guns. Thus it will be seen that it
was very difficult to obtain any troops for a movable column.
"A British Consulate had also been established at Nasaratabad, which"
is on the borders of Afghanistan and Persia. During the War the
"importance and influence of the Consul increased considerably, as he"
was in a position to gather information which was of great value to
"the military commanders, who constantly sought his advice."
"They indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,"
"temperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center"
of dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their
"migration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of"
the same system in different countries implies the absence of such
barriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic
fossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine
shells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India
and in the southern extremity of South America. Since such
organisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and
"cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water"
"connection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the"
antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered
along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely
separated countries.
CHAPTER XV
THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS
THE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of
"the beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have"
"every reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of"
"the oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the"
"solar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of"
"cosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have"
been derived.
"asafoetida, etc."
"OPIATE.--A drug which causes sleep, as chloral hydrate, opium, etc."
"OXYTOCIC.--Any agent that produces parturition, as cotton root, ergot,"
etc.
"PANACEA.--A medicine curing all diseases; a cure all, as some patent"
medicines.
PARASITICIDE.--A substance that destroys various animal and vegetable
"organisms or parasites which live upon the surface of the body, as"
"mercurial and sulphur ointment, etc."
PARTURIENT or PARTURIFACIENT.--Any agent assisting in the birth of the
"young, as ergot."
PERISTALTIC.--A medicine which increases the movements of the
longitudinal and transverse muscular fibers of the intestines and
"assists them in expelling their contents as nux vomica, arecoline, etc."
PLACEBO.--Any medicine or inert substance given for the purpose of
"satisfying the patient, rather than for its medical effects, as sugar,"
"fenugreek, anise, etc."
POISON.--An agent that when introduced into the body either destroys
"life or impairs seriously the functions of one or more of its organs, as"
"potassium cyanide, hydrocyanic acid, etc."
"POTENTIAL.--A medicine which possesses restorative effects, but is"
"delayed in its effects, as potassium iodide, arsenic, etc."

something for him.”
CHAPTER V.
ELEMENTS TO SEEK IN CHOICE OF MATERIAL.
IN “The Choice of Books” Frederic Harrison has said: “The most useful
"help to reading is to know what we shall _not_ read, ... what we"
shall keep from that small cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of
information which we can call our ordered patch of fruit-bearing
knowledge.”[24]
"Now, the same statement applies to our stories, and, having busied"
"myself, during the last chapter, with “clearing my small spot” by"
"cutting away a mass of unfruitful growth, I am now going to suggest"
what would be the best kind of seed to sow in the patch which I have
“reclaimed from the Jungle.”
"Again I repeat that I have no wish to be dogmatic, and that in offering"
"suggestions as to the stories to be told, I am only catering for a"
group of normal school-children. My list of subjects does not pretend
"to cover the whole ground of children's needs, and just as I exclude"
the abnormal or unusual child from the scope of my warning in subjects
"to avoid, so do I also exclude that child from the limitation in choice"
"of subjects to be sought, because you can offer almost any subject to"
"the unusual child, especially if you stand in close relation to him and"
"know his powers of apprehension. In this matter, _age_ has very little"

"Right Act, 1860, is presented and the subject-matter of the petition or"
any material part thereof arises out of the exercise of any belligerent
"right on behalf of the Crown, or would be cognizable in a prize court"
within His Majesty's dominions if the same were a matter in dispute
"between private persons, the petition may, if the subject thinks fit, be"
intituled in the High Court as a prize court.

orders for regulating the procedure and practice of the High Court as a

"intituled or directed to be prosecuted in that court; and, subject"
"thereto, all the provisions of the Petitions of Right Act, 1860, shall"
apply with such adaptations as may be necessary in the case of any such
petition of right; and for the purposes of this section the terms
"""court"" and ""judge"" in that Act shall respectively be understood to"
"include the High Court as a prize court and the judges thereof, and"
other terms shall have the respective meanings given to them in that
Act.
Part VI.--OFFENCES.
[Illustration: THE HOTEL AT DAVID]
The obstacles in the path of the fuller development of the national
resources of Panama have sprung wholly from the nature of its
"population. The Indian is, of course, not primarily an agriculturist,"
not a developer of the possibilities of the land he inhabits. The
Spanish infusion brought to the native population no qualities of
"energy, of well-directed effort, of the laborious determination to build"
up a new and thriving commonwealth. Spanish ideals run directly counter
"to those involved in empire building. Such energy, such determination as"
built up our great northwest and is building in British Columbia the
"greatest agricultural empire in the world, despite seven months annually"
"of drifting snow and frozen ground, would make of the Panama savannas"
and valleys the garden spot of the world. That will never be
"accomplished by the present agrarian population, but it is incredible"
that with population absorbing and overrunning the available
"agricultural lands of other zones, the tropics should long be left"
dormant in control of a lethargic and indolent people.

"Benjamin Kidd, in his stimulative book, “Social Evolution”, says on this"
subject:
“With the filling up to the full limit of the remaining territories
"suitable for European occupation, and the growing pressure of population"
"therein, it may be expected that the inexpediency of allowing a great"
"without me. With bad luck and bad weather, I might have had to wait"
"a few weeks, if not months in Nabwageta. I could perhaps have sailed"
"in a native canoe, but this could only be done without bedding, tent,"
"or even writing outfit and photographic apparatus, and so my travelling"
would have been quite useless. It was a piece of great good luck that
"a day or two afterwards, a motor launch, whose owner had heard about"
"my staying in the Amphletts, anchored in front of Nabwageta village,"
"and within an hour I was speeding towards the Trobriands again,"
following the tracks of the Kula fleet.
II
"On the next morning, as we slowly made our way along the channels"
"in the opalescent, green lagoon, and as I watched a fleet of small,"
"local canoes fishing in their muddy waters, and could recognise on"
"the surrounding flat shores a dozen well-known villages, my spirits"
"rose, and I felt well pleased to have left the picturesque, but"
"ethnographically barren Amphletts for the Trobriands, with their"
scores of excellent informants.
"Moreover, the Amphletts, in the persons of their male inhabitants"
"were soon to join me here. I went ashore in Sinaketa, where everybody"
was full of the great moment which was soon to arrive. For the Dobuan
"fleet was known to be coming, though on that morning, so far, no news"
"had reached them of its whereabouts. As a matter of fact, the Dobuans,"
"who had left Nabwageta forty-eight hours ahead of me, had made a slow"
"journey with light winds, and sailing a course to the East of mine,"
had arrived that morning only in Vakuta.
From its budding near the Panama Canal to its finish in the alimentary
canal of its final purchaser the banana has to be handled systematically
and swiftly.
[Illustration: BRINGING HOME THE CROCODILE]
[Illustration: A MORNING’S SHOOTING]
To establish this machinery the United Fruit Company has invested more
"than $190,000,000 in the tropics--doubtless the greatest investment next"
to the Panama Canal made in that Zone. How much of this is properly a
"Panama investment can hardly be told, since for example the Fruit"
Company’s ships which ply to Colon and Bocas del Toro call at other
banana ports as well. These ships are peculiarly attractive in design
"and in their clothing of snowy white, and I do not think there is any"
"American who, seeing them in Caribbean ports, does not wonder at the"
sight of the British flag flying at the stern. His astonishment is not
allayed when he learns that the company has in all more than 100 ships
"of various sizes, and nearly all of British registry. The transfer of"
that fleet alone to American registry would be a notable and most
desirable step.
[Illustration: ON CROCODILE CREEK
Each spot looking like a leaf on the water is the nose of a submerged
saurian]
From officials of the company I learned that they would welcome the
"opportunity to transfer their ships to American registry, except for"
certain requirements of the navigation laws which make such a change
hazardous. Practically all the ownership of the ships is vested in
"Americans, but to fly the British flag is for them a business necessity."
CHAPTER II
WANDERJAHRE--SOCIAL LIFE IN SCOTLAND--BEGINNING OF HIS LITERARY LIFE
In the present century in Germany we have seen a period of almost
unparalleled literary glory succeeded by a time of great commercial
prosperity and national enthusiasm. But when Ferrier visited that
country in 1834 the era of its intellectual greatness had hardly passed
"away; some, at least, of its stars remained, and others had very"
"recently ceased to be. Goethe had died just two years before, but Heine"
"lived till many years afterwards; amongst the philosophers, though Kant"
"and Fichte, of course, were long since gone, Schelling was still at"
"work at Munich, and Hegel lived at Berlin till November of 1831, when"
he was cut off during an epidemic of cholera. Most of the great men had
"disappeared, and yet the memory of their achievements still survived,"
and the impetus they gave to thought could not have been lost. The
traditional lines of speculation consistently carried out since
"Reformation days had survived war and national calamity, and it"
remained to be seen whether the greater tests of prosperity and success
would be as triumphantly undergone.
We can imagine Ferrier's feelings when this new world opened up before
"him, a Scottish youth, to whom it was a new, untrodden country. It may"
be true that it was his literary rather than his speculative affinities
that first attracted him to Germany. To form in literature he always
"attached the greatest value, and to the end his interest in letters was"
only second to his attachment to philosophy. German poetry was to him
"own methods of salvation for Corsica were rejected, he tore himself"
away and threw his undivided energies into the Revolution.
Yet the records of his early life show that in his character there was
a strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a
"character of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of"
human sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from
"his brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping"
"passionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the"
"tutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his"
relatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander
has never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved
"and honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been"
"of the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of"
spirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these
"admissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his"
character was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority
"made him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel"
"was to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his"
"determination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if"
"occasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth"
concentrated on vaster adventures.

CHAPTER II
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND CORSICA
merely repeated what was whispered to her; hence a chat with her was
"always interesting to one who, like myself, was paid to keep his ears"
open and report from time to time the direction of the political wind.
"Tournier, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his wife were her"
most intimate friends; hence she was frequently aware of facts which
"were of considerable importance to us.  Indeed, once or twice her"
friendliness for myself had caused her to drop hints which had been of
the greatest use to Lord Barmouth in the conduct of his difficult
diplomacy at that time when the boulevard journals were screaming
"against England and the filthy prints were caricaturing Her Majesty,"
with intent to insult.  Even the _Figaro_--the moderate organ of the
French Foreign Office--had lost its self-control in the storm of abuse
"following the Fashoda incident, and had libelled and maligned ""les"
"English.""  I therefore seized the opportunity for a chat with the"
"wizen-faced old lady, who seemed in a particularly good-humour, and"
deftly turned the conversation into the political channel.
"""Now, tell me, Baronne,"" I said, after we had been chatting some little"
"time, and I had learnt more than one important fact regarding the"
"intentions of Tournier, ""what is your opinion regarding the occupation"
"of Ceuta?"""
"She glanced at me quickly, as though surprised that I should be aware of"
what she had believed to be an entire secret.
"""Of Ceuta?"" she echoed.  ""And what do you at your Embassy know regarding"
"it?"""
"""We've heard a good deal,"" I laughed."
"""No doubt you've heard a good deal that is untrue,"" the clever old lady"
"the paved floor of the miniature kitchen. Having arrived in which place,"
"her anger completely vanished, for a tankardful of rich warm goat's milk"
"was handed to her by La Giralda, and in this flowing bowl she soon"
forgot her woes.
"""You must come down to the palace and be paid,"" said the little girl;"
"""we are most of us very hungry there, and those who are not hungry are"
"thirsty. The waggons from Madrid have been stopped on the way, and all"
"the guards have gone to bring them back!"""
At this Doña Susana looked quickly across to the old goatherdess and
signalled that the little Princess was not to be informed of anything
she might happen to know.
"""You have not been in the town, I trust!"" said Doña Susana."
Now La Giralda could conscientiously have declared that she had never
"been within the gates of San Ildefonso in her life, but thinking that in"
"the circumstances the statement might appear a suspicious one, she"
modified it to a solemn declaration that she had come directly down from
"her farm on the mountain-side, as, indeed, they themselves had seen."
"Satisfied of her veracity, Doña Susana took her very independent and"
difficult charge by the hand and led the way towards the palace of La
"Granja, glimpses of which could be obtained through the foliage which"
was still everywhere verdant and abundant with the first freshness of
"spring--so high did the castle lie on the hill-slopes, and so enlivening"
"were the waste waters downthrown from the rocky crests of Peñalara,"
"whose snows glimmered through the trees, as it seemed, but a bowshot"
above their heads.
"The goats, each expecting their turn of milking, followed at her heels"
"The eminent statesman, Baron Suyematsu, kindly dictated in English to"
one of our editors answers relating to certain questions with regard to
"the relation between Japan and Europe, especially France and Germany."
"With the disclosure of the alleged Kodama report in view, how far"
may one give credit to the alleged Japanese plan of invasion of
Indo-China?
I know all that has been written in France on the subject. All those
"rumours appear to me to have come originally from Russia, and to have"
been put into circulation in order to excite French opinion against
"Japan, in other words, it is nothing else than a mere repetition of the"
Yellow Peril cry.
Japan does not covet Indo-China. I have shown elsewhere that the French
colonies in the Far East have no perceptible influence upon the
"situation of Japan, either from a political or an economical point of"
"view. Japan has sufficient to do at home, she does not want to plunge"
"into external adventures, such as meddling with Indo-China or picking a"
quarrel with a country like France. You may be sure that it would be
more politic for France to cultivate amicable relations with Japan than
irritate her by such accusations. Even if those accusations honestly
"represent the true sentiment of the French, the Japanese would only take"
"them for malicious manœuvres directed to aid Russia, and they could"
not produce any good impression on the minds of the Japanese.
Is there any reason to believe that the so-called Kodama report was
forged in Russia rather than in France?
I have demonstrated elsewhere that the document which was recently made
interest.
It is a matter of intense regret that so very few people have
sufficiently clear remembrance of their own childhood to help them to
understand the taste and point of view of the _normal_ child. There
is a passage in the “Brownies” (by Mrs. Ewing) which illustrates the
confusion created in the child mind by a facetious allusion in a
dramatic moment which needed a more direct treatment.
"When the nursery toys have all gone astray, one little child exclaims"
joyfully:
"“Why, the old Rocking-Horse's nose has turned up in the oven!”"
"“It couldn't” remarks a tiresome, facetious doctor, far more anxious"
to be funny than to sympathise with the joy of the child; “it was the
"purest Grecian, modelled from the Elgin marbles.”"
"Now, for grown-up people this is an excellent joke, but for a child"
"who has not yet become acquainted with these Grecian masterpieces, the"
whole remark is pointless and hampering.[20]
VI.--_Stories which appeal to fear or priggishness._ This is a class of
story to be avoided which scarcely counts to-day and against which the
teacher does not need a warning; but I wish to make a passing allusion
"to it, partly to round off my subject and partly to show that we have"
made some improvement in choice of subject.
When I study the evolution of the story from the crude recitals
"offered to our children within the last hundred years, I feel that,"
"though our progress in intelligent mental catering may be slow, it"
is real and sure. One has only to take some examples from the Chap
Spanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers
"started back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200"
"pack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with"
a large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the
"command of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan."
"On their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal"
"of quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a"
"few friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful"
"followers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as"
their share of the spoils.
"On May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to"
"Morgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that"
"in July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between"
"Spain and England for ""restraining depredations and establishing peace"" in"
the New World.
"In April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the"
"_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being"
"acquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,"
he was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General
"Banister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to"
"Lord Arlington about Morgan, said: ""He (Morgan) is a well deserving"
"person, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's"
"pleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to"
"this island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards."""
While Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William
"Crooke, the publisher of the ""History of the Bucaniers of America."" The"
result of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and
published a long and grovelling apology.
It was an early rumour of this intention which had so stirred the
"resentment of Don Baltasar Varela, and caused him to look about for some"
instrument of vengeance to prevent the accomplishment of the designs of
"""that _burro_ of the English Stock Exchange,"" as his enemies freely"
named Mendizábal.
"But Cristina of Naples was a typical woman of the Latin races, and,"
however strongly she might be determined to establish her daughter on
"the throne of Spain, she was also a good Catholic, and any oppression of"
Holy Church was abhorrent to her nature.
"Upon this probability, which amounted to certainty in his mind, the"
Abbot of Montblanch resolved to proceed.
"Moreover, it was an open secret that a few months after the death of her"
"husband Fernando, Cristina had married Muñoz, one of the handsomest"
"officers of her bodyguard. For this and other Bourbon delinquencies,"
"conceived in the good old Neapolitan manner, the Spaniards generally had"
the greatest respect--not even being scandalized when the Queen created
"her new partner Duke of Rianzares, or when, in her _rôle_ of honorary"
"colonel of dragoons, she appeared in a uniform of blue and white,"
"because these were the colours of the ""Immaculate Conception."""
But enough has been said to indicate the nature of the adventure which
"our hero had before him, when after a toilsome march the party halted in"
the grey of the dawn in a tiny dell among the wild mountains of
Guadarrama.
"The air was still bleak and cold, though luckily there was no wind."
"Concha, the child of the south, shivered a little as Rollo aided her to"
"dismount, and this must be the young man's excuse for taking his blue"
"military cloak from its coil across his saddle-bow, and wrapping it"
The great vaults of the Abbey of Farfa resounded with glee and
merriment.
"Before a low, massive stone table, resembling a druidical altar,"
"surrounded by giant casks filled with the choicest wines of Italy,"
"Greece and Spain, there sat the Duke of Spoleto and the Abbot"
"Hilarius, discoursing largely upon the vanities of the world, and"
touching incidentally upon questions pertaining to the welfare of
Church and State. A single cresset shed an unsteady light over the
"twain, while a lean, cadaverous friar glided noiselessly in and out"
"the transepts, obsequiously replenishing the beverage as it"
disappeared with astounding swiftness in the feasters' capacious
"stomachs. And each time he replenished the vessels, he refilled his"
"own with grim impartiality, watching the Abbot and his guest from a"
low settle in a dark recess.
The vault was of singular construction and considerable extent. The
roof was of solid stone masonry and rose in a wide semicircular arch
"to the height of about twelve feet, measured from the centre of the"
ceiling to the ground floor.
"The transepts were divided by obtusely pointed arches, resting on"
"slender granite pillars, and the intervening space was filled up with"
drinking vessels of every conceivable shape and size.
"The Abbot of Farfa was a discriminating drinker, boasting of an"
"ancestral thirst of uncommonly high degree, the legacy of a Teutonic"
ancestor who had served the Church with much credit in his time.

My first visit in Robat was to the officer who had been commanding
"the scattered British forces up to that date. He was a very sick man,"
and had been holding out with the utmost difficulty until he could be
"relieved. Here I met Major Landon of the 35th Scinde Horse, one of"
the three Intelligence Officers employed by the Indian Government in
Persia.
I very quickly realised that Landon was an officer of very high
"intelligence, as well as an Intelligence Officer, and that he had a"
"fund of information concerning the country, and the conditions and"
characteristics of the inhabitants of both Persia and Baluchistan. In
"fact, I judged that he would be such an asset that, then and there, I"
"invited him to become my Brigade-Major, although I ruefully remarked"
"that I had, at present, no brigade!"
"He was keen to accept, but did not know how the authorities at Simla"
"would view his acceptance of such a post, and asked me whether I"
should be willing to shoulder the responsibility of annexing him for
"the campaign. Considering that my shoulders were broad enough, I"
promptly replied that my orders had been to take command of all the
"scattered forces I could find and co-ordinate them, and that I looked"
"upon him as my second ""find,"" Idu and his two companions being the"
"first. Further, that he was here as Intelligence Officer and would"
PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS. These valuable illuminants and fuels
"are considered here because, although they are found in traces in"
"older strata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the"
first time in large quantities. They range throughout later
formations down to the most recent.
The oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of
"Colorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those"
"of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large"
field of Ohio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher
systems.
"Petroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably"
originated from the decay of organic matter when buried in
"sedimentary deposits, just as at present in swampy places the"
hydrogen and carbon of decaying vegetation combine to form marsh
"gas. The light and heat of these hydrocarbons we may think of,"
"therefore, as a gift to the civilized life of our race from the"
"humble organisms, both animal and vegetable, of the remote past,"
whose remains were entombed in the sediments of the Ordovician and
later geological ages.
Petroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified
"rocks. Certain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others"
give off its characteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer.
"Many shales are bituminous, and some are so highly charged that"
"small flakes may be lighted like tapers, and several gallons of"
oil to the ton may be obtained by distillation.
But oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain
conditions meet:
"chieftains to assist them in their affrays with rival tribes, and made"
more than one alliance by giving such assistance. But the later
atrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards seem to have had the effect of
uniting the Indians in a tacit peaceful bond against the whites.
"Picturesque and graphic as are the writings of men like Esquemeling, the"
"Fray d’Acosta and Wafer, who saw the Indians in the days of their"
earliest experience with the sort of civilization that Pedrarias and
"Pizarro brought to their villages, they do not bear more convincing"
"evidence of the savagery of the invaders, than is afforded by the sullen"
aloofness with which the Darien Indians of today regard white men of any
race. More than the third and fourth generation have passed away but the
sins of the Spaniards are still recalled among a people who have no
"written records whatsoever, and the memory or tradition causes them to"
withhold their friendship from the remotest descendants of the historic
oppressors.
"There seems to have been no written language, nor even any system of"
"hieroglyphics among the tribes of Panama, a fact that places them far"
below our North American Indians in the scale of mental development. On
the other hand in weaving and in fashioning articles for domestic use
they were in advance of the North American aborigines. Their domestic
"architecture was more substantial, and they were less nomadic, the"
latter fact being probably due to the slight encouragement given to
wandering by the jungle. The great houses of the San Blas Indians in
their villages recall the “Long houses” of the Iroquois as described by
Parkman.

"ACTIONS.--Salicylic acid, sodium salicylate and phenyl salicylate are"
"powerful antiseptic, anti-rheumatic, diaphoretic, cardiac depressant,"
antiferment and antipyretic. Salicylic acid is in addition irritant and
"astringent, continued in large doses is apt to derange digestion; best"
to be administered on a full stomach.
"USES.--For acute rheumatism, influenza, strangles and purpura where"
"there is much sloughing; also as a surgical wash, salicylic acid one"
"part, borax one part to thirty or forty parts of water. Salicylic acid"
is a more powerful antiseptic than carbolic acid. Salicylic of soda is
freely antiseptic. Salicylic acid is highly recommended in intestinal
"flatulence, given in two drachm doses with one ounce of aromatic spirits"
"of ammonia. In gastric-flatulence give two drachms in capsule, repeat in"
half hour if necessary.
ACONITUM--ACONITE--MONKSHOOD
"DERIVATION.--Aconite is obtained from the root of aconitum napellus,"
"which grows in Northwestern North America, Europe and Asia in"
"mountainous regions, and cultivated in the United States for its"
beautiful flowers.
"PROPERTIES.--The fresh leaves have a faint narcotic odor, most sensible"
"when they are rubbed. Their taste is at first bitterish and herbaceous,"
"afterwards burning and acrid, with a feeling of numbness and tingling on"
"the inside of the lips, tongue and fauces, which is very durable,"
lasting sometimes many hours. When long chewed they inflame the tongue.
"The dried leaves have a similar taste, but the acrid impression"
referred to above:--
When Mr. Gilbert said that he would like to see the women's parts
"played by boys, he was not uttering a jest. In some of the"
"performances at Westminster School, he had seen boys in women's"
parts much more effective than any professional actress. If women
"players had been proposed to Shakespeare, he would not only have"
"been scandalised, but he would have pointed out that it was"
impossible to get the force from women that was obtained from boy
actors.
NOTE TO THE ARTICLE ON 'COMMERCIAL MORALITY'
In the October number of the _Anglo-Japanese Gazette_ (London) is
"published a criticism by Mr. Curtis, editor and proprietor of the _Kobe"
"Herald_, on 'the ridiculously sweeping assertions,' as he calls it, made"
by Mr. Longford in his article. I subjoin herewith a passage which
relates to Mr. Longford's assertion that a 'cordon' is drawn by the
"Japanese round the trading centres of Yokohama and Kobe, and that"
foreign merchants are suffering under the 'thraldom':--
"Well, let me say that no sane, fair-minded man who knows anything"
whatever of his subject would ever dream of accusing the whole
Japanese people of a lack of commercial morality. All this talk
about a cordon being drawn round the treaty ports is rubbish. No
"such barrier exists, save perhaps in the imagination of a few who"
cannot shake off the prejudices and disabilities of the past. The
"idea sounds absurd to me, knowing, as I do know, that all the"
go-ahead firms have been doing their utmost for some time past to
open up connections in the principal cities. Mr. Longford seems to
think that business is conducted in Japan to-day just as it was
"double wall of cells inclosing a body cavity, and with an opening,"
the primitive mouth. Each of these early embryological stages is
"represented by living animals,--the undivided cell by the"
"PROTOZOA, the blastosphere by some rare forms, and the gastrula in"
"the essential structure of the COELENTERATES,--the subkingdom to"
which the fresh-water hydra and the corals belong. All forms of
"animal life, from the coelenterates to the mammals, follow the"
same path in their embryological development as far as the
"gastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge, those of each"
subkingdom going their own separate ways.
"We may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods"
organic evolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The
earliest one-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-
"celled animals of the type of the blastosphere, and these by"
gastrula-like organisms. From the gastrula type the higher sub-
"divisions of animal life probably diverged, as separate branches"
from a common trunk. Much or all of this vast differentiation was
accomplished before the opening of the next era; for all the
subkingdoms are represented in the Cambrian except the
vertebrates.
EVIDENCES OF PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE. An indirect evidence of life
during the pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and
"varied fauna of the next period; for, if the theory of evolution"
"is correct, the differentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long"
process which might well have required for its accomplishment a
large part of pre-Cambrian time.
"Other indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron"
"ores, and graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have"
been formed in later times by the help of organisms. If the
"from Genoa, in 1846, Dickens says, ""If I were a Swiss, with a hundred"
"thousand pounds, I would be as steady against the Catholic canons and"
the propagation of Jesuitism as any Radical among them; believing the
dissemination of Catholicity to be the most horrible means of political
"and social degradation left in the world."""
"In connection with Dickens' remark about Ireland, we may quote the"
"remarkable statement of Mr. Michael McCarthy, himself a Roman Catholic,"
"in his book, _Five Years in Ireland_, pp. 65 and 66, where, after"
describing the welcome of the Belfast Corporation to Lord Cadogan on
"his first visit, in 1895, to the Protestant North of Ireland, and"
their glowing statements about the peaceful and prosperous condition
"of their city and district, he contrasts this happy condition with"
"the unhappy state of the ""rest of Ireland,"" meaning by that the"
"Roman Catholic parts. ""In the rest of Ireland there is no social or"
industrial progress to record. The man who would say of it that it
"was 'progressing and prospering,' or that 'its work people were fully"
"employed,' or that there existed 'a continued development of its"
"industries,' or that its towns 'had increased in value and population,'"
would be set down as a madman. It is in this seven-eighths of Ireland
that the growing and great organization of the Catholic Church has
"taken root."""
"Mr. Gladstone, in an article on ""Italy and her Church,"" in the _Church"
"Quarterly Review_ for October, 1875, says: ""Profligacy, corruption and"
"ambition, continued for ages, unitedly and severally, their destructive"
"work upon the country, through the Curia and the papal chair; and in"
doing it they of course have heavily tainted the faith of which that
"chair was the guardian."" Elsewhere he says, ""There has never been any"
"more cunning blade devised against the freedom, the virtue and the"
"happiness of a people than Romanism."""
"of German-Jewish or Dutch-Jewish descent, who in the present"
generation had become Catholic Christians as it ranged them with the
"best people. They were worthy and wealthy Belgian citizens, but"
presumably would not have deeply regretted a change in the political
"destinies of Belgium, provided international finance was not"
"adversely affected. There were also a few Belgian Socialists--a few,"
"but enough--who took posts under the German provisional government,"
on the plea that until you could be purely socialistic it did not
matter under what flag you drew your salary.
"Von Giesselin was most benevolently intentioned, in reality a"
"kind-hearted man, a sentimentalist. Not quite prepared to go to the"
"stake himself in place of any other victim of Prussian cruelty, but"
ready to make some effort to soften hardships and reduce sentences.
"(There were others like him--Saxon, Thuringian, Hanoverian,"

"ended in a vast Sicilian Vespers, a boiling-over of a maddened"
"people reckless at last of whether they died or not, so long as they"
slew their oppressors.) He hoped through the pieces played at the
"theatres and through his censored, subsidized press to bring the"
"Belgians round to a reasonable frame of mind, to a toleration of"
existence under the German Empire. But his efforts brought down on
him the unsparing ridicule of the Parisian-minded Bruxellois. They
were prompt to detect his attempts to modify the text of French
"operettas so that these, while delighting the lovers of light music,"
need not at the same time excite a military spirit or convey the
least allusion of an impertinent or contemptuous kind towards the
Central Powers. Thus the couplets

"Le militaire n'est pas riche"""
where I found Frances and Bettina luxuriating in tearful sympathy.
"I walked home with Bettina, and she invited me to go to her parlor to"
"have a cup of tea. To see Bettina boil the tea (steep it or draw it, she"
said was the proper phrase) was as pretty a sight as one could wish to
"behold, and when she poured it out in thin china cups, handing one to"
"me and taking one herself, her pride in following the fashion of modish"
ladies was as touching as it was simple and beautiful. It was almost more
"than my feeble resolutions could withstand, so when I was about to leave"
"I had a great battle with myself and was defeated, for I seized her"
"hands, and although I said nothing, she knew what was in my mind, so she"
"hung her head, murmuring:--"
"""If you are willing to make me more unhappy than I am."""
"""Not for the world, Bettina,"" I answered, rallying against myself."
"""Goodnight."""
"""Good night. Now I know you are my friend,"" she answered softly, holding"
"my hands for a moment, then dropping them suddenly and turning from me."
"I have refrained from speaking of Mary Hamilton of late, partly because"
"I did not see her frequently at this time, and partly because the shame I"
felt at the time of which I am now writing comes surging over me whenever
I touch upon the subject. Not that I did anything of which I need be
"ashamed, but because I remember so vividly my motives and desires that"
"the old sensations return, even at this distant day, as a perfume, a"
"strain of music, the soft balminess of spring, or the sharp bite of"
"winter's frost may recall a moment of the past, and set the heart"
throbbing or still it as of yore.
"After leaving Bettina, I went back to Whitehall and dressed for a ball"
"that of a young woman, under twenty years of age, who has a child"
"and an aged parent to keep, and her husband went to the war a few"
"weeks ago, leaving her penniless and on the verge of having another"
"baby. A few days ago, when I went to take her weekly money, she"
"refused to take it, saying she had got a little work to do and"
"could now manage without any help, as there were so many in much"
greater need of help than herself; and she would not take the
"money, though she was earning even less than I was allowing her."
_That_ is what I call a real heroine.
How many at work amongst our poor last winter could give such
"evidence to character as that?--I am, sir, yours, etc."

NOTE TO DIALOGUE VIII.
Before the preceding pages had been printed two events worth mentioning
here took place. One is the lamented death of Sir Henry Irving. The
other is the public discussion which took place under the auspices of
"the London Shakespeare League, on the best method of presenting"
Shakespeare's plays on the modern stage. On the latter subject perhaps I
may add a word. While in Japan the tendency is to introduce
"women-players into the company of male players, and improvement of"
"scenery is much sought after on European lines, both of which are due to"
"the occidental influence, it is curious to notice that exactly reverse"
"movements, namely the dispensing with the female players and the"
"returning back to the primitive simplicity of stage properties, are"
advocated in England by competent persons with regard to the
representation of Shakespeare. I extract below among others a passage of
the speech of Mr. Bernard Shaw on the occasion of the discussion
"Helena returned from Palestine, bringing with her the stone on which"
"Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin Mary"
"sat down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the temple,"
"the horses drawing these precious relics stood still at this spot,"
"and refused every effort to make them move. Then Christian people,"
"'recognizing the finger of God,' erected a church on this spot--_S."
"Giacomo Scossa Cavalli_--where the stones are still to be seen."""
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Knees.]
"While speaking of interesting stones, I must not omit to mention those"
"in the Church of S. Francesca Romana, near the Forum, containing the"
"marks of the knees of St. Peter--(which show, by the way, that this"
apostle was a giant in size)--when he knelt to pray that Simon Magus
might be dropped by the demons he had invoked to support him in the
air in fulfilment of his promise to fly. One of these stones used to
"lie in the _Via Sacra_, and the water which collected in the two holes"
or knee prints was looked upon as so potent a remedy of disease that
groups of infirm people used to gather around them on the approach of
"a shower. According to the legend, the place where Peter knelt when"
he thus effected the discomfiture of Simon Magus and brought him to
"the ground with such force that his thigh was fractured, never to be"
"healed, was the ancient _Via Sacra_. But, after the priests had removed"
"the stone from the roadway into the church, the inconsiderate and"
"iconoclastic explorers of our day, who have made so many discoveries in"
"their excavations about the Forum, proved that the roadway from which"
"this relic was taken was not the ancient _Via Sacra_ at all, but a more"
modern roadway which had been mistaken for it!
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Head.]
"In the Mamertine Prisons, which are also quite close to the Forum, a"
"a certain district in the South-East, abutting on to the frontiers"
"of Afghanistan and of Baluchistan, and known as the Sarhad, which is"
occupied by a number of nomad tribes who claim absolute independence.
At this time these tribes were causing considerable embarrassment and
difficulty to the Indian Government.
"The Germans and their agents, who were past masters in the art of"
"propaganda, were still endeavouring, as they had done for years"
"before the outbreak of hostilities, to work upon the discontented"
portion of the Indian population in the hope of rousing them into
"open rebellion. They believed this to be quite possible, in spite of"
the magnificent way in which India had offered her resources of men
"and money to the British Raj, and hoped thereby to handicap us still"
further in our great struggle in the West.
"They were pouring their agents, with their lying propaganda, into"
"India via Persia and Afghanistan. Afghanistan, like Persia, was"
"nominally neutral, but she was breaking her neutrality by many open"
"acts of aggression, and was offering every facility in her power"
"to the German agents in their passage through her territories, and"
thence into the Punjab.
"To reach Afghanistan, however, the German agents had to pass through"
some part of Persia. The Persian Government placed no restrictions on
"the movements of either British or Germans, of which fact the latter"
took full advantage.
A glance at the map will show that apparently the easiest route for
"them to take across Persia was in the North, in the Russian sphere of"
"influence, and to approach Afghanistan through Korasan; or, failing"
"this, by a route rather farther South, across the Lut Desert, in the"
direction of Birjand. As a matter of fact they had tried both these
"routes, but without much success, owing to the inhospitable nature of"
the country through which they had to pass and also to the opposition
"they met with from the Hazara tribes round Herat, who, belonging"
"as they do to the Shiah section of the Mahommedan religion, are at"
"daggers drawn with the Afghans, who belong to the Sunni section."
"Therefore the Germans had to try yet another road, and succeeded"
farther South where they had failed in the North. By taking the
longer route through Kerman and Narmashir in the South and South-East
"of Persia, they found easy ingress into Afghanistan."
"To effect this, however, they had to make friends with the nomad"
and war-like tribes of the Sarhad. These tribes were traditionally
"friendly to the British, but the Germans had bribed them heavily"
and had moreover assured them that Germany had turned Islam and
that the Kaiser William himself was a convert to their religion. As
"the Sarhad tribes were always out for a good thing for themselves,"
"and as they believed the lie about the German conversion, they had"
allowed themselves to be tricked into helping the Germans. This
they were doing not only by permitting them to pass through their
"territory, but also by harassing the lines of communication between"
the inadequately small British frontier posts.
"The story of Germany having turned Mahommedan, farcical as it was,"
was nevertheless a potential source of grave danger for us in India.
"It must be remembered that Germany's ally, Turkey, was Mahommedan,"
"and that in helping us against Germany, the Mahommedans of India were"
"already being called upon, indirectly, to fight against their own"
"co-religionists. When, in addition, India was assured that powerful"
"Germany was winning, so her agents avowed, in every theatre of war,"
it was inevitable that in time her loyalty to us must suffer.
explicit.
At the present recruitment in the Indian Educational Service is made in
England and is practically confined to Englishmen. Such racial
"preference is in my opinion, prejudicial to the interest of education."
"The best man available, English or Indian should be selected"
"impartially, and high scholarship should be the only test."
It has been said that the present standard of Indian Universities is
"not as high as that of British Universities, and that the work done by"
the former is more like that of a sixth form of public schools in
England. It is therefore urged that what is required for an Educational
officer is the capacity to manage classes rather than high scholarship.
I do not agree with these views: (1) there are Universities in Great
Britain whose standards are not higher than ours; I do not think that
the Pass Degree even of Oxford or Cambridge is higher than the
corresponding degree here; (2) the standard of the Indian Universities
is being steadily raised; (3) the standard will depend upon what the men
entrusted with Educational work will make it. For these reasons it is
necessary that the level of scholarship represented by the Indian
Educational Service should be maintained very high.
"In paragraph 83,631 I have stated that even these Indians who have"
distinguished themselves in European Universities have little chance of
entering the higher Educational Service. I should like to add that these
highly qualified Indians need only opportunities to render service which
would greatly advance the cause of higher education. As regards
"graduates of Indian Universities, I have known men among them whose"
works have been highly appreciated. If promising Indian graduates are
"given the opportunity of visiting foreign Universities, I have no doubt"
that they would stand comparison with the best recruits that can be
obtained from the West.
previously opposed him at the Royal Society. The plagiarism was
subsequently discovered and led to much unpleasantness. It is not
necessary to refer any more to the subject except as explanation of the
fact that the determined hostility and misrepresentations of one man
succeeded for more than ten years to bar all avenues of publication for
his discoveries. But every cloud has its silver lining; this incident
"secured for him many true friends in England who stood for fair play,"
and whose friendship has proved to be a source of great encouragement to
him.
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES
Dr. Bose's next work in 1903 was the discovery of the identity of
response and of automatic activity in plant and animal and of the
nervous impulse in plant. These new contributions were regarded as of
such great importance that the Royal Society showed its special
appreciation by recommending it to be published in their Philosophical
transactions. But the same influence which had hitherto stood in his way
"triumphed once more, and it was at the very last moment that the"
"publication was withheld. The Royal Society, however, informed him that"
"his results were of fundamental importance, but as they were so wholly"
"unexpected and so opposed to the existing theories, that they would"
"reserve their judgment until, at some future time, plants themselves"
could be made to record their answers to questions put to them. This was
interpreted in certain quarters here as the final rejection of Dr.
"Bose's theories by the Royal Society, and the limited facilities which"
he had in the prosecution of his researches were in danger of being
withdrawn. And everything was dark for him for the next ten years. The
only thought that possessed him was how to make the plant give testimony
by means of its own autograph.
"we are accustomed to say that they are very backward, and that they"
have remained children for a long time. People are in the habit of
saying strange things.”
Felix Adler says: “Perhaps the chief attraction of Fairy Tales is due
to their representing the child as living in brotherly friendship with
"nature and all creatures. Trees, flowers, animals, wild and tame, even"
the stars are represented as comrades of children. That animals are
only human beings in disguise is an axiom in the Fairy Tales. Animals
"are humanised, that is, the kinship between animal and human life"
is still keenly felt; and this reminds us of those early animistic
interpretations of nature which subsequently led to doctrines of
metempsychosis.”[33]
I think that beyond question the finest animal stories are to be found
"in the Indian Collections, of which I furnish a list in the Appendix."
With regard to the development of the love of nature through the
"telling of the stories, we are confronted with a great difficult in the"
"elementary schools, because so many of the children have never been out"
"of the towns, have never seen a daisy, a blade of grass and scarcely a"
"tree, so that in giving, in form of a story, a beautiful description"
"of scenery, you can make no appeal to the retrospective imagination,"
and only the rarely gifted child will be able to make pictures whilst
"listening to a style which is beyond his everyday use. Nevertheless,"
"once in a way, when the children are in a quiet mood, not eager for"
"action but able to give themselves up to the pure joy of sound, then"
it is possible to give them a beautiful piece of writing in praise of
"Nature, such as the following, taken from _The Divine Adventure_, by"
Fiona Macleod:
“Then he remembered the ancient wisdom of the Gael and came out of the

“I remember well the feeling roused in my mind at the mention or sight
of the name _Lucifer_ during the early years of my life. It stood for
"me as the name of a being stupendous, dreadful in moral deformity,"
"lurid, hideous and mighty. I remember the surprise which, when I had"
"grown somewhat older and began to study Latin, I came upon the name in"
Virgil where it means _light-bringer_--the herald of the Sun.”
Plato has said: “That the End of Education should be the training by
suitable habits of the Instincts of Virtue in the Child.”
"About two thousand years later, Sir Philip Sidney, in his “Defence of"
"Poesy,” says: “The final end of learning is to draw and lead us to so"
"high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clay"
"lodgings, can be capable of.”"
And yet it is neither the Greek philosopher nor the Elizabethan poet
that makes the every-day application of these principles; but we have
"a hint of this application from the Pueblo tribe of Indians, of whom"
Lummis tells us the following:
“There is no duty to which a Pueblo child is trained in which he has
to be content with a bare command: Do this. For each he learns a
fairy-tale designed to explain how children first came to know that
"it was right to ‘do this,’ and detailing the sad results that befell"
"those who did otherwise. Some tribes have regular story-tellers, men"
who have devoted a great deal of time to learning the myths and stories
"of their people and who possess, in addition to a good memory, a vivid"
"imagination. The mother sends for one of these, and having prepared a"
"feast for him, she and her little brood, who are curled up near her,"
"await the Fairy Stories of the dreamer, who after his feast and smoke"
"on this subject, for the two following experiences gathered from the"
streets which bear indirectly on the subject of story-telling:
"Mrs. Glover was visiting a sick woman in a very poor neighbourhood,"
"and found, sitting on the doorstep of the house, two children, holding"
"something tightly grasped in their little hands, and gazing with much"
expectancy towards the top of the street. She longed to know what they
"were doing, but not being one of those unimaginative and tactless"
"folk who rush headlong into the mysteries of children's doings, she"
passed them at first in silence. It was only when she found them still
in the same silent and expectant posture half-an-hour later that
she said tentatively: “I wonder whether you would tell me what you
"are doing here?” After some hesitation, one of them said, in a shy"
"voice: “We're waitin' for the barrer.” It then transpired that, once a"
"week, a vegetable-and flower-cart was driven through this particular"
"street, on its way to a more prosperous neighbourhood, and on a few"
"red-letter days, a flower, or a sprig, or even a root sometimes fell"
out of the back of the cart; and those two little children were waiting
"there in hope, with their hands full of soil, ready to plant anything"
"which might by golden chance fall that way, in their secret garden of"
oyster-shells.
This seems to me as charming a fairy-tale as any that our books can
supply.
Another time Mrs. Glover was collecting the pennies for the Holiday
Fund Savings Bank from the children who came weekly to her house. She
noticed on three consecutive Mondays that one little lad deliberately
helped himself to a new envelope from her table. Not wishing to
"frighten or startle him, she allowed this to continue for some weeks,"
"and then one day, having dismissed the other children, she asked him"
quite quietly why he was taking the envelopes. At first he was very
"went to the Island of Hispaniola, and joined the buccaneers there, living"
by hunting wild cattle and drying the flesh or boucan.
"He then sailed for a few voyages as a sailor before the mast, and acted"
"with such ability and courage that the Governor of Tortuga Island,"
"Monsieur de la Place, gave him the command of a vessel and sent him out"
to seek his fortune.
"At first the young buccaneer was very successful, and he took many Spanish"
"ships, but owing to his ferocious treatment of his prisoners he soon won a"
name for cruelty which has never been surpassed. But at the height of this
"success his ship was wrecked in a storm, and, although most of the pirates"
"got ashore, they were at once attacked by a party of Spaniards, and all"
"but L'Ollonais were killed. The captain escaped, after being wounded, by"
smearing blood and sand over his face and hiding himself amongst his dead
"companions. Disguised as a Spaniard he entered the city of Campeachy,"
"where bonfires and other manifestations of public relief were being held,"
to express the joy of the citizens at the news of the death of their
"terror, L'Ollonais."
"Meeting with some French slaves, the fugitive planned with them to escape"
"in the night in a canoe, this being successfully carried out, they"
"eventually arrived back at Tortuga, the pirate stronghold. Here the"
"enterprising captain stole a small vessel, and again started off ""on the"
"account,"" plundering a village called De los Cagos in Cuba. The Governor"
of Havana receiving word of the notorious and apparently resurrected
"pirate's arrival sent a well-armed ship to take him, adding to the ship's"
"company a negro executioner, with orders to hang all the pirate crew with"
"the exception of L'Ollonais, who was to be brought back to Havana alive"
and in chains.
"Instead of the Spaniards taking the Frenchman, the opposite happened, and"
"disturbed or destroyed, with the same result.]"

in their emotional aspects and in the emotional transformation of

"1897, p. 294), 'when threatened by a gastric or intestinal attack dream"
of seeing fish. The late Professor Sergius Botkine told me that he had
"found this coincidence in his own case, and I have myself several times"
found it in the case of a young girl who is well known to me. Some have
supposed that the sleeping consciousness receives an impression of the
elongated shape of the stomach or intestine; but such a supposition is
easier to make than to prove.' Scherner associated dreams of fish with
"sensations arising from the bladder, and here also it may be said that we"
"are concerned with a fish-like viscus. Greenwood (_Imagination in Dreams_,"
"p. 195) stated that he had always been subject, at intervals of months"
"or years, to a recurrent dream in which he would see a river swarming"
with fish that were finally piled in a horrible sweltering mass; this
"dream always left a feeling of 'squalid horror,' but he was never able to"
ascertain its cause and significance.]

"Indeed, the more one studies Panama and its resources the more one is"
convinced that all that is necessary to make the country a rich and
"prosperous one, or at any rate to cause it to create riches and"
"prosperity for investors, is the application of capital, labor and"
systematic management to the resources it already possesses. In its 400
years of Spanish and mestizo control these three factors have been
"continuously lacking. There are men in Panama, of native birth and of"
"Spanish origin, who have undertaken to develop certain of the land’s"
resources and have moderately enriched themselves. But the most striking
evidence of the success to be obtained from attacking the industrial
problem in Panama systematically and in a big way is that furnished by
"the operations of the United Fruit Company, the biggest business fact in"
the tropics.
"Panama is, of course, only one link in the colossal chain of the"
operations of this company in the tropics. The rapidly increasing
prosperity of many of the Central Republics is due largely to the
"sweeping scope of the United Fruit Company, and its impress is in"
evidence all along the north coast of South America and throughout the
West Indies. Its interests in Jamaica are enormous. Cuba put Jamaica off
"the sugar map, but the United Fruit Company came to her rescue with an"
"offer to purchase all the bananas her planters could furnish, and"
"Jamaica now leads the American tropics with 17,000,000 bunches annually,"
"of which the United Fruit Company obtains nearly half, the balance being"
handled by its competitors. The company also owns the famous Titchfield
"Hotel of Port Antonio, and operates the Myrtle Bank Hotel of Kingston."
"In Cuba the company owns 60,000 acres of sugar plantations and its two"
great sugar mills will this year add to the world’s product an amount
"with a market value in excess of $10,000,000. Its scores of white"
"substantially borne out by Grattan, _Netherlands_, pp. 18, 34;"
"Blok, _Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Volk_, i, 159, 160,"
"305-11, Eng. tr. i, 203-8; Wauters, _Les libertés communales_,"
"1878, pp. 222-30. As is noted by Blok, the status of the peasantry"
"fluctuated, the thirteenth century being one of partial"
"retrogression. Cp. pp. 318, 319, as to the general depression of"
"the peasant class. The great impulse to slavery, as above noted,"
seems to have been given by the Norse pirates in general and the
"later Norman invaders, who, under Godfrey, forced every ""free"""
Frisian to wear a halter. The comparative protection accruing to
slaves of the Church was embraced by multitudes. In the time of the
"Crusades, again, many serfs were sold or mortgaged to the Church by"
the nobles in order to obtain funds for their expedition.
The cities were thus the liberating and civilising forces;[739] and the
application of townsmen's capital to the land was an early influence in
improving rural conditions.[740] But there was no escape from the
fatality of strife in the Teutonic any more than in the ancient Greek or
"in the contemporary Italian world. Flanders, having the large markets of"
"France at hand, developed its clothmaking and other industries more"
"rapidly than the Frisian districts, where weaving was probably earlier"
"carried on;[741] and here serfdom disappeared comparatively early,[742]"
the nobility dwindling through their wars; but the new industrial
"strifes of classes, which grew up everywhere in the familiar fashion,"
naturally matured the sooner in the more advanced civilisation; and
already at the beginning of the fourteenth century we find a resulting
disintegration. The monopoly methods of the trade gilds drove much of
"the weaving industry into the villages; then the Franco-Flemish wars,"
"wherein the townspeople, by expelling the French in despite of the"
"nobility, greatly strengthened their position,[743] nevertheless tended,"
"as did the subsequent civil wars, to drive trade into South Brabant."

"The sixth of April, 1917, had caught him with a promising string of"
"yearlings, each an aristocrat in the equine world of blue-bloods, each a"
hope for that most classic of American races. But he had thrown these
upon the hands of a trainer and submerged his personal interests six
"hours after Congress declared war. At the same moment, indeed, all of"
"Kentucky was turning to a greater tradition than that of ""horses and"
"whiskey""; and, by the time the draft became operative, the board of one"
county searched it from end to end without finding a man to
"register--because those in the fighting age, married or single, with"
"dependents or otherwise, had previously rushed to the Colors. This, and"
"the fact that his state, with three others, headed the nation with the"
"highest percentage in physical examinations, added luster to the shield"
of his old Commonwealth--though he roundly insisted that 'twas not
"Kentucky's manhood, but her womanhood, who deserved the credit. After"
"our cruise he was going back to the thoroughbreds, now within a few"
months of the required Derby age; and of course I had promised to be on

"Yet still he kept her close beside him on the steps of the mighty Dom,"
"half-longing, half-hesitating to take her further, and ever and anon"
assailed by a dreamy doubt as to whether she might not even now pass
"away from him suddenly and swiftly, as a mist fading into heaven,--when"
all at once the sound of beating drums and martial trumpets struck
loudly on the quiet morning air. A brilliant regiment of mounted Uhlans
"emerged from an opposite street, and cantered sharply across the Platz"
"and over the Rhine-bridge, with streaming pennons, burnished helmets"
"and accoutrements glistening in a long compact line of silvery white,"
"that vanished as speedily as it had appeared, like a winding flash of"
"meteor flame. Alwyn drew a deep, quick breath; the sight of those armed"
soldiers roused him to the fact that he was actually in the turmoil of
"present daily events,--that his supernal happiness was no vision, but"
"REALITY,--that Edris, his Spirit-love, was with him in tangible human"
"guise of flesh and blood,--though how such a mysterious marvel had been"
"accomplished, he knew no more than scientists know how the lovely life"
of green leaf and perfect flower can still be existent in seeds that
have lain dormant and dry in old tombs for thousands of years! And as
"he looked at her proudly,--adoringly,--she raised her beautiful,"
"innocent, questioning eyes to his."
"""This is a city?"" she asked--""a city of men who labor for good, and"
"serve each other?"""
"""Alas, not so, my sweet!"" he answered, his voice trembling with its own"
"infinite tenderness; ""there is no city on the sad Earth where men do"
"not labor for mere vanity's sake, and oppose each other!"""
Her inquiring gaze softened into a celestial compassion.
"quittance of earth?--and have I so soon won the privilege to die?"""
"As he spoke, she rose and stood erect, with all the glistening light of"
"the stained window falling royally about her,--and he obeying her mute"
"gesture, rose also and faced her in wondering ecstasy, half expecting"
to see her vanish suddenly in the sun-rays that poured through the
"Cathedral, even as she had vanished before like a white cloud absorbed"
"in clear space. But no! She remained quiet as a tame bird,--her eyes"
"met his with beautiful trust and tenderness,--and when she answered"
"him, her low, sweet accents thrilled to his heart with a pathetic note"
"of HUMAN affection, as well as of angelic sympathy!"
"""Theos, my Beloved, I am ALL THINE!"" she said, a holy rapture vibrating"
"through her exquisite voice.--""Thine now, in mortal life as in"
"immortal!--one with thee in nature and condition,--pent up in"
"perishable clay, even as thou art,--subject to sorrow, and pain, and"
"weariness,--willing to share with thee thine earthly lot,--ready to"
take my part in thy grief or joy! By mine own choice have I come
"hither,--sinless, yet not exempt from sin, but safe in Christ! Every"
"time thou hast renounced the desire of thine own happiness, so much the"
nearer hast thou drawn me to thee; every time thou hast prayed God for
"my peace, rather than thine own, so much the closer has my existence"
"been linked with thine! And now, O my Poet, my lord, my king!--we are"
"together forever more,--together in the brief Present, as in the"
"eternal Future!--the solitary heaven-days of Edris are past, and her"
"mission is not Death, but Love!"""
"Oh, the transcendent beauty of that warm flush upon her face!--the"
"splendid hope, faith, and triumph of her attitude! What strange miracle"
"was here accomplished!--an Angel had become human for the sake of love,"
even as light substantiates itself in the colors of flowers!--the Eden
"lily had consented to be gathered,--the paradise dove had fluttered"
"original plank bearing the inscription, ""_Jesus, Nazarene King_,"" in"
"Hebrew, Greek and Latin, which was placed over his head; also one"
"of the nails used in his crucifixion, and two of the thorns of his"
crown; besides a large piece of the cross of the penitent thief who was
"executed with him; and, most interesting of all in some respects, the"
finger used by Thomas to resolve his doubts as to the resurrection of
Christ (John xx. 24-28).
[Sidenote: A Bottle of The Blood of Christ.]
"In Percy's _Romanism_ it is said that ""the list of relics on the right"
"of the apsis of S. Croce includes the finger of S. Thomas, apostle,"
with which he touched the most holy side of our Lord Jesus Christ; one
of the pieces of money with which the Jews paid the treachery of Judas;
great part of the veil and of the hair of the most blessed Virgin; a
"mass of cinders and charcoal united in the form of a loaf, with the fat"
"of S. Lawrence, martyr; one bottle of the most precious blood of our"
Lord Jesus Christ; another of the milk of the most blessed Virgin; a
little piece of the stone where Christ was born; a little piece of the
stone where our Lord sat when he pardoned Mary Magdalene; of the stone
where our Lord wrote the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai; of the
stone where reposed SS. Peter and Paul; of the cotton which collected
the blood of Christ; of the manna which fed the Israelites; of the rod
of Aaron which flourished in the desert; of the relics of the eleven
"prophets!""[11]"
But our party saw none of these except the finger of Thomas. It is
"to be hoped that the others have been withdrawn from exhibition, for"
"surely superstition and vulgarity can no further go. I fear, however,"
"that those who are willing to pay enough can still see ""one bottle of"
"the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,"" and ""another of the"
"milk of the most blessed Virgin""! There is also ""_una ampulla lactis"
because of the extraordinary uses and associations of it within the
last thousand years.
[Sidenote: A Winter Trip to Monza.]
"So, regardless of the wet, cold, foggy weather that we found in"
"Milan, and the rivers of mud and slush that were then doing duty for"
"streets, and the splotches of snow that lay here and there in the"
"forlorn-looking olive orchards, we took the electric tram, which was"
"comfortably heated, and ran out to Monza, a distance of some ten miles."
"When we stepped into the chilly cathedral and looked about us, we could"
"not at first see anybody to show us around, though there were a good"
many poor people saying their prayers there. Evidently the custodians
were not expecting tourists at such a season and in such weather.
"But presently, in an apartment to the left, we found a number of the"
priests warming their hands over a dish of twig coals covered with a
"light layer of white ashes, which they kindly stirred a little to make"
them give forth more heat as they saw us stretch our cold hands also
towards the grateful warmth.
[Sidenote: The Treasury of the Cathedral.]
"When we asked if we could see the Iron Crown, they said we could; but"
"instead of going at once to the chapel in which it is kept, they got a"
"great bag of keys, large keys, thirty-seven in number, as the observant"
"statistician of our party ascertained, and led us into the treasury and"
"unlocked a great number of doors (one of which had seven locks), and"
showed us the costly objects and precious relics above mentioned. We
"were only mildly interested in these--even in the apostolic baskets,"
"the Virgin's veil, and John the Baptist's tooth--partly because we were"
so cold and partly because of our greater interest in the more famous
relic which we had come especially to see.
"Blackwoods' saloon, a recognisable but idealistic likeness,"
"that Ferrier remarked, 'I should call that the pursuit of"
beauty under difficulties.'
"During her infancy Edinburgh had become Mrs. Ferrier's home, though she"
"made frequent visits to Westmorland, of whose dialect she had a"
"complete command. The courtship, however, had been for the most part"
"carried on at the picturesque old house of Gorton, where 'Christopher"
"North' was temporarily residing, and which, situated as it is"
"overlooking the lovely glen made immortal by the name of Hawthornden,"
"in view of Roslin Chapel, and surrounded by old-fashioned walks and"
"gardens, must have been an ideal spot for a romantic couple like the"
Ferriers to roam in. Another friend writes of Wilson's later home at
"Elleray: 'In his hospitable house, where the wits of _Blackwood_"
gathered at intervals and visited individually in season and out of
"season, his daughter saw strange men of genius, such as few young"
"ladies had the fortune to see, and heard talk such as hardly another"
"has the fortune to hear. Lockhart, with his caricatures and his"
"incisive sarcasm, was an intimate of the house. The Ettrick Shepherd,"
"with his plaid and homely Doric, broke in occasionally, as did also De"
"Quincey, generally towards midnight, when he used to sit pouring forth"
"his finely-balanced, graceful sentences far on among the small hours of"
"the morning. There were students, too, year after year, many of them"
"not undistinguished, and some of whom had, we doubt not, ideas of their"
own regarding the flashing hazel eyes of their eloquent Professor's
"eldest daughter.' But her cousin was her choice, though wealth offered"
"no attraction, and neither side had reason to regret the marriage of"
affection.
"At the time of his marriage Ferrier had been practising at the Bar,"
"probably with no great measure of success, seeing that his heart was"
not really set upon his work. It was at this period that he first began
"the air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path, and quietly,"
"calmly, majestically, the _Arcturus_ floated upward."

"Breckenridge, sixty seconds after the initial lift, actuated the system"
of magnetic relays which would gradually cut in the precisely measured
"""starting power,"" which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine"
"minutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power,"
they would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the
few thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate
powerfully against their progress.
Faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the
"starting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers"
felt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the
"acceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained"
constant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a
few moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps
a few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse
"than riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no"
change from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in
express elevators.
"The computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with"
"interest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space,"
there was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy
and precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could
be done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and
who was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest
degree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands
were the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed

"Large or too long continued doses derange the appetite and digestion,"
congest or inflame the stomach and liver. Eight ounces of alcohol killed
a horse. Alcohol is poisonous and should be used with caution.
"USES.--Are numerous, used principally as a stimulant, either in one"
"large dose, 2 to 3 ounces of alcohol, or better, in small repeated"
"doses, 1 ounce every 1, 2 or 3 hours, can be conjoined with other"
"stimulants such as sulphuric ether, aromatic spirits of ammonia,"
"digitalis, etc."
"It is used in anesthetic mixtures, such as alcohol, ether and"
"chloroform, combined in different proportions; in snake bites it is"
administered in very large doses.
"In blood poisoning alcohol is a most potent drug, sustaining the heart,"
lowering the temperature and acting as a germicide. Alcohol makes an
"excellent dressing for wounds; applied locally to threatened bed-sores,"
frequently prevents their formation. It is useful in colds at their
"outset, or in a chill to restore the balance of the circulation and"
prevent or overcome internal congestion by relaxing the blood vessels of
the periphery.
"All alcoholic liquors are useful in debilitating diseases, such as"
"influenza, in two or three ounce doses repeated every three or four"
"hours. One-half to one drachm of quinine to one ounce of alcohol, for"
"influenza or febrile diseases in general, excepting brain and spinal"
disease; useful in convalescence. In colic alcohol can be used with a
great degree of success; it will act as a carminative antispasmodic and
"stimulant, used in collapse and weak heart; in septicaemia and pyaemia"
"In the twelve preceding chapters, we have followed an expedition"
from Sinaketa to Dobu. But branching off at almost every step from
"its straight track, we studied the various associated institutions"
"and underlying beliefs; we quoted magical formulæ, and told"
"mythical stories, and thus we broke up the continuous thread of the"
"narrative. In this chapter, as we are already acquainted with the"
"customs, beliefs and institutions implied in the Kula, we are ready"
to follow a straight and consecutive tale of an expedition in the
"inverse direction, from Dobu to Sinaketa."
"As I have seen, indeed followed, a big uvalaku expedition from"
"the South to the Trobriands, I shall be able to give some of the"
"scenes from direct impression, and not from reconstruction. Such"
a reconstruction for one who has seen much of the natives' tribal
life and has a good grip over intelligent informants is neither very
"difficult nor need it be fanciful at all. Indeed, towards the end"
"of my second visit, I had several times opportunities to check such"
"a reconstruction by witnessing the actual occurrence, for after my"
first year's stay in the Trobriands I had written out already some
"of my material. As a rule, even in minute details, my reconstructions"
"hardly differed from reality, as the tests have shown. None the less,"
it is possible for an Ethnographer to enter into concrete details
with more conviction when he describes things actually seen.
"In September, 1917, an uvalaku expedition was led by Kouta'uya"
"from Sinaketa to Dobu. The Vakutans joining them on the way, and the"
"canoes of the Amphletts following them also, some forty canoes finally"
arrived at the western shore of Dawson Straits. It was arranged then
and there that a return expedition from that district should visit
"Sinaketa in about six months' time. Kauyaporu, the esa'esa (headman)"
"of Kesora'i hamlet in the village of Bwayowa, had a pig with circular"
only subtlety and arid ingenuity. All symbolism and allegory were
"fundamentally alien to him and indifferent, though he occasionally tried"
his hand at an allegory; and he never was mystically inclined.
Now here it is just as much the deficiencies of his own mind as the
qualities of the system which made him unable to appreciate it. While he
struck at the abuse of ceremonies and of Church practices both with
"noble indignation and well-aimed mockery, a proud irony to which he was"
not fully entitled preponderates in his condemnation of scholastic
theology which he could not quite understand. It was easy always to talk
with a sneer of the conservative divines of his time as _magistri

His noble indignation hurt only those who deserved castigation and
"strengthened what was valuable, but his mockery hurt the good as well as"
"the bad in spite of him, assailed both the institution and persons, and"
injured without elevating them. The individualist Erasmus never
"understood what it meant to offend the honour of an office, an order, or"
"an establishment, especially when that institution is the most sacred of"
"all, the Church itself."
Erasmus's conception of the Church was no longer purely Catholic. Of
that glorious structure of medieval-Christian civilization with its
"mystic foundation, its strict hierarchic construction, its splendidly"
fitting symmetry he saw hardly anything but its load of outward details
and ornament. Instead of the world which Thomas Aquinas and Dante had
"described, according to their vision, Erasmus saw another world, full of"
"charm and elevated feeling, and this he held up before his compatriots."

"It was the world of Antiquity, but illuminated throughout by Christian"
They did not stop at the street level; they continued on down another
"ramp, around a bend, descending an even steeper incline toward the"
bowels of Jupiter. Their descent ended at last before a huge metal
"barrier which, at a signal from the leader, drew smoothly up into the"
"ceiling to disclose a gigantic, red-lit chamber underlying the"
foundations of the building.
"In fear and awe, Dex gazed around that huge room."
It resembled in part a nightmare rearrangement of such a laboratory as
might be found on Earth; and in part a torture chamber such as the
most ferocious of savages might have devised had they been
scientifically equipped to add contrivances of supercivilization to
the furthering of their primitive lust for cruelty.
There were great benches--head-high to the Earthman--to accommodate
the height of the Rogan workmen. There were numberless metal
"instruments, and glass coils, and enormous retorts; and in one corner"
"an orange colored flame burnt steadily on a naked metal plate, seeming"
to have no fuel or other source of being.
There was a long rack of cruelly pointed and twisted instruments.
"Under this was a row of long, delicate pincers, with coils on the"
handles to indicate that they might be heated to fiendish precision of
temperatures. There were gleaming metal racks with calibrated
slide-rods and spring dials to denote just what pull was being exerted
on whatever unhappy creature might be stretched taut on them. There
"were tiny cones of metal whose warped, baked appearance testified that"
they were little portable furnaces that could be placed on any desired
"portion of the anatomy, to slowly bake the selected disk of flesh"
beneath them.
which has a genuine religious motive often fails. Most of the great
"artists in fiction, when they have taken in hand a subject which is of"
"religious interest, have written in a spirit of detachment. George"
"Eliot’s _Romola_ is an example, and the result is that men are more"
interested in Tito Melema than in Savonarola. Novels in which religion
is necessarily much in evidence have been written either by literary
artists who have studiously endeavoured to lay aside their own
"personal convictions, or if the books have been written with a"
distinctly religious purpose the hero and heroine have been
"unconvincing, the people in the story have not been alive."
When Cardinal Newman had abandoned prematurely his hope of maintaining
"the Catholic character of the Church of England, he did not disdain to"
employ his pen in the production of a novel with a religious purpose;
but we are amazed to find that the exquisite grace of style which is
one of the charms of the _Apologia_ could not render Charles Riding
"interesting, or the novel _Loss and Gain_, of which he is the hero,"
readable.
It is perhaps dangerous to give another example from contemporary
"fiction, but those who justly admire Mrs. Humphry Ward’s subtle"
discernment of character and great and increasing mastery of form and
"style, will not be inclined to dispute the opinion that when, in"
"_Robert Elsmere_, she undertook the defence of the modern Unitarian"
"position, her hero was hardly a “Man’s man.”"
The reason is not far to seek. The average man knows too much of the
darker side of life; and the necessary effort made by the author of
"religious novels to depict that of which they, fortunately for their"
"own souls, have had no experience, is not successful. Charles"
Kingsley’s undergraduate days were perhaps not without knowledge of
"the shadows, but he is happier in the Schools of Alexandria, or in the"
reaction of these various weak solutions upon one another and upon
the walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of vein stuffs and
ores.
As an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the
"case of a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines, Nevada, to"
"carry the hot water of the mine from one level to another, which"
in ten years was lined with calcium carbonate more than half an
inch thick.
"The Steamboat Springs, Nevada, furnish examples of mineral veins"
in process of formation. The steaming water rises through fissures
in volcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone
"of quartz, with metallic ores of iron, mercury, lead, and other"
metals.
RECONCENTRATION. Near the base of the zone of solution veins are
often stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits.
This local enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of
its metalliferous ores. As the surface of the land is slowly
"lowered by weathering and running water, the zone of solution is"
lowered at an equal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of
cementation. The minerals of veins are therefore constantly being
dissolved along their upper portions and carried down the fissures
"by ground water to lower levels, where they are redeposited."
Many of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive
concentrations: the ores were leached originally from the rocks to
a large extent by laterally seeping waters; they were concentrated
in the ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents;
they have been reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just
mentioned.
his must necessarily be in direct and absolute opposition! At the same
"time, he remembered that those who were sure of their faith never lost"
"their temper about it,--and as he glanced at his friend's perfectly"
"serene and coldly smiling countenance, he saw there was no danger of"
"his letting slip, even for a moment, his admirable power of"
"self-command. The Duc de la Santoisie, meanwhile, settling his"
"mustache, and gracefully waving one hand, on which sparkled a large"
"diamond ring, bent forward a little with a courteous, deprecatory"
gesture.

"a severely weighty emphasis on these words,--""the moral sense of each"
"man, if properly trained, is quite sufficient to guide him through"
"existence, without any such weakness as reliance on a merely"
"supposititious Deity."""
The Duke's French way of speaking English was charming; he gave an
"expressive roll to his r's, especially when he said ""the moral sense,"""
that of itself almost carried conviction. His wife smiled as she heard
"him, and her smile was not altogether pleasant. Perhaps she wondered by"
"what criterion of excellence he measured his own ""moral sense,"" or"
"whether, despite his education and culture, he had any ""moral sense"" at"
"all, higher than that of the pig, who eats to be eaten! But Alwyn"
"spoke, and she listened intently, finding a singular fascination in the"
"soft and quiet modulation of his voice, which gave a vaguely delicious"
suggestion of music underlying speech.

"the gods themselves, all this was now preached with a firmness and"
"precision hitherto unknown. These eschatological doctrines in particular,"
helped Egypt to conquer the Latin world and especially the miserable
"masses, on whom the weight of all the iniquities of Roman society rested"
heavily.

The power and popularity of that belief in future life has left traces even
"in the French language, and in concluding this study, from which I have"
"been compelled to exclude every picturesque detail, I would like to point"
out how a French word of to-day dimly perpetuates the memory of the old
Egyptian ideas.
During the cold nights of their long winters the Scandinavians dreamed of a
Walhalla where the deceased warriors sat in well-closed brilliantly
"illuminated halls, warming themselves and drinking the strong liquor served"
"by the Valkyries; but under the burning sky of Egypt, near the arid sand"
"where thirst kills the traveler, people wished that their dead might find a"
limpid spring in their future wanderings to assuage the heat that devoured
"them, and that they might be {102} refreshed by the breezes of the north"
wind.[89] Even at Rome the adherents of the Alexandrian gods frequently
"inscribed the following wish on their tombs: ""May Osiris give you fresh"
"water.""[90] Soon this water became, in a figurative sense, the fountain of"
life pouring out immortality to thirsting souls. The metaphor obtained such
popularity that in Latin _refrigerium_ became synonymous with comfort and
"happiness. The term retained this meaning in the liturgy of the church,[91]"
and for that reason people continue to pray for spiritual
_rafraîchissement_ of the dead although the Christian paradise has very
"Had his father acted thus, the young Napoleon would in all probability"
have entered the military or naval service of Great Britain; he might
"have shared Paoli's enthusiasm for the land of his adoption, and have"
followed the Corsican hero in his enterprises against the French
"Revolution, thenceforth figuring in history merely as a greater"
"Marlborough, crushing the military efforts of democratic France, and"
luring England into a career of Continental conquest. Monarchy and
"aristocracy would have gone unchallenged, except within the ""natural"
"limits"" of France; and the other nations, never shaken to their"
"inmost depths, would have dragged on their old inert fragmentary"
existence.
The decision of Charles Buonaparte altered the destiny of Europe. He
"determined that his eldest boy, Joseph, should enter the Church, and"
that Napoleon should be a soldier. His perception of the characters of
"his boys was correct. An anecdote, for which the elder brother is"
"responsible, throws a flood of light on their temperaments. The master"
of their school arranged a mimic combat for his pupils--Romans against
"Carthaginians. Joseph, as the elder was ranged under the banner of"
"Rome, while Napoleon was told off among the Carthaginians; but, piqued"
"at being chosen for the losing side, the child fretted, begged, and"
stormed until the less bellicose Joseph agreed to change places with
his exacting junior. The incident is prophetic of much in the later
history of the family.
Its imperial future was opened up by the deft complaisance now shown
by Charles Buonaparte. The reward for his speedy submission to France
was soon forthcoming. The French commander in Corsica used his
influence to secure the admission of the young Napoleon to the
military school of Brienne in Champagne; and as the father was able to
"satisfy the authorities not only that he was without fortune, but also"
"that his family had been noble for four generations, Napoleon was"
"to take part in an important religious function, or ""entertainment,"" as"
"Rogers calls it, ""where,"" he says, ""we waited on the Governour, Signior"
"Raphael de Silva Lagos, in a body, being ten of us, with two trumpets and"
"a hautboy, which he desir'd might play us to church, where our musick did"
"the office of an organ, but separate from the singing, which was by the"
"fathers well perform'd. Our musick played 'Hey, boys, up go we!' and all"
"manner of noisy paltry tunes. And after service, our musicians, who were"
"by that time more than half drunk, march'd at the head of the company;"
"next to them an old father and two fryars carrying lamps of incense, then"
"an image dressed with flowers and wax candles, then about forty priests,"
"fryars, etc., followed by the Governor of the town, myself, and Capt."
"Courtney, with each of us a long wax candle lighted. The ceremony held"
about two hours; after which we were splendidly entertained by the
"fathers of the Convent, and then by the Governour. They unanimously told"
"us they expected nothing from us but our Company, and they had no more but"
"our musick."""
What a delightful picture this calls to the mind--the little Brazilian
"town, the tropical foliage, the Holy Procession, ""wax figure"" and priests,"
"followed by the Governor with an English buccaneer on either side, and"
"headed by a crew of drunken Protestant English sailors playing ""Hey, boys,"
"up go we!"""
"Rogers, not to be outdone in hospitality, next day entertained the"
"Governor and fathers on board the _Duke_, ""when,"" he says, ""they were very"
"merry, and in their cups propos'd the Pope's health to us. But we were"
quits with 'em by toasting the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to keep up
"the humour, we also proposed William Pen's health, and they liked the"
"liquor so well, that they refused neither."" Alas! the good Governor and"
the fathers were not in a fit state to leave the ship when the end came to
"the entertainment, so slept on board, being put ashore in the morning,"
"""when we saluted 'em with a huzza from each ship, because,"" as Rogers"

who is believed to have died of the poison which he intended for one
"of his cardinals,"" is thus hit off by Pasquino:"
"""Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;"
"Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest."""
"Of Innocent X. (1644-'55), Pasquino says, ""Magis amat Olympiam quam"
"Olympium,"" referring to the shameful relations existing between this"
"Pope and his avaricious sister-in-law, Olympia Maidalchini, who made"
it her business to secure the profits of the papacy in hard cash.
"Trollope, in his _Life of Olympia_, says: ""No appointment to office of"
any kind was made except in consideration of a proportionable sum paid
down into her own coffers. This often amounted to three or four years'
revenue of the place to be granted. Bishoprics and benefices were sold
as fast as they became vacant. One story is told of an unlucky disciple
"of Simon, who in treating with the Pope for a valuable see, just fallen"
"vacant, and hearing from her a price at which it might be his, far"
"exceeding all he could command, persuaded the members of his family to"
sell all they had for the purpose of making this profitable investment.
"The price was paid, and the bishopric was given him, but, with a"
"fearful resemblance to the case of Ananias, he died within the year,"
and his ruined family saw the see a second time sold by the insatiable
"and incorrigible Olympia.... During the last year of Innocent's life,"
"Olympia literally hardly ever quitted him. Once a week, we read, she"
"left the Vatican, secretly by night, accompanied by several porters"
"carrying sacks of coins, the proceeds of the week's extortions and"
"sales, to her own palace. And during these short absences she used to"
"various oscillations. The order to produce short electric oscillations,"
"to detect them and study their optical properties, he had to construct a"
large number of instruments. It was a hard task to produce very short
"electric waves which had enough energy to be detected, but Dr. Bose"
overcame this difficulty by constructing radiators or oscillators of his
"own type, which emitted the shortest waves with sufficient energy. As a"
"receiver he used a sensitive metallic coherer, which in itself led to"
new and important discoveries. When electric waves fall on a loose
"contact between two pieces of metals, the resistance of the contact"
changes and a current passes through the contact indicating the
existence of electrical oscillations. Dr. Bose discovered the surprising
fact that with potassium metal the resistance of the contact increases
under the action of electric waves and that this contact exhibits an
automatic recovery. He found further that the change of the metallic
"contact resistance when acted upon by electric waves, is a function of"
the atomic weight. These phenomena led to a new theory of metallic
coherers. Before these discoveries it was assumed that the particles of
"the two metallic pieces in contact are, as it were, fused together, so"
that the resistance decreases. But the increasing resistance appearing
"for some elements, led to the theory that the electric forces in the"
waves produced a peculiar molecular action or a re-arrangement of the
"molecules, which may either increase or decrease the contact resistance."

HINDU UNIVERSITY ADDRESS
The foundation of the Hindu University was laid by Lord Hardinge on the
"than what had offered itself elsewhere, may be said to have led to"
his popularity; and by means of his popularity he reacted on his
"readers, stimulating their mental thirst, feeding their hopes, setting"
"before them visions, which when once seen are not easily forgotten,"
"and silently indoctrinating them with nobler ideas, which might"
afterwards be appealed to as first principles.”
If Cardinal Newman could thus maintain the value of Fiction in the
great ecclesiastical movement which has regenerated the Church of
"England, I may claim without apology that the reform in Poor Law"
Administration gained the attention of the public when Dickens made
"“Bumbledom” ridiculous, and that the Court of Chancery was swept"
cleaner by the breezes which were blowing from _Bleak House_. Let any
man run over in his mind the undoubted improvements in social matters
"during the last fifty years, and it will be seen how Fiction has"
assisted in their promotion. Did Charles Reade’s _Hard Cash_ do
nothing to arouse the attention of the public to the condition of the
insane? Did Sir Walter Besant’s novels turn no light on the sins of
"the sweater, or Charles Kingsley’s _Alton Locke_ show no reason for"
legalizing the Trade Union and the reform of the Law of Conspiracy?
"Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe may to-day be forgotten, but the southern"
states of North America would not dispute the influence of Fiction
upon the public mind.
"The fact is that men, who generally read nothing else but newspapers,"
"will read a good novel, and if the book brings before them principles"
"which they have hitherto neglected, they will very often consider"
"those principles again. It is necessary, however, that the novel shall"
appeal to them as being a fair record of the present or the past. They
may as they read it be unable to pronounce on the thesis which is at
"the back of the book, but they will be led to consider and discuss it"
"if the story, as a story, holds them. And it is here that the story"
"with the country round Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment"
"as to the tendency of papal domination. The descent of Spain, once"
"the first among the monarchies, to the lowest depths of degradation,"
"the elevation of Holland, in spite of many natural disadvantages, to"
"a position such as no commonwealth so small has ever reached, teach"
the same lesson. Whoever passes in Germany from a Roman Catholic to
"a Protestant principality, in Switzerland from a Roman Catholic to a"
"Protestant canton, in Ireland from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant"
"county, finds that he has passed from a lower to a higher grade of"
civilization. On the other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails.
The Protestants of the United States have left far behind them the
"Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Roman Catholics of"
"Lower Canada remain inert, while the whole continent round them is"
in a ferment with Protestant activity and enterprise. The French
"have doubtless shown an energy and intelligence which, even when"
"misdirected, have justly entitled them to be called a great people."
"But this apparent exception, when examined, will be found to confirm"
"the rule, for in no country that is called Roman Catholic has the"
"Roman Catholic Church, during several generations, possessed so little"
"authority as in France."""
"Charles Dickens, in a letter written from Switzerland, in 1845, to"
"his friend and biographer, Forster, says: ""In the Simplon, hard"
"by here, where (at the bridge of St. Maurice over the Rhone) the"
"Protestant canton ends and a Catholic canton begins, you might"
separate two perfectly distinct and different conditions of humanity
by drawing a line with your stick in the dust on the ground. On the
"Protestant side--neatness, cheerfulness, industry, education, continued"
"aspiration, at least, after better things. On the Catholic side--dirt,"
"disease, ignorance, squalor and misery. I have so constantly observed"
the like of this since I came abroad that I have a sad misgiving that

An habitual resident in London who is gifted with a keen faculty of
"hearing and observation, will soon learn to know instinctively the"
"various characteristics of the people who call upon him, by the"
particular manner in which each one handles his door-bell or knocker.
"He will recognize the timid from the bold, the modest from the"
"arrogant, the meditative thinker from the bustling man of fashion, the"
familiar friend from the formal acquaintance. Every individual's method
of announcing his or her arrival to the household is distinctly
"different,--and Villiers, who studied a little of everything, had not"
failed to take note of the curiously diversified degrees of single and
double rapping by means of which his visitors sought admittance to his
"abode. In fact, he rather prided himself on being able to guess with"
almost invariable correctness what special type of man or woman was at
"his door, provided he could hear the whole diapason of their knock from"
"beginning to end. When he was shut in his ""den,"" however, the sounds"
"were muffled by distance, and he could form no just"
"judgment,--sometimes, indeed, he did not hear them at all, especially"
if he happened to be playing his 'cello at the time. So that this
"morning he was considerably startled, when, having finished his letter"
"to the Duchess de la Santoisie, a long and persistent rat-tat-tatting"
"echoed noisily through the house, like the smart, quick blows of a"
carpenter's hammer--a species of knock that was entirely unfamiliar to
"him, and that, while so emphatic in character, suggested to his mind"
"neither friend nor foe. He laid down his pen, listened and waited. In a"
minute or two his servant entered the room.

instruction which he received. He kept up his friendship with the sons
"of his instructor as years went on, and always expressed himself as"
deeply attached to the place where a happy childhood had been passed.
"Nor was learning apparently neglected, for Ferrier began his Latin"
"studies at Ruthwell, and there first learned--an unusual lesson for so"
"young a boy--to delight in the reading of the Latin poets, and of"
"Virgil and Ovid in particular. After leaving Ruthwell, he attended the"
"High School of Edinburgh, the great Grammar School of the metropolis,"
"which was, however, soon to have a rival in another day school set up"
in the western part of the rapidly growing town; and then he was sent
"to school at Greenwich, where he was placed under the care of Dr."
"Burney, a nephew of the famous Fanny Burney, afterwards Madame"
"d'Arblay. From school, as the manner of the time was, the boy passed to"
"the University of Edinburgh at the age of seventeen,--older really than"
"was customary in his day,--and here he remained for the two sessions"
"1825-26 and 1826-27, or until he was old enough to matriculate at"
"Oxford. At Edinburgh, Ferrier distinguished himself in the class of"
"Moral Philosophy, and carried off the prize of the year for a poem"
which was looked upon as giving promise of literary power afterwards
fulfilled. His knowledge of Latin and Greek were considered good (the
"standard might not have been very high), but in mathematics he was"
nowhere. At Oxford he was entered in 1828 as a 'gentleman-commoner' at
"Magdalen College, the College of his future father-in-law, John Wilson."
A gentleman-commoner of Magdalen in the earlier half of the century is
"not suggestive of severe mental exercise,[2] and from the very little"
one can gather from tradition--for contemporaries and friends have
naturally passed away--James Ferrier was no exception to the common
"rule. That he rode is very clear; the College was an expensive one,"
and he was probably inclined to be extravagant. Tradition speaks of
his pelting the deer in Magdalen Park with eggs; but as to further
"distinction in more intellectual lines, record does not tell. In this"
"respect he presents a contrast to his predecessor at Oxford, and friend"

"And on another occasion, when Calypso hospitably provides clothes for"
"the shipwrecked men, and Telemachus is handling a tunic of the finest"
"wool and white as snow, with a vest of purple embroidered with gold,"
"and displaying much pleasure in the magnificence of the clothes, Mentor"
"addresses him in a severe voice, saying: “Are these, O Telemachus, the"
thoughts that ought to occupy the heart of the son of Ulysses? A young
"man who loves to dress vainly, as a woman does, is unworthy of wisdom"
or glory.”
"I remember, as a schoolgirl of thirteen, having to commit to memory"
"several books of these adventures, so as to become familiar with the"
"style. Far from being impressed by the wisdom of Mentor, I was simply"
"bored, and wondered why Telemachus did not escape from him. The only"
part in the book that really interested me was Calypso's unrequited
"love for Telemachus, but this was always the point where we ceased to"
"learn by heart, which surprised me greatly, for it was here that the"
real human interest seemed to begin.
Of all the effects which I hope for from the telling of stories in the
"schools, personally I place first the dramatic joy we bring to the"
children and to ourselves. But there are many who would consider this
"result as fantastic, if not frivolous, and not to be classed among the"
educational values concocted with the introduction of stories into the
school curriculum. I therefore propose to speak of other effects of
story-telling which may seem of more practical value.

remember that somebody called them--perhaps it was Sir Arthur Helps.
It came about that those who had a secret and timid predilection for
"the story-book, but blushed a little if at Mudie’s counter they"
"ventured to ask for a novel, found that their ordinary reading of"
Biography and Memoirs revealed some unsuspected sympathies of the
illustrious and wise. Who would have thought that Darwin devoured
"novels and Dean Church did not disdain them, and that Mr. Gladstone"
sat up all night to finish _John Inglesant_? The respectable
"pater-familias has long ceased to proscribe novel reading, and the"
most austere biographer no longer hides as a revelation of weakness
"his hero’s literary divertisements. Finally, in this year of Grace"
1906 we are boldly told that Archbishop Temple could stand an
"examination in Miss Yonge’s novels, and on one occasion was heard"
keenly discussing with Lord Rosebery the careers of the May family in
the _Daisy Chain_ as though they were living acquaintances. From being
"recognized as a recreation the novel has developed into a power, and"
Charles Dickens was a pioneer in its progress. It is the custom
amongst certain “superior persons” to sneer at the novel with a
"purpose, and to suggest that authors attained remunerative results by"
taking some subject which was already ripe for discussion and weaving
round it a web of fiction.
"Undoubtedly there is danger to-day of such artifice, but I maintain"
that the great reforms of the past century owed much to writers whose
purpose was perfectly innocent. Cardinal Newman has told us of the
"literary influence of Sir Walter Scott, who turned men’s minds in the"
direction of the Middle Ages.

The worshippers of the Virgin have not been lacking in their efforts to
"erect a suitably sumptuous building on the site of this ""miracle."" The"
"magnificent nave, with its avenue of forty-two columns of Greek marble,"
surmounted by a frieze of mosaic pictures; the glorious pavement of
"_opus Alexandrinum_, whose ""crimson and violet hues temper the white"
"and gold of the walls""; the grand _baldacchino_, with its four porphyry"
columns wreathed with gilt leaves; and the splendid tomb chamber of
"Pius IX. (predecessor of the late Pope Leo XIII.), with its riot of"
"rich marbles and alabaster, in front of the high altar--to say nothing"
of the almost incredibly costly chapels opening into the nave--combine
to give S. Maria Maggiore a proud place among the very finest of the
fine basilicas of Rome.

"But not all the splendors of the building, nor all the fascination of"
"its ""miracles"" and legends, nor all the spell of its other relics, can"
"equal the interest attaching to the ""SANTA CULLA,"" the holy cradle. On"
"the afternoon of Christmas Day, we walked through the wet streets to"
"the front of the church, pushed back the heavy, dirty screen of padded"
"canvas, such as hangs at the door of every great church in Italy,"
"however fine, and, stepping within, found ourselves in the midst of"
a scene of the most dazzling splendor. The building was brilliantly
"illuminated with hundreds of electric lights and huge candles, which"
were sharply reflected by the glistening marbles on every hand; the
"air was heavy with clouds of incense, through the blue smoke of which"
"the lofty ceiling looked higher than ever, and the organ and choir"
Vivie's health gradually recovered from the effects of the forcible
"feeding; the prison fare, supplemented by the weekly parcels, suited"
her digestion; the peace of the prison life and the regular work at
interesting trades soothed her nerves. She enjoyed the respite from
"the worries of her complicated toilettes, the perplexity of what to"
"wear and how to wear it; in short, she was finding a spell of prison"
"life quite bearable, except for the cold and the attentions of the"
chaplain. She gathered from the fortnightly letter which her
"industry and good conduct allowed her to receive, and to answer,"
that unwearied efforts were being made by her friends outside to
shorten her sentence. Mrs. Warren through Bertie Adams had found out
the cases where jockeys and stable lads had lost their effects in
the fires or explosions which had followed Vivie's visits to their
"employers' premises, and had made good their losses. As to their"
"employers, they had all been heavily insured, and recovered the"
value of their buildings; and as to the insurance companies _they_
had all been so enriched by Mr. Lloyd George's legislation that the
"one-or-two hundred thousand pounds they had lost, through Vivie's"
"revenge for the seemingly-fruitless death of Emily Wilding Davison,"
was a bagatelle not worth bothering about. But all attempts to get
the Home Office to reconsider Miss Warren's case or to shorten her
imprisonment (except by the abridgment that could be earned in the
prison itself) were unavailing. So long as the Cabinet held Vivie
"under lock and key, the Suffrage movement--they foolishly"
believed--was hamstrung.
"So the months went by, and Vivie almost lost count of time and"
"almost became content to wait. Till War was declared on August 4th,"
1914. A few days afterwards followed the amnesty to Suffragist
prisoners. From this the Home Office strove at first to exclude
Vivien Warren on the plea that her crime was an ordinary crime and
admitted of no political justification; but at this the wrath of
"on a pretext, had called for drink, and vanished in the early morning,"
leaving a dead man behind him. Who was this man? Where did he come from?
Had he been missing since last night? On these inquiries the
"Superintendent launched several intelligent men, and then was forced for"
the time to turn his attention to the business of the day.
"To search a large town for a missing man takes time, and the searchers"
"did not happen to fall in with Company B of Procession 3, which at one"
"o'clock had mustered in Digby Square, prepared to march to the Public"
"Park. Had they done so, it might or might not have seemed to them worth"
"noticing that Company B of Procession 3, which was composed of"
"carpenters and joiners, had missed some one, namely the officer whom"
"they called their ""Marshal,"" and who was to have ordered their ranks and"
marched at their head; and the name of their Marshal was none other than
François Gaspard. The Superintendent himself was keeping watch over
"Company B, but, in a professionally Olympian scorn of processions, he"
"was far from asking or caring to know who the Marshal was, and indeed,"
"if he had known, he would scarcely have drawn such a lightning-quick"
inference as that the missing Marshal and the missing murderer were one
and the same. So Mr. Gaspard's absence was passed over with a few curses
"on his laziness, or, from the more charitable, a surmise that there had"
"been a misunderstanding, and Company B, having appointed a new Marshal,"
went on its way.
One demonstration of the public will is much like another in the shape
"it takes and the incidents it produces. This Sunday's was, however, as"
"friends and foes agreed, remarkable not only for the numbers who took"
"part, but still more for the spirit which animated it, and when the"
Premier and his colleagues made their appearance on the great platform
"there was no room to doubt that somehow, by his gifts or his faults, his"
"policy or his demagogic arts, his love of humanity or his adroit wooing"
"of popularity, Medland held a position in the eyes of the common people"
"origin. If they were not native, at least they were soon naturalised,"
and that for the simple reason that they satisfied the religious
"cravings of the Greek race. The essential spirit of their worship,"
"whatever the accidents of form and expression, was the spirit of the"
"old Pelasgian worship of Demeter; and therefore, though Dionysus may"
"have been an immigrant from northern barbarous peoples, the Greeks did"
not hesitate to give him room and honour beside Demeter in the very
"sanctuary of Eleusis. Similar, we may well believe, was the lot of"
"other foreign gods and rites. Whencesoever derived, they owed their"
reception in Greece to the fact that their character appealed to
certain native religious instincts of the Greek folk. Once transplanted
"to Hellenic soil, they were soon completely Hellenized; those elements"
which were foreign or distasteful to Greek religion were quickly
"eradicated or of themselves faded into oblivion, while all that"
accorded with the Hellenic spirit throve into fuller perfection; for
the character of a deity and of a cult depends ultimately upon the
character of the worshippers.
It is fair therefore to treat of Aphrodite as of a genuinely Greek
"deity; for, though she may have entered Greece from Eastern lands,"
doubtless long before the Homeric age her worship no less than her
personality was permeated with the spirit of genuinely Greek religion.
Too well known to need re-telling here is the story of how--to use the
words of Theocritus once more--‘the beautiful Cytherea was brought by
"Adonis, as he pastured his flock upon the mountain-side, so far beyond"
"the verge of frenzy, that not even in his death doth she put him from"
her bosom[1456].’ Such was the plot of one of the most famous religious
dramas of old time. And what was its moral for those who had ears to
hear? Surely that the beloved of the gods may hope for wedlock with
them in death.
It was certainly in this sense that Clement of Alexandria understood
different parts of this country in the success of his work. This was the
fourth occasion on which he had been deputed to the West by the
"Government of India on a scientific mission, and the success that has"
attended his visit to foreign countries has exceeded all his
"expectations. In Vienna, in Paris, in Oxford, Cambridge and London, in"
"Harvard, Washington, Chicago and Columbia, in Tokio and in many other"
places his work has uniformly been received with high appreciation. In
spite of the fact that his researches called into question some of the
"existing theories, his results have notwithstanding received the fullest"
acceptance. This was due to a great extent to the convincing character
of the demonstration afforded by the very delicate instruments he had
been able to invent and which worked under extremely difficult tests
with extraordinary perfection. Even the most critical savants in Vienna
felt themselves constrained to make a most generous admission. In these
"new investigations on the border land between physics and physiology,"
"they held that Europe has been left behind by India, to which country"
they would now have to come for inspiration. It has also been fully
recognised that science will derive benefit when the synthetic
intellectual methods of the East co-operate with the severe analytical
methods of the West. These opinions have also been fully endorsed in
other centres of learning and Dr. Bose had received applications from
distinguished Universities in Europe and America for admission of
foreign post graduate scholars to be trained in his Laboratory in the
new scientific methods that have been initiated in India.
RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR INDIA
This recognition that the advance of human knowledge will be incomplete
"without India's special contributions, must be a source of great"
inspiration for future workers in India. His countrymen had the keen
imagination which could extort truth out of a mass of disconnected facts
"effort must be made if affairs were to be placed on a better footing,"
and if a protest were to be raised against the cynical criticism in
"which the Reviewers indulged. Consequently, in April 1817, a literary"
periodical called the _Edinburgh Monthly Magazine_ was started by two
"gentlemen of some experience in literary matters, with the assistance"
"of Mr. William Blackwood, an enterprising Edinburgh publisher, whose"
reputation had grown of recent years to considerable dimensions. This
magazine was not a great success: the editors and publisher did not
"agree, and finally Mr. Blackwood purchased the formers' share in it,"
"took over the magazine himself, and, to make matters clear, gave it his"
name; thus in October of the same year the first number of _Blackwood's
Edinburgh Magazine_ appeared. From a quiet and unobtrusive 'Miscellany'
"the magazine developed into a strongly partisan periodical, with a"
"brilliant array of young contributors, determined to oppose the"
"_Edinburgh Review_ régime with all its might, and not afraid to speak"
its mind respecting the literary gods of the day. Every month some one
"came to their ears as Miss Higgins, who had charge of the little"
"group, posed them against an old, overturned dory. ""A perfect"
"type--native--girls----freedom----wild beauty----"" She resented the"
"rotting dory. Vick had leaned against a crimson velvet chair. Why,"
"her hair had not been combed since the morning before, her skirt"
was in tatters where she had torn it climbing into Top Notch; she
"was horribly conscious of her long legs, bare, brown, and bruised."
Sidney found that posing in the morning sun on a beach at Provincetown
was not the lark Vick had declared posing for the great Stuart Gelding
had been. But then Vick had flirted a little with Stuart Gelding and
had always had a cup of tea with him and his wife afterward; these art
students appeared to have forgotten that their models were human with
legs that ached from holding a position and arms that trembled with
very eagerness to move. It was not one bit of fun.
"as ""totally distinct from the Icelandic,"" Celtic influence is also"
specified as affecting Norse literature in general. The first
"generations of Icelandic poets were men of good birth, ""nearly"
"always, too, of Celtic blood on one side at least""; and they went"
"to Norway or Denmark, where they lived as kings' or chiefs'"
"henchmen. The immigration of Norse settlers from Ireland, too,"
"affected the Iceland stock very early. ""It is to the west that the"
best sagas belong: it is to the west that nearly every classic
writer whose name we know belongs; and it is precisely in the west
"that the admixture of Irish blood is greatest"" (_ib._). The facts"
"seem decisive, and the statements above cited appear the more"
clearly to need modification. It is to be noted that Schweitzer's
_Geschichte der skandinavischen Literatur_ gives no hint of the
Celtic influence.
But the Icelandic civilisation as a whole could not indefinitely
progress on its own basis any more than the Irish. Beyond a certain
point both needed new light and leading; for the primeval spirit of
"strife never spontaneously weakened; the original Icelandic stock being,"
"to begin with, a selection of revolters from over-rule. So continual"
domestic feuds checked mental evolution in Iceland as in old
Scandinavia; and the reduction of the island to Norwegian rule in the
thirteenth century could not do more for it than monarchy was doing for
Norway. Mere Christianity without progressive conditions of culture
availed less for imaginative art than free paganism had done; and when
"higher culture-contacts became possible, the extreme poverty of Iceland"
tended more than ever to send the enterprising people where the culture
and comfort were. It is in fact not a possible seat for a relatively
flourishing civilisation in the period of peaceful development. The
Reformation seems there to have availed for very little indeed. It was
"vehemently resisted,[690] but carried by the preponderant acquisitive"
"forces: ""nearly all who took part in it were men of low type, moved by"
The arguments I have given against the prevailing Christian dogmas and
"usages, which you uphold, are neither private nor personal, nor shall I"
allow them to take that phase. Life is too short for me to spend hours
"day after day in sustaining, in private, a public argument which has"
"never been (and, in my opinion, never will be), refuted. And it would"
do no good to the thousands whom you are pleased to say you fear will
be led astray by my position. You have a magnificent opportunity to lead
"them back again by honest public letters, or lectures, or sermons, not"
by an afternoon's chat with me.
"And, while I recognize the courtesy of your pressing requests (made,"
"without exception, in the most gentlemanly terms) to permit you to meet"
"me personally and refute my arguments, I feel compelled to say that,"
"unless you are willing to show the courage of your convictions, _and"
"the quality of your defense_, to the public, I fear they would have no"
"weight with me, and I should have wasted your precious time as well as"
"my own, which I should feel I had no right to do, nor to allow you to"
"do, without this frank statement of the case."
"Now, do not suppose that I have the slightest objection to meeting the"
"clergy personally and socially. Upon the contrary, many of my friends"
are clergymen--even bishops--but candor compels me to state that up to
the present time not one of them has (either privately or otherwise)
been able to answer either of the first two lectures in that little
"book, and as to the third one, no one of them, in my opinion, will ever"
try to answer it.
Time will show whether I am right in this.
"In the mean time accept my thanks for your interest, and believe me,"
"Sincerely,"
revolted unsubduably against his son is to be explained in terms of
certain circumstances little stressed in popular historiography. In the
"narratives of the rhetorical historians, no real explanation arises. The"
revolt figures as a stand for personal and religious freedom. But when
"Charles abdicated, after slaying his thousands, the Reformation had been"
in full tide for over thirty years; Calvin had built up Protestant
Geneva to the point of burning Servetus; England had been for twenty
"years depapalised; France, with many scholars and nobles converted to"
"Calvinism, was on the verge of a civil war of Huguenots and Catholics;"
the Netherlands themselves had been drenched in the blood of heretics;
and still no leading man had thought of repudiating either Spain or
"Rome. Yet within thirteen years they were in full revolt, led by William"
"of Orange, now turned Protestant. Seeing that mere popular Protestantism"
"had spread far and gone fast, religious opinion was clearly not the"
determining force.
"In reality, the _conditio sine qua non_ was the psychological reversal"
"effected by Philip when he elected to rule as a Spaniard, where his"
father had in effect ruled as a Fleming. Charles had always figured as a
"native of the Netherlands, at home among his people, friendly to their"
"great men, ready to employ them in his affairs, even to the extent of"
partly ruling Spain through them. After his punishment of Ghent they
were his boon subjects; and in his youth it was the Spaniards who were
jealous of the Flemish and Dutch. This state of things had begun under
"his Flemish-German father, Philip I, who became King of Spain by"
"marriage, and under whom the Netherland nobles showed in Spain a"
rapacity that infuriated the Spaniards against them. It was a question
simply of racial predominance; and had the dynasty chosen to fix its
"capital in the north rather than in the south, it would have been the"
lot of the Netherlanders to exploit Spain--a task for which they were
perfectly ready.
Ferrier appears to have spent a week at Frankfort before reaching his
destination at Leipzig. He describes his journey there: 'At Frankfort I
saw nothing worthy of note except a divine statue of Ariadne riding on
a leopard. After lumbering along for two nights and two days in a
"clumsy diligence, I reached Leipzig two days ago. I thought that by the"
"way I might perhaps see something worthy of mention, and accordingly"
"sometimes put my head out of the window to look. But no--the trees, for"
"instance, had all to a man planted their heads in the earth, and were"
"growing with their legs upwards, just as they do with us; and as for"
"the natives, they, on the contrary, had each of them filled a"
"flower-pot, called a skull, full of earth, put their heads in it, and"
"were growing _downwards_, just as the same animal does in our country;"
and on coming to one's recollection in the morning in a German
"diligence you find yourself surrounded by the same drowsy, idiotical,"
"glazed, stained, and gummy complement of faces which might have"
accompanied you into Carlisle on an autumn morning after a night of
travel in His Majesty's mail coach.'
Berlin impressed Ferrier by its imposing public buildings and general
"aspect of prosperity. It had, of course, long before reached a position"
"of importance under the great Frederick's government, though not the"
"importance or the size that it afterwards attained. Still, it was the"
"centre of attraction for all classes throughout Prussia, and possessed"
a cultivated society in which the middle-class element was to all
appearances predominant. Ferrier writes of the town: 'Of the inside of
"the buildings and what is to be seen there I have nothing yet to say,"
"but their external aspect is most magnificent. Palaces, churches,"
"mosque-like structures, spires and domes and towers all standing"
"together, but with large spaces and fine open drives between, so that"
"all are seen to the greatest possible advantage, conspire to form a"
most glorious city. At this moment a fountain which I can see from my
"In 1832, Ferrier became an advocate at Edinburgh, but it does not"
appear that he had any serious idea of practising at the Bar. This is
the period at which we know that the passion for metaphysical
"speculation laid hold of him,--a passion which is unintelligible and"
"inexplicable to those who do not share in it,--and as Ferrier could not"
"clearly say in what direction this was leading him, as far as practical"
"life was concerned, he probably deemed it best to attach himself to a"
"profession which left much scope to the adopter of it, to strike out"
lines of his own. What led Ferrier to determine to spend some months of
the year 1834 at Heidelberg it would be extremely interesting to know.
The friend first quoted writes: 'I cannot tell of the influences under
which he devoted himself to metaphysics. My opinion is that there were
"none, but that he was a philosopher born. He attached himself at once"
"to the fellowship of Sir William Hamilton, to whom he was introduced by"
a common friend--I think the late Mr. Ludovic Colquhoun. I know that he
looked on Sir William at that time as his master.'
Probably the friendship with Hamilton simply arose from the natural
attraction which two sympathetic spirits feel to one another. It is
"clear that at this time Ferrier's bent was towards metaphysics, and"
"that, as Mr. Inglis says, this bent was born with him and was only"
beginning to find its natural outlet; therefore it would be very
natural to suppose that acquaintance would be sought with one who was
"at this time in the zenith of his powers, and whose writings in the"
_Edinburgh Review_ were exciting liveliest interest. A casual
acquaintanceship between the young man of three-and-twenty and the
matured philosopher twenty years his senior soon ripened into a
"friendship, not perhaps common between two men so different in age. It"
is perhaps more remarkable considering the differences in opinion on
philosophical questions which soon arose between the two; for it is
just as difficult for those whose point of view is fundamentally
any time on its own account.'
"It was, as has been said, only about three years previously to this"
"visit that Hegel had passed away at Berlin, and one wonders whether"
"Ferrier first began to interest himself in his writings at this time,"
and whether he visited the graveyard near the city gate where Hegel
"lies, close to his great predecessor Fichte. One would almost think"
this last was so from the exact description given in his short
biography of Hegel; and it is significant that on his return he brought
with him a medallion and a photograph of the great philosopher. This
would seem to indicate that his thoughts were already tending in the
"direction of Hegelian metaphysics, but how far this was so we cannot"
tell. Certainly the knowledge of the German language acquired by
"Ferrier during this visit to the country proved most valuable to him,"
and enabled him to study its philosophy at a time when translations
"were practically non-existent, and few had learned to read it. That"
"knowledge must indeed have been tolerably complete, for in 1851, when"
Sir Edward Bulwer (afterwards Lord Lytton) was about to republish his
"translation of Schiller's Ballads, he corresponded with Ferrier"
"regarding the accuracy and exactness of his work. He afterwards, in the"
"preface to the volume, acknowledges the great services Ferrier had"
"rendered; and in dedicating the book to him, speaks of the debt of"
gratitude he owes to one whose 'critical judgment and skill in
detecting the finer shades of meaning in the original' had been so
"useful. Ferrier likewise has the credit, accorded him by De Quincey, of"
having corrected several errors in _all_ the English translations of
_Faust_ then extant--errors which were not merely literary
"inaccuracies, but which also detracted from the vital sense of the"
"original. As to Lord Lytton, Ferrier must at this time have been"
"interested in his writings; for in a letter to Miss Wilson, he advises"
her to read Bulwer's _Pilgrims of the Rhine_ if she wishes for a
"description of the scenery, and speaks of the high esteem with which he"
"difficult to recruit members, the festivities, once so popular, fell into"
"desuetude, and {38} Varro, at the beginning of his _Antiquities_, expressed"
"his fear lest ""the gods might perish, not from the blows of foreign"
"enemies, but from very neglect on the part of the citizens.""[21] It is well"
"known that Augustus, prompted by political rather than by religious"
"reasons, attempted to revive the dying religion. His religious reforms"
stood in close relation to his moral legislation and the establishment of
the imperial dignity. Their tendency was to bring the people back to the
pious practice of ancient virtues but also to chain them to the new
political order. The alliance of throne and altar in Europe dates from that
time.
This attempted reform failed entirely. Making religion an auxiliary to
moral policing is not a means of establishing its empire over souls. Formal
reverence for the official gods is not incompatible with absolute and
practical skepticism. The restoration attempted by Augustus is nevertheless
very characteristic because it is so consistent with the Roman spirit which
by temperament and tradition demanded that religion should support morality
and the state.
"The Asiatic religions fulfilled the requirements. The change of régime,"
"although unwelcome, brought about a change of religion. The increasing"
tendency of Cæsarism toward absolute monarchy made it lean more and more
upon the Oriental clergy. True to the traditions of the Achemenides and the
"Pharaohs, those priests preached doctrines tending to elevate the sovereign"
"above humanity, and they supplied the emperors with dogmatic justification"
for their despotism.[22]
It is a noteworthy fact that the rulers who most loudly proclaimed their
"autocratic pretentions, like {39} Domitian and Commodus, were also those"
that favored foreign creeds most openly.
"necessity of THAT! And, oddly enough, these lists scarcely ever include"
"the name of a poet,--which is the absurdest mistake ever made. A"
liberal education in the highest works of poesy is absolutely necessary
"to the thinking abilities of man. But, Alwyn, YOU need not trouble"
"yourself about what is good for the million and what isn't, . ."
whatever you write is sure to be read NOW--you've got the ear of the
"public,--the 'fair, large ear' of the ass's head which disguises Bottom"
"the Weaver, who frankly says of himself, 'I am such a tender ass, if my"
"hair do but tickle me, I must scratch!'"""
Alwyn smiled. He was thinking of what his Shadow-Self had said on this
"very subject--""A book or poem, to be great, and keep its greatness"
"hereafter, must be judged by the natural instinct of PEOPLES. This"
"world-wide decision has never yet been, and never will be, hastened by"
"any amount of written criticism,--it is the responsive beat of the"
"enormous Pulse of Life that thrills through all mankind, high and low,"
"gentle and simple,--its great throbs are slow and solemnly measured,"
"yet if once it answers to a Poet's touch, that Poet's name is made"
"glorious forever!"" He.. in the character of Sah-luma.. had seemed to"
"utter these sentiments many ages ago,--and now the words repeated"
themselves in his thoughts with a new and deep intensity of meaning.
"""Of course,"" added Villiers suddenly--""you must expect plenty of"
"adverse criticism now, as it is known beyond all doubt that you are"
"alive and able to read what is written concerning you,--but if you once"
"pay attention to critics, you may as well put aside pen altogether, as"
it is the business of these worthies never to be entirely satisfied
"with anything. Even Shelley and Byron, in the critical capacity, abused"
"Keats, till the poor, suffering youth, who promised to be greater then"
"either of them, died of a broken heart as much as disease. This sort of"
"injustice will go on to the end of time, or till men become more"
Christianized than Paul's version of Christianity has ever yet made
All the rumours which had been reported to me in the Amphletts about
the previous movements of the Trobriand natives had been correct. Thus
"the natives of Vakuta had really been to the East, to Kitava, and"
"had brought with them a big haul of armshells. To'uluwa, the chief of"
"Kiriwina, had visited Kitava later, and about five or six days before"
"had returned from there, bringing with him 213 pairs of armshells. The"
"Sinaketans then had gone to Kiriwina, and out of the 213 pairs had"
succeeded in securing 154. As there had been previously 150 pairs
"in Sinaketa, a total of 304 was awaiting the Dobuans. On the morning"
"of my arrival, the Sinaketan party had just returned from Kiriwina,"
hurrying home so as to have everything ready for the reception of the
"Dobuans. Of these, we got the news that very afternoon--news which"
"travelled overland from one village to another, and reached us from"
Vakuta with great rapidity. We were also told that the uvalaku fleet
would be at Sinaketa within two or three days.
This period I utilised in refurbishing my information about that phase
"of the Kula, which I was going to witness, and trying to get a clear"
outline of every detail of all that was going soon to happen. It is
extremely important in sociological work to know well beforehand
"the underlying rules and the fundamental ideas of an occurrence,"
"especially if big masses of natives are concerned in it. Otherwise,"
the really important events may be obliterated by quite irrelevant and
"accidental movements of the crowd, and thus the significance of what"
he sees may be lost to the observer. No doubt if one could repeat
"one's observations on the same phenomenon over and over again, the"
essential and relevant features would stand out by their regularity
"and permanence. If, however, as it often happens in ethnographic"
"field-work, one gets the opportunity only once of witnessing a"
"public ceremony, it is necessary to have its anatomy well dissected"
"beforehand, and then concentrate upon observing how these outlines are"
"followed up concretely, gauge the tone of the general behaviour, the"
strongly felt the attraction of a marvelous country where everything was
"mysterious, from the Nile that had created it to the hieroglyphs engraved"
upon the walls of its gigantic edifices.[10] At the same time they were
shocked by the coarseness of its fetichism and by the absurdity of its
superstitions. Above all they felt an unconquerable repulsion at the
"worship of animals and plants, which had always been the most striking"
"feature of the vulgar Egyptian religion and which, like all other archaic"
"devotions, seems to have been practised with renewed fervor after the"
accession of the Saite dynasty. The comic writers and the satirists never
"tired of scoffing at the adorers of the cat, the crocodile, the leek and"
"the onion. Juvenal says ironically: ""O holy people, whose very"
"kitchen-gardens produce gods.""[11] In a general way, this strange people,"
"entirely separated from the remainder of the world, were regarded with"
about the same kind of feeling that Europeans entertained toward the
Chinese for a long time.
A purely Egyptian worship would not have been acceptable to the Greco-Latin
world. The main merit of the mixed creation of the political genius of the
Ptolemies consisted in the rejection or modification of everything
"repugnant or monstrous like the phallophories of Abydos, and in the"
retention of none but {79} stirring or attractive elements. It was the most
civilized of all barbarian religions; it retained enough of the exotic
"element to arouse the curiosity of the Greeks, but not enough to offend"
"their delicate sense of proportion, and its success was remarkable."
It was adopted wherever the authority or the prestige of the Lagides was
"felt, and wherever the relations of Alexandria, the great commercial"
"metropolis, extended. The Lagides induced the rulers and the nations with"
whom they concluded alliances to accept it. King Nicocreon introduced it
"into Cyprus after having consulted the oracle of the Serapeum,[12] and"
"Agathocles introduced it into Sicily, at the time of his marriage with the"
"daughter-in-law of Ptolemy I (298).[13] At Antioch, Seleucus Callinicus"
THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS. It is possible that the earth began as a
"vaporous, shining sphere, formed by the gathering together of the"
material of a gaseous ring which had been detached from a cooling
and shrinking nebula. Such a vaporous sphere would condense to a
"liquid, fiery globe, whose surface would become cold and solid,"
while the interior would long remain intensely hot because of the
slow conductivity of the crust. Under these conditions the
primeval atmosphere of the earth must have contained in vapor the
water now belonging to the earth's crust and surface. It held also
"all the oxygen since locked up in rocks by their oxidation, and"
all the carbon dioxide which has since been laid away in
"limestones, besides that corresponding to the carbon of"
"carbonaceous deposits, such as peat, coal, and petroleum. On this"
"hypothesis the original atmosphere was dense, dark, and noxious,"
and enormously heavier than the atmosphere at present.
"THE ACCRETION HYPOTHESIS. On the other hand, it has been recently"
suggested that the earth may have grown to its present size by the
"gradual accretion of meteoritic masses. Such cold, stony bodies"
might have come together at so slow a rate that the heat caused by
their impact would not raise sensibly the temperature of the
growing planet. Thus the surface of the earth may never have been
hot and luminous; but as the loose aggregation of stony masses
grew larger and was more and more compressed by its own
"gravitation, the heat thus generated raised the interior to high"
"temperatures, while from time to time molten rock was intruded"
"among the loose, cold meteoritic masses of the crust and outpoured"
upon the surface.
It is supposed that the meteorites of which the earth was built
"brought to it, as meteorites do now, various gases shut up within"
"Panama and Sawkins, the former wishing to know what the pirates had come"
"there for. To this message Sawkins sent back answer ""that we came to"
"assist the King of Darien, who was the true Lord of Panama and all the"
"country thereabouts. And that since we were come so far, there was no"
reason but that we should have some satisfaction. So that if he pleased to
"send us five hundred pieces of eight for each man, and one thousand for"
"each commander, and not any farther to annoy the Indians, but suffer them"
"to use their own power and liberty, as became the true and natural lords"
"of the country, that then we would desist from all further hostilities,"
"and go away peaceably; otherwise that we should stay there, and get what"
"we could, causing to them what damage was possible."""
"This message was just bluff on Sawkins's part, but having heard that the"
"Bishop of Santa Martha was in the city, Sawkins sent him two loaves of"
"sugar as a present, and reminded the prelate that he had been his prisoner"
"five years before, when Sawkins took that town. Further messengers"
"returned from Panama next day, bringing a gold ring for Sawkins from the"
"well-disposed Bishop, and a message from the Governor, in which he"
"inquired ""from whom we had our commission and to whom he ought to complain"
"for the damage we had already done them?"" To this Sawkins sent back answer"
"""that as yet all his company were not come together; but that when they"
"were come up we would come and visit him at Panama, and bring our"
"commissions on the muzzles of our guns, at which time he should read them"
"as plain as the flame of gunpowder could make them."""
"After lying off Panama for some while without meeting with any plunder,"

But there was another work which exercised a great influence on his
"young mind--the ""Gallic War"" of Cæsar. To the young Italian the"
conquest of Gaul by a man of his own race must have been a congenial
"topic, and in Cæsar himself the future conqueror may dimly have"
recognized a kindred spirit. The masterful energy and all-conquering
"will of the old Roman, his keen insight into the heart of a problem,"
"the wide sweep of his mental vision, ranging over the intrigues of the"
"Roman Senate, the shifting politics of a score of tribes, and the"
myriad administrative details of a great army and a mighty
province--these were the qualities that furnished the chief mental
"training to the young cadet. Indeed, the career of Cæsar was destined"
"to exert a singular fascination over the Napoleonic dynasty, not only"
"on its founder, but also on Napoleon III.; and the change in the"
character and career of Napoleon the Great may be registered mentally
in the effacement of the portraits of Leonidas and Paoli by those of
"Cæsar and Alexander. Later on, during his sojourn at Ajaccio in 1790,"
when the first shadows were flitting across his hitherto unclouded
"love for Paoli, we hear that he spent whole nights poring over Cæsar's"
"history, committing many passages to memory in his passionate"
admiration of those wondrous exploits. Eagerly he took Cæsar's side as
"against Pompey, and no less warmly defended him from the charge of"
plotting against the liberties of the commonwealth[6]. It was a
perilous study for a republican youth in whom the military instincts
were as ingrained as the genius for rule.
Concerning the young Buonaparte's life at Brienne there exist few
"authentic records and many questionable anecdotes. Of these last, that"
which is the most credible and suggestive relates his proposal to his
schoolfellows to construct ramparts of snow during the sharp winter of
Abdominal section fifty-three and a half hours after accident.
Incision in right linea semilunaris. Great omentum adherent to
"ascending colon, which was covered with plastic lymph. Gas and"
intestinal contents escaped from an opening at the line of
reflexion of the peritoneum from the ascending colon;
retro-peritoneal extravasation and emphysema extended the whole
"length of the ascending colon and around duodenum, the wall of"
the colon itself exhibiting subperitoneal emphysema. The colon
was freed and the rent sewn up with interrupted sutures. About
[Symbol: ounce] iv of foul fæcal fluid were evacuated from
"loin, and a free counter-opening made. The opening in the ilium"
by which the bullet had entered the abdomen was found at the
brim of the pelvis; the loin and peritoneal cavity were sponged
dry and flushed with boiled water; no lymph was seen on the
small intestine. A large gauze plug was inserted into the
"posterior wound, one end of the plug being brought out of the"
operation incision.
During the succeeding six days progress was not unsatisfactory:
"the abdomen became soft, moved with respiration, there was no"
"sickness, and the bowels acted. The pulse fell to 90,"
"respirations to 20, and the temperature did not exceed 102° F."
"The wound suppurated freely, however, and although there were"
"no further signs of peritoneal septicæmia, it was evident that"
"general infection had taken place, and on the sixth day a"
"parotid bubo developed on the right side, which was opened."
On the seventh day the patient suddenly commenced to fail
"rapidly; vomiting was almost continuous--at first curdled milk,"
later frothy watery fluid--and on the eighth day he died. The
"abdomen remained soft, sunken, and flaccid, and death no doubt"
resulted from general septicæmia rather than from peritoneal
"patients in whom the bullet entered by the upper part of the loin, and"
"escaped 1-1/2 inch within the anterior superior spine of the ilium, also"
did well. The same holds good when the wounds either entered or emerged
"under the anterior costal margin of the thorax, either prior to or after"
traversing the thorax.
Wounds passing directly backward from the iliac regions were in my
experience very unfavourable; but I believe mainly as a result of
hæmorrhage from the iliac arteries.
_The occurrence of wounds of the abdomen of an 'explosive'
character._--The vast majority of the abdominal wounds observed in the
Stationary or Base hospitals were of the type dimensions. A certain
number of the abdominal injuries which proved fatal on the field or
"shortly afterwards were described as explosive in character, and were"
referred by the observers to the employment of expanding bullets.
"A few words on this subject seem necessary, because it seems doubtful"
whether such injuries could be produced by any of the forms of expanding
"bullet of small calibre in use, unless the track crossed one of the"
bones in the abdominal or pelvic wall. That this was sometimes the case
there is no doubt: thus I saw two cases in which the splenic flexure of
"the colon was wounded, in which the external opening was large, and a"
comminuted fracture of the ribs of the left side existed. One can well
believe that bullets passing through the pelvic bones might 'set up' to
"a considerable extent, and although I never happened to see such a case,"
an explanation of some of the wounds described by others might be found
in this occurrence.
"In instances in which the soft parts alone were perforated, I am"
"disinclined to believe that bullets of small calibre, either regulation"
"or soft-nosed, were responsible for the injuries. I had the opportunity"
"been maintained that Attis was not worshiped together with his companion,"
"the Great Mother, during the times of the republic, but this is undoubtedly"
"wrong, because the two persons of this divine couple must have been as"
inseparable in the ritual as they were in the myths.[10]
"But the Phrygian religion kept alive in spite of police surveillance, in"
spite of precautions and prejudices; a breach had been made in the cracked
"wall of the old Roman principles, through which the entire Orient finally"
gained ingress.
"Directly after the fall of the republic a second divinity from Asia Minor,"
"closely related to the Great Mother, became established in the capital."
During the wars against Mithridates the Roman soldiers learned to revere
"Mâ, the great goddess of the two Comanas, who was worshiped by a whole"
people of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks of
the {54} Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and
"personified fertile nature. Her worship, however, had not felt the"
"influence of Thrace, but rather that of the Semites and the Persians,[11]"
like the entire religion of Cappadocia. It is certain that she was
"identical with the Anâhita of the Mazdeans, who was of much the same"
nature.
The rites of her cult were even more sanguinary and savage than those of
"Pessinus, and she had assumed or preserved a warlike character that gave"
"her a resemblance to the Italian Bellona. The dictator Sulla, to whom this"
"invincible goddess of combats had appeared in a dream, was prompted by his"
superstition to introduce her worship into Rome. The terrible ceremonies
"connected with it produced a deep impression. Clad in black robes, her"
"""fanatics,"" as they were called, would turn round and round to the sound of"
"drums and trumpets, with their long, loose hair streaming, and when vertigo"
"seized them and a state of anesthesia was attained, they would strike their"
arms and bodies great blows with swords and axes. The view of the running
The geological formations contain a record still more important
than that of the geographical development of the continents; the
fossils imbedded in the rocks of each formation tell of the kinds
"of animals and plants which inhabited the earth at that time, and"
from these fossils we are therefore able to construct the history
of life upon the earth.
FOSSILS. These remains of organisms are found in the strata in all
"degrees of perfection, from trails and tracks and fragmentary"
"impressions, to perfectly preserved shells, wood, bones, and"
"complete skeletons. As a rule, it is only the hard parts of"
animals and plants which have left any traces in the rocks.
"Sometimes the original hard substance is preserved, but more often"
"it has been replaced by some less soluble material. Petrifaction,"
"as this process of slow replacement is called, is often carried on"
"in the most exquisite detail. When wood, for example, is"
"undergoing petrifaction, the woody tissue may be replaced,"
"particle by particle, by silica in solution through the action of"
"underground waters, even the microscopic structures of the wood"
being perfectly reproduced. In shells originally made of
"ARAGONITE, a crystalline form of carbonate of lime, that mineral"
"is usually replaced by CALCITE, a more stable form of the same"
"substance. The most common petrifying materials are calcite,"
"silica, and pyrite."
Often the organic substance has neither been preserved nor
"replaced, but the FORM has been retained by means of molds and"
"casts. Permanent impressions, or molds, may be made in sediments"
"not only by the hard parts of organisms, but also by such soft and"
"perishable parts as the leaves of plants, and, in the rarest"
"instances, by the skin of animals and the feathers of birds. In"
living[1514]. The allusion to human weddings is clear. It was no doubt
"imperative in old time, as it still is, in Greece, that anyone who"
"attended upon a bride or bridegroom, as for instance the bearer of"
"water for the bridal bath, should have both parents living; and the"
"use of the same term in reference to Eros, the attendant upon Zeus"
"and Hera, marks the intimate connexion between the divine marriage"
and the marriage of living men and women. But another epithet in the
"passage conveys no less clear an allusion to the marriage of those,"
"whom men call dead, with their deities. Hera is named εὐδαίμων, a word"
"which, meaning ‘favoured by God,’ may seem strangely applied to one"
who herself was divine[1515]. But it was selected by Aristophanes for
a good reason; by the word εὐδαιμονία was commonly denoted that future
bliss which the initiated believed to consist in wedlock with their
"deities. Like θεοφιλής, ‘god-beloved,’ the term εὐδαίμων, ‘blessed,’"
"was, so to speak, a catch-word of the mysteries[1516]; and the"
application of it to Hera in Aristophanes’ ode brings the legend of
Hera’s marriage into rank with those other wedding-stories whose actual
plot hinged upon the identity of death and marriage. Thus though one
"legend might be more appropriate in its externals to one occasion, and"
"another legend to another occasion, the ultimate and fundamental idea"
of them all was single and the same.
This view is boldly championed by the second authority whom I proposed
to quote upon the subject of mystic marriage-scenes depicted on
"funeral-monuments. ‘The idea,’ says Lenormant, ‘of mystic union"
in death is frequently indicated in the scenes represented upon
_sarcophagi_ and painted vases. But for the most part the idea is
"expressed there only in an allusive manner, which depends upon the"
identification which this marriage-scene established between the dead
"person and the deity, by means of such subjects as the carrying off"
"of Cephalus by Aurora, or Orithyia by Boreas, or the love-story of"
"Aphrodite and Adonis[1517].’ ‘Thus,’ he explains, ‘a girl carried"
"years; we can read its sacred texts, mythical narratives, hymns, rituals,"
"and the Book of the Dead in the original, and we can ascertain its various"
ideas as to the nature of the divine powers and of future life. A great
number of monuments have preserved for our inspection the pictures of
"divinities and representations of liturgic scenes, while numerous"
inscriptions and papyri enlighten us in regard to the sacerdotal
organization of the principal temples. It would seem that the enormous
quantity of documents of all kinds that have been deciphered in the course
of nearly an entire century should have dispelled every uncertainty about
"the creed of ancient Egypt, and should have furnished exact information"
with regard to the sources and original character of the worship which the
Greeks and the Romans borrowed from the subjects of the Ptolemies.
"And yet, this is not the case. While of the four great Oriental religions"
"which were transplanted into the Occident, the religion of Isis and Serapis"
is the one whose relation to the ancient belief of the mother country we
"can establish with greatest accuracy, we {74} know very little of its first"
"form and of its nature before the imperial period, when it was held in high"
esteem.
"One fact, however, appears to be certain. The Egyptian worship that spread"
over the Greco-Roman world came from the Serapeum founded at Alexandria by
"Ptolemy Soter, somewhat in the manner of Judaism that emanated from the"
temple of Jerusalem. But the earliest history of that famous sanctuary is
"surrounded by such a thick growth of pious legends, that the most sagacious"
"investigators have lost their way in it. Was Serapis of native origin, or"
"was he imported from Sinope or Seleucia, or even from Babylon? Each of"
these opinions has found supporters very recently. Is his name derived from
"that of the Egyptian god Osiris-Apis, or from that of the Chaldean deity"
Sar-Apsi? _Grammatici certant_.[1]
"Whichever solution we may adopt, one fact remains, namely, that Serapis and"
"general lines, as a danger which is bound to increase unless very"
definite steps are taken to counteract it. The supreme example of
"economic pressure applied against freedom of thought is Soviet Russia,"
"where, until the trade agreement, the Government could and did inflict"
"starvation upon people whose opinions it disliked—for example,"
Kropotkin. But in this respect Russia is only somewhat ahead of other
"countries. In France, during the Dreyfus affair, any teacher would have"
lost his position if he had been in favour of Dreyfus at the start or
against him at the end. In America at the present day I doubt if a
"university professor, however eminent, could get employment if he were"
"to criticize the Standard Oil Company, because all college presidents"
have received or hope to receive benefactions from Mr. Rockefeller.
"Throughout America Socialists are marked men, and find it extremely"
"difficult to obtain work unless they have great gifts. The tendency,"
"which exists wherever industrialism is well developed, for trusts and"
"monopolies to control all industry, leads to a diminution of the number"
"of possible employers, so that it becomes easier and easier to keep"
secret black books by means of which any one not subservient to the
great corporations can be starved. The growth of monopolies is
introducing in America many of the evils associated with State Socialism
"as it has existed in Russia. From the standpoint of liberty, it makes no"
difference to a man whether his only possible employer is the State or a
Trust.
"In America, which is the most advanced country industrially, and to a"
lesser extent in other countries which are approximating to the American
"condition, it is necessary for the average citizen, if he wishes to make"
"a living, to avoid incurring the hostility of certain big men. And these"
"big men have an outlook—religious, moral, and political—with which"
"they expect their employees to agree, at least outwardly. A man who"
"openly dissents from Christianity, or believes in a relaxation of the"
"marriage laws, or objects to the power of the great corporations, finds"
of his work. The greatest difficulty lay in the construction of a
receiver to detect invisible ether disturbances. For this a most
laborious investigation had to be undertaken to find the action of
electric radiation on all kinds of matter. As a result of this long and
"very patient work a new type of receiver was invented, so perfect in its"
action that the _Electrician_ suggested its use in ships and
electro-magnetic high houses for the communication and transmission of
"danger signals at sea through space. This was in 1895, several years in"
advance of the present wireless system. Practical application of the
result of Dr. Bose's investigations appear so important that Great
Britain and the United States granted him patents for his invention of a
certain crystal receiver which proved to be the most sensitive detector
of wireless signals.
UNIVERSAL SENSITIVENESS OF MATTER
In the course of his investigations Dr. Bose found that the uncertainty
"of the early type of his receiver was brought on by fatigue, and that"
the curve of fatigue of his instrument closely resembled the fatigue
curve of animal muscle. He was soon able to remove the 'tiredness' of
his receiver by application of suitable stimulants; application of
"certain poisons, on the other hand, permanently abolished its"
sensitiveness. Dr. Bose was thus amazed at the discovery that inorganic
"matter was anything but inert, but that its particles were a thrill"
under the action of multitudinous forces that were playing on it. The
lecturer was at this time constrained to choose whether to go on with
"the practical applications of his work, the success of which appeared to"
"be assured, or to throw himself into a vortex of conflict for the"
establishment of some truth the glimmerings of which he was then but
dimly beginning to perceive. It is very curious that the human mind is
sometimes so constituted that it rejects lines of least resistance in
"and Justinian,[33] and in accordance with the sad prophecy of Hermes"
"Trismegistus[34] Egypt, Egypt herself, lost her divinities and became a"
land of the dead. Of her religions nothing remained but fables that were no
"longer believed, and the only thing that reminded the barbarians who came"
"to inhabit the country of its former piety, were words engraved on stone."

This rapid sketch of the history of Isis and Serapis shows that these
divinities were worshiped in the Latin world for more than five centuries.
The task of pointing out the transformations of the cult during that long
"period, and the local differences there may have been in the various"
"provinces, is reserved for future researches. These will undoubtedly find"
"that the Alexandrian worship did not become Latinized under the empire, but"
that its Oriental character became more and more pronounced. When Domitian
"restored the Iseum of the Campus Martius and that of Beneventum, he {86}"
"transferred from the valley of the Nile sphinxes, cynocephali and obelisks"
"of black or pink granite bearing borders of hieroglyphics of Amasis,"
Nectanebos or even Rameses II. On other obelisks that were erected in the
propyleums even the inscriptions of the emperors were written in
"hieroglyphics.[35] Half a century later that true dilettante, Hadrian,"
"caused the luxuries of Canopus to be reproduced, along with the vale of"
"Tempe, in his immense villa at Tibur, to enable him to celebrate his"
voluptuous feasts under the friendly eyes of Serapis. He extolled the
merits of the deified Antinous in inscriptions couched in the ancient
"language of the Pharaohs, and set the fashion of statues hewn out of black"
basalt in the Egyptian style.[36] The amateurs of that period affected to
prefer the hieratic rigidity of the barbarian idols to the elegant freedom
of Alexandrian art. Those esthetic manifestations probably corresponded to
"religious prejudices, and the Latin worship always endeavored to imitate"
the art of temples in the Nile valley more closely than did the Greek. This
evolution was in conformity with all the tendencies of the imperial period.
"of activity for many aspiring young men. But for my disciples, I call on"
"those very few, who, realising inner call, will devote their whole life"
with strengthened character and determined purpose to take part in that
infinite struggle to win knowledge for its own sake and see truth face
to face.
ADVANCEMENT AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE
"The work already carried out in my laboratory on the response of matter,"
"and the unexpected revelations in plant life, foreshadowing the wonders"
"of the highest animal life, have opened out very extended regions of"
"inquiry in Physics, in physiology in Medicine, in Agriculture and even"
"in Psychology. Problems, hitherto regarded as insoluble, have now been"
brought within the sphere of experimental investigation. These inquiries
are obviously more extensive than those customary either among
"physicists or physiologists, since demanding interests and aptitudes"
"hitherto more or less divided between them. In the study of Nature,"
"there is a necessity of the dual view point, this alternating yet"
rhythmically unified interaction of biological thought with physical
"studies, and physical thought with biological studies. The future worker"
"with his freshened grasp of physics, his fuller conception of the"
"inorganic world, as indeed thrilling with ""the promise and potency of"
"life"" will redouble his former energies of work and thought. Thus he"
"will be in a position to win now the old knowledge with finer sieves, to"
research it with new enthusiasm and subtler instruments. And
thus with thought and toil and time he may hope to bring fresher views
into the old problems. His handling of these will be at once more vital
"and more kinetic, more comprehensive and unified."

problems of the nascent science which includes both Life and Non-Life
drives of the flight-angle directors in the hour and declination ranges;
before his eyes was the finely marked micrometer screen upon which the
guiding goniometer threw its needle-point of light; powerful optical
"systems of prisms and lenses revealed to his sight the director-angles,"
down to fractional seconds of arc. It was the task of the chief pilot
to hold the screened image of the cross-hairs of the two directors in
such position relative to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the
"mighty vessel precisely upon its course, in spite of the complex system"
of forces acting upon it.
"For almost an hour Breckenridge sat motionless, his eyes flashing from"
"micrometer screen to signal panel, his sensitive fingers moving the"
potentiometers through minute arcs because of what he saw upon the
"screen and in instantaneous response to the flashing, multi-colored"
"lights and tinkling signals of his board. Finally, far from earth, the"
"moon's attraction and other perturbing forces comparatively slight, the"
signals no longer sounded and the point of light ceased its irregular
"motion, becoming almost stationary. The chief pilot brought both"
"cross-hairs directly upon the brilliant point, which for some time they"
"had been approaching more and more nearly, adjusted the photo-cells"
"and amplifiers which would hold them immovably upon it, and at the"
"calculated second of time, cut out the starting power by means of"
another set of automatically timed relays. When only the regular driving
"power was left, and the acceleration had been checked and found to be"
"exactly the designated value of 981.286 centimeters, he stood up and"
heaved a profound sigh of relief.
"""Well, Steve, that's over with--we're on our way. I'm always glad when"

"What had he ever been taught of theology, the Divine word to man? In"
"his school-days, if his father was an income tax payer he probably had"
"a weekly lesson in “Divinity,” when he construed a few verses of the"
"Gospels in the Greek Testament, and showed up to his master, now and"
"then, a map of the journeying of the Apostle Paul in Asia Minor and"
"Eastern Europe. If his father expected him to be confirmed, in due"
"course, some lessons in the catechism were added for his benefit, but"
prudent pedagogues took care not to endanger the popularity of a
"school, whether public or private, by any definite teaching which"
might be accused of being dogmatic. The head-master was probably a
"person of unsuspected orthodoxy, with a possible deanery or bishopric"
in view for his days of superannuation. His sermons in chapel used to
"set a fine standard of conduct before the boys, and were gracefully"
free from all mention of controversial questions. In due course they
"were published with the title _Sermons at Yarrow_, and enterprising"
parents turning over their pages would find little to criticize and
"much to admire. The Cross, if presented at all in these publications,"
was so bespangled with rhetorical jewellery that “Jews might kiss and
Infidels adore.” And the children of Israel as public-school boys were
never painfully conscious of any great difference between themselves
and their baptized companions. But unfortunately only a few of the
boys came under the civilizing instruction of the Chief. Bright young
"athletes from Oxford and Cambridge, lured into the ranks of pedagogy"
"by their love of football and cricket, were the assistant-masters. A"
"regular salary with holiday for a fourth of the year, the prospect of"
"early marriage, and a remunerative boarding-house, attracted them to a"
"pleasant position, and they had no wish to rebel against the"
time-table which made them teachers of “Divinity” for at least one
hour in the week. All educated people should be tolerably familiar
"with a book so largely used in quotation as the Bible, and the"
succession of the Kings of Israel and Judah could be used in
case excited the contempt alike of the man[1480] to whom the flattery
"was paid and of all posterity--a contempt which teaches, hardly less"
clearly than the indignation excited a century earlier by the supposed
"profanation of the mysteries, in what reverence and high esteem the"
idea of marriage between men and gods was generally held.
"Even Lucian, in whom reverence was a less pronounced characteristic"
"than humour, condemns seriously enough a parody of the mysteries"
of Eleusis which occurred in his own day; and his account of it at
the same time shows once more that the marriage of men and gods was
"the very essence of the mysteries. The impostor Alexander, he says,"
instituted rites with carrying of torches (δᾳδουχία) and exposition
of the sacred ceremonies (ἱεροφαντία) lasting for three days. “On
"the first there was a proclamation, as at Athens, as follows: ‘If"
"any atheist, Christian, or Epicurean hath come to spy upon the holy"
"rites, let him begone, and let the faithful be initiated with heaven’s"
blessing.’ Then first of all there was an expulsion of intruders.
"Alexander himself led the way, crying ‘Out with Christians,’ and the"
whole multitude shouted in answer ‘Out with Epicureans.’ Then was
"enacted the story of Leto in child-bed and the birth of Apollo, and his"
marriage with Coronis and the birth of Asclepius; and on the second day
the manifestation of Glycon and the god’s birth[1481]. And on the third
day was the wedding of Podalirius and Alexander’s mother; this was
"called the Torch-day, for torches were burnt. And finally there was the"
"love of Selene and Alexander, and the birth of his daughter now married"
to Rutilianus[1482]. Our Endymion-Alexander was now torch-bearer and
exponent of the rites. And he lay as it were sleeping in the view of
"all, and there came down to him from the roof--as it were Selene from"
"heaven--a certain Rutilia, a very beautiful woman, the wife of one of"
"Caesar’s household-officers, who was really in love with Alexander"
"and was loved by him, and she kissed the rascal’s eyes and embraced"
"him in the view of all, and, if there had not been so many torches,"
class distinctions were by no means so coveted as in lands that had
"been thoroughly feudalized; and the Buonapartes, content with their"
civic dignities at Ajaccio and the attachment of their partisans on
"their country estates, seem rarely to have used the prefix which"
implied nobility. Their life was not unlike that of many an old
"Scottish laird, who, though possibly _bourgeois_ in origin, yet by"
"courtesy ranked as chieftain among his tenants, and was ennobled by"
"the parlance of the countryside, perhaps all the more readily because"
he refused to wear the honours that came from over the Border.
But a new influence was now to call forth all the powers of this tough
stock. In the middle of the eighteenth century we find the head of the
"family, Charles Marie Buonaparte, aglow with the flame of Corsican"
patriotism then being kindled by the noble career of Paoli. This
"gifted patriot, the champion of the islanders, first against the"
"Genoese and later against the French, desired to cement by education"
the framework of the Corsican Commonwealth and founded a university.
It was here that the father of the future French Emperor received a
"training in law, and a mental stimulus which was to lift his family"
above the level of the _caporali_ and attorneys with whom its lot had
"for centuries been cast. His ambition is seen in the endeavour,"
"successfully carried out by his uncle, Lucien, Archdeacon of Ajaccio,"
to obtain recognition of kinship with the Buonapartes of Tuscany who
had been ennobled by the Grand Duke. His patriotism is evinced in his
"ardent support of Paoli, by whose valour and energy the Genoese were"
finally driven from the island. Amidst these patriotic triumphs
"Charles confronted his destiny in the person of Letizia Ramolino, a"
"beautiful girl, descended from an honourable Florentine family which"
had for centuries been settled in Corsica. The wedding took place in
"1764, the bridegroom being then eighteen, and the bride fifteen years"
"of age. The union, if rashly undertaken in the midst of civil strifes,"
"was yet well assorted. Both parties to it were of patrician, if not"
these cases differing little in character from those of slight
"continuous hæmorrhage. In a third, the bleeding was definitely of a"
"secondary character, corresponding with one of the classes of secondary"
"hæmorrhage described in Chapter IV., and occurring on the eighth or"
tenth day from giving way of an imperfectly closed wounded vessel. In
either of the two latter classes the development of the hæmothorax often
"corresponded with a journey, or with allowing the patient to get up."
The general course of these effusions was towards spontaneous absorption
"and recovery. Coagulation of the blood took place early, the fluid serum"
"separated, and tended to undergo absorption with some rapidity, leaving"
"a small amount of coagulum at the base, which evidenced its presence for"
many weeks by a persistence of a certain degree of dulness on
"percussion. Early coagulation, I think, accounted for the usual absence"
of gravitation ecchymosis as a sign.
The course to recovery was sometimes broken by signs of slight pleuritic
"inflammation, which, as affecting the amount of effusion, will be spoken"
of under the heading of symptoms. In some cases the amount of blood was
so great as to necessitate means being taken for its removal; in these a
reaccumulation often took place. Occasionally an empyema followed in
cases thus treated.
The nature of the blood evacuated on tapping varied much. In very early
"aspirations unchanged blood was often met with, but clot sometimes made"
evacuation difficult and necessitated a second puncture. In the tappings
"done at the end of a week or more a dark porter-like fluid was common,"
while when suppuration was imminent a brick-red-coloured grumous fluid
replaced normal blood. In the cases where early incision was resorted
"to, blood both fluid and in clots was often mixed with a certain"
"proportion of lymph flakes, perhaps indicating the part taken by"
inflammatory reaction to the irritation of the clot in producing the
"concerning dreams of flying, he comes to the conclusion that 'the"
sensation of aerial flight in dreams is simply a hallucinatory phenomenon
"of an exclusively physiological [he means 'psychological'] kind,' and"
"not evidence of the existence of the 'astral body.'[106] The fact,"
"nevertheless, that so many people are found who believe such dreams to"
"possess some kind of reality, clearly indicates the powerful impression"
they make.
"All my life, it seems to me, certainly from an early age, until recently,"
I have at intervals had dreams in which I imagined myself rhythmically
"bounding into the air, and supported on the air, remaining there for"
a perceptible interval; at other times I have felt myself gliding
"downstairs, but not supported by the stairs. In my case the experience"
"is nearly always agreeable, involving a certain sense of power, and it"
"usually evokes no marked surprise, occurring as a familiar and accustomed"
"pleasure. On awaking I do not usually remember these dreams immediately,"
which seems to indicate that they are not due to causes specially
"operative at the end of sleep, or liable to bring sleep to a conclusion."
But they leave behind them a vague yet profound sense of belief in their
reality and reasonableness.
"Dream-flight, it is necessary to note, is not usually the sustained flight"
"of a bird or an insect, and the dreamer rarely or never imagines that he"
is borne high into the air. Hutchinson states that of all those whom he
has asked about the matter 'hardly one has ever known himself to make any
"high flights in his dreams. One almost always flies low, with a skimming"
"manner, slightly, but only slightly, above the heads of pedestrians.'[107]"
"Beaunis, from his own experience, describes what I should consider a"
"typical kind of dream-flight as a series of light bounds, at one or two"
"yards above the earth, each bound clearing from ten to twenty yards,"
"the dream being accompanied by a delicious sensation of easy movement,"
We shall now take up the difficult question of the influence of Judaism
upon the mysteries during the Alexandrian period and at the beginning of
the empire. Many scholars have endeavored to define the influence exercised
by the pagan beliefs on those of the Jews; it has been shown how the
Israelitic monotheism became Hellenized at Alexandria and how the Jewish
"propaganda attracted proselytes who revered the one God, without, however,"
observing all the prescriptions of the Mosaic law. But no successful
researches have been made to ascertain how far paganism was modified
through an infiltration of Biblical ideas. Such a modification must
necessarily have taken place to some extent. A great number of Jewish
"colonies were scattered everywhere on the Mediterranean, and these were"
long animated with such an ardent spirit of proselytism that they were
bound to impose some of their conceptions on the pagans that surrounded
them. The magical texts which are almost the only original literary
"documents of paganism we possess, clearly reveal this mixture of Israelitic"
theology with that of other peoples. In them we frequently find names like
"Iao (Yahveh), Sabaoth, or the names of angels side by side with those of"
"Egyptian or Greek divinities. Especially in Asia {64} Minor, where the"
"Israelites formed a considerable and influential element of the population,"
an intermingling of the old native traditions and the religion of the
strangers from the other side of the Taurus must have occurred.
"This mixture certainly took place in the mysteries of Sabazius, the"
"Phrygian Jupiter or Dionysus.[31] They were very similar to those of Attis,"
with whom he was frequently confounded. By means of an audacious etymology
"that dates back to the Hellenistic period, this old Thraco-Phrygian"
"divinity has been identified with ""Yahveh Zebaoth,"" the Biblical ""Lord of"
"Hosts."" The corresponding expression ([Greek: kurios Sabaôth]) in the"
Septuagint has been regarded as the equivalent of the _kurios Sabazios_
([Greek: kurios Sabazios]) of the barbarians. The latter was worshiped as
"the supreme, almighty and holy Lord. In the light of a new interpretation"
the purifications practised in the mysteries were believed to wipe out the
law gives the succession of the formations in local areas. The
fossils which they contain demonstrate the law of the progressive
"appearance of organisms, and by means of this law the formations"
of different countries are correlated and set each in its place in
a universal time scale and grouped together according to the
affinities of their imbedded organic remains.
GEOLOGIC TIME DIVISIONS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HUMAN HISTORY. We
"may compare the division of geologic time into eras, periods, and"
"other divisions according to the dominant life of the time, to the"
ill-defined ages into which human history is divided according to
"the dominance of some nation, ruler, or other characteristic"
"feature. Thus we speak of the DARK AGES, the AGE OF ELIZABETH, and"
the AGE OF ELECTRICITY. These crude divisions would be of much
"value if, as in the case of geologic time, we had no exact"
reckoning of human history by years.
And as the course of human history has flowed in an unbroken
stream along quiet reaches of slow change and through periods of
"rapid change and revolution, so with the course of geologic"
"history. Periods of quiescence, in which revolutionary forces are"
"perhaps gathering head, alternate with periods of comparatively"
"rapid change in physical geography and in organisms, when new and"
higher forms appear which serve to draw the boundary line of new
"epochs. Nevertheless, geological history is a continuous progress;"
its periods and epochs shade into one another by imperceptible
"gradations, and all our subdivisions must needs be vague and more"
or less arbitrary.
HOW FOSSILS TELL OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PAST. Fossils are used
"not only as a record of the development of life upon the earth,"
but also in testimony to the physical geography of past epochs.

in view.
"[7] The late Sir John Skelton, K.C.B."
"After his marriage in 1837, Ferrier devoted his attention almost"
entirely to the philosophy he loved so well. He did not succeed--did
"not perhaps try to succeed--at the Bar, to which he had been called."
Many qualities are required by a successful advocate besides the subtle
mind and acute reasoning powers which Ferrier undoubtedly possessed:
possibly--we might almost say probably--these could have been
"cultivated had he made the effort. He had, to begin with, a fair junior"
"counsel's practice, owing to his family connections, and this might"
"have been easily developed; his ambition, however, did not soar in the"
"direction of the law courts, and he did not give that whole-hearted"
devotion to the subject which is requisite if success is to follow the
efforts of the novice. But if he was not attracted by the work at the
"Parliament House, he was attracted elsewhere; and to his first"
"mistress, Philosophy, none could be more faithful. In other lines, it"
"is true, he read much and deeply: literature in its widest sense"
"attracted him as it would attract any educated man. Poetry, above all,"
"he loved, in spite of the tale sometimes told against him, that he"
gravely proposed turning _In Memoriam_ into prose in order to ascertain
logically 'whether its merits were sustained by reason as well as by
rhyme'--a proposition which is said greatly to have entertained its
"author, when related to him by a mutual friend. Works of imagination he"
delighted in--all spheres of literature appealed to him; he had the
sense of form which is denied to many of his craft; he wrote in a style
"at once brilliant and clear, and carelessness on this score in some of"
"the writings of his countrymen irritated him, as those sensitive to"
such things are irritated. He has often been spoken of as a living
"protest against the materialism of the age, working away in the quiet,"
"regarded it all as a part of the experience in life which he craved, and"
"he might have become in a short while just such another as these, had it"
not been for an incident which suddenly arrested him in his career of
"dissipation, and turned his thoughts into different channels."
"It had been early June when he came to town, and now July had come, with"
"its sultry suns and breathless nights, when Grey ofttimes felt after an"
"evening over cards that it was mockery to go to bed, and lounged away"
"the residue of the night at his open window, enjoying the only coolness"
"and freshness that was to be had, as the wind came whispering from the"
river charged with refreshing moisture.
Sometimes the river seemed to call him; and at such times he would lay
"aside his finery, clothe himself in some plainer habit, and betake"
"himself through the silent house, where the night watchman was always"
"found slumbering at his post, out through the big courts and down to the"
"river steps, where a few light wherries were always kept moored, one of"
"which he would select, and shoot out upon the glimmering river to meet"
the new day there.
Some of his happiest hours were spent thus; and at such times as these
he felt rising within him a vague sense of unrest and of disgust.  He
"had come to the world of London to conquer fate, to make for himself a"
name and a career; and here he was wasting day after day in
"coffee-houses or clubs, with a crowd of idlers whose thoughts never rose"
"above the fancy of the hour, whose only ambition was to kill time as"
"easily and pleasantly as possible, and to line their pockets with gold,"
that they might have more to throw away on the morrow.
Was this what he would come to?  Was this what he was made for?  Would
"he become like unto them, a mere roisterer and boon companion, a man"
without aspirations and without ambition?  His cheeks burned at the
The Oriental civilizations on the contrary were sacerdotal in character. As
"in medieval Europe, the scholars of Asia and Egypt were priests. In the"
temples the nature of the gods and of man were not the only subjects of
"discussion; mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philology and history were"
"also studied. The successors of Berosus, a priest from Babylonia, and {32}"
"Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, were considered deeply versed in all"
intellectual disciplines as late as the time of Strabo.[13]
This state of affairs proved detrimental to the progress of science.
Researches were conducted according to preconceived ideas and were
perverted through strange prejudices. Astrology and magic were the
monstrous fruit of a hybrid union. But all this certainly gave religion a
power it had never possessed either in Greece or Rome.
"All results of observation, all conquests of thought, were used by an"
"erudite clergy to attain the principal object of their activities, the"
"solution of the problem of the destiny of man and matter, and of the"
relations of heaven and earth. An ever enlarging conception of the universe
kept transforming the modes of belief. Faith presumed to enslave both
physics and metaphysics. The credit of every discovery was given to the
gods. Thoth in Egypt and Bel in Chaldea were the revealers not only of
"theology and the ritual, but of all human knowledge.[14] The names of the"
Oriental Hipparchi and Euclids who solved the first problems of astronomy
and geometry were unknown; but a confused and grotesque literature made use
of the name and authority of Hermes Trismegistus. The doctrines of the
planetary spheres and the opposition of the four elements were made to
support systems of anthropology and of morality; the theorems of astronomy
were used to establish an alleged method of divination; formulas of
"incantation, supposed to subject divine powers to the magician, were"
combined with chemical experiments and medical prescriptions.
"canoe, but makes all the strokes on one side, a thing that looks very"
"easy, but is in fact extremely difficult. The dexterity of these men"
with their long single oar is wonderful. They glide in and out among
"scores of gondolas on the crowded canals without collision or jerking,"
and they turn a corner within an inch.
[Sidenote: Baggage Smashing in Europe.]
"These remarks upon the skill of the gondoliers, and the ease and safety"
"of the gondolas, remind me, by contrast, of the destructive bungling"
"of a porter in Cologne, who undertook to cart a load of trunks and"
"handbags and shawl-straps down from our hotel to the Rhine steamer, and"
"who, in turning a corner on a down grade, made the turn too short, and"
hurled the whole lot of our belongings into the muddy street with such
"violence that many of them were defaced, some permanently damaged, and"
one valise broken to pieces and utterly ruined.
That German baby carriage had an exciting adventure also on the night
"of our arrival in Rome. As usual, it was made the apex of the pyramid"
"of trunks and grip-sacks which constitute our sign manual, so to"
"speak, on the top of every omnibus that takes us from the station to"
"the hotel; but in this instance it was carelessly left untied, so"
"that as we went steeply down one of the seven hills of Rome, the cart"
"tumbled from its high perch to the stone-paved street, snapping off one"
"of the handles, and suffering sundry other shattering experiences. A"
few days after we had the pleasure of paying a fraudulent cabinetmaker
more for repairing it than it cost in the first instance. The Italian
workmen and shopkeepers uniformly charge you more than their work and
goods are worth. I think I have had more counterfeit money passed on me
in the short time I have been in Italy than I have had in all the rest
"of my life before, and the very first swindle of this kind to which I"
"was subjected was in a church, when the sacristan gave me a counterfeit"
"They irritate the nose when inhaled, but reflexly they stimulate the"
"circulation and respiration, they are good stimulants as they do not"
affect the brain. The aromatic spirits of ammonia is also a carminative.
"Externally they are rubefacients, and when confined are vesicants."
USES.--Its antacid and stimulant properties recommend ammonia in
"indigestion, tympanites, and spasmodic colic, especially in cattle and"
"sheep. Stimulating the spinals and respiratory systems, it is valuable"
"in the treatment of influenza, pneumonia, pleurisy and similar"
complaints. The fumes of ammonia are occasionally used to arouse animals
"from shocks, collapse, or chloroform intoxication, but must be used"
"cautiously, lest excessive irritation of the respiratory mucous membrane"
"be produced. It is a promptly acting antidote in poisoning by opium,"
"aconite, digitalis, and ether narcotic and sedative drugs. It may be"
"administered much diluted in the usual way, injected subcutaneously and"
"intravenously, and also applied externally, in the treatment of"
"snake-bites. On account of its producing bronchial secretion, and"
"assisting in its expulsion, ammonia is serviceable as a stimulating"
expectorant. To develop its more general effects its alcoholic
proportions should be prescribed as spirit of ammonia or the aromatic
"spirit of ammonia. Externally used in the form of liniment of ammonia,"
"with oils, camphor, etc., proves useful as a stimulant in rheumatism,"
"stiff-joints, muscular strains, sore throat, pleurisy, pneumonia and"
"influenza, and for preventing the rapid chilling of fomented surfaces."
"It relieves the irritation caused by nettles, and by bites and stings of"
insects.
LINIMENTUM AMMONIAE--AMMONIA LINIMENT
"Is made by mixing ammonia water, 350; cottonseed oil, 570; alcohol, 50;"
"oleic acid, 30. The above is recognized by the U. S. P. and is"
excision of a rib for draining a hæmothorax. These operations in the
early part of the campaign were more freely undertaken on the
supposition that rise of temperature and other symptoms of fever pointed
to incipient breaking down of the clot. Subsequent experience showed
"this not to be the case, and early operations for drainage ceased to be"
undertaken. In these operations a primary difficulty was met with in
"effectively clearing out the clot, a drain had to be left, and"
suppuration occurred later in a considerable proportion. The
"suppurations were most troublesome; local adhesions formed, and the pus"
"collected in small pockets, which were difficult to find and to drain,"
and even when the collections seemed to have been successfully dealt
"with at the time, residual abscesses often followed at a very late date."
"Thus, I saw a case with a contracted chest and a fresh abscess the day"
"before I left Cape Town, in whom I had advised and witnessed an"
operation for the evacuation of clot in the presence of signs of fever a
"week after my arrival in the country, nine months previously. I saw"
"another case where general infection followed incision of a hæmothorax,"
but the patient fortunately recovered.
The question of _pleurisy_ has already been mentioned in connection with
"hæmothorax; it no doubt accounted for secondary effusion in some cases,"
and beyond this I have nothing to add to what has been there said.
"_Pneumonia_ was rare; there were occasionally signs of consolidation,"
"but, I think, quite as often in the opposite lung as in the one injured."
"I never saw a fatal case, and I am inclined to think that when it"
occurred it was as often the result of cold and exposure as of the
"injury to the lung. Abscess of the lung I only saw once, and that in a"
case in which the injury to the chest was complicated by paraplegia from
"spinal injury and septicæmia, and it was possibly pyæmic."
_Diagnosis._--No difficulties special to small-calibre wounds were
are among the main purposes of the Institute I am opening to-day; in
these fields I am already fortunate in having a devoted band of
"disciples, whom I have been training for the last ten years. Their"
"number is very limited, but means may perhaps be forthcoming in the"
future to increase them. An enlarging field of young ability may thus be
"available, from which will emerge, with time and labour, individual"
"originality of research, productive invention and some day even creative"
genius.
But high success is not to be obtained without corresponding
"experimental exactitude, and this is needed to-day more than ever, and"
to-morrow yet more again. Hence the long battery of supersensitive
"instruments and apparatus, designed here, which stand before in their"
cases in our entrance hall. They will tell you of the protracted
struggle to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that
remained unseen;--of the continuous toil and persistence and of
ingenuity called forth for overcoming human limitations. In these
directions through the ever-increasing ingenuity of device for advancing
"science, I see at no distant future an advance of skill and of invention"
"among our workers; and if this skill be assured, practical applications"
will not fail to follow in many fields of human activity.
The advance of science is the principal object of this Institute and
also the diffusion of knowledge. We are here in the largest of all the
many chambers of this House of Knowledge--its Lecture Room. In adding
"this feature, and on a scale hitherto unprecedented in a Research"
"Institute, I have sought permanently to associate the advancement of"
knowledge with the widest possible civic and public diffusion of it; and
"this without any academic limitations, henceforth to all races and"
"languages, to both men and women alike, and for all time coming."
The lectures given here will not be mere repetitions of second-hand
"awkwardly upon classical imitation and, by assiduous study tempered by a"
"wise criticism, achieved success."
Only two plays with any claim to the designation of tragedies have
"survived to us from the Interludes, neither of them of much interest."
"_Cambyses_ (1561), by Thomas Preston, has all the qualities of an"
"imperfect Interlude. There are the base fellows and the clowns, Huff,"
"Ruff, Snuff, Hob and Lob; the abstractions, Diligence, Shame, Common's"
"Complaint, Small Hability, and the like; the Vice, Ambidexter, who"
"enters 'with an old capcase on his head, an old pail about his hips for"
"harness, a scummer and a potlid by his side, and a rake on his"
shoulder'; and the same scuffling and horseplay when the comic element
is uppermost. Incident follows incident as rapidly and with as trifling
"motives as before. In the course of a short play we see Cambyses, king"
"of Persia, set off for his conquests in Egypt; return; execute"
"Sisamnes, his unjust deputy; prove a far worse ruler himself; shoot"
"through the heart the young son of Praxaspes, to prove to that too-frank"
counsellor that he is not as drunk as was supposed; murder his own
"brother, Smirdis, on the lying report of Ambidexter; marry, contrary to"
"the law of the Church and her own wish, a lovely lady, his cousin, and"
then have her executed for reproaching him with the death of his
"brother; and finally die, accidentally pierced by his own sword when"
"mounting a horse. All these horrors, except the death of the lady, take"
"place on the stage. Thus we have such stage-directions as, 'Smite him in"
"the neck with a sword to signify his death', 'Flay him with a false"
"skin', 'A little bladder of vinegar pricked', 'Enter the King without a"
"gown, a sword thrust up into his side, bleeding.' Of real tragedy there"
"is little, the hustle of crime upon crime obliterating the impression"
which any one singly might produce. Yet even in this crude orgy of
bloodshed the melancholy voice of unaffected pathos can be heard
mourning the loss of dear ones. It speaks in the farewells of Sisamnes
"and his son Otian, and of Praxaspes (the honest minister) and his little"
speedily depressed by their evaporation; endowed with enough of
learning and culture to be a Voltairean and write second-rate
verses; and with a talent for intrigue which sufficed to embarrass
his never very affluent fortunes. Napoleon certainly derived no
world-compelling qualities from his father: for these he was indebted
to the wilder strain which ran in his mother's blood. The father
doubtless saw in the French connection a chance of worldly advancement
and of liberation from pecuniary difficulties; for the new rulers now
sought to gain over the patrician families of the island. Many of them
had resented the dictatorship of Paoli; and they now gladly accepted
"the connection with France, which promised to enrich their country and"
"to open up a brilliant career in the French army, where commissions"
were limited to the scions of nobility.
"Much may be said in excuse of Charles Buonaparte's decision, and no"
one can deny that Corsica has ultimately gained much by her connection
with France. But his change of front was open to the charge that it
was prompted by self-interest rather than by philosophic foresight. At
"any rate, his second son throughout his boyhood nursed a deep"
resentment against his father for his desertion of the patriots'
"cause. The youth's sympathies were with the peasants, whose allegiance"
"was not to be bought by baubles, whose constancy and bravery long held"
out against the French in a hopeless guerilla warfare. His hot
Corsican blood boiled at the stories of oppression and insult which he
"heard from his humbler compatriots. When, at eleven years of age, he"
"saw in the military college at Brienne the portrait of Choiseul, the"
"French Minister who had urged on the conquest of Corsica, his passion"
"burst forth in a torrent of imprecations against the traitor; and,"
"even after the death of his father in 1785, he exclaimed that he could"
never forgive him for not following Paoli into exile.
"What trifles seem, at times, to alter the current of human affairs!"
children; we step into the land of fiction. It has always been a source
"of astonishment to me that, in trying to escape from our own every-day"
"surroundings, we do not step more boldly into the land of pure romance,"
"which would form a real contrast to our every-day life, but in nine"
cases out of ten the fiction which is sought after deals with the
"subjects of our ordinary existence--namely, frenzied finance, sordid"
"poverty, political corruption, fast society, and religious doubts."
There is the same danger in the selection of fiction for children:
"namely, a tendency to choose very utilitarian stories, both in form and"
"substance, so that we do not lift the children out of the commonplace."
"I remember once seeing the titles of two little books, the contents of"
which were being read or told to small children of the poorer class:
"one was called “Tom the Boot-black,” the other, “Dan the News-boy.”"
My chief objection to these stories was the fact that neither of
the heroes rejoiced in their work for the work's sake. Had Tom even
"invented a new kind of blacking, or if Dan had started a splendid"
"newspaper, it might have been encouraging for those among the listeners"
"who were thinking of engaging in similar professions. It is true, both"
"gentlemen amassed large fortunes, but surely the school age is not to"
be limited to such dreams and aspirations as these! One wearies of the
"tales of boys who arrive in a town with one cent in their pockets, and"
"leave it as millionaires, with the added importance of a Mayoralty, not"
to speak of a Knighthood. It is true that the romantic prototype of
"these boys is Dick Whittington, for whom we unconsciously cherish the"
affection which we often bestow on a far-off personage. Perhaps--who
knows?--it is the picturesque adjunct of the cat--lacking to modern
millionaires.[38]
I do not think it Utopian to present to children a fair share of
stories which deal with the importance of things “untouched by hand.”
They too can learn at an early age that “the things which are seen are
"personal motives rather than religious zeal.""[691] ""The glebes and"
"hospital lands were a fresh power in the hands of the crown, and the"
subservient Lutheran clergy became the most powerful class in the
island; while the bad system of underleasing at rack-rent and short
lease with unsecured tenant-right extended in this way over at least a
"quarter of the better land, stopping any possible progress."" For the"
"rest, ""the Reformation had produced a real poet [Hallgrim Petersen], but"
"the material rise of Iceland""--that is, the recent improvements in the"
"condition of the people--""has not yet done so,""[692] though poetry is"
still cultivated in Iceland very much as music is elsewhere.
Thus this one little community may be said to have reached the limits of
"its evolution, as compared with others, simply because of the strait"
natural conditions in which its lot was cast. But to think of it as a
tragically moribund organism is merely to proceed upon the old
hallucinations of race-consciousness. Men reared in Iceland have done
"their part in making European civilisation, entering the more southerly"
Scandinavian stocks as these entered the stocks of western Europe; and
"the present population, who are a remnant, have no more cause to hang"
their heads than any family that happens to have few members or to have
missed wealth. Failure is relative only to pretension or purpose.
"The modern revival of Scandinavian culture, as must needs be, is the"
outcome of all the European influences. At the close of the sixteenth
"century, in more or less friendly intercourse with the other Protestant"
"countries of north Europe, Denmark began effectively to develop a"
"literature such as theirs, imaginative and scientific, in the vernacular"
as well as in Latin; and so the development went on while Sweden was
gaining military glory with little enlightenment. Then a rash attack
upon Sweden ended in a loss of some of the richest Danish provinces
"(1658); whereafter a sudden parliamentary revolution, wrought by a"
"league of king and people against the aristocracy, created not a"
means of a dramatic story we can counteract some of the sights and
sounds of the streets which appeal to the melodramatic instinct in
children. I am sure that all teachers whose work lies in the crowded
cities must have realised the effect produced on children by what they
see and hear on their way to and from school. If we merely consider
"the hoardings, with their realistic representations, quite apart from"
"the actual dramatic happenings in the street, we at once perceive"
that the ordinary school interests pale before such lurid appeals as
these. How can we expect the child who has stood open-mouthed before
"a poster representing a woman chloroformed by a burglar, whilst that"
"hero escapes in safety with her jewels, to display any interest in the"
arid monotony of the multiplication-table? The illegitimate excitement
created by the sight of the depraved burglar can only be counteracted
by something equally exciting along the realistic but legitimate side;
"and this is where the story of the right kind becomes so valuable, and"
why the teacher who is artistic enough to undertake the task can find
the short path to results which theorists seek for so long in vain. It
is not even necessary to have an exceedingly exciting story; sometimes
one which will bring about pure reaction may be just as suitable.
I remember in my personal experience an instance of this kind. I had
been reading with some children of about ten years old the story from
"Cymbeline, of Imogen in the forest scene, when the brothers strew"
"flowers upon her, and sing the funeral dirge,"
“Fear no more the heat of the sun.”
"Just as we had all taken on this tender, gentle mood, the door opened"
and one of the prefects announced in a loud voice the news of the
"relief of Mafeking. The children were on their feet at once, cheering"
"lustily, and for the moment the joy over the relief of the brave"
"garrison was the predominant feeling. Then, before the Jingo spirit"
"'If Ferrier's life should be written hereafter,' said one, who knew and"
"valued him, just after his death,[7] 'let his biographer take for its"
motto these five words from the _Faery Queen_ which the biographer of
"the Napiers has so happily chosen.' Ferrier's life was not, what it"
"perhaps seems, looking back on its comparatively uneventful course,"
"consistently calm and placid,--a life such as is commonly supposed to"
"befit those who soar into lofty speculative heights, and find the"
'difficult air' in which they dwell suited to their contemplative
temperaments. Ferrier was intrepid and daring in his reasoning; a sort
"of free lance, Dr. Skelton says he was considered in orthodox"
"philosophical circles; a High Tory in politics, yet one who did not"
"hesitate to probe to the bottom the questions which came before him,"
even though the task meant changing the whole attitude of mind from
"which he started. And once sure of his point, Ferrier never hesitated"
openly to declare it. What he hated most of all was 'laborious dulness
and consecrated feebleness'; commonplace orthodoxy was repugnant to him
"in the extreme, and possibly few things gave him more sincere pleasure"
than violently to combat it. The fighting instinct is proper to most
"men who have 'stuff' in them, and Ferrier in spite of his slight and"
"delicately made frame was manly to the core. But, as the same writer"
"says, 'though combative over his books and theories, his nature was"
"singularly pure, affectionate, and tolerant. He loved his friends even"
"better than he hated his foes. His prejudices were invincible; but,"
"apart from his prejudices, his mind was open and receptive--prepared to"
"welcome truth from whatever quarter it came.' Such a keen, eager nature"
"was sure to be in the fray if battle had to be fought, and we think"
none the worse of him for that. Battles of intellect are not less keen
"than battles of physical strength, and much more daring and subtlety"
"may be called into play in the fighting of them; and Ferrier, refined,"
"sensitive, fastidious, as he was, had his battles to fight, and fought"
receive them.
We are all acquainted with this talk in speculative regions of
"knowledge, but we most of us also know how disastrous it is to any true"
advancement in such directions. What happens now is just what happened
in the eighteenth century. Men relapse into a self-satisfied indolence
of mind: in religion they are content with believing in a sort of
"general divine Beneficence which will somehow make matters straight,"
however crooked they may seem to be; and in philosophy they are guided
"by their instincts, which teach them that what they wish to believe is"
true.
"Now, all this is what Ferrier and the modern movement, largely"
"influenced by German modes of thought, wish to protest against with all"
"their might. The scepticism of Hume and Gibbon was logical, if utterly"
impossible as a working creed and necessarily ending in absurdity; but
this irrational kind of optimism was altogether repugnant to those who
demanded a reasonable explanation of themselves and of their place in
nature. The question had become summed up in one of superlative
"importance, namely, the distinction that existed between the natural"
and supernatural sides of our existence. The materialistic school had
"practically done away with the latter in its entirety, had said that"
"nature is capable of being explained by mechanical means, and that"
these must necessarily suffice for us. But the orthodox section adopted
"other lines; it accepted all the ordinarily received ideas of God,"
"immortality, and the like, but it maintained the existence of an"
"Absolute which can only be inferred, but not presented to the mind,"
"and, strangest of all, declared that the 'last and highest consecration"
"of all true religion must be an altar ""To the unknown and unknowable"
"God.""'[6] This so-called 'pious' philosophy declares that 'To think"
"that God is, as we can think Him to be, is blasphemy,' and 'A God"
understood would be no God at all.' The German philosophy saw that if
"a horde of alligators or crocodiles, as are seen in Crocodile Creek, one"
"of the affluents of the Bayano. This river, which empties into the Gulf"
"of Panama, is in its lower reaches a tide-water stream and perhaps"
because of the mingling of the salt and the fresh the water is densely
filled with the microscopic infusoria which at night blaze forth in
coldly phosphorescent gleams suggestive of the sparkling of a spray of
"diamonds. Put your hand into the stream, lift it and let the water"
trickle through your fingers. Every drop gleams and glistens as it falls
with a radiance comparable with nothing in nature unless it be the great
fire-flies of the tropics. Even diamonds have to pass through the hands
of the cutter before they will blaze with any such effulgence as the
trickling waters of this tropical stream. One who has passed a night
"upon it may well feel that he has lived with one of the world’s marvels,"
and can but wonder at the matter-of-fact manner in which the natives go
about their tasks unmoved by the contact with so much shining glory.

There is always controversy on the Isthmus over the question whether the
gigantic saurians of Crocodile Creek are in fact crocodiles or
alligators. Whether expert scientific opinion has ever been called upon
"to settle the problem I do not know, but I rather suspect that crocodile"
was determined upon because it gave to the name of Crocodile Creek in
which they are so plentifully found “apt alliteration’s artful aid” to
make it picturesque. Whatever the precise zoological classification
given to the huge lizards may be is likely to be relatively unimportant
"before long, because the greatest joy of every tourist is found in"
killing them. The fascination which slaughter possesses for men is
"always hard to understand, but just what gives the killing of alligators"
"its peculiar zest I could never understand. The beasts are slow, torpid"
"and do not afford a peculiarly difficult test of marksmanship, even"
though the vulnerable part of their bodies is small. They are timid and
The old attic was now so rich of hue and yet so stiffly chaste that
Noll almost rubbed his eyes to see if he were awake.
It was indeed a handsome room; and yet----
Some faint whisper of the how and the why these things had chanced
flashed through Noll’s consciousness. Here Julia had put the savings of
her hard-won earnings. A tidy mind frets at the ordered disorder of the
workshop. She was of a precise habit that has a ruthless distaste for
"chips. She had secretly consulted the old lady, who had grimly advised"
her to “let the man’s room be”; but he who takes to the council of war
"a decided intention is irked by opposition, and smiles away the wisdom"
of older heads as the mere caution of senility. And indeed there was
"something of the poetic intention behind her gentle obstinacy, as there"
was behind everything she did; for (and she knew it in her secret heart
to be not wholly without a little of such jealous venom as her gentle
blood could hold) she had been passionately set upon bringing into this
"man’s life a fresh influence, a fragrance that she was sure he had"
not known--she was aglow with the glamour of the love-mood to be the
all-in-all in the atmosphere of her lover’s day. And as the rich crave
"ever to be more rich, so she, queening it in her little parish, was"
blind to the simple fact that all the subtle and gracious tenderness of
her gentle womanhood had won her a larger empire over her lover than
"any she could hope to win by petty endeavour. The old lady, her wise"
old eyes seeing that the other had come to consult the oracle with the
"answer rather than the question, had nodded her willingness, after the"
"first demur, to comply with the younger woman’s whim. And the nod of"
"surrender once given, she had addressed herself, during their absence"
"on the honeymoon, to carrying out the young wife’s instructions to the"
"uttermost detail, even employing no small sum out of her own small"
income to the perfecting of it.
the priests to embrace in their collections all possible contingencies so
"as to be prepared for any question that might at any time arise, a large"
number of signs were entered which the diviners thought _might_ occur. In
"other words, in order to be on the safe side the diviners allowed their"
fancy free rein and registered many things that we can positively say
never did occur and never could occur[17]. With the help of hand-books on
"human and animal pathology, we can without difficulty distinguish between"
"two classes. Thus, twins being regarded as significant and triplets even"
"more so, the priests did not stop at this point but provided for cases"
"when four, five six up to eight and more infants were born at one"
"time[18]. Again in regard to animals, inasmuch as bitches and sows may"
"throw a litter of ten and even more, the priests in their collections"
"carried the number up to thirty[19] which is, of course, out of the"
"question. For sheep and goats the number was extended up to ten, though it"
probably never happened that more than triplets were ever born to an ewe
"or to a mother-goat. Even twins are rare, and I am told that there are few"
authenticated cases of triplets.
Malformations among infants and the young of animals were of course
"plentiful, but here too the anomalies and monstrosities are not as"
numerous and varied as were entered in the handbooks of the Babylonian and
Assyrian diviners. The factor of fancy to which I have referred enters
"even more largely in the entries of many actual malformations, through the"
assumption of a more or less fanciful resemblance of some feature or of
some part of an infant or of the young of an animal with the features or
parts of some animal.
An excess number of limbs--three legs or four arms in the case of an
"infant, or five or six legs in the case of a lamb, puppy, pig or foal, or"
two heads--is not uncommon. On this basis the priests entered cases of
excess legs and arms and heads up to nine and more[20]; and similarly in
regard to ears and eyes.
"almost reach the intensity of hallucination. Thus, after an indigestible"
"supper, I awake with the vivid feeling that some one is lying on me"
"and attempting to drag off the bedclothes, and I find myself violently"
"attempting, but apparently in vain, to articulate: 'Who is there?' In a"
"dream of similar type, which occurred when lying on my back (and possibly"
"with slight indigestion due to an unusually late dinner), I awoke making"
a kind of inarticulate exclamation which awakened my wife. I had dreamed
"that I was lying in bed, and that some unseen creature--more supernatural"
"than human, it seemed--was violently dragging the bedclothes off me, while"
"I shouted to it, very distinctly it seemed to me, 'Avaunt, avaunt!'"
"It is evident that my own sense of oppression, my own unconscious and"
"involuntary movements in disturbing the bedclothes, were reconstructed by"
"sleeping consciousness as the actions of an external person, in the second"
"case, a supernatural creature, which, it is interesting to note, I duly"
accepted as such and addressed in the conventionally appropriate manner
of old romance. The illusion may persist for some moments after waking. A
"lady, after breathing rather loudly and convulsively for a few seconds,"
"wakes up, saying 'There is a rat or a mouse on the bed, shaking it up"
"and down.' 'You were asleep,' her husband replied, 'as I knew by your"
"breathing.' 'Oh, I was breathing like that,' she said, 'to make it jump"
"off.' Here we see that, somewhat as in the previous cases, the dreamer's"
"own muscular activity is, during sleep, reconstructed into the image of an"
"external force; but when she is in the semi-waking hypnagogic stage, she"
"recognises that the activity was her own, though still unable to dismiss"
the delusion based on the theory formed during sleep.
"At this point we reach the threshold of hallucination, and the next"
"case to be brought forward may be said to lie on the threshold, for an"
impression received in the hypnagogic (or hypnopompic) stage is accepted
"in its illusional form, even when the dreamer is fully awake. A farmer's"
"daughter--a bright girl of twenty-one, with quick nervous reactions,"
"Gulf of Florida. Tiring of this, Vane stole a vessel and ranged up and"
"down the coast from Florida to New York, taking ship after ship, until at"
last the Governor of South Carolina sent out a Colonel Rhet in an armed
"sloop to try and take him. On one occasion Vane met the famous Blackbeard,"
whom he saluted with his great guns loaded with shot. This compliment of
"one pirate chief to another was returned in like kind, and then ""mutual"
"civilities"" followed for several days between the two pirate captains and"
"their crews, these civilities taking the form of a glorious debauch in a"
quiet creek on the coast.
"Vane soon had a change of fortune, when, meeting with a French man-of-war,"
"he decided to decline an engagement and to seek safety in flight, greatly"
to the anger of his crew. For this he was obliged to stand the test of the
"vote of the whole crew, who passed a resolution against his honour and"
"dignity, and branded him a coward, deprived him of his command, and packed"
"him off with a few of his adherents in a small sloop. Vane, not"
"discouraged by this reverse of fortune, rose again from the bottom rung of"
"the ladder to success, and quickly increased in strength of ships and"
"crew, until one day, being overcome by a sudden tornado, he lost"
"everything but his life, being washed up on a small uninhabited island off"
the Honduras coast. Here he managed to support life by begging food from
the fishermen who occasionally came there in their canoes.
"At last a ship put in for water, commanded by one Captain Holford, who"
happened to be an old friend of Vane's. Vane naturally was pleased at this
"piece of good fortune, and asked his dear old friend to take him off the"
"island in his ship, to which Holford replied: ""Charles, I shan't trust you"
"aboard my ship, unless I carry you as a prisoner, for I shall have you"
"caballing with my men, knock me on the head, and run away with my ship"
"a-pirating."" No promises of good behaviour from Vane would prevail on his"
"friend to rescue him; in fact, Captain Holford's parting remark was that"
"he would be returning in a month, and that if he then found Vane still on"
"out in such force that they were divided into a night and a day crew,"
"half of them being sent back to report later, while among the mountains"
of freight the work went forward faster than ever. But the night had
"served to point the anger of the strikers, and the dock owners,"
"becoming alarmed for the safety of their property, joined with Emerson"
"in establishing a force of a dozen able-bodied guards, armed with"
"clubs, to assist the police in disputing the shore line with the"
"rioters. The police themselves had proved ineffective, even betraying a"
"half-hearted sympathy with the union men, who were not slow to profit"
"by it. Even so, the day passed rather quietly, as did the next. But in"
time the agitation became so general as to paralyze a wide section of
"the water-front, and the city awoke to the realization that a serious"
"conflict was in progress. The handful of fishermen, hidden under the"
"roof of the great warehouse, outnumbered twenty to one, and guarded"
"only by a thin line of pickets, became a centre of general interest."
"As the violence of the mob, stimulated rather than checked by the"
"indifference of the police, became more openly daring, so likewise did"
"the reprisals of the fishermen, goaded now to a stubborn rage. They"
"would not hear to having their food brought to them, but insisted daily"
on emerging in a body at noon and spending the hour in combat. Not to
"speak of the physical disabilities they incurred in these affrays, the"
"excitement distracted them and affected their work disastrously, to the"
great concern of their employer.
It was on the fourth day that Boyd espied the man in the gray suit
"among the strikers and pointed him out to his three companions, Clyde"
and Fraser having joined him and George in a spirit of curiosity. Clyde
"was for immediately executing a sally to capture the fellow, explaining"
that once they had him inside the dock-house they could beat him until
"he confessed that Marsh was behind the strike, but his valor shrank"
amazingly when Fraser maliciously suggested that he himself lead the
"to write, and his first contribution to literature took the form of"
"certain papers contributed to _Blackwood's Magazine_, the subject being"
the 'Philosophy of Consciousness.' From that time onwards Ferrier
"continued to write on philosophic or literary topics until his death,"
and many of these writings were first published in the famous magazine.
"Before entering, however, on any consideration of Ferrier's writings"
"and of the philosophy of the day, it might be worth while to try to"
"picture to ourselves the social conditions and feelings of the time, in"
"order that we may get some idea of the influences which surrounded him,"
and be assisted in our efforts to understand his outlook.
In the beginning of the nineteenth century Scotland had been ground
"down by a strange tyranny--the tyranny of one man as it seemed, which"
"man was Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville, who for many long years"
ruled our country as few countries have been ruled before. What this
"despotism meant it is difficult for us, a century later, to figure to"
ourselves. All offices were dependent on his patronage; it was to him
"that everyone had to look for whatever post, advancement, or concession"
"was required. And Dundas, with consummate power and administrative"
"ability, moulded Scotland to his will, and by his own acts made her"
"what she was before the world. But all the while, though unperceived, a"
"new spirit was really dawning; the principles of the Revolution, in"
"spite of everything, had spread, and all unobserved the time-spirit"
made its influence felt below a surface of apparent calm. It laid hold
first of all of the common people--weavers and the like: it roused
"these rough, uneducated men to a sense of wrong and the resolution to"
"seek a remedy. Not much, however, was accomplished. Some futile risings"
took place--risings pitiable in their inadequacy--of hard-working
"weavers armed with pikes and antiquated muskets. Of course, such rebels"
were easily suppressed; the leaders were sentenced to execution or
"transportation, as the case might be; but though peace apparently was"
claims to have practised in order to obtain a favorable judgment from
"Osiris. If one considers the period in which it appears, this ethics is"
"undoubtedly very elevated, but it seems rudimentary and even childish if"
"one compares it with the principles formulated by the Roman jurists, to say"
nothing of the minute psychological analyses of the Stoic casuists. In this
"range of ideas also, the maintenance of the most striking contrasts"
"characterizes Egyptian mentality, which was never shocked by the cruelties"
and obscenities that sullied the mythology and the ritual. Like Epicurus at
"Athens, some of the sacred texts actually invited the believers to enjoy"
life before the sadness of death.[47]
Isis was not a very austere goddess at the time she entered Italy.
"Identified with Venus, as Harpocrates was with Eros, she was honored"
"especially by the women with whom love was a profession. In Alexandria, the"
"city of pleasure, she had lost all severity, and at Rome this good goddess"
remained very indulgent to human weaknesses. Juvenal harshly refers to {91}
"her as a procuress,[48] and her temples had a more than doubtful"
"reputation, for they were frequented by young men in quest of gallant"
adventures. Apuleius himself chose a lewd tale in which to display his
fervor as an initiate.
"But we have said that Egypt was full of contradictions, and when a more"
"exacting morality demanded that the gods should make man virtuous, the"
Alexandrian mysteries offered to satisfy that demand.
At all times the Egyptian ritual attributed considerable importance to
"purity, or, to use a more adequate term, to cleanliness. Before every"
"ceremony the officiating priest had to submit to ablutions, sometimes to"
"fumigations or anointing, and to abstain from certain foods and from"
incontinence for a certain time. Originally no moral idea was connected
with this purification. It was considered a means of exorcising malevolent
demons or of putting the priest into a state in which the sacrifice
the vestibule in the Argive Heraeum there was a couch (κλίνη) for
"Hera[1475], and he seems to speak of it as if it were a common enough"
"piece of temple furniture. So too at Phlya in Attica, where were held"
"the very ancient mystic rites ‘of her who is called the Great,’ there"
"was a bridal chamber (παστάς), where, it has rightly been argued, there"
‘must have been enacted a mimetic marriage[1476].’ Again Clement of
"Alexandria speaks of a παστός of Athena in the Parthenon, and makes"
it quite clear by the story which he relates that he understood the
word in the sense of bed-chamber. The story is also for other reasons
"worth recalling, because it shows how the religious conception of"
marriage between men and gods was readily extended to the worship of
"other deities than those whose mysteries we have sought to unravel,"
and at the same time furnishes the only case known to me in which
that mystic belief was prostituted to the base uses of flattery. The
occasion was the reception accorded by the Athenians to Demetrius
"Poliorcetes. Not content with hailing him as a god in name, they went"
"so far in their mean-spirited subjection as to set up a temple, at"
"the place where he dismounted from his horse on entering their city,"
"to Demetrius the Descender (Καταιβάτης)[1477], while on every side"
altars were erected to him. But their grossest piece of flattery was
"a master-piece of grotesque impiety, and met with a fitting reward. A"
marriage was arranged between him (the most notorious profligate of his
"age) and Athena. ‘He however,’ we are told, ‘disdained the goddess,"
"being unable to embrace the statue, but took with him to the Acropolis"
"the courtesan Lamia, and polluted the bed-chamber of Athena, exhibiting"
to the old virgin the postures of the young courtesan[1478].’ Even that
"contemptuous response to the Athenians’ flattery did not abash them,"
"but, finding that he did not favour their acknowledged deity, they"
"determined to deify his acknowledged favourite, and erected a temple to"
Lamia Aphrodite[1479].
But such travesties of holy things were rare; and this one notorious
"our faces towards Nuremberg, and in a greater degree after we reached"
"that city, we embarked on a wider current of adventure, a fuller and"
"less selfish life. If we had still our own cares and griefs, hopes and"
"perils--as must be the case, I suppose, until we die--we had other"
"common ones which we shared with tens of thousands, rich and poor,"
gentle and simple. We had to dread sack and storm; we prayed for
relief and safety in company with all who rose and lay down within the
walls. When a hundred waggons of corn slipped through the Croats and
"came in, or Duke Bernard of Weimar beat up a corner of the Burgstall"
"and gave Wallenstein a bad night, we ran out into the streets to tell"
"and hear the news. Similarly, when tidings came that Tzerclas with his"
"two thousand ruffians had burned the King of Sweden's colours, put on"
"green sashes, and marched into the enemy's camp, we were not alone in"
"our gloomy anticipations. We still had our private adventures, and I"
"am going to tell them. But besides these, it should be remembered that"
"we ran the risks, and rose every morning fresh to the fears, of"
"Nuremberg. When bread rose to ten, to fifteen, to twenty times its"
"normal price; when the city, where many died every day of famine,"
"plague, and wounds, began to groan and heave in its misery; when"
through all the country round the peasants crawled and died among the
"dead; when Wallenstein, that dark man, heedless of the fearful"
"mortality in his own camp, still sat implacable on the heights and"
"refused all the king's invitations to battle, we grew pale and gloomy,"
stern-eyed and thin-cheeked with the rest. We dreamed of Magdeburg as
they did; and as the hot August days passed slowly over the starving
"city and still no end appeared, but only with each day some addition"
"of misery, we felt our hearts sink in unison with theirs."
"And we had to share, not their lot only, but their labours. We had not"
"been in the town twenty-four hours before Steve, Jacob, and Ernst were"
"enrolled in the town militia; to me, either out of respect to my lady,"
"or on account of my stature, a commission as lieutenant was granted."
"The Genevan philosopher had asserted that Christianity, by enthroning"
"in the hearts of Christians the idea of a Kingdom not of this world,"
"broke the unity of civil society, because it detached the hearts of"
"its converts from the State, as from all earthly things. To this the"
Genevan minister had successfully replied by quoting Christian
teachings on the subject at issue. But Buonaparte fiercely accuses
"the pastor of neither having understood, nor even read, ""Le Contrat"
"Social"": he hurls at his opponent texts of Scripture which enjoin"
obedience to the laws: he accuses Christianity of rendering men slaves
"to an anti-social tyranny, because its priests set up an authority in"
"opposition to civil laws; and as for Protestantism, it propagated"
"discords between its followers, and thereby violated civic unity."
"Christianity, he argues, is a foe to civil government, for it aims at"
making men happy in this life by inspiring them with hope of a future
"life; while the aim of civil government is ""to lend assistance to the"
"feeble against the strong, and by this means to allow everyone to"
"enjoy a sweet tranquillity, the road of happiness."" He therefore"
concludes that Christianity and civil government are diametrically
opposed.
In this tirade we see the youth's spirit of revolt flinging him not
"only against French law, but against the religion which sanctions it."
He sees none of the beauty of the Gospels which Rousseau had
admitted. His views are more rigid than those of his teacher.
"Scarcely can he conceive of two influences, the spiritual and the"
"governmental, working on parallel lines, on different parts of man's"
"nature. His conception of human society is that of an indivisible,"
"indistinguishable whole, wherein materialism, tinged now and again by"
"religious sentiment and personal honour, is the sole noteworthy"
influence. He finds no worth in a religion which seeks to work from
"within to without, which aims at transforming character, and thus"
transforming the world. In its headlong quest of tangible results his
polished copper plate prepared with a film sensitive to the light. A
few minutes' exposure to the light renders insoluble in water those
"parts of the film which the light has reached through the negative, and"
"when the other parts of the film, which remain soluble in water, are"
"washed away, the picture appears clear on the surface of the plate. The"
dots and the stipples forming the picture are then further treated to
enable them to resist the action of the solution of iron perchloride to
"which the plate is next subjected, which etches out the spaces between"
"the dots, and leaves the latter in relief. As the etching on the"
"copper must be in reverse as regards right and left, in order that it"
"may appear in proper relation when printed on the paper, the negative"
"must be produced through a reflecting prism, or the finished negative,"
"properly toughened, must be stripped from the glass on which it has"
"been produced, and turned over. In ordinary practice, a number of such"
"turned negatives are placed together on a single large glass, and"
"exposed together on a large copper plate, to be cut apart afterwards"
and mounted separately. The primary etching is usually supplemented by
"further processes, such as re-etching, vignetting, hand-tooling and"
routing. The finished plate is finally mounted on a wooden block to the
height of type.
Illustrations in full color are reproduced from corresponding
"originals, usually paintings in oil or water-color, by means of the"
three-[40] or four-color[40] process of reproduction. The plates for
"this purpose are usually all halftone, but are sometimes a combination"
of halftones and Benday[40] plates. Two-color halftones have either
"a tint background, or secondary plate in tint, the latter forming"
the underground upon which the keyplate is printed in black. In the
"three-color process, the respective plates are printed in yellow, red"
and blue successively over one another. In the four-color process a
"fourth plate is used to emphasize the blacks of the picture, the plate"
"being virtually a keyplate, combining all the features of the subject,"
"you?’ and then turning to her ravisher, ‘What do you mean, sirrah, by"
"handling me so roughly, and dragging me down into the sea? I shall"
"go under and be drowned, miserable girl.’ And Poseidon answers, ‘Do"
"not be frightened, you shall come to no harm; no, I will strike the"
"rock here, near where the waves break, with my trident, and will let"
"a spring burst up which shall bear your name, and you yourself shall"
"be blessed and, unlike your sisters, shall not carry water when you"
are dead (καὶ σὺ εὐδαίμων ἔσῃ καὶ μόνη τῶν ἀδελφῶν οὐχ ὑδροφορήσεις
ἀποθανοῦσα)[1499].’ The whole point of Poseidon’s answer clearly
depends upon the existence of a well-known belief that the Danaids were
punished hereafter for remaining unmarried and that the punishment took
the form of vainly fetching water for that bridal bath which was a
necessary preliminary to a wedding; Amymone shall have a very thorough
"bridal bath, and the spring that bears her name shall be a monument"
"of it, while she herself shall be ‘blessed’ by wedlock with Poseidon;"
thus shall she escape the fate of the unmarried. Clearly then there was
no distinction between the uninitiated and the unmarried; both alike
were doomed vainly to fetch water for those ablutions which preceded
initiation into the mysteries or into matrimony; and once again the
conception of marriage as a mystic and sacramental rite akin to the
rites of Eleusis is clearly revealed.
It may further be noted here that this idea of the punishment of the
"unmarried completely explains the custom, on which I have already"
"touched, of erecting a water-pitcher (λουτροφόρος) over the grave of"
"unmarried persons. This intimated, according to Eustathius[1500], that"
the person there buried had never taken the bath which both bride and
bridegroom were wont to take before marriage. But this must not be
taken to mean that the water-pitcher was erected as a symbol of the
punishment which the dead person was supposed to be undergoing; this
"was not an idea which his relatives and friends, even if they had held"
"it, would have wished to blazon abroad. One might as soon expect to"
elaborate way in which the interpretation of dreams was dealt with is well
"seen in the treatise on this subject by Artemidorus of Daldi, a native"
"of Ephesus, and contemporary of Marcus Aurelius.[142] He divided dreams"
"into two classes: _theorematic_ dreams, which come literally true, and"
_allegorical_ dreams. The first group may be said to correspond to the
"modern groups of prophetic and proleptic or prodromic dreams, while the"
second group includes the symbolical dreams which have of recent years
"again attracted attention. Synesius, who lived in the fourth century,"
and eventually became a Christian bishop without altogether ceasing to
"be a Greek pagan, wrote a very notable treatise on dreaming, in which,"
"with a genuinely Greek alertness of mind, he contrived to rationalise and"
almost to modernise the ancient doctrine of dream symbolism. He admits
"that it is in their obscurity that the truth of dreams resides, and that"
we must not expect to find any general rules in regard to dreams; no two
"people are alike, so that the same dream cannot have the same significance"
"for every one, and we have to find out the rules of our own dreams. He"
"had himself (like Galen) often been aided in his writings by his dreams,"
"in this way getting his ideas into order, improving his style, and"
"receiving criticisms of extravagant phrases. Once, too, in the days when"
"he hunted, he invented a trap as a result of a dream. Synesius declares"
that attention to divination by dreams is good on moral grounds alone. For
he who makes his bed a Delphian tripod will be careful to live a pure and
noble life. In that way he will reach an end higher than that he aimed
at.[143]
"It seems to-day by no means improbable that, amid the absurdities of"
"this popular oneiromancy, there are some items of real significance."
"Until recent years, however, the absurdities have frightened away the"
scientific investigator. Almost the only investigator of the psychology
of dreaming who ventured to admit a real symbolism in the dream world was
"Scherner,[144] and his arguments were not usually accepted nor even easy"
to accept. When we are faced by the question of definite and constant
"world--the internal or the external world--which, except in so far as"
"it may seek to reproduce the actual sounds of the world, can only be"
expressive by its symbolism. And the symbolism of music is so pronounced
that it is even expressed in the elementary fact of musical pitch. Our
minds are so constructed that the bass always seems _deep_ to us and the
treble _high_. We feel it incongruous to speak of a _high_ bass voice or
a _deep_ soprano. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this and
"the like associations are fundamentally based, that there are, as an acute"
"French philosophic student of music, Dauriac (in an essay 'Des Images"
"Suggérées par l'Audition musicale'[132]), has expressed it, 'sensorial"
"correspondences,' as, indeed, Baudelaire had long since divined[133]; that"
the motor image is that which demands from the listener the minimum of
effort; and that music almost constantly evokes motor imagery.[134]
"The association between high notes and physical ascent, between low"
"notes and physical descent, is certainly in any case very fixed.[135]"
"In Wagner's _Lohengrin_, the ascent and descent of the angelic chorus"
"is thus indicated. Even if we go back to the early composers, the same"
correspondence is found. In Purcell it is very definite. In Bach--pure and
abstract as his music is generally considered--not only this elementary
"association, but an immense amount of motor imagery is to be found; Bach"
"shows, indeed, a curious pre-occupation in translating the definite sense"
of the words he is musically illustrating into corresponding musical
"terms; the skill and subtlety with which he accomplishes this, can often,"
"as Pirro and Schweitzer have shown, be appreciated only by musicians.[136]"
It is sometimes said that this is 'realism' in music. That is a mistake.
When the impressions derived from one sense are translated into those of
"another sense, there can be no question of realism. A composer may attempt"
"a realistic representation of thunder, but his representation of lightning"
can only be symbolical; audible lightning can never be realistic.
Not only is there an instinctive and direct association between sounds
"dictatorship, were to be borne, provided that social equality could be"
saved. As republican Rome had saved her early liberties by intrusting
"unlimited powers to a temporary dictator, so, claimed Rousseau, a"
young commonwealth must by a similar device consult Nature's first law
of self-preservation. The dictator saves liberty by temporarily
abrogating it: by momentary gagging of the legislative power he
renders it truly vocal.
The events of the French Revolution form a tragic commentary on these
theories. In the first stage of that great movement we see the
"followers of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau marching in an"
undivided host against the ramparts of privilege. The walls of the
Bastille fall down even at the blast of their trumpets. Odious feudal
privileges disappear in a single sitting of the National Assembly; and
"the _Parlements_, or supreme law courts of the provinces, are swept"
"away. The old provinces themselves are abolished, and at the beginning"
of 1790 France gains social and political unity by her new system of
"Departments, which grants full freedom of action in local affairs,"
though in all national concerns it binds France closely to the new
popular government at Paris. But discords soon begin to divide the
reformers: hatred of clerical privilege and the desire to fill the
empty coffers of the State dictate the first acts of spoliation.
Tithes are abolished: the lands of the Church are confiscated to the
service of the State; monastic orders are suppressed; and the
Government undertakes to pay the stipends of bishops and priests.
"Furthermore, their subjection to the State is definitely secured by"
"the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July, 1790) which invalidates"
their allegiance to the Pope. Most of the clergy refuse: these are
"termed non-jurors or orthodox priests, while their more complaisant"
colleagues are known as constitutional priests. Hence arises a serious
"schism in the Church, which distracts the religious life of the land,"
and separates the friends of liberty from the champions of the
symbols it still remains true that scepticism is often called for. But
there can be no manner of doubt that our dreams are full of symbolism.[145]
"The conditions of dream life, indeed, lend themselves with a peculiar"
"facility to the formation of symbolism, that is to say, of images"
"which, while evoked by a definite stimulus, are themselves of a totally"
"different order from that stimulus. The very fact that we _sleep_, that"
"is to say, that the avenues of sense which would normally supply the real"
"image of corresponding order to the stimulus are more or less closed,"
renders symbolism inevitable.[146] The direct channels being thus largely
"choked, other allied and parallel associations come into play, and since"
"the control of attention and apperception is diminished, such play is"
often unimpeded. Symbolism is the natural and inevitable result of these
conditions.[147]
It might still be asked why we do not in dreams more often recognise the
actual source of the stimuli applied to us. If a dreamer's feet are in
"contact with something hot, it might seem more natural that he should"
"think of the actual hot-water bottle, rather than of an imaginary Etna,"
"and that, if he hears a singing in his ears, he should argue the presence"
of the real bird he has often heard rather than a performance of Haydn's
"_Creation_, which he has never heard. Here, however, we have to remember"
"the tendency to magnification in dream imagery, a tendency which rests"
on the emotionality of dreams. Emotion is normally heightened in dreams.
Every impression reaches sleeping consciousness through this emotional
"atmosphere, in an enlarged form, vaguer it may be, but more massive. The"
sleeping brain is thus not dealing with actual impressions--if we are
justified in speaking of the impressions of waking life as 'actual'--even
"when actual impressions are being made upon it, but with transformed"
"impressions. The problem before it is to find an adequate cause, not for"
"the actual impression, but for the transformed and enlarged impression."
Under these circumstances symbolism is quite inevitable. Even when the
but untrained mind--dreamed that she saw her brother (dead some years
"previously) with blood streaming from his fingers. She awoke in a fright,"
and was comforting herself with the thought that it was only a dream when
she felt a hand grip her shoulder three times in succession. There was no
"one in the room, the door was locked, and no explanation seemed possible"
"to her. She was very frightened, got up at once, dressed, and spent"
the rest of the night downstairs working. She was so convinced that a
"real hand had touched her that, although it seemed impossible, she asked"
her brothers if they had not been playing a trick on her. The nervous
"shock was considerable, and she was unable to sleep well for some weeks"
"afterwards. She naturally knew nothing about abnormal psychic phenomena,"
"and was utterly puzzled to explain the experience, except by supposing"
that it may have been a ghost. The explanation is really very simple. It
is well recognised that involuntary muscular twitches may occur in the
"shoulder, especially after it has been subjected to pressure, and that in"
some cases such contractions may simulate a touch.[164] The dream of a
"bleeding hand indicates, when we bear in mind the tendency to objectify"
"sensations symbolically, now familiar to us in dreaming, that the"
dreamer's arm was probably pressed beneath her in a cramped position.[165]
"This pressure would account, not only for the dream, but for the muscular"
"twitches occurring on awakening. The nature of the dream, the terrified"
"emotional state it produced, and the mental obscurity of the hypnagogic"
"state, naturally combined, in a subject unaccustomed to self-analysis, to"
"create an illusion which reflection is unable to dispel, though in the"
normal waking state she would probably have given no attention at all
"to such muscular twitches. Strictly speaking, such an experience is an"
"illusion--that is to say, a misinterpretation of a real sensation--and"
not a hallucination--or perception without known objective causation--but
there is no clear line of demarcation. In any case it may now be taken as
"proved that hallucinations tend to occur in the neighbourhood of sleep,"
and therefore to partake of the nature of dreams.[166]
metallic ores have been dissolved; but at the base of the zone of
"solution we may find exceedingly rich deposits of copper ores,--"
"copper sulphides, red and black copper oxides, and green and blue"
"copper carbonates, which have clearly been brought down in"
solution from the leached upper portion of the vein.
ORIGIN OF MINERAL VEINS. Both vein stones and ores have been
"deposited slowly from solution in water, much as crystals of salt"
are deposited on the sides of a jar of saturated brine. In our
study of underground water we learned that it is everywhere
"circulating through the permeable rocks of the crust, descending"
to profound depths under the action of gravity and again driven to
"the surface by hydrostatic pressure. Now fissures, wherever they"
"occur, form the trunk channels of the underground circulation."
Water descends from the surface along these rifts; it moves
"laterally from either side to the fissure plane, just as ground"
water seeps through the surrounding rocks from every direction to
a well; and it ascends through these natural water ways as in an
"artesian well, whenever they intersect an aquifer in which water"
is under hydrostatic pressure.
"The waters which deposit vein stones and ores are commonly hot,"
and in many cases they have derived their heat from intrusions of
igneous rock still uncooled within the crust. The solvent power of
"the water is thus greatly increased, and it takes up into solution"
various substances from the igneous and sedimentary rocks which it
traverses. For various reasons these substances stances are
deposited in the vein as ores and vein stones. On rising through
"the fissure the water cools and loses pressure, and its capacity"
"to hold minerals in solution is therefore lessened. Besides, as"
"different currents meet in the fissure, some ascending, some"
"descending, and some coming in from the sides, the chemical"
performed by him could have the expected effect. It was similar to the
"diet, shower-baths and massage prescribed by physicians for physical"
health. The internal status of the officiating person was a matter of as
much indifference to the celestial spirits as the actual worth of the
"deceased was to Osiris, the judge of the underworld. All that was necessary"
to have him open the fields of Aalu to the soul was to pronounce the
"liturgic formulas, and if the soul declared its innocence in the prescribed"
terms its word was readily accepted.
"But in the Egyptian religion, as in all the religions of antiquity,[49] the"
original conception was gradually transformed and a new idea slowly took
its place. The sacramental acts of purification were now {92} expected to
"wipe out moral stains, and people became convinced that they made man"
"better. The devout female votaries of Isis, whom Juvenal[50] pictures as"
"breaking the ice to bathe in the Tiber, and crawling around the temple on"
"their bleeding knees, hoped to atone for their sins and to make up for"
their shortcomings by means of these sufferings.
When a new ideal grew up in the popular conscience during the second
"century, when the magicians themselves became pious and serious people,"
"free from passions and appetites, and were honored because of the dignity"
"of their lives more than for their white linen robes,[51] then the virtues"
of which the Egyptian priests enjoined the practice also became less
external. Purity of the heart rather than cleanliness of the body was
demanded. Renunciation of sensual pleasures was the indispensable condition
"for the knowledge of divinity, which was the supreme good.[52] No longer"
did Isis favor illicit love. In the novel by Xenophon of Ephesus (about 280
A. D.) she protects the heroine's chastity against all pitfalls and assures
its triumph. According to the ancient belief man's entire existence was a
"preparation for the formidable judgment held by Serapis after death, but to"
"have him decide in favor of the mystic, it was not enough to know the rites"
of the sect; the individual life had to be free from crime; and the master
"Our censors, dilettante, delicate-handed, with their canons of"
criticism might do worse than reckon up the number of English novels
which have lived on into the twentieth century. They will be surprised
to find that they are nearly all novels with a purpose and a religious
purpose for their “motif.” Charles Reade when he wrote _Never too late
"to mend_, not only helped forward the humane and intelligent treatment"
"of criminals, he showed how the Divine Image was stamped indelibly on"
"human nature, and where it seemed to be obliterated could be restored."
But Charles Reade drew real men and women. His characters are not
puppets of the play-house but are alive. And Thackeray--_Clarum et
"venerabile nomen_--making hypocrites his quarry, and raining his"
"quiver full of satiric shafts upon the hateful crew, never scoffed for"
"a moment at reverent things, but with bowed head and hushed footsteps"
"passed by the sanctuary. Therefore, these men are still living forces."
Men will read other novels of the past as women look at old-fashion
"plates, and amuse themselves with the differences and contrasts of"
"succeeding generations, but the novels which men buy in their hundreds"
"of thousands, the novels which are reprinted again and again, the"
"novels for which the publishers wait as their copyright is expiring,"
"like heirs expecting a rich man’s death, that each may endeavour to be"
first in the field with an edition which pays no royalty to the
author; these novels are those which truly represented life as it
"seemed in other days, life seeking ever to be reassured that One has"
come who offers to those who walk in darkness the light of life.
It is exasperating to some minds to discover that the man of the world
"is not altogether worldly, and that he finds in books which recognize"
"religion as a considerable part of man’s life, something which gives"
to them reality and truth. Immature minds and inexperienced penmen are
"not impressed by the things which really matter, and in the interval"
between the University and man’s settlement in life much nonsense is
"and sensory nerves, its actions are similar to that of alcohol, but more"
"prompt and less protracted; it is eliminated quickly, chiefly by the"
lungs.
"When inhaled, it first causes irritation of the fauces, a sense of"
"strangulation and cough, then a stage of excitement in which the visible"
mucous membranes are flushed and the respiration and pulse quickened; a
"convulsive stage generally follows, with rigid muscles and respiration"
"stertorous; this subsides and complete insensibility is established, the"
muscles being relaxed and the reflexes abolished; in fact all of the
"functions of the body are suspended, except respiration and circulation."
"If the inhalation be continued these too become paralyzed, death usually"
resulting from slow paralysis of respiration (chloroform paralyzes
quickly); the heart pulsating long after breathing has ceased. Atropine
"hypodermically is the best antagonist to the toxic effects of ether,"
also artificial respiration and injections of brandy.
"USES OF ETHER.--When mixed with alcohol, as the spirit, ether mixes"
readily with water. It is excellent in indigestion with flatulence; it
"checks gastric fermentation, expels the gas and overcomes irregular and"
"violent gastro-intestinal movements; hence, is also very good in"
"spasmodic colic. In spasmodic colic, best to combine with cannabis"
indica or belladonna. When used as a vermifuge it should be followed by
a purge. Used diluted one to ten to dislodge worms in the rectum. A most
reliable remedy for collapse. Ether and alcohol are indicated in
"parturient paresis, ether with aqua ammonia may be used intravenously"
when the cow is unable to swallow. Sulphuric ether and alcohol or whisky
"are also good in parturient eclampsia of bitches, though aromatic spirit"
"of ammonia is better; for chills, spirit of nitrous ether; also useful"
in convalescence from debilitating disease. Ether is a very good remedy
"in Thumps. Ether may be used for local anesthesia, applied as a spray,"
as well as a lively satisfaction at being able to solve the problem of
aerial locomotion by virtue of superior organisation alone.[108] Lafcadio
"Hearn, somewhat similarly, describes, in his _Shadowings_, a typical and"
"frequent dream of his own as a series of bounds in long parabolic curves,"
"rising to a height of some twenty-five feet, and always accompanied by the"
sense that a new power had been revealed which for the future would be a
permanent possession.
The attempt to explain dreams of flying has led to some bold hypotheses.
Freud characteristically affirms that the dream of flying is the bridge to
a concealed wish.[109] I have already mentioned the notion that dreams of
"flight are excursions of the 'astral body.' Professor Stanley Hall, who"
"has himself, from childhood, had dreams of flying, argues, with scarcely"
"less boldness, that we have here 'some faint reminiscent atavistic echo"
from the primeval sea'; and that such dreams are really survivals--psychic
vestigial remains comparable to the rudimentary gill-slits not uncommonly
found in man and other mammals--taking us back to the far past when man's
ancestors needed no feet to swim or float.[110] Such a theory may accord
"with the profound conviction of reality that accompanies these dreams,"
though that may be more easily accounted for; but it has the very serious
weakness that it offers an explanation which will not fit the facts. Our
"dreams are of flying, not of swimming; but the ancestors of the mammals"
"probably lived in the water, not in the air. In preference to so hazardous"
"a theory, it seems infinitely more reasonable to regard these dreams as an"
interpretation--a misinterpretation from the standpoint of waking life--of
actual internal sensations. If we can find the adequate explanation of a
psychic state in conditions actually existing within the organism itself
"at the time, it is needless to seek an explanation in conditions that"
ceased to exist untold millenniums ago.
My own explanation was immediately suggested by the following dream. I
"dreamed that I was watching a girl acrobat, in appropriate costume, who"
the sociological maxim that civilisations flourish in virtue partly of
natural advantages and partly of psychological pressures. On the face of
"things, it would seem that the original negation of natural advantage"
could hardly be carried farther than here. A land pieced together out of
drained marshes certainly tells more of man's effort than of Nature's
bounty. Yet even here the process of natural law is perfectly sequent
and intelligible.
One of the least-noted influences of the sea on civilisation is the
economic basis it yields in the way of food-supply. Already in Cæsar's
time the Batavians were partly fishermen; and it may be taken as certain
that through all the troubled ages down to the period of industry and
commerce it was the resource of fishing that mainly maintained and
retained population in the sea-board swamps of the Low Countries. Here
"was a harvest that enemies could not destroy, that demanded no ploughing"
"and sowing, and that could not well be reaped by the labour of slaves."
When war and devastation could absolutely depopulate the cultivated
"land, forcing all men to flee from famine, the sea for ever yielded some"
return to him who could but get afloat with net or line; and he who
could sail the sea had a double chance of life and freedom as against
land enemies. Thus a sea marsh could be humanly advantaged as against a
"fruitful plain, and could be a surer dwelling-place. The tables were"
first effectually turned when the Norse pirates attacked from the
sea--an irresistible inroad which seems to have driven the sea-board
Frisians (as it did the coast inhabitants of France) in crowds into
"slavery for protection, thus laying a broad foundation of popular"
"serfdom.[725] When, however, the Norse empire began to fail, the sea as"
a source of sustenance again counted for civilisation; and when to this
natural basis of population and subsistence there was added the peculiar
stimulus set up by a religious inculcation or encouragement of a fish
"diet, the fishing-grounds of the continent became relatively richer"
estates than mines and vineyards. Venice and Holland alike owed much to
By what secret virtue did the Egyptian religion exercise this irresistible
"influence over the Roman world? What new elements did those priests, who"
"made proselytes in every province, give the Roman world? Did the success of"
their preaching mean progress or retrogression from the standard of the
ancient Roman faith? These are complex and delicate questions that would
require minute analysis and cautious treatment with a constant and exact
"observation of shades. I am compelled to limit myself to a rapid sketch,"
"which, I {87} fear, will appear rather dry and arbitrary, like every"
generalization.
The particular doctrines of the mysteries of Isis and Serapis in regard to
"the nature and power of the gods were not, or were but incidentally, the"
reasons for the triumph of these mysteries. It has been said that the
"Egyptian theology always remained in a ""fluid state,""[37] or better in a"
"state of chaos. It consisted of an amalgamation of disparate legends, of an"
"aggregate of particular cults, as Egypt herself was an aggregate of a"
number of districts. This religion never formulated a coherent system of
generally accepted dogmas. It permitted the coexistence of conflicting
"conceptions and traditions, and all the subtlety of its clergy never"
"accomplished, or rather never began, the task of fusing those"
irreconcilable elements into one harmonious synthesis.[38] For the
Egyptians there was no principle of contradiction. All the heterogeneous
beliefs that ever obtained in the various districts during the different
"periods of a very long history, were maintained concurrently and formed an"
inextricable confusion in the sacred books.
About the same state of affairs prevailed in the Occidental worship of the
"Alexandrian divinities. In the Occident, just as in Egypt, there were"
"""prophets"" in the first rank of the clergy, who learnedly discussed"
"religion, but never taught a theological system that found universal"
"acceptance. The sacred scribe Cheremon, who became Nero's tutor, recognized"
"commerce, which finally undermined it, were set up or stimulated by its"
"own example. With less rapacity, indeed, it might have conciliated"
populations that it alienated. A lack of any higher ideals than those of
zealous commerce marks its entire career; it is associated with no such
growth of learning and the fine arts as took place in commercial
Holland; and its members seem to have been among the most unrefined of
the northern city populations.[724] But it made for progress on the
"ordinary levels. In a world wholly bent on privilege in all directions,"
it at least tempered its own spirit of monopoly in some measure by its
principle of inclusion; and it passed away as a great power before it
could dream of renewing the ideal of monopoly in the more sinister form
"of Oriental empire taken up by the Dutch. And, while its historians have"
not been careful to make a comparative study of the internal civic life
"which flourished under the commercial union, it does not at all appear"
"that the divisions of classes were more steep, or the lot of the lower"
"worse, than in any northern European State of the period."
"The ""downfall"" of such a polity, then, is conceptual only. All the"
realities of life evolved by the league were passed on to its
constituent elements throughout northern Europe; and there survived from
it what the separate States had not yet been able to offer--the
"adumbration, however dim, of a union reaching beyond the bounds of"
"nationality and the jealousies of race. In an age of private war,"
"without transcending the normal ethic, it practically limited private"
war as regarded its German members; and while joining battle at need
"with half-barbarian northern kings, or grudging foreigners, it of"
"necessity made peace its ideal. Its dissolution, therefore, marked at"
"once the advance of national organisation up to its level, and the"
persistence of the more primitive over the more rational instincts of
coalition.
FOOTNOTES:
"them as external beings. Primitive man has done so from the first, and"
this impulse has struck its roots into all our most fundamental human
traditions even as they survive in civilisation to-day. The man of
"the early world moves, like the dreamer, among a sea of emotions and"
"ideas which he cannot recognise the origin of, and, like the dreamer,"
"he instinctively dramatises them. But, unlike the dreamer, he gives"
stability to the images he has thus created and in good faith mistaken
"for independent beings. Thus we have the animistic stages of culture, and"
early man peoples his world with gods and spirits and demons and fairies
"and ghosts which enter into the traditions of his race, and are more or"
less accepted even by a later race which no longer creates them for itself.
In our more advanced civilisations we are still struggling with later
forms of that Protean tendency to objectify the self and to animate the
things and even the people around us with our own spirit. The impatient
"and imperfectly bred child, or even man, kicks viciously the object he"
"stumbles against, animate or inanimate, in order to revenge a wrong which"
"exists only in himself. On a slightly higher plane, the men of mediæval"
times brought actions in the law courts against offending animals and
"solemnly pronounced sentence against them as 'criminals,'[175] while"
even to-day society still 'punishes' the human criminal because it has
"imaginatively re-created him in the image of an ordinary normal person,"
and lacks the intelligence to perceive that he has been moulded by the
laws of his nature and environment into a creature which we do well to
"protect ourselves against, but have no right to 'punish.'[176] Everywhere"
we still see around us the surviving relics of this primitive tendency
of men to project their own personalities into external objects. A fine
"civilisation lies largely in the due subordination of this tendency, in"
"the realisation and control of our own emotional possibilities, and in the"
resultant growth of personal responsibility.
It is thus impossible to over-estimate the immense importance of the
nature of an excitation is rightly perceived its quality cannot be
rightly perceived. The dreamer may be able to perceive that he is being
"bitten, but the massive and profound impression of a bite which reaches"
his dreaming consciousness would not be adequately accounted for by
the supposition of the real mosquito that is the cause of it; the only
adequate explanation of the transformed impression received is to be found
(as in a dream already narrated) in a creature as large as a lobster.
This creature is the symbol of the real mosquito.[148] We have the same
phenomenon under somewhat similar conditions in the intoxication of
chloroform and nitrous oxide.
"The obscuration during sleep of the external sensory channels, with"
"the checks on false conclusions they furnish, is not alone sufficient"
to explain the symbolism of dreams. The dissociation of thought during
"sleep, with the diminished attention and apperception involved, is also"
a factor. The magnification of special isolated sensory impressions in
"dreaming consciousness is associated with a general bluntness, even an"
"absolute quiescence, of the external sensory mechanism. One part of the"
"organism, and it seems usually a visceral part, is thus apt to magnify its"
place in consciousness at the expense of the rest. As Vaschide and Piéron
"say, during sleep 'the internal sensations develop at the expense of the"
peripheral sensations.' That indeed seems to be the secret of the immense
emotional turmoil of our dreams. Yet it is very rare for these internal
sensations to reach the sleeping brain as what they are. They become
"conscious, not as literal messages, but as symbolical transformations."
"The excited or labouring heart recalls to the brain no memory of itself,"
"but some symbolical image of excitement or labour. There is association,"
"indeed, but it is association not along the matter-of-fact lines of our"
"ordinary waking civilised life, but along much more fundamental and"
"primitive channels, which in waking life we have now abandoned or never"
knew.
"ACTION.--Aloes is a purgative, acting chiefly on the large intestines;"
small doses are bitter tonics; it stimulates both peristalsis and
"secretion, increases secretion of bile; is also diuretic; applied"
externally it is stimulant and desiccant; the Barbadoes is the most
active and uniform in its effects.
"Aloes should be kept in lumps in tin cans or other good containers, only"
powdered for immediate use; in melting aloes don’t let the temperature
rise above 120 degrees as it impairs the activity by converting the
active aloin into inert resin. Aloes operate in from 12 to 24 hours
after administration; don’t repeat an aloetic purge until 24 hours have
"elapsed. It also does not cause catharsis. In about 15 hours, the"
"patient should be exercised, but returned to the stall as soon as the"
"desired effect is evident. If it fails to act in 24 hours, linseed oil"
"may be given. Aloin appears to contain the active principles of aloes,"
"and is usually as operative, but some manufactures are ineffective."
"USES INTERNAL.--In dyspepsia with capricious appetite, irregularity of"
"the bowels, hide-bound horses, worms; is used in colic, both spasmodic"
"and flatulent, for overloaded condition of the bowels; to promote"
"excretion of waste products from the bowels and the blood, and"
"consequently relieve febrile symptoms; rheumatic attacks, skin"
"irritation, swollen limbs and inflamed joints; in lymphangitis to"
"prevent and aid in curing. By attracting the blood to the bowels, it is"
"useful in congestion or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, full"
"doses being necessary; in paralysis, paraplegia or hemiplegia or"
"reflexed paralysis due to indigestion, give full doses. Aloes should not"
be used in irritation or inflammation of the alimentary canal or piles.
It is not advisable to give an aloetic purge when the temperature is
above 102° F. Nor in hemorrhage from the rectum; in high fevers it is
"apt to cause superpurgation, also should not be used where there is"
great debility or weakness. In influenza the bowels are apt to be
"round the monarch at Versailles. The young King Louis XVI., it is"
"true, carried through several reforms, but he had not enough strength"
of will to abolish the absurd immunities from taxation which freed the
"nobles and titled clergy from the burdens of the State. Thus, down to"
"1789, the middle classes and peasants bore nearly all the weight of"
"taxation, while the peasants were also encumbered by feudal dues and"
tolls. These were the crying grievances which united in a solid
"phalanx both thinkers and practical men, and thereby gave an immense"
impetus to the levelling doctrines of Rousseau.
"Two only of his political teachings concern us here, namely, social"
equality and the unquestioned supremacy of the State; for to these
"dogmas, when they seemed doomed to political bankruptcy, Napoleon"
"Buonaparte was to act as residuary legatee. According to Rousseau,"
"society and government originated in a social contract, whereby all"
members of the community have equal rights. It matters not that the
spirit of the contract may have evaporated amidst the miasma of
luxury. That is a violation of civil society; and members are
justified in reverting at once to the primitive ideal. If the
"existence of the body politic be endangered, force may be used:"
"""Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do"
so by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he shall be
"forced to be free."" Equally plausible and dangerous was his teaching"
as to the indivisibility of the general will. Deriving every public
"power from his social contract, he finds it easy to prove that the"
"sovereign power, vested in all the citizens, must be incorruptible,"
"inalienable, unrepresentable, indivisible, and indestructible."
Englishmen may now find it difficult to understand the enthusiasm
called forth by this quintessence of negations; but to Frenchman
recently escaped from the age of privilege and warring against the
"coalition of kings, the cry of the Republic one and indivisible was a"
"trumpet call to death or victory. Any shifts, even that of a"
first appearance in the gay world. He knew that it belonged to Lady
"Geraldine Romaine; and often his eyes roved round some gay assemblage,"
searching half unconsciously for a sight of her tall and graceful
"figure, and the sweet, earnest face, so different from the laughing and"
grimacing crowd in which he now moved.  Grey had not known much of
"women, so far.  His college life first, and then his roving career of"
"adventure, had hindered him from making friendships save with those of"
his own sex; and his deep love for his mother had preserved as a living
"power his chivalrous belief in women, and a resolute determination to"
"disbelieve the idle, malicious, and vicious tales he heard of them on"
"all sides.  Womanhood was sacred to him, and should be sacred to the"
world.  That was his inalienable conviction; and he had striven to be
"blind and deaf to much of what had often been passing around him, that"
"he might not sink to the level of the men he met, who would tear to"
"tatters a woman’s reputation for an evening’s pastime, or revel in every"
ugly bit of scandal or tittle-tattle that the young beaux’ valets
"learned from the lackeys of other fine folk, and retailed with additions"
"at the door of the theatre, the gates of the Park, or on the staircases"
of the fashionable houses whither their masters and mistresses flocked
"for amusement, unconscious or heedless of the gossip spread abroad about"
them by their servants at the doors.
Grey took no pleasure in the society of these fashionable dames.  His
tongue had not learned the trick of the artificial language then in
vogue.  He was disgusted by the gross flattery every lady looked to
"receive, and the lisping platitudes of the attendant beaux filled him"
with scorn.  It was small wonder that he chose rather the society of men
"of more virility and stronger fibre, such as Lord Sandford and his"
"chosen friends; for though many of them were wild young rakes, and not a"
"few had a very doubtful record, yet Grey knew little enough about that,"
"and found them not without attraction, although the higher part of his"
"nature revolted from much that he saw and heard.  Nevertheless, he"
"In applying his mind to the views of Locke, the ordinary man finds"
himself arriving at very commonplace and well-accustomed conceptions.
"Locke, indeed, may reasonably be said to represent the ideas of common,"
everyday life. The ordinary man does not question the reality of
"things, he accepts it without asking any questions, and bases his"
theories--scientific or otherwise--upon this implied reality. Locke
"worked out the theory which had been propounded by Lord Bacon, that"
knowledge is obtained by the observation of facts which are implicitly
"accepted as realities; and what, it was asked, could be more"
self-evident and sane? It is easy to conceive a number of perceiving
"minds upon the one hand, ready to take up perceptions of an outside"
material substance upon the other. The mind may be considered as a
"piece of white paper--a _tabula rasa_, as it was called--on which"
"external things may make what impression they will, and knowledge is"
apparently explained at once. But though Locke certainly succeeded in
"making these terms the common coin of ordinary life, difficulties crop"
"up when we come to examine them more closely. After all, it is evident,"
the only knowledge our mind can have is a knowledge of its own
"ideas--ideas which are, of course, caused by something which is"
"outside, or at least, as Locke would say, by its _quality_. Now, from"
this it would appear that these 'ideas' after all come between the mind
"and the 'thing,' whatever it is, that causes them--that is to say, we"
"can perhaps maintain that we only know our 'ideas,' and not things as"
in themselves. Locke passes into elaborate distinctions between primary
"qualities of things, of which he holds exact representations are given,"
"and secondary qualities, which are not in the same position; but the"
whole difficulty we meet with is summed up in the question whether we
"really _know_ substance, or whether it is that we can only hope to know"
"ideas, and 'suppose' some substratum of reality outside. Then another"
difficulty is that we can hardly really know our _selves_. How can we
"know that the self exists; and if, like Malebranche, we speak of God"
ourselves that the function was one which would involve no official
"recognition of the Pope on our part, and that we should be merely"
"Protestant spectators, we gladly accepted the offer of tickets for the"
"audience, and, supposing in our simplicity that, as the reception was"
"set for noon, we should be sufficiently early if we went at eleven"
"o'clock, we drove up to the main entrance of the Vatican at that hour."
"There was a great throng of people about the door, but our tickets"
obtained for us immediate entrance along with a stream of other ladies
and gentlemen. The regulation attire for these functions is full
"evening dress for gentlemen, while ladies wear black, with no hat, but"
with a lace mantilla on the head. We first passed through a double line
"of the famous Swiss Guards, in their extraordinary uniform of crimson,"
"yellow and black, designed by no less a person than Michael Angelo."
"Then we were shown up the great stairway, and passing through a couple"
"of large rooms, one of which was adorned with Raphael's frescoes, we"
"found ourselves at the entrance of a long and spacious hall, already"
"densely crowded, as it seemed to us, but with a space kept open down"
the centre between the rows of seats on either side. Looking down
"this open space, we could see at the other end, on a slightly raised"
"platform, the pontifical throne, upholstered in red velvet, with"
"golden back and arms, effectively set in the midst of crimson hangings,"
which swept in rich masses from the lofty ceiling to the floor.
"Preceded by guards, we travelled the whole length of the hall, and"
"found, to our great gratification, that our seats were quite close to"
"the throne, so that we had an excellent position for seeing and hearing"
all that was going on. We soon noticed that many of the hundreds of
"people present, like some of us, had not observed the regulations as"
to dress. Many others had. Mingled with the soberer attire of the
"spectators, pilgrims and priests, we saw now and then a violet cassock,"
"as one bishop after another drifted in. Apart from these vestments,"
there was no semblance of a religious gathering. It was more like a
"social function, and the people were chatting gaily, the jolliest and"
But his selfish support merely sanctioned a power already established. The
propaganda of the Oriental religions was originally democratic and
sometimes even revolutionary like the Isis worship. Step by step they
"advanced, always reaching higher social classes and appealing to popular"
conscience rather than to the zeal of functionaries.
"As a matter of fact all these religions, except that of Mithra, seem at"
first sight to be far less austere than the Roman creed. We shall have
occasion to note that they contained coarse and immodest fables and
atrocious or vile rites. The Egyptian gods were expelled from Rome by
"Augustus and Tiberius on the charge of being immoral, but they were called"
immoral principally because they opposed a certain conception of the social
order. They gave little attention to the public interest but attached
considerable importance to the inner life and consequently to the value of
"the individual. Two new things, in particular, were brought to Italy by the"
"Oriental priests: mysterious methods of purification, by which they claimed"
"to wash away the impurities of the soul, and the assurance that a blessed"
immortality would be the reward of piety.[23]
These religions pretended to restore lost purity[24] to the soul either
through the performance of ritual ceremonies or through mortifications and
penance. They had a series of ablutions and lustrations supposed to restore
original innocence to the mystic. He had to wash himself in the sacred
"water according to certain prescribed forms. This was really a magic rite,"
"because bodily purity acted sympathetically upon the soul, or {40} else it"
was a real spiritual disinfection with the water driving out the evil
"spirits that had caused pollution. The votary, again, might drink or"
besprinkle himself with the blood of a slaughtered victim or of the priests
"themselves, in which case the prevailing idea was that the liquid"
circulating in the veins was a vivifying principle capable of imparting a
new existence.[25] These and similar rites[26] used in the mysteries were
supposed to regenerate the initiated person and to restore him to an
"was rhythmically rising to a great height in the air and then falling,"
"without touching the floor, though each time she approached quite close"
"to it. At last she ceased, exhausted and perspiring, and I had to lead"
"her away. Her movements were not controlled by mechanism, and apparently"
"I did not regard mechanism as necessary. It was a vivid dream, and I"
awoke with a distinct sensation of oppression in the chest. In trying
"to account for this dream, which was not founded on any memory, it"
occurred to me that probably I had here the key to a great group of
dreams. The rhythmic rising and falling of the acrobat was simply the
objectivation of the rhythmic rising and falling of my own respiratory
"muscles--in some dreams, perhaps, of the systole and diastole of the"
heart's muscles--under the influence of some slight and unknown physical
"oppression, and this oppression was further translated into a condition"
"of perspiring exhaustion in the girl, just as men with heart disease may"
"dream of sweating and panting horses climbing uphill, in accordance with"
that tendency to magnification which marks dreams generally.[111] We may
recall also the curious sensation as of the body being transformed into
"a vast bellows or steam engine, which is often the last sensation felt"
before the unconsciousness produced by nitrous oxide gas.[112] When we
are lying down there is a real rhythmic rising and falling of the chest
"and abdomen, centring in the diaphragm, a series of oscillations which at"
"both extremes are only limited by the air. Moreover, in this position we"
"have to recognise that the circulatory, nervous, and other systems of"
"the whole internal organism, are differently balanced from what they are"
"in the upright position, and that a disturbance of internal equilibrium"
always accompanies falling.
"It is also noteworthy (as, indeed, Wundt has briefly remarked) that the"
modifications produced by sleep in the respiratory process itself tend
to facilitate its interpretation as a process of flying. Mosso showed
"that respiration in sleep is more thoracic than when awake, that it is"
"lengthened, and that the respiratory pause is less marked.[113] That is to"
crime impelled men to seek absolution in the formal practices of
asceticism. They applied to the Oriental priests for spiritual remedies.
People flattered themselves that by performing the rites they would attain
a condition of felicity after death. All barbarian mysteries pretended to
reveal to their adherents the secret of blessed immortality. Participation
in the occult ceremonies of the sect was a {43} chief means of
salvation.[36] The vague and disheartening beliefs of ancient paganism in
regard to life after death were transformed into the firm hope of a
well-defined form of happiness.[37]
This faith in a personal survival of the soul and even of the body was
"based upon a strong instinct of human nature, the instinct of"
self-preservation. Social and moral conditions in the empire during its
decline gave it greater strength than it had ever possessed before.[38] The
"third century saw so much suffering, anguish and violence, so much"
"unnecessary ruin and so many unpunished crimes, that the Roman world took"
refuge in the expectation of a better existence in which all the iniquity
of this world would be retrieved. No earthly hope brightened life. The
tyranny of a corrupt bureaucracy choked all disposition for political
progress. Science stagnated and revealed no more unknown truths. Growing
poverty discouraged the spirit of enterprise. The idea gained ground that
"humanity was afflicted with incurable decay, that nature was approaching"
her doom and that the end of world was near.[39] We must remember all these
causes of discouragement and despondency to understand the power of the
"idea, expressed so frequently, that the spirit animating man was forced by"
bitter necessity to imprison itself in matter and that it was delivered
from its carnal captivity by death. In the heavy atmosphere of a period of
oppression and impotence the dejected soul longed with incredible ardor to
fly to the radiant abode of heaven.
"To recapitulate, the Oriental religions acted upon the senses, the"
"phenomena of fatigue and depression, together with possibilities of"
"recovery and of exaltation, yet also that of permanent irresponsiveness"
which is associated with death. I was filled with awe at this stupendous
generalisation; and it was with great hope that I announced my results
"before the Royal Society,--results demonstrated by experiments. But the"
"physiologists present advised me, after my address, to confine myself to"
"physical investigations in which my success had been assured, rather"
than encroach on their preserve. I had thus unwittingly strayed into the
domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system and so offended its
etiquette. An unconscious theological bias was also present which
"confounds ignorance with faith. It is forgotten that He, who surrounded"
"us with this ever-evolving mystery of creation, the ineffable wonder"
"that lies hidden in the microcosm of the dust particle, enclosing within"
"the intricacies of its atomic form all the mystery of the cosmos, has"
also implanted in us the desire to question and understand. To the
theological bias was added the misgivings about the inherent bent of the
Indian mind towards mysticism and unchecked imagination. But in India
this burning imagination which can extort new order out of a mass of
"apparently contradictory facts, is also held in check by the habit of"
meditation. It is this restraint which confers the power to hold the
"mind in pursuit of truth, in infinite patience, to wait, and reconsider,"
to experimentally test and repeatedly verify.
"It is but natural that there should be prejudice, even in science,"
against all innovations; and I was prepared to wait till the first
incredulity could be overcome by further cumulative evidence.
Unfortunately there were other incidents and misrepresentations which it
was impossible to remove from this insulating distance. Thus no
conditions could have been more desperately hopeless than those which
confronted me for the next twelve years. It is necessary to make this
brief reference to this period of my life; for one who would devote
himself to the search of truth must realise that for him there awaits no
the most daring and original psychologist in the field of morbid psychic
phenomena--that we owe the long-neglected recognition of the large place
of symbolism in dreaming. Scherner had argued in favour of this aspect of
"dreams, but he was an undistinguished and unreliable psychologist, and"
his arguments failed to be influential. Freud avows himself a partisan of
"Scherner's theory of dreaming and opponent of all other theories,[152] but"
his treatment of the matter is incomparably more searching and profound.
"Freud, however, goes far beyond the fundamental--and, as I believe,"
undeniable--proposition that dream-imagery is largely symbolic. He holds
that behind the symbolism of dreams there lies ultimately a _wish;_ he
"believes, moreover, that this wish tends to be really of more or less"
"sexual character, and, further, that it is tinged by elements that go back"
"to the dreamer's infantile days. As Freud views the mechanism of dreams,"
"it is far from exhibiting mere disordered mental activity, but is (much"
"as he has also argued hysteria to be[153]) the outcome of a desire, which"
"is driven back by a kind of inhibition or censure (_i.e._, that kind"
"of moral check which is still more alert in the waking state), and is"
seeking new forms of expression. There is first in the dream the process
"of what Freud calls condensation (_Verdichtung_), a process which is that"
fusion of separate elements which must be recognised at the outset of
"every discussion of dreaming, but Freud maintains that in this fusion all"
"the elements have a point in common, and overlie one another like the"
pictures in a Galtonian composite photograph. Then there comes the process
"of displacement or transference (_Verschiebung_), a process by which the"
really central and emotional basis of the dream is concealed beneath
trifles. Then there is the process of dramatisation or transformation
into a concrete situation of which the elements have a symbolic value.
"Thus, as Maeder puts it, summarising Freud's views, 'behind the apparently"
insignificant events of the day utilised in the dream there is always an
important idea or event hidden. We only dream of things that are worth
while. What at first sight seems to be a trifle is a grey wall which
hides a great palace. The significance of the dream is not so much held
"intellect and the conscience at the same time, and therefore gained a hold"
"on the entire man. {44} Compared with the ancient creeds, they appear to"
"have offered greater beauty of ritual, greater truth of doctrine and a far"
superior morality. The imposing ceremonial of their festivities and the
"alternating pomp and sensuality, gloom and exaltation of their services"
"appealed especially to the simple and the humble, while the progressive"
"revelation of ancient wisdom, inherited from the old and distant Orient,"
captivated the cultured mind. The emotions excited by these religions and
"the consolations offered strongly attracted the women, who were the most"
fervent and generous followers and most passionate propagandists[40] of the
religions of Isis and Cybele. Mithra was worshiped almost exclusively by
"men, whom he subjected to a rigid moral discipline. Thus souls were gained"
by the promise of spiritual purification and the prospect of eternal
happiness.
"The worship of the Roman gods was a civic duty, the worship of the foreign"
gods the expression of a personal belief. The latter were the objects of
"the thoughts, feelings and intimate aspirations of the individual, not"
"merely of the traditional and, one might say, functional adoration of the"
citizen. The ancient municipal devotions were connected with a number of
earthly interests that helped to support each other. They were one of
various forms of family spirit and patriotism and guaranteed the prosperity
"of the community. The Oriental mysteries, directing the will toward an"
"ideal goal and exalting the inner spirit, were less mindful of economic"
"utility, but they could produce that vibration of the moral being that"
"caused emotions, stronger than any rational faculty, to gush forth from the"
depths of the soul. Through a sudden illumination {45} they furnished the
intuition of a spiritual life whose intensity made all material happiness
appear insipid and contemptible. This stirring appeal of supernatural life
made the propaganda irresistible. The same ardent enthusiasm guaranteed at
the same time the uncontested domination of neo-Platonism among the
philosophers. Antiquity expired and a new era was born.
This intimate union of erudition and faith continued {33} in the Latin
world. Theology became more and more a process of deification of the
principles or agents discovered by science and a worship of time regarded
"as the first cause, the stars whose course determined the events of this"
"world, the four elements whose innumerable combinations produced the"
"natural phenomena, and especially the sun which preserved heat, fertility"
"and life. The dogmas of the mysteries of Mithra were, to a certain extent,"
the religious expression of Roman physics and astronomy. In all forms of
pantheism the knowledge of nature appears to be inseparable from that of
God.[15] Art itself complied more and more with the tendency to express
"erudite ideas by subtle symbolism, and it represented in allegorical"
"figures the relations of divine powers and cosmic forces, like the sky, the"
"earth, the ocean, the planets, the constellations and the winds. The"
sculptors engraved on stone everything man thought and taught. In a general
way the belief prevailed that redemption and salvation depended on the
"revelation of certain truths, on a knowledge of the gods, of the world and"
"of our person, and piety became gnosis.[16]"
"But, you will say, since in the classic age philosophy also claimed to lead"
"to morality through instruction and to acquaint man with the supreme good,"
why did it yield to Oriental religions that were in reality neither
"original nor innovating? Quite right, and if a powerful rationalist school,"
"possessed of a good critical method, had led the minds, we may believe that"
it would have checked the invasion of the barbarian mysteries or at least
"limited their field of action. However, as has frequently been pointed out,"
even in ancient Greece the philosophic critics had very little hold on {34}
popular religion obstinately faithful to its inherited superstitious forms.
But how many second century minds shared Lucian's skepticism in regard to
the dogmatic systems! The various sects were fighting each other for ever
so long without convincing one another of their alleged error. The satirist
of Samosata enjoyed opposing their exclusive pretensions while he himself
"reclined on the ""soft pillow of doubt."" But only intelligent minds could"

"75 $100 bills, one, two, 3,000 more, plus the $10,000 and the $5,000 makes $201,000 exactly."
The perfect embezzlement.

"You may say that Rome wasn't built in a day, but neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover--"

"Yes indeed, if Croesus, Kreuger, Rockefeller could afford to brag a little, well, in due time, why not the perfect embezzler?"
I only make these notes because someday people may recognize the...

"Look, I got home late and I do have a date tonight, so--"
"Sally, did we get any money today?"
Was any cash received in the office?
Cash?
Just the one loan deposit.
That wad?
"I mean, how much?"
How much was it?
"$45,000, but you already know about that."
"Actually, I'm 100% objective."

You know how we get topspin?

Tell me.
- 'Cause Baby Jesus made topspin.
What?
- Baby Jesus gave it topspin.
- Jesus?
Ah!
Why do you say that?
- Because Baby Jesus made everything.

And that's one thing I never mean to do
"Open your eyes, vato."
"Oh, oh-oh, baby, don't you know I'm human?"
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
"Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done"
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
"Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"

So she doesn't live here anymore
Where does she live now?
She lives in Tokyo I think
"Well no, for sure"
What do you mean?
"Officer, it's not like I was holding her in custody"
"She was over 20 too, so we were just living together"
Ok...
"Plus, I am a victim too"
A missing person's report was it from her parents?
Or was it these two?
Is it normal to be investigating together?
Not that it matters
This really doesn't concern me anymore
So it's a little annoying
You need to be more responsible
Hey...
What about me is irresponsible?
I'm mentally fucked up cause of her
She is the one who is irresponsible
How is she irresponsible?
Miyu was texting me about the violence she was tolerating
Miyu is the victim

That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?

Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.

They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."

Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"-To begin with, it could make things worse."
"-Oh, how?"
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
"-Yeah, but--"
"-Meanwhile, your daughter--"
-You could do it yourself.
-No.
I'd need Church approval...
-...and that's rarely given.
-But-- Uh....
-Could you see her?
"-Yes, I could."
"I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I--"
"Oh, not a psychiatrist."

Because it proves the existence Fantômas.

Good one.
"Keep saying it to yourself, you might believe it."
"Dr. Gallant, I'd like to offer my services in officiating at your nuptials."
-What?
I'm a Universal Life minister.

It's completely legal.
I've married lots of people.
"So, what are you?"
"Like, Reverend Jerry?"
"Actually, I go by Father Superior."

Yes. I'd like you to be my bridesmaid.

"Well, there is that rich jerk, Roger Frank, who hates me and wants to destroy me."
"Wait, you don't think he turned the council against me?"
"It did seem weird that you were impeached just days after you were fired, so I called your old company, and it turns out they just signed a new, huge client-- Dustybear Financial."

"Chief, I think Tat-chi is skilled enough to be our representative."
Amida Buddha!
The Shaolin and Wu-tang parties have both arrived as planned.
"If they can fight each other,"
Your Highness will surely have the advantage.
You'll be the ruler.
Will the two representatives please come out?
Remember to eliminate unnecessary doubts.
Please start the fight!
Stand back!
Shaolin monks say that the Wu-tang school originated from them.
Does the Shaolin still say that?
"Amida Buddha, yes!"
Wu-tang founder San-feng broke our rules and was expelled.
That's enough!
He was expelled because Shaolin was jealous of his ability.
We are the best fighters.
Nonsense!
Wu-tang is too proud!
We're only telling facts.
Please don't argue!
I trust this contest will decide which school is better once and for all.

"With the ceremonies complete, the tomb was sealed."
Tutankhamun was finally left alone in the silent valley.
"Pharaoh Ay reigned for just four years, leaving no heir."
"When a new dynasty began,"
Tutankhamun's name was removed from the monuments he had built.
"With his records erased, his memory was allowed to wither away."
"Goodbye, old chap."
- All done?
- All done.
"So, was it worth it?"
"I think so, yes."
"Oh, yes."
And did you find him?
"A bit, yes."
A bit.
"During his lifetime,"
"Howard Carter received no official honour in Britain or Egypt in recognition of his unique achievements, and when he died in March, 1939, his funeral was poorly attended."
But Tutankhamun's tomb remains the most famous archaeological find of all time.

The fracture wasn't consistent with a flat surface like the hull of a boat.
It looked more like a hammer blow.

Chief Superintendent Fairbank had nothing to do with this case.
He ran Vice.
Also copied in on the missing persons report.
What do we know about Chief Superintendent Fairbank?
This.
Councillor Dale Roach with guess who?
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Chief Superintendent Fairbank retired in 2008.
"Oh, yeah."
Pat ran vice for donkey's years.
"If Oliver Stephens-Lloyd did submit a list of abusers at Sands View, almost certainly it would have gone to Vice."
Almost certainly.
Which makes the fact he was copied in on Stephens-Lloyd's missing persons and postmortem reports all the more suspicious.
"Sir, former Chief Superintendent Fairbank still lives in the area."
"Well, let's see what he's got to say for himself."
"Good work, you two."
Good work.
- Sir.
- Sir.
"Come in, please."
"Very grateful for your time, sir."
"Oh, anything I can do to help."
"And I'm retired now, there's no need for the sir."

What is written in doctor certificate?
As long as I am still wearing a prosecutor's clothes...
I'll do everything to preserve it.
Choi Eung Chan.
Why would you you come here?
!
Our Prosecutor... became like this because he was following you.
Right?
City Hunter!
It's you!
At the site...
Because he was fearlessly running around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor became like that!
You killer!
Hey!
By any means...
I will catch you!
"I promise you, I will catch you!"
Hey!
Let go.
Let go!
Seriously!
Aish
"I came because we lost a precious prosecutor, but"
I think I should just go
I found that Chairman Cheon Jae Man and President Choi Eung Chan have something going on.
"After the President assumed office,"
Hae Won got the bid to construct the bridge over Minja Expressway.
"For that, there was a controversy over the favoritism."
"Right before the presidential election,"
Haewon moved a pile of money.
And that was used for presidential election.
And that contract was the payback.
"I was gonna say, they seem like..."
Albany girls.
"Uh, so, anyway, we just wanted to drop by... and find out if you've seen this guy."
"Well, I'll let you know."
"Although, with Jerry, he could be shacked up anywhere."
"He's a bookie, for Christ's sake."
It was nothing.
Nothing.
"The word ""lotto"" never even came up."
"- See, Mr. Crazy Man?"
- Thank God!
- They were checking on Jerry.
- They asked about Jerry?
"- Yeah, yeah."
It was just routine.
- Not routine.
It's called a murder investigation.
"No, trust me."
Dale took care of every thing.
They'll find a cure for cancer before they find Jerry.
[MaleAnnouncer] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six.
"Covering Harrisburg, New York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's News at Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather."
This is News at Five.
Our top story tonight:
The body of a local bookmaker was found floating in the river today.
Police say it was foul play and are following leads.
More on that story in a moment.
"First, let's check in with the weather center... to see if we can expect more of these spring-like temperatures."
Russ?
Russ?
"Oh, yeah?"
- How about these temperatures?
"However, unlike Freddie Lau,"
Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now.
Impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA from her body.
Freddie Lau's casino is less than a mile from Pleasure Palace where Fenchurch worked.
You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out similarities in their deaths.
Strangling is not a common MO.
HARRY:
Such a clumsy way to kill someone.
What?
You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes.
You really have to hate them or love them.
HARRY:
Who's that?
Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov.
Jumped off his penthouse balcony.
Not much left of him.
It's going to take at least another 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
SURI:
Harry?
Kaleem intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kaleem, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Kayleigh Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone new was trying to muscle out Freddie
- but Freddie wasn't listening.
- Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Yeah, but Kayleigh Fenchurch's murder was so precise."
"You know, no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
"Freddie Lau, his body's just dumped in an alleyway."
Sloppy
Check out the CCTV in Soho on the night Freddie died.
The enemy is cloaked and is fast!
"It seems to be using arrows, which is probably to..."
"Right, muzzle flashes would make it easy to pinpoint its location."
This must be to avoid that.
Optical camouflage?
Does invisibility technology even...?
It must be based on...
"Anyway, it's ingenious."
"There's nothing on my thermograph, and it's not casting a shadow."
But...
It definitely exists.
Yeah.
"You are giving this to me, Milord?"
Customize it however you like.
I've already discussed the matters of your peerage title and activation factor with Princess Lemrina.
Milord Slaine...
The arrow has been loosed.
There is no turning back now.
"Yes, Milord!"
Count Sebring.
Count Raffia.
Inform Count Orga.
Tell him to swear fealty.
"Smoke grenades, loading complete."
"Ready here, too."
Fire!
"He's right, it definitely exists."
And if it exists... it will have an effect on air currents!
Target located.
Right!
Open fire!
- Lieutenant!
"No, I only stopped by to--"
We were discussing something quite different.
"All right, never mind."
"Oh, put them right over there."
Has anyone else been here this evening?
Anyone called?
Just Enos Watterton.
He wanted to make sure you got away all right.
- I didn't know then you'd missed the train.
- Enos Watterton?
- Oh.
- Sandy-
"- Sandy, if you won't tell me, will you please tell Perry what's been upsetting you so lately?"
"I mean, that's part of the reason I wanted to talk to him."
"Oh, for heaven's sakes, Beth, I don't care what you do."
- Sandy!
"- Driver, wait."
"Taxi, taxi!"
[jazz playing]
"Sellers, Sellers."
[phone ringing]
Yes?
Who?
"Oh, Sandy--"
Ha!
"Well, I guess we all miss a train once in a while."
"I'll catch the first plane in the morning, sir."
The only reason I bothered you was to double check to make sure that I have all the papers they'll need in Phoenix.
What?
"I mean in the briefcase, sir."
I had the impression that you put everything in there yourself and--
"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't actually."
Did you talk to the Queen?
- I can not talk to the Palace.
And the Prime Minister?
- Still unattainable.
Do you want to be reached?
We are ready.
"- Carlos, what does he do here?"
We will not go anywhere.
- Why?
There is an emergency meeting.
- What the hell is going on?
All flights were canceled due to cosmic interference.
"Excuse me, one that?"
"- A solar storm, exactly."
"The satellites are dead, some are precipitated."
"For security reasons, you have to stay here."
Here in Istanbul?
"- No, here at this hotel."
All foreign dignitaries will be concentrated here.
How long will we have to wait?
"- One day, one week."
You do not know.
"Do you remember the Icelandic volcano, Eyjajafufukukul?"
Eyjafjallajökull.
- Yup.
I have to go back to Belgium right away.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
This situation is a disadvantage for everyone.
I had to receive a promotion this week.
"If we can not fly, we'll be in the car."
"By car, through the Balkans?"
- Yup.
He's doing what?
Get me satellite surveillance on a 50-mile grid around the exchange point.
Where's Scott?
I had to bring him back Khartoum along with that bloody journalist woman.
- He took a bullet to the spleen.
- (SIGHS)
SINCLAIR: (OVER COMMS) He's lost a lot of blood.
"They're prepping him for surgery, now."
"You've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission, with the only lead..."
to Latif...
Please tell me
Crawford gave you the intel beforehand.
- Negative...
- Sinclair.
And I think I'm about to get arrested.
"Walk away now, you don't know me, go."

"JACOUB: (CONTINUOUSLY) Wait, wait, wait..."
There are two wells near here.
The Janjaweed will be close to one.
The nearest is Bir an Natrun...that way.
"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And, your friend, Scott, he promised me much money."
"And a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
"So, what's your reason?"
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
A Japanese that is active overseas.
"Today, we're in the popular chocolate shop in Paris, L'atelier de Bonheur."
"Ah, it's Bonheur."
"Geez, I want to go to Paris."
I want to eat Bonheur chocolates.
"No matter where you get them, chocolates won't be much different, right?"
"What are you saying, onee-chan?"
It's totally different.
(T/N: onee-chan means older sister)
Bonheur is special.
"And in this place that's called the world's best chocolate shop, there is a Japanese employee."
Hee...
- It's been six years since he came alone to Paris.
"Built up his expertise, the young chocolatier Koyurugi Souta."
Making chocolates in Bonheur was my dream.
- No way.
"But next week, I will be returning to Japan, and opening my own shop."
"Chocolates that won't lose to the taste of Bonheur,"
I want to let the Japanese people enjoy them.
"Then, I'll be taking it."
- Yes.
"Wow, it's as pretty as a picture."
As expected of the prince of chocolate.
Not at all.
"Ever since I came back to Japan, there's been nothing but good things."
"Dad accepted the renovation of the shop without any complaints, thanks to Bonheur's reputation, for good or bad, right after I landed in japan,"
I even got the label of prince of chocolate.
Take care.
Ah...
Excuse me.
Souta-kun.
See.
[Collective chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
Magnum .44.
I bet it was from the same gun the exterminator used.
Who the fuck are you?
"Agent Shaw, from the c.I.A."
So far you haven't been very cooperative.
And just why is the c.I.A. Interested in this case?
"We're interested because in these sensitive times, two months before elections, the exterminator has been stirring up a lot of resentment against incumbent politicians and the entire judicial system."
"This could easily be the work of the opposition party, or maybe even a foreign government."
"Dr., uh, Megan Stewart, please."
What do you think?
I think you have to take a shit.
It's coming out of your mouth instead of your asshole.

"Apparently George Salt left for work early yesterday morning for an emergency meeting,"

It makes me want to break everything right now
If I can't hear the words I yearn for again
I'd carelessly offer my life
Desires that cuddle
With a fading light
It's lonely
Will the morning sun come before me?
Answer me
Is there a love that binds us?
Stand and face the despair we invited
The wills of the people
Born and destroyed
Choose the future and open the lock

Say something to Ryner!

"Ah... sorry, I didn't hear you."

THE VISITORS ARRIVE
"Yes, because they wanted to fly."
And not because the computer liked them.
Hallo!
Where are you?
Good morning!
Morning exercise!
- What a hairstyle!
- Come on!
Can we start now?
He looks terrible.
Who's going to tell him?
Will you?
No turning back now.
- Is the fire prepared?
- No.
It should be burning by now!
This man's blind.
He seems not to notice that we don't care about his Expedition.

Did you betray me?
What if I did?
You've lost anyway
Si Sun...
What happened to you?
I fell from the stairs
"My son's gone, my baby is gone!"
Lost...
"Ah Kwai, help me"
My son's gone...
"You only think about your son, and not about me"
"That's not true, but I've spent so much money in the hope that I could have a son"
A son...
You should have the ability
Am I not?
I'll give you anything you want
Did you say I'm not capable?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
"You bastard lf you are that capable, marry a Miss Hong Kong"
"If it were not for me you'll still be a whore in that place, you bitch"
I didn't come to Hong Kong to bear you a son

The address he gave to his release is false.
It took a notice research to find him.
Done.
He resurfaced Otoharada.
Now I count on you to find him.
Then...
Yagami.
Do not disappoint me.
Yes.
- Return to your quarters!
- Yes.
"Chief, this time..."
"Refer to the jurisdiction, and will investigate."
We must give them every detail.
Yes.
Course.
This Ogiso a big head.
"Yeah, but wait."
The head endures same.
The leader knows the suspect Otoharada?
You not know?
So.
Cho was killed here.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.

Who told you that story?
ByeOTQQVU-
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-go turns up dead two days ago."

All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."

"May I present His Excellency, the Count of Matamoro."
You know my brother.
Major Blas Vivar.
I have the honour of knowing the Count.
"The title of Count is in dispute between us, as, of course, is Spain itself."
Why?
You're a Spaniard.
Why do you fight against your country and your brother?
Politics.
I am what is called afrancesado...
- one who suports France
- Why?
Bonaparte brings the light of reason.
"There are two Spains, Lieutenant."
My brother's Spain is a monastery - silence and superstition
My Spain is a court - science and scholarship.
"If you were Spanish,"
- which would you choose lieutenant?
- I am neither monk nor prince.
So I would choose a tavern.

She says he can see you tomorrow.
- She?
- His scheduler.
- You paged him.
- She called back.
Call Fisher or his scheduler and say:
"""I want the secretary here in half an hour to talk about moving his announcement to the briefing room because we have more TV cameras."""
- Because we have...
The most dangerous place in Washington is between Bill Fisher and a TV camera.
Clean as a whistle.
- Thank you.
- Molly Morello.
When was the last time I asked you for anything?
"- By the way, I found this."
- What?
"I was only saying so to Marti Caine, before her last trip to South Africa."
"So keep your embittered, communistic treason to yourself during tonight's intercourse with Tarby and friends."
I am not having intercourse with Tarby and that's final.
What a surprise!
Four minutes into the episode and he delivers the most tortuous double entendre ever.
It was a great gag.
"- Social intercourse, Eddie, social."
"- Oh, phew."
We shall talk about subjects far above your head.
"Poetry, fine art, golf."
"That reminds me, I must bone up on Tarby's book of golfing anecdotes."
They are the greatest work of Eng lit since Dick.
- Oo-er.
"- Dick-ens, Eddie."
Dick-ens.
Oo-er.
There's only one thing I hate more than golfing anecdotes and it's this.
"It's a close run thing, though."
Ha ha ha ha ha!
"This is brilliant stuff, it's classic, classic, classic."
"Well done, Tarby."
Oh.
"Oh, listen to this one."
"Listen, listen, listen."
Shut up.
"""Lynchy and I had taken time off and flown to Spain"

"The man, codename: the Needle."
Also known as Henry Faber.
"He was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called Öln in West Prussia."
At the age of 13 he went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden.
"Two years later, he was transferred to the more prestigious Groß-Lichterfelde near Berlin."
"He already spoke fluent English because his father, Baron von Müller-Guder, had worked in Washington as a military attaché, and had sent his son to private school there."
"But back in Germany, the boy rebelled constantly and was often flogged for it."
He passed his final exams with extremely high marks.
"In the '20s, the Needle was a cadet at the war school in Metz, and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him."
"In '31, Hitler visited the family estate and met him."
"In '33, Hitler came to power."
The Needle was made a captain and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties.
He had an affair with a German actress.
He never married.
He made no close friends.
"And in '38, the Needle disappeared."
God.
Clever bastards.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- And who might you be?
- I should be asking who you are.
You're on my boat.
- What's in that bag?
"- Binoculars, camera, reference books."
"No, you don't."
"So far, so good."
I have been directed to address you... on the possibility of making the army your career.
- [Muffled Whimper] - [Laughing] - [Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
"[Charles, Laughing] Army..."
Career...
I'm sorry.
"If I held that in, my teeth would've exploded."
- You gotta be kidding.
"- Gentlemen, please, it's impolite to laugh at the senile."
- What'd he say?
- Loss of hearing is the first sign.
Will you clowns keep quiet!

"- Gracias, Padre."
"Now, I think you'll admit... the army presents unique opportunities... that can't be had anywhere else."
That's very true.
What other job lets you die for a living?
Certainly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The army provides a chance to see the world.

"Mrs. Collins, you have a call on our house phone."
It sounded urgent.

She teaches second grade.
You have any enemies?
But before they can find out where she is...
- She's gone missing before.
- Twelve years ago.
"Not only did Sara disappear, but the story did, too."
..they left to find out who she is.
Her name's Nicki Johnson.
12 years ago I asked her to marry me.
I never saw her again.
"Now, the mystery is just beginning to unravel"
It's Jessica.
- Your ex-wife ?
- I don't understand.
They've never met before.
"Jessica Nevins, the Senator's ex-wife is considered a person of interest and investigators are attempting to locate her."
"Daddy, what is it?"
What aren't you telling me?
It's Amanda McNeal.
The wife of Curtis McNeal.
He was the mayor of Atlanta.
"Killed back then, kept on ice until now?"

"I know His Majesty favours you,"
"But if you spew nonsense like that again,"
You won't stay alive even if you had ten heads to spare.
Am I clear?
!
See!
Didn't I tell you to cut down on drinking?
And?
I heard His Majesty hasn't given his word yet
My Lady
If we don't send out reinforcements
Will the Hans cut off our salt supply?
What are we going to do?
I'm journeying to Go-San Nation
Go-San Nation?
Might it be for the salt?
Yes.
Although the trade problem with Han Dynasty has been solved...
His Majesty's worry has not abated
I would like to handle this problem for His Majesty.
"I know you have good intentions, but I heard from your grandfather,"
No one really knows if Go-San Nation has any salt.
Please don't worry
I've met some people from Go-San Nation at BuYeo City
I have confidence.

"It's driving like a dream, Mr Matthews."
"Like most people of genius, Mary had a grand theory."
So...
Thank you.
"Mary spent 20 years trying to model plankton population, so that we could work towards re-seeding the deserted areas of the ocean."
You're talking about fish food.
"Plankton can also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Mr Kingdom."
Re-seed even a fraction of the Pacific and you could stop global warming in its tracks.
- Reverse it.
- Gosh!
Gosh!
That is why Barkway wants to get his hooks into it.
"But, Miss Cramer..."
"Oh, please call me Janet, since you are buying me cakes and everything."
"Janet, all Professor Barkway intends is to publish Mary's research."
Isn't that exactly what she would have wanted?
Don't you think I'm a better judge of that than anyone else?
"So, you're going to publish it yourself?"
How maybe I could have stopped it all
"If I had been braver and said something,"
"Well, that's when all this started."
"I'm sorry, daddy."
I should have said something to you.
Sir.
I've...
I'm so sorry.
"I had a dream last night,"
And in it... :
I saw ev-everything.
Now I know why you did what you did.
"I'm so sorry if I was short with you yesterday,"
So sorry about what happened to arianna...
To you and lily.
For everything.
Thank you.
It's been quite a burden.
The hardest part has been keeping my wife in the dark.
"Unfortunately, it looks like that's..."
No longer an option.
You are gonna come forward?
I don't think I really have a choice.
I should have put it all together sooner.

At ease.
"Now, men, Mr. Jeffries has something important to say to you."
"Boys, I've been managing picture theaters for a long time."
This is the neatest and best-drilled company of ushers I've ever seen.
But some are not measuring up to the necessary standards of discipline that I insist upon.
I won't mention any names.
This is merely a friendly warning that any usher caught chewing gum during the performance of duty will be dismissed.
I also have a report that a certain usher is making a habit of using the men's lavatory on the mezzanine floor for dice and crap games.
This must stop.
I think I've made myself clear.

There are hundreds of Christian camps that minister to thousands of youth every summer.
"Some of these youth have already accepted the truth, but some need direction in their lives."
"By attending camp, we could give 'em that help, by reintroducing them to the blessings of the lord."
Tonight Michelle decided she was gonna share with her brothers and sisters by spiking dinner with several milligrams of ecstasy.
"Dear lord, thank you so much for this food."
- Amen.
- All:
Amen.
Amen.
I feel amazing.
I love you guys.
"We love you, too."

It didn't take long for these happy campers to go from holy rollers...
[Heavy breathing and sighing]

[Laughing] Yeah!

Michelle sat back to enjoy the show.

But she suddenly got a little choked up.

[Laughing] I'm sorry.

"Peter Rickman, age 41."
Accident.
"Brought in late afternoon just after you left for the day, Dr. Stegman."

- I know what he's presenting with.
"I read the papers, Dr. Hook."
How's his nut?
"His ""nut,"" as you say, is banged up."
How severely has yet to be ascertained.
Why don't you run some tests?
I may have to operate later.

Only one person in this department has the right to order an MRI.
And that person is me.
"- Cancel it immediately, please."
- I can't.
What did you say?
It's already happened.
If you'd been in for early rounds...
"I have disliked your attitude for the last six weeks, since I've been here, Dr. Hook."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Dr. Stegman."
You're insubordinate and arrogant.
I'll have your job for this.
"I think that went well, don't you?"
Aren't you worried?
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already.

- Major Dunnett.
It means going a hundred miles into occupied French territory.
"Care to come along, Sharpe?"
- But...
- Good.
"Tomorrow, I go on ahead."
Alone.
"It attracts less attention and gives me a chance to contact my Spanish agents who are searching, too."
"A small special force of Rifles attached to Dunnett's force will travel a day behind, in case I need help."
"That's where you come in, Richard."
Want you to command the sharp shooters
Sir Arthur.
The men you will be commanding must know nothing of this mission in case of capture.
"That is a secret shared between you and your superior officers,"
Major Dunnett and Captain Murray
"Whatever happens, one of you must get through to Casa Antigua."
You'll find them camped about three miles north of here.
They like to live rough.
They expect you at dawn tomorrow.
Give this to Captain Murray.
"Major Dunnett is an officer of the old school, Sharpe."
He may not erm...
He may not approve of my raising an officer from the ranks
"Yes, sir."
He may not erm... mind his manners.
So you must mind yours.
Sir.
"Good luck, Mr Sharpe."

"Hey, can I talk to you about something?"
It's a little awkward.
I know what this is about.
"Given the professional standstill you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching."
Yes.
"And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines."
"Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history."
One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things.
"You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back."
You could have fun with that.
"Yeah, that's not it."

"Oh, of course he is."

Eddie Santos was a pit bull.
"Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid."
What was he doing without backup?
It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down.
He'd never had a problem with him before.
"Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him."
It happens.
Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there?
Because it was his collar.
"He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south."
There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless...

She is my wife and my everything.

Okay.
All right.
"Well, uh, tomorrow night, then."
Absolutely.
Blair.
Hey.
You never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday.
What are you doing?
I could ask you the same question.
Does Serena know you're trying to pull off plaid?
"Seriously, Blair, I expected Chuck"
"To go back to his old habits after your breakup,"
But I'd actually thought you'd grown up a little.
Whatever do you mean?
Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side
Two days in a row?
It pretty much looks like
"You're pretending to be a Columbia student, and not that"
"I care much about what Jenny Humphrey does these days,"
"But I saw that smackdown on ""Gossip Girl."" she was dealing drugs."
It's called an intervention.
"It's called you going back to plotting and conniving,"
"Okay, and that's the Waldorf equivalent"
"Of Chuck going around, sleeping with every call girl in the city"
And avoiding any kind of emotional contact.
Okay.
So I'm pretending to be a student here.
But it's only because I'm living a nightmare.
I was spellbound... but she said it all...
I even tried to get away...
"""but when I looked back, there she was, right in front of me"""
"""Then I smiled and she smiled back;"
"when I took a step, she came along"""
"""Then we became breathless, and a moment stood stilled"""
"And then, we were in love"
That's our love-story
That's our life-story
"3 months, 28 days and 8 hours ago we fell in love"
You're crazy
Why do you drag him everywhere?
He won't leave us alone
What does that mean?
- You're bananas
I'll be home by eight.
"Yes, I'm with Jai."
Brian is also with us
Why talk to your mother like that?
Like how?
So irritably...?
Because she irritates me
"At times, I hate her."
Maybe Because of the familiarity?
"When you're far from home, you realise... what mother means, what a family means"
This monkey is hovering around all the time... particularly when I'm with you
"Yes, because of you"
You're seeing my parents today
After we drop Brian.
Won't take long
Now smile and give an okay

Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
"Hi, Stuart."
"Hi, Sheldon."
Pardon me...
Excuse me...
"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater with a character like Stuart is repellent.
"No offense, Stuart."
None taken.
"Although ""repellent"" is kind of a... kind of a strong word."
"I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
"Um, again..."
"Stuart, please."
You're being rude.
Anything else?
I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
I'm listening.
"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise,"
"I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as ""not my girlfriend."""
Interesting.
Now try it without the quadruple negative.
You're being impossible.
"Hi, Stuart."
Fine.
Amy... will you be my girlfriend?
Yes.
"Well, that's enough of that."
Sorry to interrupt.
"Fredo, you're nothing to me now."
"Not a brother, not a friend."
"I don't want to know you, or what you do."
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
"When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there."
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.
There's more people than at a ballgame in here.
"-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!"
-Frankie Five-Angels...
This committee will come to order!
"-State your name, please."
-Frank PentangeIi.
-Where were you born?
"-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo."
Where do you live now?
I Iive in an army barracks with the FBI guys.
We have here a witness that will further testify to michael corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling.
This witness has had no buffer between himself and michael corleone.
He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against michael corleone.
-Senator.
"-Thank you, Chairman."
Mr. PentangeIi.
Mr. PentangeIi.
Were you a member of the CorIeone family?
"Did you serve under Caporegime, Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather?"
I never knew any Godfather.
I have my own family.
"Mr. PentangeIi, you..."
You are contradicting your own sworn statement.
Heart attack.
Higgins?
Who's playing for Mrs. Blackmore?
"Well, no one."
The funeral's today.

What a strange little man.
[ Magnum Narrating ] I really had to hand it to Higgins.
"In less than an hour, he'd dug up four articles on Caine, gassed the Ferrari and packed a lunch."
"After bridge tomorrow, Zeus and Apollo might be having me for lunch."
But until then--
Caine's life was a Horatio Alger story.
"Orphaned at birth, he ran away to sea at 1 4, sailed freighters until the war, then enlisted."
He fought in Europe and was decorated for bravery twice.
"After the war, law school on the G.I. Bill and a lucrative practice in New York and so on, until he was nominated for the Supreme Court."
[ Engine Revving ]
All the articles read the same:
Robert Caine was an amazing man.
"I wasn't sure a brief marriage to a prostitute who disappeared 40 years ago... was going to do him any real damage, even if it did leak."
Not with his record.
But I couldn't help feeling there was more to it than that.
Right on time.
Have you found her?
"Let's go for a ride, Mr. Caine."
[ Engine Revving ]
Well?
I haven't found her yet.
"Well, where are we going?"
"On the phone, you led me to believe--"
That I had a lead?

' Tangakl
Morning to dawn
Give it to Zahireh_
Go ahead.
Did Zaer Kheder allow you to play Kettledrum?
I don't understand.
How you don't understand?
Didn't you go to talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder'?
I said I don't get it.
I said I don't get it.
So don't talk about Tangak anymore.
If I'm going to go to Tangak there is nothing related to Zaer Kheder regarding my decision to go to Tangak_
So what?
My decision of going to Tangak is separate from bringing the cradle.
I have to go to Tangak_
Say it again please!
How there was no word of tangak before yesterday?
Now we are talking about it!
I've decided to go there and I will.
"Mr. Bashirou, did you think if you go to another city, you'll become a real man?"
We have been faced so many problems because of Tangak's people.
"They forced your father to move in to Bushehr, don't you remember?"
Why are you silent?
"It was because of you and Hanieh that my father had to move in to Bushehr and put Zaer Kheder in trouble, but now for you and Hanieh I have to go to Tangak_"
Tangak's people will put you in trouble my little son.
- You can't survive.
- How can they put me in trouble?
They are unable to confront me.
I am so tough-skinned_
"Be damned to you and your rag, sir."
My Rifles march at dawn.
"South, sir."
"Good night, Miss."

Comandante Teresa whom believe you've already met
I want you to seize the chapel of Torrecastro and hold it against all-comers until Major Vivar has raised the gonfalon of Sant'lago over the chapel roof.
Seize Torrecastro?
With six men and a straggle of Spaniards?
It can't be done.
"May I remind you of our main mission, sir?"
- To find a missing gentleman
"- Not now, Richard."
Our mission is Torrecastro.
Spain is a sleeping tiger.
"If the people of Torrecastro rise up, even for an hour, the shock will shake the whole of Spain."
"- Carry on, sir."
- Rise p?
"Do you really believe men will fight and die for a rag on a pole, sir?"
"You do, Richard."
You do.
Richard!
I knew you would not march to Torrecastro for a superstition.
I'm like you.
"I don't believe in virgins or holy candles, but I believe in Spain."
I had to choose between Spain and Richard Sharpe.
- I had no choice!
- You did your duty.
Now I must do mine.
Just try and understand.
Excuse me!
I'll just come.
I can't kill her.
And when she return Bhai's diamond then why?
"I think electricity has gone, Papa."
Shits!
"It's will be back tomorrow, Papa."
Don't you have Inverter?
What?
Don't you have Inverter?
"Papa, he's challenging you, I'll turn on the inverter."
"Papa, forget about electricity and kill him with bomb."
"I am not that Laxminarayan, It must some another Laxmi."
Have you gone mad?
That Laxminarayan lives in my hotel.
"I saw him, you leave me Sir."
It's about my job.
No.
Not at all.
"There's another Laxminarayan, May be he lives in Room No. 504"
"I am not that Laxminarayan, He must be that under garments dealer."
If you lied to me then...
You're saying like I'll say something and you will follow me.
"Sir, do what you want,"
"Marveles Idea,"
"Come, show me, where is that another Laxminarayan?"
"Papa, You take the tie, who will take the tie man?"
"Don't worry,"
"If you want stuff then you have to show your stuff, and business happens like this, I think you don't know about business."
"I am in business from 40 years,"
"I will stop if you show me the stuff, Yes or No."
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Sally, then we'll get back to your tests."
"Well, excuse me, Doctor,"
Sally have you ever seen those two clowns before?
"So help me, Judy, you've seen the last banana in your life, you two-timing little rat!"
"When we get you back to Wameru, you'll get solitary confinement in a cage."
The second I get my hands free
I'm gonna wallop the daylights outta you.
(SCREECHING)
Sally!
"Captain, Sergeant, quick, before she gets lost."
"Hey, Captain, get these ropes off us."
We'll help you find her.
After what you threatened?
You'd probably kill her.
"Hey, there she is."
Judy.
Come here.
(CHATTERING)
- Come on.
"- Come on, Judy."
That's a good girl.
Now come on.
Untie these ropes.
"Come on, Judy, get these ropes off."
"No, Judy, you're not the world-famous astro-chimp."
"You're just plain, old-fashioned, smart-aleck Judy from Wameru."
"For Pete's sake, Judy, you're not Sally."
"Sally is obviously an intelligent, superior, well-behaved animal, and you're just a spoiled little brat."
"Jack, do you suppose something has happened to Judy and she really believes she's Sally?"
She could be suffering from some kind of nervous disorder.
The only thing she's suffering from is a sense of misplaced grandeur.
It looks like an intramuscular injection.
Absolutely alone.
I repeat my question:
Were you really alone last night?
Are you sure?
You had invited anyone?
Mathilde!
Mathilde.
"For whatever reason, you could have poisoned your patron."
And then deceived us by injecting it into yourself.
A soporific.
All this is not clear and I am obliged to place you under arrest.
Until you decide to tell us the truth.
But I am innocent.
I said all I knew.
You may enjoy explaining it to the Judge.

"Put them over there, thank you."
"Hello, Fandor!"
"Interesting, that paper of yours on the Norvins St. case."

And say so ...
Couldn't you push a little further?
"They have no adventures, these people?"
Adventures?
"Yes, you could write a scandalous article about the Baroness de Vibray and Dollon."
"After all, this is the only crime for 48 hours."
We must fill up the column.
And maybe you could drag some Fantomas in all this.

"The interesting thing about Alan Ladd was he was only, like, four foot three, but it was all his legs that were short."
"Like, his trunk was normal."
"- Sat down, he was taller than most people."
- Is that true?
Good heavens.
"But when he stood, yeah, they had to put him on a little apple crate."
I never know with you.
That's what's so worrying.
"- No, it's absolutely true."

Here they come.
"- Oh, I'm screwed."
- Don't panic.
The Earl has to introduce his people to you.
Just pay attention and repeat what he says.

"Chief magistrate Martin Portreeve, lieutenant colonel Rodson Heathcote-Drummond, the honorable Martin Gled-heweson, bishop of Lichfield, lord keeper of the privy seal Lemonde Oswolf-sticket."
"Everyone, please welcome the Earl of Cleveland."
"And with him plaidsy, war man, churchie, and..."

"Oh, you look so beautiful."

You gave her away to secure your rule.

Is she learning our language?
We are studying my Paşa.
But she's not that keen
You'll learn our language quickly
How much did you pay for me?
We have got lots of golds.
I'll give you as much as you want
Just let me go
I understand your anger.
But think twice before talking
Because
You are neither talking to a merchant nor a pirate
Were you ever captured?
I'm grieving
I'm miserable
I don't know what to do or what to think
Nobody treats me bad here
But I treat everyone badly
Anything I want is done.
"Dish, drinks"
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm a prisoner
I request you to release me
I realised it is not happening.
But at least let me walk in the yard
"I want to breathe, walk and ride a horse"
Don't tell me you couldn't manage it
Did you find it?
I told you I would bring it
Did anyone see you?
I took it when everyone was in the yard
Of course.
My wife is a savage woman
- I know this region like the back of my hand
- It's this bone right here
It hurts so much when you press it
Right here?
Ah!
Easy!
Here!
Have a drink!
No more wine for us please.
We can't afford it
It's alright
This one's on me
You're indeed a beautiful serpent
Every day I carry those damn logs without getting paid properly
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds look down on me
We're losing our hunting grounds and you still keep the hounds to look down on you?
Look!
Those are the trees that used to watch over our ancestors
This is how they end up
"Strange thing is, why so many constructions?"
What?
Not only do you befriend us with wine but you speak our language fluently
Hey!
It's going to rain
- Stop drinking and go home!
"- Good morning, sir!"
"Good morning, Mr. Policeman"
You've worked all day long for such a mean wage and you waste it on wine?
What else can we do with so little money?
"Yeah, right!"
"All right, people, let's learn something."
"Carter, how do you check for spinal cord injury on an unconscious patient?"
- Look for absence of tendon reflexes.
- Do it.
Poor little thing.
"- Harper, what film do we want first?"
- Chest?
I'll do a cross-table lateral to rule out a C-spine fracture.
Deep tendon reflexes are present bilaterally.
Babinski is normal.
"Harper, let's talk head trauma."
What study should we do?
"- Come on, Harper."
Pay attention.
"- Pressure's falling, 50/30."
What do you hear?
Diminished breath sounds on the right?
I appreciate air movement bilaterally.
No pneumo.
"- No, that's upper airway sounds."
- I see a tracheal shift to the left.
- So do I.
- Tension pneumo.
Good call.
I'll teach you how to do a needle decompression.
"Carter, run the blood up to the lab."
Our new Urgent Care Facility could use someone like you.
- Urgent Care's a smart move.
- Most emergencies are run-of-the-mill stuff.
"Sprained ankles, croup, concussions...."
You'll spend most of your time on ear infections and well-baby checkups.
Private practice is changing.
What do you mean?
You have to pay the remaining six thousand dollars before you can have your license
Six thousand more?
Of course
"Give me back the money, I'm not buying it"
"Well, then all that will cover the administrative costs lf everyone came in like you and messed about, how can we run a business here?"
Country bum
How come you puke just after a short car ride?
Are you alright?
Luckily I haven't bought it
"Otherwise, you can't enjoy it"
Come down
"Hey, you..."
Damn
What happened?
What are you doing?
Stand still
You want your money back?
Here I'm sure to have my money back
And along with some administrative fee
Thank you
Hey
Don't you know me?
I am Choi Ha ls it really you?
Yes I couldn't have recognized you if you hadn't call me
Let me look at you
Well?
You are pretty
Just put on more make-up to make yourself pretty
Money is for spending l heard that you've got married
Are you going to be a mother soon?
Really?
How about that carpenter?
He treats me well
"But he wants a son, and I want an id card"
"When he got a son, and I get my id card"
He won't force me to be with him
He might even give me some money then I can do whatever I want
What do you want to do anyway?
I want to go to Taiwan
Then what do you want to do in Hong Kong?
Me?
"I want to be rich I want to earn a lot of money, and enjoy myself"
Can't you be rich in Thailand?
If I could would I have come to Hong Kong?
Then are you rich yet?
Do you know how to become rich?
"I know Hung Fist, and have learnt Thai Boxing too lf l combine the 2 styles they are no match to me"
"Just wait and see, I will win"
Does it hurt?
Do you feel the pain?
"This is Ah Mut Sha, your opponent"
He's testing the power of his opponent
"Watch out for his elbow, he's quick"
"He's Chan Kam Kong, represented Hong Kong last time"
His punches are powerful
Have you seen his knee attacks?
Very lethal
Within one round
"One, two, three, four"
Again
Catch it
"Lousy Japanese stuff, hardly used it for over a day"
Save some money
- What'd she say?
- Garcia says this looks like a list of additives needed to weaponize anthrax.
Could they get enough anthrax?
"The letter sent to senator Tom Daschle's office in 2002 only contained two grams of purified spores, enough to kill 25 million people if effectively distributed."
Are you willing to have a chat with me?
Go ahead.
Gideon.
Let's chat.
He's from Egypt.
Cairo.
- You sure?
"- No, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian."
What type of name is Gideon?
American.
"I often forget that in your culture, you put your country first and your god last."
"Sir, he was born and raised in egypt."
"They pronounce ""J"" sounds as a ""G""."
You don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?
Egyptian.
"In two minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in two months."
"They and I have... very, very different motives and methodologies."
And yet your country relies on them to protect you from us.
Sometimes they're their own worst enemy.
Yeah.
"Who is your worst enemy, agent Gideon?"
It's not a who.
It's a what.
Ignorance.
You're a very honest man.
And you?
"Must have become a hafez by what,"
- age 10?
ABBY:
Welcome to AUTEC and the surrounding areas of the Caribbean.
What is this?
The Bermuda Triangle.
And an ode to my inner mapper.
I'm marking the site of each and every amazing thing that happened here.
"Well, you can't just say that and not give us a little taste."
I wouldn't dream of it.
"Okay, so this bullet marks where the USS Cyclops vanished in the Triangle, and this bullet is the Bimini Wall."
It's a possible location for Atlantis.
"And this bullet, Gibbs, this is the Tongue of the Ocean."
"It's like an underwater Grand Canyon, and we think that AUTEC is running cables down more than 6,000 feet."
To what we don't know.
"Any of these bullets have a point, Abbs?"
The bullet that killed Ridgeway.
I traced that back to a company called Vita Foras.
Vita Foras.
It's Latin.
Rough translation:
"""Great Outdoors."""
I'd guess we're looking at hunting weapons?
You would guess right.
"More specifically, extremely rare hunting rifles, the kind that crazy hard-core collectors would trade."
Hard to track.
Exactly.
"Love your triangle, Abbs."
I...
I just have to ask.
You're in the business of proving things with science.
Why this need to chart the unexplainable?
"Wait, you're in my head, right?"
I'm just going to answer you in my thoughts.
"Hey, sharing is a virtue"
This is a world of efficiency
"Only those fast enough can live, stupid!"
Y es!
"Come, take some soup!"
Your leftover!
We've tasted every bone!
Now you can have the most original taste!
"Brother Jin, you must be hungry"
T ake this first
I don't feel like eating
"I'm sorry, I did want to bring you some food"
"But all those nasty brothers, they were so fast in clearing up all dishes, leaving you only this"
This one is untouched!
I really don't feel like eating
You're deeply hurt and haven't eaten for days
Your stomach will hurt.
"Come, for my sake"
"T ake this bowl of rice, come!"
I'll get you some tea
Your brothers fight for food?
They say this is a world of efficiency
Only those fast enough can live!
You must be the slow one!
"I'm the junior, they always bully me"
"Every meal I only have rice with soup, no food"
It's better than what I have now!
So original!
"Y es, that's called the original taste"
Rice has it's own taste!
Isn't it?
My Master said... your Kung Fu technique is stunning
Love you!
And you!
"In polite society,"
One telephones ahead before trespassing.
I imagine strange women traipsing through the property
Isn't a completely unusual occurrence.
That's a fair point.
What brings you here?
My landlady gave me an idea.
"Why, now if we could get an opinion from your butcher..."
Someone robbed howard's impenetrable vault.
"If I can find out how he got in,"
Perhaps I can trace where he went
And locate howard's missing technology.
"You're not really dressed for it, I'm afraid."
Our thief didn't exactly walk the items out of the front door.
"The night of the break-in, did you hear anything?"
There was a tremendous thunderstorm.
"It knocked the power out, including the alarms,"
For almost two hours.
Not that I would have heard any of it.
I'm afraid the sultry combination
Of candlelight and rain always puts me out like a baby.
Hmm.
You're quite the guard dog.
Security is not within my purview.
Sousa:
Ssr.
Open up.
Unbelievable.
A known fugitive isn't answering his door.
Knock harder.
I would've expressed my love for you...
Still I'm found at fault...
Is that my mistake?
"When you come after me, I feel angry..."
"When I don't see you around, I go mad about you..."
My heart rages in fire...
Time has no medicine to cure my heart...
"You fight with your conscious everyday, dear..."
What will your arrogance achieve?
Nothing wrong to accept your love...
"Stop fighting, sweetheart..."
Don't you like my arrogance?
"Daddy, I want to talk you urgently."
I'm in an important meeting.
Talk to me later.
No dad.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
They have come there on an official visit.
The clue 'LOSER' was given to me on November 9th.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
"So, he already knew about Ministers programme."
There is some link between their programme  his plan.
What are these Ministers doing in Malaysia?
Ministers are planning something unofficial here.
"Banerjee, we earned 300 crores cheating people  doing all the wrong deeds."
We struggled had to turn this money into dollars.
Your 300 crores is the first investment for the hotels we are going to start.
Big money will change hands.
He has come here to rob that money.
"If he had come here months before, he must've planned it well."
He must've planned a game.
There is a link between Ministers  my uncle.
With beautiful costumes and a full orchestra.

"What do you think of it now, Tyler?"
"Uh, shouldn't Miss Chummy appear for Mr. Tyler's benefit?"
"You see, uh, Judge Peterby owns a small piece of the show."
"I've contributed, not only in the shape of money but also in the shape of, uh, Miss Chummy."
- Like it?
- It looks pretty good.
We have enough capital for a good show but we wanna put on a great show.
"Your 15,000 would allow us to do it."
"Hmm, well, I feel it needs certain changes."
"Now, the Bill Robinson number."
"I think if you played that in a street in Harlem, you'd get more out of it."
"Good idea, we'll use it."
Right Grady?
Right.
Miss Chummy brings a new personality into the theater.
"Uh, my advice would be to accept the boys' generous offer, Tyler."
"You don't have to sell me, Commodore."
"All I wanna know is, will I have a voice in the production?"
"As a partner, you'll have as much to say as Grady and myself."
"They've adopted a little idea of mine, Tyler."
"- Well, she hasn't."
"The guidance system malfunctioned at the point of re-entry, so instead of the Atlantic Ocean,"
- she may well be in this area.
- (MARSH):
Are you sure?
The American consulate in Nagoro just radioed me.
I've been out alerting all the village chiefs.
"Well, having been on a lunar orbit,"
"I'd say that at this moment,"
Sally is the world's most valuable chimp.
(SCREECHES)
"As soon as she's found, she has to be given a very complete examination."
"Now, the American consulate in Nagoro is sending out a truck with a military and scientific attaché, but they don't know the area as well as we do."
"Poor thing, she might've been injured in the landing."
Or what about possible attack by another animal in the bush?
"Uh, she has to be in an exhausted condition, so wherever she is she's in serious jeopardy."
"Mike, get me a dart rifle from the truck."
- Mmm.
"- Hedley, I'll go with you."
- Good.
"- Jack, you and Mike take a look down by the river."
"And, Paula, you stick right here by the radio."
(JUDY CHATTERING)
"Look, Judy, come on now."
This is no time for fun and games.
Come on.
Get over there.
"Go on, scoot."
(ENGINE STARTS)
(SCREECHING)
"Come on, Judy, we have work to do."
You heard the Daktari.
Jesus.
What if I fall asleep and all the good stuffs taken away instead?
They'd have to find it first.
"I am your superior, you know that?"
"Harry, why don't you just stop gambling?"
"Look, I have patches for my addictions."
They have patches for porn?
Why are you really here?
You're making my girls nervous.
I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau.
Why has he called in my debt?
- Belshazzar was the king of Babylon.
- Here we go.
A man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends.
Just like Freddie Lau?
"One evening, he holds a fabulous feast for them all."
"But during the feast, Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall."
- It predicts...
- Belshazzar's own death.
"So, what, you're saying that someone's threatening to kill Freddie Lau?"
Why else would Lau be planning to sell up and leave London?
"Ah, come on, Kaleem."
Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out.
You're not telling me something.
"Come on, leave now."
I have to watch my girls like a hawk.
"Oh, did that um..."
missing stripper of yours ever turn up?
- What was her name?
- Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday.
- Matched her description.
I might have questions for you later.
"(Horn Honking, People Chattering)"
"Passports, please."
You came to French Morocco four days ago?
That's right.
"You are a doctor, sir?"
"Yes, I'm a surgeon, a tourist and American citizen."
Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
- l didn't have.
- (Bicycle Bell Ringing)
You were in Paris recently?
"Yes, I was attending a medical convention."
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.
You had an aperitif with him in your hotel room.
You ate at the same restaurant last night.
"Yes, but at different tables."
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him for the first time yesterday on a bus.
"And yet, out of 5,000 people in a great marketplace, he comes to you when he is about to die."
is that the action of a casual acquaintance?
I know absolutely nothing about Louis Bernard.
"Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau."
The
- What's that?
Perhaps you have also never heard of the American fbi?
"Now, wait. I - lt would be so much easier for both of us if you would cease to pretend."
Look here -
The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover.
That's why he was killed.
He told you what he had discovered.
Why?
Because he placed complete confidence in you.
I said ifs not Zaer Kheder's order
You will go neither to Zaer Kheder nor to Tangak_ That's it!
"So, sorry to disturb you, Bashirou's mommy."
- It's early to leave.
"- I leave, I have something to do."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye
- Don't bother yourself.
- Please.
"It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
What did you say?
"- It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
- Don't talk nonsense.
Did you look at yourself?
"They forced your father to drive out of Tangak, they did it to me."
"What the hell are you going to do there, as a baby boy?"
You are a little boy.
Are you such a man to go to Tangak?
So?
Donkey work!
"Pottering, minor works and difficulties are for mine and playing Ketfledrum for the others'."
Just you tell me is it fair?
"Bashirou, tell me definitely how much?"
"- Playing Kettledrum, definitely."
"- No, ifs not the way."
From morning to dawn.
You are headstrong like your father
"Obstinate, dogged, inflexible, tough."
"If I wasn't headstrong, how could I play Kettledrum till dawn?"
Ashoura is perennial; ifs not going to be finished this year.
"Next year, God willing."
"Don't say God willing, Zaer or say it in the way means ""yes""."
"""He was shirtless, and he was ripped,"
"""and he was carrying a bow and arrow."
"""And he saw me with Crackle,"
"""and he thought I was in danger."
"""And he shot Crackle through the heart."
"""And I cried and said,"
"""'You don't know what you're doing!"
'
"""But shooting the dragon through the heart"
"""is what we needed to get back to reality."
"""So we landed back in the library."
"""And the old white man returned to his job"

"And that's why I don't like white people."""

"I eventually asked my mom about it, and I was way off."
Way off.
"My parents named me Sasheer, which is hard for some people to pronounce, which I get."
"There's two ""S""s in there."
So...
"One's a ""sss,"" one's a ""shh."""
"So it's like, ""What do we do?"""
And the people who get my name wrong the most are white people.
And I don't want to make it a race thing.
But...
Numbers are in.
Studies have shown that the demographic that consistently gets my name wrong are Caucasian.
"I did this show once, and the host was white, and probably still is."
And...
She could not get my name for the life of her.
Kept saying things like Shasheer or Saheer and moving letters around in my name and attacking it like a Sudoku puzzle.
If you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins...
And you're short 2 sen on a bill of Y130
How many of each denomination did you have?
What is it?
"Fujio's homework, from yesterday"
He's starting junior high this year
The preliminaries are so complicated
And if I can't do the work he's been set...
It kept me up till 2 a.m
Working on this?
Yes.
"Go on, solve it"
Thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins 2 sen short on a bill of Y130
Forget it.
It's our cross to bear
Wait.
If you call it X...
You can't do it like that!
No using algebra
A total of 32 coins...
And no using real coins!
Right!
I've got it!
"It just takes patience No, that's wrong too"
You don't have to get upset about it
They don't do this in junior
If you could do it you'd say they do
Couldn't the doctor find me a tutor?

I simply can't do it myself Please ask him
You worry too much
I don't really care who just so long as he's clean

"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- Just a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."

"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.
Carol.
He wants to do the thing.

"Mr. President, it isn't a good idea to deviate from the flight plan."
"Pretty please, Carol?"
"Leader of the free world saying ""pretty please""?"
That ought to count for something.
"Captain Johns, we are going to deviate from Route Omaha."
The president would like to do the thing.
Copy that.

Do you know that Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president who was in favour of women having the vote?
He wrote a paper on suffrage while he was still in the Illinois legislature.
"Yes, I did know that because you tell me every time we do this."

"We are short Foxtrot, one minute out."
- I need a go-no go.

Just because Cody answered one rescue call doesn't mean he's part of the team.

Galactic showdown!
"In a fierce battle for survival, the Republic and separatist armies have clashed in the distant Sullust system."
"Count Dooku's most cunning assassin, Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack."

Lord Tyranus.
My master.
There is a disturbance in the force.
"Your assassin, she has become very powerful."
I understand.
Perhaps you could make your operative aware of our concerns.
Blackmire has a very sophisticated counter-surveillance program.
George Browne is an ex-CIA agent.
"If you have an operative in there, they will be exposed."
You don't have anything to be concerned about.
I don't have an operator in any kind of direct exposure.
Good to hear.
"If you could call me tomorrow, after you've spoken to your superiors,"
I'd appreciate it.
You can reach me any time.
Thank you.
I'll be giving you a call in the morning.
- Good night.
- A pleasure.
Likewise.
Call Julianna immediately and tell her she's not going on her trip with George Browne.
Anything I can do?
Call the FBI and start screaming.
They've been sharing our intel with the CIA.
It's Inspector Spalding.
I've had a visit from the CIA regarding our Blackmire operation requesting we drop it.
Please advise me what course to take.
She's not answering.
Is there wire on Julianna still up?
Is Julianna at her place?
She's just leaving with Browne.
- There they go.
- You got everything?
And that's it.

- That's not fair.
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year...
"Let me tell you something, Stephanie."
"Maybe you don't know how babies are made, because when people are trying, they know they're trying!"

"For most of Tutankhamun's reign, the real power was wielded from behind the throne by a military council run by the young king's advisor, Ay."
"But when Tutankhamun reached the age of 18, he would have claimed his inheritance to rule Egypt as a divine pharaoh."
The king's newfound power would not last long.
"In his tenth year on the throne, Tutankhamun died."
Exactly why remains a mystery.
"Some believe he was murdered by his own advisors, or perhaps he just had an accident."
Examination of his body using modern scientific techniques showed a leg injury which could have been fatally infected.
Tutankhamun was still a teenager.
And lift!
"Lift slowly, very slowly."

"- Afternoon, Carter."
Where have you been?
- Packing.
I have to go to Cairo.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- I've had a telegram.
Carnarvon is ill.
- Nothing serious I hope.
- I rather think it is.
"I would havejoined the Party gladly, but I've been baptised. I'm a believer."

-Will this show start soon?
"-Yes, pretty soon."
I used to feel the sniper's look on my spine during the Finnish campaign.
The feeling made us freeze.
Although they paid more attention to officers.
We soldiers were less alluring forthem.
"Listen, it seems to me that my dad was buried in the vicinity ofthis hill."
-What made you make such a guess?
"- The place is called Zabolotye, isn't it?"
-Yes.
- This is where he was killed during World War I.
"Afellow villager came back from that war and told us that it happened near a city of Kaza, a marsh, a small river."
Everything seems to fit the description.
I neverthought I'd find his grave.
"And if it is true, eh?"
The family's fate has brought me to this hill...
There are a few mortar squads to the south ofthese pines.
The distance is about 400 meters.
"No, it looks more like 500."
5 machine gun slots 30 meters awayfrom the hillock

"OK, Germans, show more to us!"

Major Hogan
- meet Mr Sharpe.
- Congratulations.
"Capital choice, sir."
The minute I saw him I looked.
"Hogan says ""Aye that fellow don't seem much but he's a natural-born officer """
"Of course, you know, Sir Arthur, he'll need a mentor."
"Hogan, you keep your hands off him."
Hogan is an officer on...
- Ahem!
- On my staff.
Your colonel will be informed.
I'll request light duties till his wound be healed
Good day to you both.
"Light duties, sir."
Light duties it is.
Absolutely.
"See here, Sharpe."
Light duties means staying at headquarters and being snubbed by snobs.
How would you like me to find you something else?
"As long as it's safe, sir."
That's my boy.
So the bankers won't budge?
"Afraid not, Sir Arthur."
We need to find Rothschild.
I'd like to suggest we add that fellow Sharpe to Dunnett's search party.
I make a man an officer today and you want me to send him into the mountains tomorrow.
"- Have you no heart, Hogan?"
"- No, sir."
"We need somebody to command Dunnett's sharpshooters, and Sharpe will be much happier up in the mountains than up in the mess."
"You know the problem, Sir Arthur."
What do you got?
Three people came in and went directly to a cage or table and cashed in $100 chips.
"One of those people, I would definitely call him a person of interest."
You know what I mean?
No.
His name's Ben Hollis.
No record.
But you remember Sean... who got her counterfeit chip from the guy she hooked up with-Alex.
"If you keep tracking Ben, like I did, you get to this."
Ben giving Alex a stack of phony chips.
Interesting coincidence.
Okay.
Find him.

What about those chip-making machines?
All five machines outside Vegas are accounted for.
"One was recently sold and is in transit from New Jersey to California, but the buyer says he's been checking with the driver every day."

"I got the driver's number, called him and verified the location of the cell- westbound I-70, just this side of the Eisenhower Tunnel."
"Yes, but cellphone calls can be rerouted."
You get any specs on the rig?
"Yes, upstairs."

There is no dilemma!
"You're absolutely right, Mrs John."

"Well, he'll be in for a surprise, right, Mrs John?"
Don't blow your smoke in my child's face!
Don't be surprised then if your child still looks like a seven month-old one.
That is not due to my smoking!
"That's all down to his father, that blue-blooded weakling who tried to prove that I couldn't bring up a child!"

Have you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment?
Has there been a burglary?
"No, no, no, nothing like that."
I just wondered if...
"You know, if... you noticed anything unusual lately?"
Unusual?
"Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike."
I am sorry to disturb you so late.
Good night.
What we know is this:
One:
Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.
Two:
Miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off.
"Three: the mill suddenly activates, catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this."
What's the fucking point?
"These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik."
Our job is to investigate these events from every possible angle...
So that we might prevent their recurrence.
So we'd appreciate it if you would be a bit more co-operative.
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.
"What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?"
I was distracted.
By what?
What distracted you?
"It was Ivan, I was watching Ivan on the pit."
"The whole thing is my fault, okay."
When did that happen?
In the womb would be my guess.
Any chance we may bump into your old coworkers?
"Or even Wendy, perhaps?"
Wendy and I decided to leave it alone for now.

They said they found him this way.

Doc?
Abrasions on his hands and face indicate the possibility of a fight which was ended by this single stab wound.

"That's it, Tony?"
Only one word?
No wisecracks about wayward sailors on shore leave?

I understand that sailors often refer to this liberty as their annual beer-and-crabs week.
"Alfred, find the earthquakes."
Listen to me.
What kind of place is that?
That is an underground plutonium processing plant.
Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes
"Well, I didn't count on killing anybody."

It will never go that far.

-We need money
"-Off course, Im sorry."
We leave on friday
-Friday?
What about the consert?
"-No, it...."
We were supposed to go together.
"Im going to check if we can pospone it, so that Lise get to go on the consert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, im just beeing stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about the friday?
Do you know anyone that make it be postponed?
"Have it done till tomorrow, Then we pospone until sunday"
-Sorry
-Tronstad?
-Have you got a minut?
"-Yes, what is it about?"
How sure are we?
How far are they with the bomb?
Any new information i have not got?
We're never sure.
We know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr an schetch-
"-That we thought showed a bomb, This was likely an reactor"
"But if you have an reactor you can make plutonium, if you have plutonium you can make a bomb."
"We do not know if heisenberg did it as a warning, help - 69 00:09:57.200 -- 00:09:59.600 - or just to impress"
"Therefor we have to sink the shipment, Cause we just dont know"
"Heisenberg sees heavy water as essential for his research, that we know..."
"The case is, we are afraid."

"Oh, my God."
Let me have a mirror.
This is how I always look.
What we have here is another case... of a patient being diagnosed improperly.
He was suffering from third-degree burns... but there isn't any scar tissue anywhere.
Any real doctor might assume that this is... a rare case of the Stromburg theory... where badly burned tissue has an adverse reaction... causing the tissue to heal.
- Wrong!
Wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
Wrong.
"The Stromburg theory states... that minor burns could heal under stress, not third-degree."
"Look in the book... page 294, 3rd paragraph, middle of the page."
- He's right.
- Thank you.
Dr. Jones wrong.
He don't know what he talkin' about.
You really should reread chapter fourteen.
Chapter fourteen?
"Please, tell us why."
"In chapter fourteen, he starts out talking about..."
What was I saying again?
"Thank you very much for your medical tips, Mr. Reed."
I just want to run a few more tests... and you may leave whenever you're ready.
"Oh, no, Mrs. Johnson."
"They just called me, and I..."
"Yeah, basically there's a really fit bloke"

"Well, I'd like to introduce you to everybody."
"So, what did you think of Mr. Austin Howard, then?"
Um...

Charlestown needs a makeover.

- Thirty-six holes and...
- Twenty-five orphans without a home.
Who let him in?
Anyone?
He works for me.
I thought he should hear what you have planned for his home.
- Of course.
"- By all means, please continue."
"Yes, do."
"To survive hard times like these, we all have to make sacrifices."
Those making the biggest sacrifices are the boys at Newman.

"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes."
"My dream is simple, folks."
"I want to help the orphans and create a new Charlestown full of life, energy and growth potential."

"By shipping us off to dangerous big-city homes where kids have tattoos, piercings, and, God forbid, Facebook?"

Somers wanted me to be ready to file an injunction this morning restraining a man named Norstaad from any future acts of violence and/or interference.
And also to put a private detective on the trail of one Latham Reed.
"I didn't take the case, though."
Too busy.
Who's Reed?
"Some building contractor that Somers said may have made off with a certified check for $50,000."

Yesterday afternoon.
"Oh, there's Anderson now."
If you'll excuse me.
Certainly nice to have seen you both.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

It cannot be that you have not heard from her in all this time.
You must tell me where--
Have I interrupted you?
"Please, Mr. Mason."
Why do you not leave like I tell you?
"Well, it seemed obvious you didn't want to talk in front of Lt. Anderson."
But I do not need you.
"Axel, what happened between you and Somers yesterday that caused him instruct his attorney to file an injunction against you?"
"Oh, that."

Ballistics from the police lab confirm  the wayward bullet that killed the boy came from Zapatti's gun...
"Here you are, Mr. Zapatti."
Michael find Vinnie.
I want to have a little talk with him.
"Yesterday, on the corner of Broadway  and Marcy Street, gunfire broke out  claiming 6-year-old James Bone  along with 21-year-old Tino Zapatti  a convicted felon on probation  and a 32-year-old police detective, Eddie Santos."
The Police Commissioner has disclosed  that an investigation is underway into Santos' activities.
Question:
What was Santos doing with a drug dealer  wanted for probation violations?
Good morning.
It will raise serious questions of corruption in the courts.
"Stern gave Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer  probation instead of sending him to prison."
The question everyone is asking  because of this unusual disposition  is why did the judge do that?
"Good morning, Mrs. Santos."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
- It's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
"New testimony will be provided by Harris' 17-year-old stepdaughter, Amy."
"... first-degree murder, which could result in a sentence..."
Such a nice couple.
"We really thought they""d make it."
I thought so.
We prayed for them.
Why did all of America become so obsessed with the Clara Harris story?
"Because it happened to a middle-class, dual-income, respectable family."
"Because it happened in the suburbs, where good people like you and me live."
Because if a sickness can grow inside the Harris family... are any of us really immune?
We all know...
Clara received the maximum sentence:
20 years in prison.
David's own parents forgave Clara.
They begged the judge for leniency.
The woman prosecutor used this argument to convict:
Why didn't Clara Harris do what every other woman in her situation does?
Take her husband to the cleaners.
Divorce David?
Take him to the cleaners?
"I'm sorry, but that woman missed the boat entirely."
Clara didn't want a divorce.
Clara Harris was in a life-and-death fight for her family.
Her survival instincts kicked in.

My home is your home.
"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain."
We're trapped here.
I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby.
"Yes, but according to my observations,"
I didn't think you capable of such voyages.
"Notice the period, Captain."
900 light-years from Earth.
It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.
"Ah, yes."
You complain to the collector?
Face the consequences
The roads are in poor condition in our area
Why do you place the tar barrels at my door?
Didn't you ask for roads?
Next month will get stone pebbles....
Will the stork eat the fish?
Or will the fish eat the stork?
Man will eat both....
-What do you want now?
-I want Arul now
Why does the Satan riding the cycle ask for the cockroach riding the bike?
I must get Arul now
To get grace go to the temple Or do a fire walk
-I will walk upon you
-Should not talk like that
I will talk like that only
Won't you respect your brother?
You call yourself a brother
Who said you are my brother?
Look at his ugly face They have named a tin as 'Gold'....
"Sir, are there no female members here?"
-Swarnam
-Yes coming
What do you want?
We have moved to your opposite house
We are doing house warming today
All of you must come
I may not be able to come why don't you go and attend?
Mom said a senior like you should conduct the Pooja
OK we will come
Why do you look through a lens?
"Mrs. Gower, a person may invite police officers into an apartment or residence... if that person has common right of entry, which you do, Mrs. Gower."
"You got any idea when he gets home, where he goes after work?"
"Not on Thursday, but on Wednesdays and Fridays, he's got some kind of a meeting, 8:00."
"Sometimes after work he comes home, falls asleep."
I knock on his door for him at 7.30.
[Saperstein] What kind of meeting?
Boy Scouts.
Who knows?
He's a quiet guy.
No trouble at all.
Saperstein.
Yeah.
Call the lieutenant.
Tell him to get in touch with a Dr. Irene Benton at this hospital.
"I'm going down to Hudson Hardware, get the owner and go through the place."
- Stake yourself out here.
"If Zucco shows, nail him."
- Okay.
Bobby.
"Danny first came here five months ago, Lieutenant."
- And the bombings started about a month later.
- But he's getting better in the group.
"In the beginning, the arguments, the violent emotions practically made him pass out."
"The others laughed at him, sympathized with him, attacked him."
"But they never excluded him, and that was the key."
Danny's not half as afraid of emotions anymore.
But he has got problems.
"Now, would you say that makes him a candidate for our bomber or not?"
"What do you think, Doctor?"
"I think you ought to question him on your own, Lieutenant."
I got a better idea.
- I think I'll join the group.
"Edie, you will help me?"
"You will tell them for me, yes?"
"Of course, Axel."
"This is my new and good friend Miss Morrow, from Beverly Hills."
"When I tell Edie what I want to do, she helps me."
What's happened is this:
Axel is selling his shop here and with it his highly honored trademark.
"The proceeds will go into a Hospital Fund, and I'm happy to tell you that the local church committee and others have pledged that they will match that amount dollar for dollar."
[Men grumbling]
"Boys, boys, what does this mean?"
You are afraid you lose your jobs?
You think Axel Norstaad would let this happen?
Of course not.
Now I will show you your new employer.
"Mr. Martin Somers of Long Beach, where he has big, big furniture factory."
"Mr. Somers, I introduce you around."
Tell your boss I just dropped in to--
Mr. Hadley.
We didn't expect to see you here.
I'm sure you didn't.
Losing bidders are supposed to go home and shut up.
"Hello, Hadley."
"Hello, Norstaad."
I gather it's all signed and delivered.
Sorry I gave you such a legitimate offer.
I don't know what you mean.
"It's nothing, Axel."
Everybody wanted your trademark.
"Mr. Hadley just needs a consolation drink, that's all."
It isn't me that needs the drink.
"Miss Morrow, you may be a very fine little promoter, but your knowledge of the furniture business--"
"You just say those things to me, Hadley."
Eh?
- Ah!
Talk to the manager.
- Eh?
"Say I'm your friend or something, anyway, do some negotiation."
"If you do, I'll give you this."
Also.
- What else?
Is that guy new?
"Ah, he's a recently joined apprentice."
I don't think the tempering is going well.
"No one seems to be checking it,"
I think it should be redone.
- You can tell by looking from here?
I can tell.
"Ah, he's here."
Eh?
"Wrapped up in the fragrance of chocolate, without good or bad feelings, she pops in my head."
"A chocolate that all the passion is poured into, like an extension of my own being,"
I want her to hold it in her mouth.
I want it to pour into her body.
"These kinds of dirty aspirations, brought me all the way here."
Saeko-san.
I will definitely become a chocolatier.
No matter how many years it takes.
I will become a chocolatier that everybody acknowledges.
"I will become famous enough to stay in your mind, to make you think ""I shouldn't have abandoned him back then""."
I will make you regret it.
"And then, after stealthily eating my chocolate, you will say ""C'est bon""."
That's my dream.
"Even if that voice,"
never reaches my ears.
Now that Samm...
"Now that my brother has gone, I must find something with which to occupy myself."
I've responsibilities.
Dependents.
I've decided that to continue with the agency.
"I understand, Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film?"
The role of an inebriated uncle.
No!
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother I would say, ""What have you got to lose by being honest Sammy?"""
"Explain to the man, he's 63."
Not 36.
"And that he's pre-flown to fame is ""Inspector Chamfold""."
Chamforth.
Inspector Chamforth.
Please be calm Mr.Hilliard.
I'm perfectly calm.
What you're seeing is controlled anger tempered with ice headed detachment.
This is one of the many subtle emotions which a good actor is capable of.
Three weeks and location Devon.
Followed by three in a London studio.
There are currently only nine films in pre-production with the studios.
None of the others hold a role for you.
"I hope I share some of my brother's qualities, Mr.Ambrose. I do not however share his sentimental attachments."
I'll not keep un-profitable clients on the books.
Veal.
Twice please.
Oh!
And some veal pudding?
Excellent choice.
Too long.
Lose half.
Which half?
* When you taught me
* What my heart
* Was made for
* I got what I prayed for
* You're

* Dear.
"And so, my dear duchess."
"Tomorrow, I may be in possession of the city and its treasures."
- A theatrical titan.
"- Not really, Commodore."
Success is in my very grasp.
- Confounded flies.
- Tell me about it.
I have invested practically everything I have in a theatrical venture which is certain to make millions.
"Millions, duchess."
"Do you know, Commodore, since you've called me duchess when others address me as Mrs. Schultz."
I positively shudder.
"Yes, I can understand that."
"Now, as I was saying..."
But let's not talk anymore of money.
There are so many more important things.
- Name one.
"- Well, happiness."
There are times when I feel I could trade all my wealth for just a sip from the cup of dreams.
"For a cottage, small, by a waterfall."
You're so understanding.
"Uh, tell me, what is your opinion of the privileges of love?"
- I'm in favor of them.
- I mean..
Do you think a woman in love is privileged to speak her mind?
How can you stop them from doing it?
"Oh, you're never like me, dear Elinor."
Look how calmly you take the news.
He opened his heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
"It came out quite unawares, quite without design."
I could talk of nothing but my child.
"He gave way to his feelings and he told me of his earnest, tender, constant affection for Marianne."
Everybody knows Colonel Brandon to be an excellent man.
Excellent?
"Oh, my dear, he remained constant throughout that business with Willoughby and he brought me here."
- Any man might do as much for love.
"- Oh, Elinor, do you now belittle him?"
On the contrary!
I am saying that what makes him so fine a gentleman is his constant goodness to everybody.
I have offered heartfelt thanks for all he has done.
"Oh, thanks are not enough."
One must help good causes along.
I have told him that Marianne will be well enough to see him tomorrow.
Whose idea was this?
"Mother's, I suppose."
You must thank him.
I mean to.
He is a worthy man.
"But worthy men are so uninteresting, especially men of his age."
And letting him see me in this state...
- You look lovely.
- My skin looks terrible.
"You are romantically pale, like the heroine of one of Mrs Radcliffe's novels."
"- Hmm, yes."
I see what you mean.
- (LAUGHS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Good morning, Colonel."
Yeah.
Quick there and back.
No leftovers-
- I will be there to cut the turkey.
"I know, I know."
There's my cab.
Love you.
I'll just be another minute.
"...in Fairfax, not much better, and along the coast, our coldest temperatures, as we will dip down into the teens."
"The forecast of scattered showers in some areas was quickly turned into the wet, icy accumulation that we are seeing out there right now."
"So, let's go ahead and take a look at our local temperatures."
"Now, in DC, we can expect lows into the 20s."
"In Fairfax, not much better, and along the coast, our coldest temperatures, as we will dip down into the teens."

"Somehow a ""White Thanksgiving"" never sounds quite right."
Tell me about it.
"Yesterday you were calling this a ""chance of rain."""
Is he here yet?
Is he here yet?
Did I miss him?
"I just hung up with him, Abbs-- he's getting on the elevator."
One very fast elevator.
Hey.
"Ellie, he's adorable."
"Aw, thanks."
"Jake Malloy, this is the amazing Abby."
- Oh.
"Uh, I-I could've guessed."
I am sure that all this is very risky for our organization.
"Well then, we have to get ready for the meeting, we do not have much time."
Follow them!
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one, respond unit one."
"Agent S.O.S four to unit one,attention unit one,"
"Unit one, go ahead."

"Miss Diana, one moment, I must speak with you."
"Yes, Madame"
"Attention, attention, this is Lucrecia reporting, we have Adriana, you may pick her up."
"Yes, Madame?"
"Do not be frightened, Miss, you are only going to serve as company, to your friend Dinamo."
We do not want any risks.
"It is best for you to not resist, dear."
"Freeze or I shoot, darling."
Take her.
"I will take care of her later, personally."
Kill him!
I will.
Watch out!
"Are you ok, Dinamo?"
"I am, Inspector, this is bigger than you can imagine."
We are facing an S.O.S. cell.
S.O.S.?
Secret Organisational Service.
What are they looking for here?
"I do not know, Inspector, but we must not waste time."
"Have your men sorround the hotel and wait there, to await my signal."
May I use one of your motors?
"And Ágika increasingly better enthused into dreaming about the major, the major changed to increasingly more attractive one  and resembled hers father increasingly better."
Just as tall.
Just as stately.
Like that than the dad's beautiful motion
And brave and gallant!
And he does not have a purse.
He carries the paper money out in his pocket into little dumplings.
Rolls a bullet there only if it is necessary to pay
And from this everybody knows who he.
His soldiers worship it.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
A hero!

A military officer!
He comes.
Daddy!
For Tót family was an idea.
"They was thought that a major is tall surely, haggard,  his sword rings, his spur twangs."
They waited for a major like this
There it is.
It's him.
"Whoo, this only lieutenant."
- Mom!
- My small son!
Look at that.The Melcsó child.

They mentioned 4 witnesses...

"No, it's..."
Josée Morin.
She's still in there with the doctor.
- Detective Sergeant Racine.
"- Yes, yes..."
We mustn't talk too loud.
"It's not good for her, even if she's sedated."
You gave her some...
Sedatives?
"Yes, yes."
I had no choice.
She's in a terrible state of shock.
But did she talk to you?
Yes.
She had a very bad night.
She can't remember...
"The way she speaks isn't very coherent, but I still managed to get a few bits of information on what happened."
"First of all... one, she's a woman who was at the hotel and who was having drinks with some... alcohol, and who suffered a terrible shock, which would have been preceded by a perturbation of an emotional nature... which was followed by a sort of blackout."
"But she will recall some elements, always the same ones."
I have noted that.
really?
Which ones?
That she found herself in this bedroom.
"Then... that her right cheek was tumefied,"
Go away.
"Doctor, we are terribly sorry, but we aren't doing it out of spite."
We don't have it easy either.
Such research is so terribly demanding.
We are trained specialists.

I didn't have a childhood at all.
Do you know what it means to toil through cold eternal space from planet to planet whole light years
with such a half-wit?
You should take a rest.
Do you also rest sometimes?
-Only in critical situations.
-And how?
Shall we show it to the doctor?
"Well, actually it's a secret."
But we can show it to you.

-Six.

"Don't shit yourself, we're going for a drive."

Institutionalised bullying wasn't quite the work experience I had in mind.
But I knew how to deal with bullies.
I got my mum to tell the teacher.
"I was hoping you'd be able to do something about it, Mr Gilbert."
- I'm sorry.
- I just wonder what he said to them.
"- I don't think he said anything, Kevin."
- He must have said something.
He walked back through the town centre sopping wet and barely clothed.
I'd hoped you'd take this more seriously.
"He wrote to the paper especially to get work experience, and instead I'm picking frogspawn out of his underpants."
Would you excuse me just for a second?
Ooooooooh God!
"Look,"
"I really want to help, but it's not my responsability."
"I will ask if they'll consider swapping students, but I can't promise anything."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have a meeting to attend to."
What a pickle!
"That big, stupid--"
It was my shop!
My office!
Who do you think everyone was looking to for running things?
Me.
Lisa Pedersen.
But I paid Mr.-
- Mr. Somers nothing.
Who else did you tell about those bids?
Who else could have had private dealings with Somers?
I don't understand.
I don't remember.
"Lisa, do you recall correspondence with a certain shoe company in Chicago?"
A company interested in obtaining a large building site?
A company who had written concerning the property occupied by Axel's cabinet shop?
"Oh, that."
I-
- I threw that in the wastebasket.
"Yet that company still expected to obtain the property, just as they'd already obtained the land next to it, the land once slated for Axel's Hospital?"
"Now think hard, Lisa."
Who else did you tell about the bids?
"It must have been a man who dealt with Somers, since he obviously knew what Somers had planned."
"It must have been a man who, on the night of the murder, told Axel where to find Somers."
"Now, it must have been--"
[Lisa] Yes.
"Yes, I told him."
Somers was a crook.
And out-and-out crook.
"Oh, yes, I knew it."
And what he was up to-- everything.
I paid him to tell me.
In return I was to have an option on the property he never intended to use anyway.
"- hello, alberto CoIombo."
- Borghetti.
You wanted to see me?
I'd Iike to check a few details on yourtransfer application.
would you Iike help?
"It's kids, always slashing the tires."
please sit down.
What can I do foryou?
How long have you been disabled?
It's not easy to talk about.
I was very young.
The memory is blurred.
It's terrible to relive that trauma.
muscle spasms.
Done.
"please, go on."
There are two transfer applications in yourname.
A recent one for a person with reduced mobility and another six months ago in which the applicant is normal.
Are you the same person?
They're both mine.
I did the one as a healthy person... because I wanted my application to be considered like all the others.
"It's important to see in a ""normal"" person's eyes something otherthan pity."
- That's quite honorable.
- Thank you.
But if this compromises my transfer...
"It's a simple but necessary check, because often people make false statements to get a position in milan."
It happens very often.
It's shameful.
"But that's not your case, you'II be fine in milan."
Thank you.
I won't botheryou any further.
No bother at all.
It's Fan-Big-cup Fan!
"Now we know your name, if you're killed we can set up a spirit tablet for you!"

Dame it!
This string will have to be paid for!
Who are you?
The bill collector!
Bill collector
Whose bill are you collecting?
You almost cost me my livelihood
How could I not settle accounts with you?
What do you mean by that!
?
You picked 28 strings of my grapes tonight!
"Each string contains 1 1 3 grapes making a total of 3,164 grapes in all"
"That means you owe 253, 700 coppers I won't take anymore or any less"

Want to run!

Help!
Help!
Don't shout-l've been hanging here all day
"What a ridiculous way to fail, Brother"
We're hung on the tip of a straw!
What damned rotten luck!
Hey!
You two were stealing my grapes together!
I have a mother 80 years old and 20-some dependents waiting to eat
Please find forgiveness in your heart!
Then from now on work to pay your debts
We will have the time that it takes him
To reach the curb to intercept him.
Steal from the gural nataz?
Are you crazy?
Probably.
But letting a priceless relic
Fall into their hands is not something
I'm willing to let happen.
I'm betting you feel the same.
"No way, it's too risky."
As risky as stealing back
The pendant of tuthankhamen
From their stronghold in izmir?
Or of causing the arrest of
An entire gural nataz cell in malta?
The details of how we recovered
That pendant were never made public.
Be that as it may...
"Professor, his train's on time."
In 30 seconds we'll lose a chance to strike
A blow to the very heart of the gural nataz.
"If this is a setup,"
You won't even have to worry about
The gural nataz...
I'll take care of you myself.
Now what are we supposed to do
With this guy once we grab him?
(andreas:)the courier has the map
Inside the briefcase.
Sydney.
Come on.
Excuse me.
"This is not good, Mr. Mogi..."
Otoharada...
Remember Me?
You should know that your acts no sense.
Make yourself.
Why do you think I agreed to share with you?
You need to know?

I will kill you
You will see
This is a promise!
"The man cut inside to by the police this is Otoharada Kuro, 46 years."
- The suspect in the early morning of 20...
- Otoharada... killed a taxi driver to Using a knife...
Kill the man and save my father!
Kill him!
Kill this man!
Sayu...
"If you shoot, they will launch the assault."
"If that happens, I can do anything for you."
Farm somewhat valve tone!
I also want to save the life of a murderer.
Do not condemn you!
Otoharada.
Shut up!
Shut up!
There's change .
To disarm the hostage taker special forces would prepare an assault .
The person whose name is written dies in this book
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds to make that happen

"Hello, Congressman Pierce, Mrs. Pierce."
We are here from the White House on behalf of the Families First Bill.
"Oh, yes."
"Mom, the White House here to see me."
We need you to vote for the bill.
"More importantly, the president needs you to vote for the bill."
The president?
The president sent you here to talk to me?
She used sentences containing your name.
"Okay, I'm in."
"I mean, yeah, absolutely."
- Fantastic!
"- Mom, the president needs me to..."
"Oh, no, Joker and Penguin beat us to it."
"Hey, guys."
You're here just in time to celebrate.
The congressman is going to vote yes on the Families First Bill.
"It was a personal request from the president, so..."
"Congressman, now, while I respect your decision, you do understand that the amendments to this bill will negatively affect your district."
Hardworking families don't want to support lazy ones.
And your support will shrink faster than a penis in the December Hudson.
- Really?
- You shit-eating cocksuckers.
"- Whoa, whoa!"
"- I'm sorry, Mrs. Pierce."
How dare you come in here and try to strong-arm a person when he's sitting at his sick mother's bedside?
"That's exactly what you just did, dumbass."
Don't tell me what I did or did not just do.
Could you guys please keep the noise down?
There's a lot of really sick people on this floor.
"Yes, there are."
I see two very sick people.
Which is to our good fortune.
Still havin' you here with us.
"So happy to keep you happy, Daddy."
Livy and Ellie are waitin' on me.
We're goin' to the suffragette rally this afternoon.
"Do you want to come, Tootsie?"
I promised Abigail I'd baby sit little Camden.
"What about Annie Laurie's tea dance, Zelda?"
Isn't that today?
Those affairs are insufferable.
"More so than the ""insufferablegette"" rally?"
I find it gratifying that
Zelda has so many activities to choose from.
"Well, I'm off to march, wave signs and shout slogans that would curl your hair."
Nothing to love about women voting.
Sorry I'm late.
Your family takes forever to eat lunch.
- Livy.
"- Well, she's right, Ellie, they do."
I thought you changed your mind.
I wouldn't miss this.
"It's historic, and happening right here in little old Montgomery."
Not to mention it's something to write about in your next letter to Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.
"Dearest Scott, the rally was ever so amazing."
"Why do you keep writing him, anyway?"
"Well, just because I told him I wasn't gonna marry him doesn't mean I can't correspond, does it?"
"- Come on, Zelda."
- Whatever is the matter now?
"I'm comin', I'm comin'."
Woman:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.
If there's another way to go
I missed it 20 long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and they murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust He called me brother
My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me!
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!
One word from him and I'd be back
"Beneath the lash, upon the rack"
Instead he offers me my freedom!
I feel my shame inside me like a knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
(WEEPING)
Is there another way to go?
I am reaching but I fall
And the night is closing in
As I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin
You're lying.
"- Marcy, no..."
- Stop it!
A man broke into my car.
He warned me about you.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Believe me.
"You want to get away from your father, don't you?"
Not like this.
"It's for us, Marcy."
The thing is...
I'm gonna need that money back.
Where is it?
That man.
He took it.
Got your 911.
What's up?
Amanda McNeil.
The refrigeration unit shut down.
Must have some kind of short circuit.
That is crap.
"Whatever caused it, the accelerated decomp liquefied her organs."
Not much chance I'll be able to confirm cause of death.
That was not an accident!
This is Judy Nash coming to you live from outside the Collins Estate in Buckhead.
"Last night, the FBI launched a tactical assault on the Quarry Tunnel in connection with their search for Sara Collins."
"Although the cause is unknown, the assault ended in near tragedy with a structural collapse."
The FBI has released the identity of one of the men believed to have abducted Sara.
"That man is Mark Valera, found dead in the trunk of his own car two nights ago."
Anyone with information about Mr. Valera is asked to call the hotline.
The FBI is also continuing their search for Jessica Nevins.

"So you'll know we'll never forget you can always turn to the words love, friendship and remembrance and know that we're always thinking them. """
This is the loveliest thing that ever happened to me.
I... .
There's another word in this book.
Gratitude.
"Now, let's talk about graduation."
"I would like a report from the president of the class, Ted Carter."
"Ms. Thornton, I've arranged for all the necessary committees and if they all do their jobs well, I'm sure we'll have a fine graduation."
"Vice president, Selena Cross."
Paa.
- After a fashion.
- Paa...
Do you think maybe she recognizes that I'm Roland's father?
And that's what all the speaking and gestures are about?
It seems to be some form of primitive language.
- Pa.
"- Well, we know she had a father at some point."
It appears so.
- (indistinct conversations)
- I've been expecting your call.
You have?
You don't seem the type of person who's comfortable with unanswered questions.
I want you to keep looking for his parents.
"Well, in fact,"
"I've carried on with my search, anticipating this very thing."
So you have something?
Please tell me it's not a mother pining for her lost child.
Not exactly.
"After her parents died,"
I found out that Joanne Perly left Stratford.
But the trail went cold after that.
So I checked into Mr. Braxton.
It seems he left England for the bright lights of Brantford.
"There, he met and married Joanne."
How did they get Roland?
The woman I think was Roland's mother lived out of town on a homestead.
She went into labour earlier than her time.
"There were complications, and she died."
What happened to Roland?
The rural midwife was the only person present.
She reported that the baby was never delivered.
"But, uh, it turns out an antiques dealer"
Had it in Tokyo in the 1920s.
Now it's here in Washington.
"Artie, it's at the secret service."
What the hell's it doing there?
"Well, the Japanese government presented it"
In the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace.
Guess that didn't work out so well.
And the curator at the Wilson museum of peace
Made the connection a couple days ago
And offered it to be united with the sword
At the gift ceremony.
"But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremonies,"
So it's going back to the museum in the morning.
The sword and the tsuba in D.C. at the same time.
"No, no, no."
That's--that's too much coinc--
Too much coincidence.
"Well, Artie, we're sitting on the secret service building."
"But, look, if this thief is--is coming to get the tsuba,"
We have to warn Dickinson.
"No, no. absolutely not."
"Well, Artie, you saw what this guy's willing to do."
"Yeah, and--and so did you."
And imagine what he's capable of with the sword.
"No, no, no. this thief is ruthless and smart."
"So if you warn the secret service,"
And they do anything out of the ordinary--
Anything at all-- then he will be tipped off.
So you want to use him as bait.
"- No, Artie."
No.
Go!
Go!
Move!
Move!
Go!
"This is yet another liberal attack on our values, our families and on our way of life."
"On the subject of gay marriage, remember this, people."
This is not about the union of two people of the same sex.
"This, this is clearly the work of liberal judges who are trying to force their will on you, the American people."
Society at large is better served by maintaining the sacred tradition of marriage.
As in a man and a woman joined together by holy matrimony.
The people know it.
You know it.
And I know it.
This is Jim O'Bannon reporting.
"Good night, everybody, and thanks for watching The O'Bannon Files."
Yeah?
"Arbor's gone, sir."
Missed his assignment in Seattle.
What happened?
I'm not sure what happened.
He just vanished.
"So the guy doesn't complete his assignment, and you have no fucking idea where he is."
This is unacceptable.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I'm gonna make it right.
I have Senate Oversight all over my ass.
And I'm meeting with the director tonight.
The last thing I need is a failed assignment by a rogue agent who disappeared and didn't follow orders.
He is your man.
He is your responsibility.
- Height?
"- Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What colour hair?
- No hair.
Dude is balder than you.
"1963, James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine."
"1975, breaking and entering."
"1 982, grand theft auto."
"1 984, armed robbery."
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.
"City, state and federal, he's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside."
Entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
Sometime during the Clinton administration Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound of your finest meth."
"Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'll represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
Fifty goes to me.
Don't worry about it.
"There's, uh, one more thing."
"Garcia, she asked me about a week ago, who the godparents were gonna be, as in, hello, like I'm right here, like right in front of you."
"She'll be wonderful, but I have a few folks on my side of the aisle lobbying for the same position."
"Oh, Lord."
"So what are we doing, godparenting by committee?"
May have to be.

Some men reach high peaks to leave an indelible memory.
Most of us are content to push forward.
And very few are born to become king.
"Small that camera, is not it?"
"- It's modern technology, Your Majesty."
It's amazing that you can make movies with such a small device.
How big is your team?
- I'm the team.
There's only me.
You're perfect.
"We'll have a nice portrait of you, do not worry."
But you're so tired.
"Sire, allow me, your speech."
Mr Moreau?
- Mr. Lloyd?
I should arrange the microphone at His Majesty.
Of course.
The documentary Our king must point out the king's competence
And his professional commitment.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
And he must grasp his vitality and spontaneity.
Controlled spontaneity.
"Well, listen, I've loved all your stories but we have to come up with a title for our show."
"I quite liked, ""I'm not a happy slapper""."
That made me laugh.
"There's something about the spots in front of you, are they there now?"
"Yeah, cos there's a lot of bright light here, so they're dancing about."
When you go outside will they go away?
"Yeah, in the dark, I probably won't see 'em."
What about the Grandmaster Flash story?
There must be something in there.
What did he say to you?
What was the swear bit?
"""Why aren't you dancing, motherfucker?"""
"""We're going to do this to another white guy, in Exeter""."
In Exeter.
What about Alan Davies
"- Why Aren't You Dancing, Motherfucker?"
Alan Davies Is Now In Slovakia?
"What do you think, Ardal?"
May I take a bath in your home?
Can you remember how you actually phrased it when you asked for the bath?
"It was just literally, ""Hello, can I have a bath?"""
I wouldn't have done that if...
You could have pointed a gun at my head and I wouldn't have done that.
"First of all, thank you to Rob Delaney, Ardal O'Hanlon,"
"Roisin Conaty and Elis James, thank you very much."
"I'm Alan Davies and you have been watching, Hello, Can I Have A Bath?"

"Hey, you guys, thank you very much for having me and for paying for my flight to come over."
"Hello, boys."
"Hey, I heard Alan needs an auctioneer."
I'm here.
[Siren chirping] It's Trevor Nigel.
What...
You're gonna have to move that.
"Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest."
Excuse me?
We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.
Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.
I admit nothing.
Neither did your partner before he was killed.
Jordan is dead?
"He gave me up, didn't he?"
I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.
"No, Trevor."
You gave yourself up.
"Back when your studio was doing Heatwave,"
I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.
But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid.
"I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting."
Hayley:
It's the same handwriting on your serial killer partner's screenplay.
"Richard, you're a pretty good writer, but you should really read Jordan's work, because it is inspiring."
"After I read his ""Gemini Killers"" screenplay,"
I knew that I had found a kindred spirit...
Someone with the same desires as I had.
And his script laid out...
[Handcuffs clicks] the perfect plan for us to kill...
Ow!
...
Without attracting suspicion.
"Sadly, he could never nail the end."
"Well, we did, and you've reached it."
Maybe you should do the rewrite.
"Hey Pakodi, Tiger Bhai has come."
Take Chilly Chicken and chilled beer.
['Sher'ishindiwordmeaning'Tiger']
"Yes, Tiger Bhai and Beer Bhai will come."
That Tiger Bhai will not come at all.
"It is Tiger Bhai, who came."
Why did you say Tiger Bhai then?
What do you say 'Tiger' in English?
- Tiger!
Have I served him for a year without knowing that?
What ?
Should I newly tell you the order?
"I should tell you a new matter, you are under arrest."
"Without knowing that you were Tiger Bhai, I fed the militants who crossed the border for a year."
Suzuki Subramanyam alias Peter alias Pakodi.
"Though I have no success, I did 16 undercover operations."
I was side tracked as bad luck is in my back pocket.
I will get into main track now by pushing you in.
"If you are undercover, all these are my cover."
We are the undercover to cover you sir.
Undercover for the undercover?
Excellent!
Do not underestimate diamond as it's light and department guy as he is short.
Thank you guys.
I am very happy about my first success.
This is your last mission.
This is the last job I will be giving you.
"That means, are you dying sir?"
"- Suzuki sir, last mission for you"
"That means, am I going to die sir?"
- You will be retiring next month.
My God!

I'd lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.

I'd just like to get on with my life.
"Ms Denton, I'm Gill Biggeloe, Legal Counsel to AC-l 2."
Mm.
I imagine they keep you very busy.
Ha.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As pan of a new initiative christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
There seems to be an oversight.
Some of the officers involved in my wrongful conviction are missing.
"Superintendent Hastings, as Senior Investigating Officer, represents the whole team."
"Well, I want them here."
"Or this new box you need to tick just... well, won't get ticked."
God give me strength.
Thank you.
It wouldn't have been the same without you.

Oh.
"I guess all I have to do is turn around, right?"
"They think I'll play that cute factor, you know?"
Let's put it this way.
Everybody is looking for you.
So leave or I'm calling the cops.
Leave.
"Hello, gentlemen."
How are you?
- Don't get too close or I'll vomit.
- You never used to say that.

Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island...
Have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
That's very odd.
There's an opening in the ground.
Is this the back door?
That's not natural.
We want to take a look at the well.
Down to the water!
Might there be clues down there?
What the hell's that?
Do you see that?
- Wow.
- Down slow.
This well may be associated with the Templars.
- Whoa!
"- What do you got, Tony?"
"Right here on these rocks, I've got a triangle."
This thing's amazing.
There is an island in the North Atlantic where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years.
"So far, they have found bits of gold chain, a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, even a 17th century Spanish coin."
"To date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery."
"And, according to legend, one more will have to die before the treasure can be found."
"Jack, why don't you hack that tree out of the way."
- Wow.
- That's my big discovery.
"Well, honestly, David, that is quite odd."
"A few days ago, during a meeting in the war room,"
"Rick, Marty and members of the Oak Island team were introduced to New York based writer and researcher Zena Halpern by area historian Doug Crowell."
- Hello?
"- Hi, Zena, it's Doug."
"How could I forget that you're going out... with the ""cover girl""?"
Everyone else is orgasmic... that you're going out with her.
"- Good, because I just wanted to..."
"- Don't worry about it, Paul."
- It's good to keep things open.
- That's what I...
Here.
There are many more where these came from.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was just wrapping this up... so I can go to Carl's photo book party.
"I'll send Carls your best, because you're not going."
You have a very important project to do.
Have you noticed people's desks lately?
Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors... since Todd Oldham's debut collection.
It's all about black.
"What it this bullshit, anyway?"
This is not Lucky Charm cereal.
"This is not ""Oz""."
"This is not ""Skills""."
I want you to replace each and every one... of these hideous five-a-dime acessories immediately.
Everybody's desks should be in ship-shape by tomorrow morning.
Philip's just messengered over his new line of desk acessories.
"From now on, everything should be black."
Those bitches... they all said:
"""Brown is the new black""."
"I got news for you, baby:"
Black... could kick brown's ass.
"Jocelyn, what are you doing working so late?"
I'm making the bulletin boards clash-proof.
God forbid we have a stray yellow damn tag!
- I'm so sorry!
Hello.
We have someone else in the room.
Leo?
Print on the glasses isn't Paul Fordyce's and we can't find a match on the database.
Someone helped him kill himself?
Or we've been dealing with a double act.
'We have entrusted our sister Vivian to God's mercy and now we commit her body to the ground.
'Earth to earth.
'Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust 'in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ#
'I know this.
"Have you, ah, have you seen the original?"
"'It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
'It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
'But I'm drawn to these images.
Why?
"'Looking for reassurance, I suppose#"
Richard!
This glass is new.
There'll be two sets of prints on it.
"One will be mine, the other will match the print you're looking for."
Nikki?
"The other print belongs to the person who helped Paul Fordyce kill Dave Stubbs, Lucy Philips, Tony Lane, Henry Elliot and Carla Burns, and Paul Fordyce himself."
The guy who came here and said he was being followed by Paul Fordyce.
The guy who picked up that picture and said that he liked looking at these images just to see if they hinted at the life beyond.
Who couldn't resist turning the bodies over so he could look into their eyes.
Richard Henderson.
It's a match.
Armed police.
Armed police!
"- Clear this area, please."
"Everybody, can we just clear out of this area?"
There is another restroom under the stairs to the left.
What's going on out here?
Angry mob getting angrier.
And somebody's still packing.
There you are.
City roads are bad enough-- forget about getting to the airport.
That our fake air marshal?
I.D.'d from the fingerprint that Bishop sent over.
Facial recognition came up empty for a reason.
This guy is a notorious chameleon.
"Well, it would explain why Bishop found him familiar, but not familiar enough."
Norman Dopps.
Name rings a bell.
Maybe because he comes up on our Most Wanted updates every week.
He's this go-to jack-of-all-trades for organized crime families and drug cartels and other horrible people that can afford him.
Any terrorist affiliation?
Probably... the only thing that's not on his record.
Why?
Chatter may not be about him.
"Not so fast, boss."
Chatter's changed again.
Look at this.
"On it, Gibbs."
We'll call you back.
I knew I'd seen his face before;
the Most Wanted updates.
I check them religiously.
"Well, I guess I'm only mildly religious."
"What did Gibbs say, Tony?"
Homeland now thinks it's an assassination plan.
So I don't have to send him down the mines quite yet?
"Um, I'm sorry, I think that might be my next appointment."
"No, that is your previous one."
That's Fuzz's dad who's just successfully missed every other parent-teacher interview.
"Cleaver, this is Fiona McCready, Fuzz's English teacher."
Hi.
Sorry.
Caught up in a very complex trial.
"Oh, was the complex trial run over five or eight furlongs?"
Finnegan mentioned you were a barrister.
I think he wants to follow in your footsteps.
"According to all the other teachers, he is."
"What is an education, anyway?"
I spent most of 1982 learning 52.8% of Malaysia's GDP came from rubber.
I don't even know if they produce the stuff anymore.
"He's a bright boy, he's falling behind."
Why?
"Because he doesn't sit up straight in class and say,"
"'Miss, Miss, ask me!"
'
You know what happens to kids who do that.
"Yes, they're in an office somewhere with their hand up still."
"Anyway, that last teacher seemed quite impressed."
"Yes, she did."
Yeah.
Never had a teacher who looked like that.
I did once see Miss Treadwell in her bathers.
Her varicose veins looked like an aerial shot of the Nile Delta.
(Laughs)
Is there a word that means even shallower than superficial?
Are you still screwing Scarlet?
I knew it was a mistake telling you.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
Yes.
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero."
"Your Honor, I have a document..."
"See, the hardest thing was leaving the life."
I still love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
"We had it all, just for the asking."
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive.
Isn't that right?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about being a rat.
"Objection, Your Honor."
In view of the violence...
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
"I'd bet $20.000, $30.000 over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies."
It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
- All right.
All right.
"Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?"
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive.
That's really good.
"I mean, I'm very impressed by that, especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations."
"All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know."
Anyone?
Bueller.
Anyone?
Bueller.
Newton stole it.
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
"And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails."
"- I'm sorry, what's your name?"
- Ben.
Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson was the original author of this method.
"Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?"
"Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist."
"And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna."
"All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?"
"We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?"
"Ben, suppose you're on a game show."
"And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?"
"Now, behind one of the doors is a new car."
"Behind the other two, goats."
"Which door would you choose, Ben?"
"That and the V.A. records, yes."
Do you mind passing this on to the judge?
--based on only one interview?
"The defendant has a lengthy, documented case--"
Please answer the question.
-Would you restate the question?
-All right.
"Based on that one interview, you were able--?"
Where are you going with this?
"Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant V.A. record one way..."
... ourpsychologist interprets it another.
Another and another until the end of time.
So much for expert witnesses.
Let's take a break.
2:30 all right for everybody?
"I see you've already met Peter Ragan, my law clerk."
He's written some of my best opinions.
He appeared before me first time I presided over moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
INTERVIEWER:
So what are you looking over here?
"It's a short-term, I believe, contract-- 21 days."
And it looks in order.
But I'm gonna read it just to be sure.
Make sure I don't have to give up my first-born
Or something like that.
INTERVIEWER:
And what will that be for?
"I'm gonna be Toxie's double whenever they need it, I guess."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yo, you're supposed to stop"
People from going up here.
"You see, if they fall down, break their neck with babies."
So stop them from going through.
[Chatter]
We're gonna have a little problem
"Today, because people are going to be going up that step."
We're shooting now.
"If somebody goes up the steps when the cameras are rolling,"
"That's very bad, because it means we waste film."
Yeah.
"Because you know what'll happen,"
"They'll look at the camera behind them,"
And then that screws it up.
Because then people know that they aren't
Supposed to be in the movie.
"So have to make sure that the pedestrians, very politely,"
"Are told to go around the back, that we're making a movie,"
That we're going around the back.
"I don't want women with tiny babies coming through here,"
"Tripping over wires, bumping into people."
-They haven't had the time to replace it!
- Really!
Samsonov!
Mayor Samsonov reporting.
Replace it!
-Quickly!
"-Yes, sir!"
-He is about to replace it.
- Have a smoke.
-What is there on your mind?
- Thanks.
-Tell me.
"- First, we witness all distinctive signs of a trap."
"And ifthere is a mousetrap, there is a wayto deceive it."
There is no better place forthat than this hill.
I've already heard that.
"Second, my scouts took a prisoner who clearlyfed us false data."
Why?
He knewthat we'd check it and find out that the hill seems not to represent any imminent danger.
What ifthe Germans knew about the exact time ofthe offensive and were going to covertly pull their shock troops out to the hill bythe time it begins?
The front intelligence units reported that somewhere here deep in the German defence... there were mobile reserve tank units.
"The Germans are not so strong as they used to be in 1941, so they gather all theirforces into one fist."
How much time do you think they need to get to Hill 89?
"Well, ifthe road is good, it'll take them not more than two hours."
"OK, tomorrowwe are going tojump into this boiler."
May I come in?
"- Oh, it is you finally, Ivan Semenovich."
Come in.
"The oven is fuming all the time, it is really hard to breathe. I do not knowwhat to do."
Can you help us?
It is a nightmare.
-Can you see that?
"And when was this, sir?"
12 years ago.
And you believe that woman is Sara Collins?
"Yeah, I do."
"Your name, sir?"
Peter Manning.
M-A-N-N-I-N-G.
27 hours.
I got two calls from the director's office.
He's got half of Capitol Hill breathing down his neck.
Yeah?
"Well, if they want to do something constructive for a change, give them a badge and let them help."
I'll put that in the suggestion box.
We got the DNA back on these hairs we found in Jessica Nevins' hotel room.
They're Sara's.
Pulled out by the root.
Is there enough to issue a warrant for Miss Nevins?
No.
"But we're monitoring her credit card accounts, all her known acquaintances."
"She sticks her head out of the rabbit hole, we got her."
And Amanda McNeal:
Where are we at with the prelim?
Body's still frozen.
M.E. can't autopsy until it thaws out.
"Guys, Dockery's got something."
Surveillance footage from the Biltmore garage four minutes after Sara disappeared.
There's our Taurus.
And there's Valera.
"Sara's probably tied up in the backseat, maybe the trunk."
"All right, I want subpoenas for every exterior surveillance camera in downtown Atlanta-- security cams, traffic cams, weather cams,"
"Convenience stores, ATMs."
"And you can wake up every judge in town, if you have to."
You saying Flack hit him?
"Mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination."
"I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol."
All were negative.
Don Flack did not kill this boy.
Find out what did.
"Now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?"
That's correct.
And what was his demeanor?
He was fine.
"So the kid's calm, perfectly healthy."
He agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
"He's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room."
"And then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead."
That's exactly whatappened.
"And if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you."
Did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
- Bruises?
- No.
Was Detective Flack ever alone with him?
"In the car, maybe?"
I drove.
Detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
We were together the entire time.
What about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
In the locker room.
Who accompanied him there?
Detective Flack.
Detective Flack.
Doesn't look good.
!
-Quick carry her inside!
-Yes.
"Are you alright, Priestess Yeo Mi-Eul?"
We thought we were going to lose you.
I'm okay.
You've exhausted yourself.
How's things in the palace?
"About the reinforcements,"
His Majesty hasn't come to a decision yet.
The ministers have differing opinions among themselves too.
It looks like His Majesty is having a hard time.
"It's just a yes or a no, must it take so long?"
As long as you agree to it.
BuYeo will receive the Emperor's benevolence.
I simply cannot understand all this dragging and procrastination.
"Prince Dae-So, please try again."
"If I try again, it'll only make it worse."
I cannot wait any longer!
"If you cannot decide soon, then it leaves me no choice."
What's that supposed to mean?
Haven't I made myself clear enough?
It's because of Prince Dae-So's hardwork that our nations... have the peace that they enjoy now.
"This has nothing to do with the reinforcements,"
It was solely between you and me.
Don't try to put them together.
I'm very touched that you brought me Hae Mo-Su's head.
"Concerning BuYeo and the Han Dynasty's diplomacy,"
I'm very interested in helping you out.
"But,"
"If you're holding back because you fear your father,"
Then it's a pity our friendship has to end here.
Perhaps we could have a duel.
"That's a good idea, I think."
"If Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Enright have a duel, one of them dies... sorted."
Mrs. Rogers takes to her bed.
She's waiting for an apology.
Underneath the trees...
Captain Glover has planned an afternoon to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar with a nautical picnic of salt pork washed down with rum and fresh lime.
"I'm going to introduce you to a distant relative of mine,"
Captain Blackwood... and there's the gentleman himself.
"He looks like you, actually."
You see the curly hair there.
I can really see the resemblance.
Look to your left.
Yes...
Needs a shave.
"My hair isn't quite that gray yet, but I'm working on it."
I have a letter here from Admiral Nelson to Captain Blackwood giving instructions to keep an eye on the fleet.
"So, as I pass that round, I'll read out actually..."
That's the genuine letter.
No way.
So I'll pass this round.
That's the real thing.
"It goes, ""To Captain, the Honorable Henry Blackwood,"
"""HM Ship Aureleus."
"""From the Victory, October 9, 1805, AM"
"""Cadiz due east, 19 leagues."
"""My dear sir, many thanks for your letter of yesterday."
"Let us have them out."""
"""In short, watch all points and all winds and weathers,"
"Be assured I am ever and always yours, Nelson and Bronte."""
Wow!
"At the house, Mrs. Rogers finally receives an apology from Mrs. Enright."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I'm looking for Kay Howard, we're supposed to have lunch."
Uh-huh.
"Well, um, Kay will probably be back in a second."
- Do you wanna have a seat?
- OK.
I've gotta go.
I understand.
I'm getting pretty good at being on my own.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Look at his, it's almost like it's getting back to normal in here."
When's Crosetti coming back from Atlantic City?
Tomorrow.
I hate to admit I kinda miss the little booger.
"Hey, you guys."
"Frank, this just arrived for you."
"Now, aren't you supposed to tip those overnight delivery guys?"
"Certainly, you don't have to, but I always feel like,"
"""Gosh, they got it here overnight."""
Wilgis's red wig from the murder site in Iowa.
"Too little, too late."
"This time next week, there'll be three movies of the week, six paperbacks and a deck of souvenir playing cards."
The cash cow has only begun to get milked.
"He's in one of those rare moods, Gee."
You didn't hold her for me.
You didn't do anything to keep her here including grabbing that lawyer by his legal briefs.
I needed five minutes.
You let me down.
"Maybe, but you better figure out what you're really angry about, Frank."
"Is it because Wilgis may end up in a mental institution instead of the electric chair, or are you ticked off because you weren't the one to get her confession?"
Jin Tianyun!
"Master Shi, it's been 3 years since we met"
"Your temper is still so bad, huh?"
"Brother Jin, how come you're still here?"
I'm afraid that you'll be bullied again
So I came back!
"Jin Tianyun, you taught my apprentice in secret"
This is definitely against ethics
T alk about morality?
How complicated!
I don't know that.
Your apprentice saved my life
I taught him a bit as a way to say thanks
Why are you so mean?
"That's true, Master."
"In fact, it's good to learn more!"
"You traitor, you've betrayed our teachings"
And our school.
I'll kill you!
"Shi Zhengzong, the decent school talks about"
Loving and helping the young generation
But you blame your apprentice ;
even beat him up... in order to save your face.
"If you try to... give him a hard time again, I'll interfere"
"Jin Tianyun, I know how to teach my pupils"
You have no say here!
"You yelled so loud, don't you fear... it will break some more of your rib bones?"
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
"Just leave here, quick!"
"So, you're wounded"
If I fight with you...
People will say I've taken undue advantage
I did find a breach on the same day the photos were downloaded.
I'm thinking someone could've pirated his signal.
Todd Fleming.
The alligator blood Stella found puts him on Nelson's roof.
Maybe that's what he was doing up there.
"Okay, so Fleming downloads the photos of the boy, and makes it looks like Coach Nelson sent them."
"I mean, it's possible, but why?"
"Clearly, Fleming wanted to discredit Nelson."
"Making a coach look like a pedophile, that'll do it."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nelson's apartment.
Stell and Lindsay found the alligator blood over here.
"Okay, maybe something."
"I'm getting a list of networks, but nothing strong enough to connect to."
It means we're in the vicinity.
"Okay, I've got several network choices now."
Signal looks like it's strongest in this direction.
"Got one Wi-Fi network that's fully unprotected, no password, nothing-- genius."
Look what it's called.
Vince N. Wireless Network.
"So all Fleming had to do from here was to release a prewritten script to Nelson's computer, turning it into a zombie."
Giving him complete control.
"The e-mail connects to the murder, I just can't figure out how."
"Yeah, well, we know Fleming didn't kill Nelson."
He had an alibi.
"Right, but Coach Nelson's wife said she saw two people up here."
He might've had some help.
There's sawdust over here.
Sid found sawdust on the victim.
But Stella and Lindsay would've found the sawdust when they were here.
Not necessarily.
- Treat me as you would a stranger.
"As for you, Mr. Buff um, it might be wiser if you didn't speak at all."
I never met a Kentuckian so plainly from Massachusetts.

Do you have your pistols?
Keep them hidden.
"In this business, you never fight unless you've failed, and we won't fail."
Nothing can stop us.
[thunder]
Nothing.
[Pittenger] Andrews gave us 3 days for our journey through the Cumberlands.
"Traveling by twos and threes, we were strung out miles apart in a desolate country."
"We'd been supplied with Confederate money, but food and lodging were scarce, and transportation out of the question."
"My companion was the Giant, Bill Campbell."
"As I came to know him, I felt a growing concern over his quick, violent temper."
One such powder keg could blow our whole expedition sky-high.
"We reached the Tennessee River on time, only to find it impassable."
"Pardon me, ma'am."
Do you know the whereabouts of the ferryman?
"Home, like enough."
But he won't chance it across before morning.
River's swole up mighty angry.
- Could you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?
"[Pittenger] Flemingsburg, Kentucky."
Inn's pretty full.
We can pay double.
[thunder]
"They're from Flemingsburg, too."
There's a score of us in all.
We couldn't abide the Yankees anymore so we pulled up stakes.
Gonna throw in our lot with the Southern army.
May all welfare come to you.
Did you see any pregnant lady running from here.
"""l did'nt see anyone, King"""
"""Where had you gone, swami?"""
"""T o Uma"
"- But I am Uma, you have come to me only now."""
That widow's name is also Uma.
She is bringing up the two boys..
"""...with great love."
"You should help her, Parvati."""
"""Mother will surely help, but what is the their future, Lord"""
Sometimes you talk in such a way that I feel you are mad.
"""What is my mistake, Lord?"
"-lgnorance can cause mistakes."""
Now only you said Mother Parvati will help in the...
"""...upbringing of those boys, then immediately you ask their future."""
"""When Parvati is going to help them, how will their future be?"""
"""Lord, I have been caught in my own web of words."""
"""Always you trouble others, Narad."
"You just understand that..."""
...those two boys will always get the mercy of both of us.
They will cross all hurdles and come up in life.
Their mother will also attain fame  get peace due to them.
"""This is enough, Lord."
"Both of you are venerable"""
"""Come Suchivar, come"""
Long live!
"""Bless my son, Sage"""
This is not your son.-But I have only brought him up.
I know and also that Shiv's mercy is there on Satyavrt's son
"""That is why, Shiv came in the form of Trishwar to protect him"""
And has handed over the work of bringing him up to you
"Guys, all I know is that we should really appreciate this... 'cause I don't think we're gonna be able to do this in college."
This peach cobbler is amazing!
"Now, who would leave a whole pan of peach cobbler just sitting on a counter?"
See?
We don't need anyone else.

"It runs on water, man!"

A foie gras car with a luncheon meat badge.
And we try to set a new land speed record.
Hello!
And we start tonight with some good news because I've finally found an advantage to being over 40.
"Yes, hair sprouts out of your ears and yes, hangovers last a fortnight, but all you youngsters - the only chance you get to drive a Subaru Impreza and a Mitsubishi Evo VIII is on your PlayStations."
"Whereas me, with my wise shoulders and my hairy ears,"
I'm allowed by the insurance companies to take them to the best driving country in the world.
Scotland.
Those cases have nothing to do with this case.
The jury will disregard.
Please disregard it.
Please disregard it because that's exactly what they do to people like you and me.
"We are disregarded because, unless we make them money,"
- unless you're putting cash in their pocket--
- Objection.
- Ms. Papagian-- - ...no value to them at all.
Sustained.
"Uh, really, one more time, and you're done."
All right.
"Well, I am done."
Here's the thing.
They're going to tell you that Ryan Larson was suicidal.
Absolutely a lie.
In no way was Ryan Larson suicidal.
Thank you for your time.
Hi.
That was interesting.
It's very impassioned.
The evidence will show that Ryan Larson left a suicide note.
"Look, Borns Tech is in the business of protecting America from terrorism."
That's what we do.
"Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Leonard Letts, my co-counsel, and Lucy Kittridge."
Lucy's brother died in the war effort.
"He went overseas, and he lost his life to enemy fire protecting this country and all the principles that we hold dear."
Lucy's brother--
- Objection.
- ...wasn't a war profiteer.
[whispering]
He was a patriot.
And so is Borns Tech.

"I have, but what of him?"

Our Emperor wishes to give you a chance to serve the Han.
"He requests you send 1 0,000 soldiers."
This is an opportunity to show your allegiance... and restore our estranged friendship.
We know what His Majesty is like.
He'll never send reinforcements.
I agree.
But he still hasn't given an answer.
He usually does immediately.
Maybe he has different plans.
"(Jinyong, Tax Minister) I doubt it."
It's probably because of the recent trade issue.
He's worried refusing the demand might lead to another salt scare.
- Chief General.
- Yes?
"Can we afford to send 1 0,000 soldiers?"
Not from the city and the borders... but there will be no problem if we send the Sachooldo soldiers.
"(Heukchi, Chief General) The King knows that."
Prime Minister.
What can we gain from sending reinforcements?
It could solve the trade issue.
We could even demand steel weapons.
Why don't we demand they arm our men and pay for their expenditures?
"(Bulgae, Court Minister) That's a great idea."
But I doubt they will comply.
We must wonder... whether the Han can win the war as Yangjung says they will.
We mustn't send men to a losing battle.
Did you check up on them?
Yes.
The subjects are still discussing whether they should comply or not.
They can discuss all they want but isn't it up to King Kumwa?
- Dongsun.
"- Yes, Governor."
"Up to now, all I really found are things."
"Wonderful things, sir?"
Yes.
But nothing written.
No papyrus.
"If I went to your house, walked through each room, how much would I actually learn about you just from looking at your possessions?"
"Not much, I think."
"But if I read your diary, came across some household bills, found letters that had been written to you, then, I think, I'd begin to understand who you really were."
"Well, I think my wife might have something to say about you wandering about her house and rummaging around, sir."
"Yes, I expect she might."
"Well, I'll say good night."
"Good night, sir."

He came here at his own expense as a personal favour to me.
"Hauser and Hall, as you well know, are here courtesy of the Metropolitan."

"Yes, to show what I imagined to be the essence of Britain..."

Eminently british.

"It was taken in Venice, in rather dramatic circumstances."
"It's the suit, tie and shoes of a man I loved."
In an apartment in Venice where we stayed.
"My shoes nearby, not at all aligned with his."
"That still aren't aligned, even less than before."
That are the only element of disorder in the picture.
And this colored shade...
It's a picture I sent him as a break-up letter in a way.
An ironic picture also.
Don't you think so?
Ironic?
I don't know.
This one is strange...
I don't like it very much...
It's a field in Corsica with...

They told me to expect the call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.

"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."

- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
- Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
- You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- Why?
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
Well... fuck you.
Next month I am going to buy the same ones but in red.

But Om borrowed the money for my education
Out there you can earn lots more.
Just mail the money home
No American company will give me a loan.
"And Om wants cash, immediately"
This urgency was never the point.
The decision to borrow was his own
You knew nothing about it

Only a few weeks to go... before your work permit expires.
And you got to return before that
Is everything all right?
What was that about the work permit?

"Jai, will you step outside for a minute?"
"Whatever you got to say, say it in front of Nitu"
Have you informed Om about this?
They have wounded me in such a way..
..that I wont be able to forgive them in this life!
Dont be so harsh on them!
If you wont support them in their bad times..
..then who else will support them?
And did you forget what sister-in-Iaw used to say?
The one who doesnt know how to forgive..
..even God doesnt forgive that person.
"Jyoti, even if God sends me to hell for not.."
"..forgiving them, then III happily go, but I.."
..I will not give them a place in..
..my heaven-Iike house again.
"If.. if I forgive them today, then all those brothers.."
..who take care of their younger brothers..
..like theirfatherwiII neverforgive me!
"Jyoti, its very simple."
If today these people have cried in orderto improve..
"..their bad times, then can you assure me that.."
"..in future, if the time changes.."
..these people wont change themselves?
Can you assure me about this!
?
No!
You cant assure me about this.
"Krishna, get these people out of here!"
Im feeling suffocated!
"One day, you promised me that.."
..you will never let these children cry.
"And today, when these children are.."
"..in front of you, you are feeling suffocated!"
Did you forget your promise!
?
Ready.
Fire.
What the hell's going on?
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
They were opening a vortex.
They would've escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could've kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
"If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might've avoided a firefight."
"With all due respect, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
Archer to Major Hayes.
"Go ahead, Captain."
"Report to my ready room, on the double."
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as tactical officer.
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain...
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"- Of course, ser."
I want a complete record of this.
Mr. Spock.
What do we have on this general area?
"Virtually nothing, captain."
No records of any explorations.
There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.
"However, none has ever been recorded."
Anything on intelligent life forms?
"Nothing specific, captain."
Unscientific rumours only.
More like space legends.
"Security control, this is bridge."
Status report.
"Mr. Sulu, status, alien vessel."
"They must be aware we're after them, sir."
They've gone to warp 6 also.
Warp factor 7.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Something the matter, Mr. Spock?"
"A sustained warp-7 speed will be dangerous, captain."
"Thank you, Mr. Spock."
I mean to catch them.
"We'll either catch them, or we'll blow up, captain."
They may be faster than we are.
They'll have to prove it.
"Yes, Mr. Spock?"
"You mean to destroy the alien ship, captain?"
Of course.
I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
Destruction may be unnecessary.
"Colony Cestus III has been obliterated, Mr. Spock."
"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim."
Enough with the complicated stuff.
Just tell me whether or not you can save him... as a doctor.
You bastard!
What are you doing right now?
Answer me.
I can save him.
Then save him.

"What we've been doing right, wrong, how to expand, where to get more pento."
I had a feeling you'd get her back onside.
I can be very convincing.
Mmm.
I love funerals.
Nothing like staring death in the face to make you feel alive.
"Watch the Series Premiere of The Blacklist Redemption, Thursday on Global."
Scottie Hargrave is in charge of a global intelligence gathering operation.
"You should know, I have anger issues."
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Take it easy.
You're hired.
You want me to work for you?
We could do incredible things together.
You really know how to push my buttons.
Welcome to the family.
"Your sister's response is a typical consequence of loss, numbness that follows a period of intense grief."
"Losing one's parents, especially so suddenly, can be deeply disorienting."
Rest is what she needs.
"At Rosewood, she will have the benefit of time and privacy to recuperate."
"I don't see why, if rest and recuperation is what you prescribe, we couldn't simply repair to the coast as usual."
"Or if warmer weather is what she needs, we could go to Italy."
"He's a racist and a little shady, maybe, but a murderer?"
"It may be just a feeling, but I know he's in this."
We just need to figure out how.
Iayudame!
Iayudame!
Shot execution style just like all the others.
Why put him in there?
There must be something symbolically important.
There's something inconsistent about the staging.
"It's not remorse, and it's not a forensic countermeasure either."
Each of these families were registered gun owners.
That must be how he's selecting his victims.
He wants them to fight back.
It's propaganda for his race war.
He's turning the families into martyrs.
And the fall guy takes the blame.
"But now he's lost control because his fall guy got away, and he's devolving."
His name's Ramon Gomez.
He's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico City.
And he's pretty freaked out.
"Well, that's understandable."
Was he able to give a description of the unsub?
Just of the vehicle.
His English is not good.
We put an APB out.
Hola.
Mi nombre es Emily Prentiss.
Preston campaign headquarters.
This is...
And please tell everybody that I appreciate all of their help.
"Sometimes I don't have a chance to do it personally, so it's really great what they do."
"Hey, uh, Clark, you got a second?"
"Well, there are worse things."
Don't make this your whole life.
Trust me.
It's not worth it.
Go home.
Get some rest.
Now.
And that is an order.
"Yes, sir."
"Now, not too many people realise this but the White House is actually three buildings:"
"The East Wing where you guys came in the West Wing, which houses the Oval and Executive Offices and we're about to enter the residence, which is the famous building that..."
-...got blown up in Independence Day.
- What's in there?
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.
"Right this way through the double doors, please."
There's still lots more to see.
You got a visitor.
Hey.
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
The White House is big.
"Including below-ground levels, it's six storeys tall with 132 rooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces and 35 bathrooms."
"The grounds contain a tennis court, a basketball court a putting green, a jogging track and a swimming pool."
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?
"She's referring to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre which is this really cool bunker behind 10 feet of concrete and steel that's capable of surviving a nuclear blast, plus for your information, miss, it's the one room in the house that no one knows the location of."
WikiLeaks says it's under the East Wing.
"Who wants to see the bowling alley, huh?"
"- Oh, my God."
"- How we doing, folks?"
He's going!
Take them away.
"Sister Renata, we have forced your foes to forsake the bodies of your sisters."
But we have discovered you are in a sinful pact with the devil.
"Confess your sin, apostate!"
I am not guilty of the sin which you have named.
Woe is us!
Get away from us!
"Sisters, come to your senses!"
Holy Sister Renata!
Holy Sister Renata!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
"- Back, insidious spirit!"
"You are the pure, innocent bride of a celestial angel."
"Pray for us, save us, deliver us from the Devil."
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
From this sister came all misfortunes.
From this sister came all devilish intrigues.
"Malign spirits, condemned and prohibited, banished, exiled,"
"I command and charge you, in the blinking of an eye, depart all of you who purvey iniquity..."
"You are holy and without sin, you save us sinners."
Sisters!
Sister Renata!
- Get away from me!
"Have pity, dark one!"
"Have pity, base one!"
"Have pity, terrible one!"
"Have pity, dreadful one!"
Have pity!
"Get out, black one!"
You think we're being bugged?
[Beeping stops]
"We aren't sure exactly what or who we're looking for out here, so I figured, we can't be sure who's looking for us."
"So, what tripped the alarm?"
Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.
"[Beeps, whirring]"
"[Beeping] Ah, ha ha ha."
I'll be damned.
Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.
Mm.
[Sighs]
Hello.
Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter to the watch's battery.
"You think it's CIA, left over from my Thailand mission?"
Possible.
Doubt we'll ever know for sure.
Can't we track down where it was purchased?
No.
"I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible."
"But we have to try, right?"
"I mean, it's why we're here."
[Knock on door]
Kendall.
Wow.
You certainly have baited the hook.
"I had to, especially considering it's gonna be two against one tonight."
What are you talking about?
"Come on, Rick."
I know you're gonna sneak into Austin's house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him.
"I'm no fool, but you are if you think your little plan will work without these."
Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.
Where'd you get those?
"-Yes, I do know."
"-First, you talk about a beating... and then we find out all you're discussing is a single blow."
Would you say that the arguments in the Lucas Cross house... were more or less violent than any other family arguments?
-Objection!
-What's the purpose of that question?
The witness must define her terms if the jury and this court... are to clearly understand what she means.
"A beating becomes one blow, a blow becomes a slap?"
Perhaps the slap will become something else.
Objection overruled.
-I have no further questions.
"-No questions, your Honor."
You may step down.
The prosecution would like to call Mrs. Constance MacKenzie.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Constance MacKenzie.
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've known the defendant a long time."
"Yes, since she was a baby."
Did Selena ever complained that her stepfather had beaten her... at any time?
-What?
-Did Selena ever complained...
"Oh, no."
No.
"Did you ever see any marks on her, injuries?"
No.
"You knew the defendant 's mother well, did you not?"
Nellie worked for me as a house maid.
Did she ever mentioned Lucas' brutality or... described any beating he had ministered?
"No, she said he was drunk and and lazy, and he deserted her..."
I have Pyrellic poisoning.
Sleer's doing.
There is an antidote that prevents the poison's spreading.
"As long as I take it daily I get no worse, but Sleer, of course, controls my supply."
- So long as you manufacture Pylene-50.
- That is the threat always over my head.
To work for Sleer or to die in agony.
"But, from time to time,"
"Commissioner Sleer comes in here to taunt me, to gloat."
"Now, thanks to my outdated nitroglycerine, Dayna,"
I am ready.
I hope Leitz comes as well.
He usually does.
- Leitz.
- Almost as vile a sadist as Sleer.
"Yes, I should like Leitz to be here."
Is something wrong?
But Leitz told us he worked for the resistance.
"But he didn't tell us about that booby-trap door, did he?"
"And he must have set Hunda up, too."
"That story about the monorail tunnel, it's all a trap."
We've got to tell Hunda and warn him.
"Forbus, we came here to get a sample of Pylene-50 in the hope that someone can devise..."
"Somebody already has, Tarrant."
"These block the effects of Pylene-50, but unfortunately can't reverse them."
And this is the written formula.
- Forbus...
"- Don't waste time thanking me, my friends."
You must hurry.
"- Flight commander wants clearance to launch, sir."
"- All right, go ahead."
"Strike leader, this is Control."
It's ok.
Well?
"He's gone, sir."
"All right go on, keep them back."
"All-powerful and mysterious God, we commend to you Alec, your servant."
Blot out the sins he has committed through human weakness.
This we ask through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

CLOSURE ENGLISH SUBTITLES WORK VERSION N°3
"This documentary was filmed from 1994 to 1996 during the NIN ""Self destruct"" tour."
"The hectic conditions of a rock and roll concert tour are less than ideal for film making, and as a result, the picture and sound quality in portions of this programs are compromised."

Nine Inch Nails i mean god damn them some long as nails.

"There, there's a lot..."
"They're the best fuckin thing that happened to music, alright ?"
Show them the rat bit you.
Rat bit me.
What are you guys gonna do with that picture ?
"Well, this is gonna be plaqued and put up in the cracker barrel."
"What we're gonna do, we're gonna have the picture there with like the rest of the groups autographs around there."
It's gonna go up with Gallagher's above the fireplace.
We want to keep it a good school.
Do you know what I mean?
- Yes sir.
"- No, you don't, son."
"You see, I've got these officers here, the school board, the newspapers..."
"the television and a whole lot of nasty, angry parents."
They all want to know something about what happened.
And you're the person who knows that something.
Right now you are standing between...
"me and my ability to keep this good school and I don't like that, son."
I don't like it when people do things to my school.
You get my meaning?
"So, why don't you tell us what was the noise that caused you..."
to come out of the bathroom?
"- Hey, Brian."
How are you doing?
- You actually know my name.
Of course I know your name.
How are they treating you Bri?
Baseball bats?
Electrodes attached to various parts of your anatomy?
Excuse me. I have a class.
J ust remember what happens to snitches.
"- Hey, Brian."
Are you okay?
"- Yes, sure."
I'm really sorry you're the person that has to deal with this.
- lt's no problem.
- Because you know...
"if you saw something, like somebody had a gun, then you should tell them."
"If you don't, you would be part of it and people are really scared, Brian."
"So, you should tell them if you saw anything."
Could I have been swarmed?
In my underwear too.
I could've been swarmed in my underwear.
Hey.
You don't get to put them pictures in my head.
- That's an assault on my imagination.
- What a horrible way to die.
Thousands of stingers stinging you.
Like secrets that don't sting once they keep stinging you until you're bloated and full of pus.
- Who wanted à la mode?
- Ah.
"Well, Kentucky was bloated and full of pus because she was sabotaging Betty's Bees."
"Kentucky had it in for Betty, but who had it in for Kentucky?"
The terrifying bee man.
What if he was made of bees?
That's why she couldn't see his face.
He didn't have one.
What if there's a whole bee-folk society who walk like people?
- You're thinking about how you can train bees to walk in people shapes?
- Yeah.
Ain't no bees walking around in no people shapes.
Kentucky was wiggity-wiggity-whacked.
- With a swarm of bees.
- Smells like an inside job.
Kentucky was talking to someone when Dusty was dropping eaves.
Someone who knew what she was doing and would wanna kill her for it.
"If it is an inside job, we gonna need an inside bee girl."
- No.
- We gotta tap this honey at the source.
Uh-huh.
"""Calling all Bee-Girls."""
"Under the nom de plume of Katherine ""Kitty"" Pimms  Chuck answered the call calling for Bee-Girls."
Why should I wait for that?
- Did you find anything?
- Searching the containers takes time.
- Then hire more people.
- It's not people we need.
We're still negotiating with a few less-than-cooperative shipping companies.
- Just solve the problem.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
I've spoken to the Board.
"Everyone wishes you the best, but we have no managing director, prices are dropping, rumours are rife."
"They can voice their complaints to me, otherwise, just do as I ask."
"I'm paying you to do as I ask, so, do it!"
That wasn't necessary.
- Here's the TV script.
- Thank you.
Neither the nanny nor Cart and Emilie's teachers have heard of the gap.
Isn't it just a game they've made up?
- Are they ready'?
- Yes.
The police called.
They advise against doing it.
No.
Come.
You can help save Emilie's life.
- I'm sure your voters will forgive you.
- I've already answered questions.
"As you know, Emilie's kidnapping is closely tied to an old murder case, which your friend, Assistant Public Prosecutor Schuitz was responsible for."
"I was appalled by the whole story, but I have explained our meeting."
- According to a witness...
- The meeting was about Louise Hjelby.
Seifert is totally unreliable.
Is he really the cause of this meeting?
- Have you had a fight?
Scum!
He came for beer.
I told him the store is shut.
He took it perforce
He even broke the statue of The Goddess!
Bloody half-caste!
"I say Lajjo, thank God that you and your daughters... haven't been marred by this British ness!"
"Else, you would've been nowhere!"
Dam these scoundrels!
"Set sail in stormy waters, and you're in danger of sinking"
You were so little when we brought you here.
And now...
They said that a grown-up daughter is a burden on a man
"But a daughter like you, makes a father's chest swell with pride!"
You're my good girl
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish
I want to take a look at Europe
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going
Please don't be cross.
"I have never disobeyed you, Babuji"
I'll be going away to a land I have never seen
The man I'm going to marry is a complete stranger.
But...
I have no complaints.
You must've considered it in my best interests
But I won't get a chance like this ever again.
I don't even know whether I'll ever come back... whether I will have these friends later on
"Besides, it's only for a month."
"In a month, I will have lived a lifetime"
- An elderly man blowing his hands.
Fore!
It landed near hole 6.
- Did I hit that family?
- They shouldn't bring the pram here.
"Go, go, go!"
We're in for it.
Take it easy.
- So Davis was wrong after all?
"- Well, I never did believe him."
And only a few yards from where he thought the tomb was.
- That's right.
"- Well, you deserve it, Monsieur Carter."
I shall come and inspect the tomb tomorrow.
This is a most excellent day for our department and for the country.
I shall arrange storage facilities at the Cairo Museum.
No.
It's far too early to involve the museum.
"Whatever we do, nothing must be rushed."
These things are precious.
I understand.
All care will be taken.
I'm putting together a team of experts.
I've already contacted the Metropolitan Museum as well as our own British specialists.
This is a huge task.
Please do not forget there are national interests to be considered.
That may be so but this must be preserved for all posterity.
That is far more important than the concerns of any single nation.
"And as His Lordship's field director, I intend to ensure that the correct procedures are followed at all times."
I hope that's clear.
"This is an Egyptian tomb, Monsieur Carter."
And she doesn't let him get away with anything.
She was his wife when he met her.
They're the blue stabilizers.
Ugh!
See?
"Yeah, well, it's just boring now, isn't it?"
They're boringers.
They're blue...
Boringers.
"Doctor, how come she can fly the TARDIS?"
You call that flying the TARDIS?
Ha!
"River Song is better at operating the TARDIS than the Doctor is and, for the first time, you see the Doctor actually being quite put out by that."
Charted the ship to its destination and...
Parked us right alongside.
"""Parked"" us?"
You haven't landed.
Of course we've landed.
I just landed her.
But...
It didn't make the noise.
What noise?
"You know, the --"
It's not supposed to make that noise -- you leave the brakes on.
"Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise."
I love that noise.
"I like that the classic noise that we all associate with the TARDIS, the fact that my ringtone is that noise, turns out that it's a mistake."
I imagine that that was just a nice little Steven Moffat gem for people who have watched the show for so long.
[ Wheeze
"What's great about river is that she's this mysterious character and, generally, when the mystery is taken away from a character, they become less interesting."
River becomes more interesting.
"A lovely twist is when River Song is about to be shot by Amy Pond and, suddenly, River Song says,"
"Next time you miss a payment, ladies, we'II bury you alive in matching wicker coffins."
Am I dreaming this?
"What do you think, hilary?"
Is Joyce dreaming?
"Were you on the receiving end of cunnilingus from Robert KiIroy silk, Joyce?"
You...you just blew up The Wicker Barn.
"technically, Joyce, it was actually you who blew it up."
"I, I..."
"That's it, Joyce."
Let it all out.
Those women could have been killed.
"Goodness me, no."
LiIIian can blow the door off a Smeg fridge without so much as damaging an organic vine tomato.
Why?
Why did you do it?
"Let me ask you a simple question, Joyce."
Why did you move to little Stempington?
"Jeremy was posted here and, can't quite believe I'm saying this now, but..."
Yes?
"When we came to look around, I fell in love with the place."
Oh.
Because it's clean?
Because there's no graffiti?
Because there are no delinquent teenagers sniffing toilet Duck in the arcade?
And how d'you think it stays that way?
"Ooh, hello, Wendy, love."
Is that a My little Pony lunch box?
"Pop in the back and sit next to Auntie MiIIie, darling."
"You see, now your fingerprints are all over this little box, Joyce, you're the prime..."
"No, you're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn."
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, gosh, you don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the cIick-cIink for the next ten years, do you?"
"WHen He starts playing, you go¸:"
"""where does a person learn to play like that..."
"""...when nobody else is playing like that?"""
I was in tHe military during the Korean War.
Many younger actors bad been drafted in tbe service and tbey were tbere.
David Janssen was a little buddy of mine.
"So I thought¸: ""Well, I'll maybe try it. """
THe impression I Had was of a kid kind of really groping around for who He was.
"Even acting was something that, you know, kind of Happened to Him."
"Tbe tbree young men featured in tbis scene Rex Reason, Grant williams and clint Eastwood were discovered and developed right here on our lot."
"Just like all tbe otber people, be didn't know wbat be was talking about."
Tbat's funny.
You'd tbink be'd know sometbing.
He's as blind as you are.
"WHen I was signed at Universal, actually He was in tHe class."
The result tbat tbey wanted were stars then.
And tbey wanted to mold tbem into elegant women and He-men.
And Clint was a perfect subject for that because He was a phenomenal listener.
Was He interested in acting?
I think very much so.
"THey weren't exactly the HigH-grade pictures of the day, but they were experience."
Dropping napalm.
follow an order.
"Hey, I tbink I bear surf."
"Yeab, I feel a ground swell."
Tbe beach must be dead abead.
"Dr. bell's waiting for bim in surgery, sir."
"-Wbat is it, will?"
"-TeIepbone, Dr. Parker."
those contract players were just....
You were just journeymen.
You were there to be called upon.
"Apparently, your marine was stabbed, and based on the granulation tissue and the degree of healing,"
I'd say this happened three or four days ago.
He stitch himself up?
Appears so.
Should've gone to the hospital.
"It's a pretty deep wound, but he didn't go."
That means he didn't want the authorities to find out who stabbed him.
"And if this attack is somehow connected to the crash that killed him, then..."
"Like I said, it's not an accident."
Everybody's hiding something about this case.
"Apparently, even Jared."
(chuckles) That seems to be going around.
Loretta...
I'm sorry.
But I wasn't hiding anything from you.
I assumed that Sebastian came to you before he came to me.
"Truth is, I'd offered the position to Gregorio first."
And she turned you down?
"Wasn't the right fit for her, I guess."
"So when Sebastian surprised me, said he wanted to become an agent, I..."
"Dwayne, I'm not mad at you or Sebastian."
I always knew he'd come out of his shell sooner or later.
"The truth is,"
I think you need to worry more about
"Sebastian driving you crazy in the field, if I were you."
(laughs) Good possibility of that.
"Come on, go."
You got your hands full.
"You don't have to worry about me, too."
"I always got time for that, Loretta."
(sighs)
"There must be over $100,000 in here, huh?"
and there was coverage on the troops in Afghanistan.
She swears to me that she saw me.
"After that point, she became obsessed with politics."
And that's when she first saw you.
The man that was gonna bring Daddy home.
"And when I finally did come home, I realised that.."
I'm not her hero anymore.
So I guess I just figured that I'd try to help protect the man that is.
"Well, if she saw you today, Cale, she'd be proud of you."
You know how when they're young and they come running up to you..
"and they hug you and they're shouting ""Daddy"".."
"and all of a sudden, one day, that just stops?"
Yeah.
I'd give anything for that hug just one more time.
"You know, my daughter, she's 15 years old, her name is Amber."
You know what she wants for her birthday?
A belly button ring.
Belly button ring.
What parent is equipped for that?
Daughters.
What'shappening?
"Attention, attention."
"Everyone below Calico T11, please clear the ﬂoor immediately."
Put the president onscreen.
"Mr. President, Delta Force entered Washington airspace."
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron on the line.
"You're online, sir!"
"What do you have for us, colonel?"
We developed this plan independent of the Secret Service.
We'll use the superstructure of the city to mask our approach.
What if they start killing hostages?
They're dead anyway if this fails.
"What are you talking about, for Christ's sake?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"There haven't been more than 1 00 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there.
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.
In other words: normal.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
I mean to L.A.
"No, I...."
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
"When I touch your forehead, open your eyes."
"Are you comfortable, Regan?"
Hello?
I got accepted to Florida University.
"You mean to tell me, that you got in without hacking into the computer system... and making it all happen like you usually do?"
"All by myself, just like a big boy."
I see you guys later.
Where are you going?
What's wrong man?
Time to celebrate!
Touchy subject.
"""What are we all doing tonight?"""
Katie.
"Katie, you work at Hybra Tech don't you?"
I bet you see all sorts of examples of these scientific processes.
"Actually, I work in the monitoring station in security."
Hybra Tech is a classic example of a company... whose goods and services constantly udelices... the scientific discovery processes.
"They create almost everything, from processed cheese to napalm."
A very unfortunate part in the scientific processes is failure.
"In simple terms, you can not make a omelette without breaking a few eggs"
Where are you going?
Get back to your seat please.
What is going on here?
Julian parents was 2 of the volunteers that died last year at Hybra Tech... they where in a car-wreck.
Julian!
wait.
She didn't know.
It's cool...
They been on my mind a lot lately.
It's been really hard on my brother too.
I am so sorry.
Thanks...
I'll be alright.
"Well, well, well..."
What have we here?
"- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe."
"It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham."
"I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too."
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee.
"That's what it is, Mitchell."
"What's Thuggee, sir?"
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed 50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
"There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year."
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
"The order was religious and worshipped Kali, the goddess of blood."
"The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?"
Stranglers.
They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
"Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately."
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
"- What do we do, sir?"
"- You're dismissed, Ballantine."
"MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger..."
"Ballantine, you're dismissed."
"You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work."
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
"Ballantine would be a great help, sir."
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
"Yes, sir."
He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
neat and tidy.
"But I never knew, until now, who kept them that way: me""!"
"Yeah, the boys are certainly getting around these days."
I've had a V-mail letter just the other day from Norman Page.
-You remember Norman?
"-Oh, sure!"
He said something about...
He dug a foxhole so deep it was just short of desertion.
And then the seasons spun by so fast they've seen to become one.
The war news was too big to grasp and too unhappy to understand.
Selena wrote me often about Peyton Place.
and I treasured her letters.
She always tried to mention my mother... and tell me what people were saying to each other.
Orwere not saying.
"Eventually,I broke the ice of my intentions... and subscribed to the ""Peyton Place Times""."
"Iwas hungry for names that meant something to me... but among them,unhappily,came the names of those gone forever."
Betty...
Rodney asked me to take care of you.
-I don't need your help.
-But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years-old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought of anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but..."
"Rodney liked flashy girls, so that's the way I was going to be."
Funny thing is Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him.
But you taught him appearance was worth more than feelings.
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's...
Let's keep of what's left of the family together.
"No, a little brighter one, please."
I have to get out of this as soon as possible.
My kids are still young...
They would be shocked if they knew their dad was suspected of murder.
"I just remembered, it's my oldest daughter's birthday today."
And it's just going to pass by like this.
Even though us meeting at Chung Gye Plan was an ill-fated relationship...
What was an ill-fated relationship?
We... got along like blood brothers.
We did?
- When?
"- Wow, seriously..."
"But I was thankful that you gave me 150,000 won more than the others..."
So I will repay you with this favor.
Hey...
Thanks.
"For us, as a life mentor and his apprentice..."
"We shared a lot with each other, don't you think?"
- When?
"- Oh, seriously..."
There will be moments when you suddenly remember these things...
I will go with Chan Gyu tomorrow morning.
We've been working together all along.
The remaining one percent that's crawling out...
I have that too.
"Anything I'm doing with Jung Yeon, I know I can do to the best of my ability."
What?
How should we understand this relationship?
What is there to understand?
We're friends.
"Well, more than friends..."
"I guess we should say, best friends?"
Aren't we all friends now?
"You should see a doctor, Arthur."
Too much sand in the lungs.
That's the real curse of the pharaohs.
I'll be fine once we're away from Egypt.
I shall miss it dreadfully.
(Soldier shouting orders)
Monsieur Carter.
I am sorry that it has come to this.
I must ask you for the key to the tomb.
The refusal to work is in contravention of the terms of the concession.
My department will now take responsibility and overall control of the tomb and the excavation.
You mean you're kicking me out?
"I warned you, Monsieur Carter."
I've already spoken with the minister.
He's in full agreement with me.
"The key, if you please."
"The soldiers were hardly necessary, you know."
"Have I done the right thing, Arthur?"
You did what you believed to be right.
(Phone ringing)
Carter.
OPERATOR:
"Mr Carter, I have Monsieur Lacau for you from Cairo."
HOWARD:
The situation in Egypt has changed.
The nationalist campaign of violence has backfired.
The government are concerned.
The hotel trade is vital to them and they're worried about losing tourists.
Lacau is keen to reopen the tomb.
But he needs an international team to do it and he's asked me to go back.
"Under his proposal,"
I see that I remain responsible for the costs of the excavation.
No.
Just not to eat beef.
"If my behaviour was improper, I should be sensible of it."
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?
"If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove impropriety, we are all offending."
"Good morning, Colonel."
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.
If you would care to join us on Thursday next.
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband are travelling up especially.
"We should be delighted, Colonel."
"I will, of course, be including Mr. Willoughby in the party."
I should be delighted to join you.
"Good morning, Miss Dashwood."
"Good morning, Colonel."
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.
Her romantic prejudices tend to set propriety at naught.
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.
"The sooner she is acquainted with the ways of the world, the better."
I knew a lady with the same sweetness of temper -
- Who was forced into a better acquaintance with the world.
The result was only ruination and despair.
This world will be better off without you.
One less Divergent ruining everything.
"And no one will ever, ever forgive you for what you've done."
You're wrong.
Mus sens)
Because I will.
(SCOFFS)
(GUNFIRE)
ELECTRONIC VOICE;
Amity Sim complete.
Wait!
No!
Stop!
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Initializing message.
Hello.
I come from outside the wall.
Where we have all but destroyed each other.
We designed your city as an experiment.
We believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.
And we created factions to ensure peace.
But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions.
These will be the Divergent.
They are the true purpose of this experiment.
They are vital to humanity's survival.
"If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded."
The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.
We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.
But you're not.
Mankind waits for you with hope
beyond the wall.
You Okay?
You have a... gentleman friend?
"Vastra, what's happening?"
"The snow is highly localised, and on this occasion not naturally occurring."
It's coming out of that cab parked by the gates.
"Sir, one pulver grenade would blow these snowmen to smithereens."
"They're made of snow, Strax, they're already smithereens."
"See, Clara - our friends again."
Clara?
Who's Clara?
Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid called Clara.
That's the way to do it!
Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculpture impersonating Mr Punch.
"Jenny, what have you got?"
Should hold it.
"Sir, this room - one observational window on the line of attack and one defendable entrance."
"Right, everyone in there now, move it."
You - carry her.
Nice to see you off your cloud and engaging again.
"I'm not engaging again, I'm under attack."
"You missed this, didn't you?"
Argh!
Argh!
Shut up!
"Strax, how long have we got?"
They're not going to attack.
They made no attempt to conceal their arrival.
An attack force would never abandon surprise so easily - and they're clearly in a defence formation.
"Well done, Straxie, still got it!"
"Sir, please do not noogie me during combat prep."
So there's something here they want.
The Ice Woman.
Exactly.
"- Okay, sit down."
"We are not in this battle alone, I've enlisted the aid... of a very valued ally."
Deep Throat?
He was instrumental in cracking the case of the missing Manolo Blahnik.
"Roxette, do you really think we need the Deep Throat?"
Why can't we just find the Yuri within ourselves?
"Call me silly, but I have a hunch it might be..."
- Pierre Larroux.
- Nonsense!
"Pierre may be an obsequious, ass-licking meretricious... sick offend, but Yuri he's not."
He's off to a secret shoot... for Vogue.
- What?
- Lies!
He'd better not be.
"Ok, now let's move on."
Cornelia?
"Chi Chi, any trend report from the front?"
"I heard from the chef at ""Daveé"", who heard from his boyfriend... who works backstage at Galliano, with Orlando Pitta... whose blow drier system just came from the Gautier show... that his next collection will be revolutionary."
The girls will come out on the catwalk... in wheelchairs.
Wheelchair chic?
- Genius!
- Inspirational.
I think Da Vinci did sketches of wheelchair prototypes.
- We can use those for the layout.
- I have goose bumps.
Nine pages!
"Jocelyn, I see you put your name down for the..."
"""make your own video"" booth."
Do you know?
I think I'm gonna join you on that one.
"Paul, Jocelyn, why don't you guys run over to Gustav's studio now... and I'll be there in a few minutes All right?"
Just sit tight.
"Magnum, P.I.?"
"I'm Barbara Terranova from Bayonne, New Jersey."
"Your answering machine said I could find you here, so I came right over."
"Hi, Barbara Terranova."
I'm Rick.
"I, uh, manage this club."
This is T.C. The fella you're looking for is standing right behind you with the baseball hat on.
Figures.
"I've only been here two days, but already I know everything in Hawaii is a little cuckoo."
Oh...
Maybe you'd like to step out on the beach where we can talk more privately.
"Magnum, I'm gonna be up front."
I have enough cash to pay your salary for one day... exactly one day.
So I gotta have results in 24 hours.
What do you say?
"I'm sorry, Miss Terranova, but no respectable private investigator... can guarantee a one-day result."
"Well, almost none."
I know.
That's what they all said.
All?
I phoned every investigator in the phone book.
Oh.
"Well, alphabetically, of course."
"Thomas, we gotta do something with your listing."
We gotta move it up or somethin'.
I just figured I could count on you somehow.
"I mean, your voice on your answering machine was so sympathetic."
I quit my job back in Bayonne at the Firmer Body in Ten Days Exercise Salon... and I spent all my savings on new outfits and a plane ticket one way.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
"Once I said yes, it was like punching a clock."
Barbara barely gave me time to shower and change into some gear I kept at the club.
"I wanted to grab a cab back to the estate and pick up the Ferrari, but she said that would be a waste of her time and money."
Or are you sad that you're separating?
I'm frustrated because the command is unfair.
"You said that you always follow a command.-This command is not by the Commander, but as a father."
This melodrama with the entrance of Yoon Myeong Joo's father means they're still in the screening procedure.
I've been curious since before
How did Myeong Joo and Master Sergeant Seo meet?
Fighting Team!
Fighting!
--Fighting!
"There was a joint march, and Yoon Myeong Joo was the Army Surgeon on service at that time."
"I'll carry the military gear for you, so I'll kill you if you give up."
"Yes, I understand!"
- Go on up.
This is the third time you're here.
What's wrong?
- Take off your boots.
"It's great being the duty officer and first in your squadron, but you can be discharged from this military due to the current state of your feet."
Staff Sergeant Seo Dae Yeong.
"Even if I do get discharged, I am determined to be first."
"I hope your determination to get first place isn't to get permission for a vacation, so that you can crash your ex-girlfriend's wedding."
"Nothinglikethat,right?"
That's right.
Really?
Really.
Get out.
Why here?
We're going to that sea from earlier.
It'll be better to go before we get busy.
You said that it's far.
Because it's far.
I want to be with you for a long time.
It's over here.
"Now, inside this Ark is a relic of Atlantis itself."
The Torch of Truth.
Where is the director with his key to open the blasted display case?
"Uh, professor,"
Kelly discovered something you might want to--
Professor Atticus.
I've just been on the phone to the Balkan Embassy.
They say that you and Mr. MacGyver are thieves.
"Oh, do you hear that, MacGyver?"
"First we are spies, now we are thieves."
"They claim the Ark is a national treasure, and demand its return."
You can't return it to those butchers.
It belongs to the world.
You have no say in the matter.
"I'll remind you, Professor Atticus, that you no longer work here."
"Oh, Mr. Director, this Ark contains the missing link to Atlantis, an unknown chapter in history."
If you'll just open the display case and let us get hold of that medallion.
"Excuse me, can I see that?"
The medallion's magnetic.
"Yeah, so's the Ark."
A magnetic lock and key.
Impossible.
The people of Solon's time had no concept of the physics of magnetism.
"Ah, but legend says the people of Atlantis did, and Solon somehow must have learned it from them."
Pure speculation.
Ha-ha-ha!
You won't think so when you see what's inside this Ark.
"That's it, this is it."
This is it.
It works.
"It works, it works."
"Oh, after all these years, MacGyver."
How can you call that a physical?
!
That was nothing but sexual harrassment!
"I check not only your physical capabilities, but your attitude towards your work, as well as how you express yourself."
I find it extremely insulting to have my actions labeled as sexual harrassment.
"I am a neuter, and do not possess any sexual appetite."
Do you feel it is harrassment when you undergo an X-ray or endoscopic exam?
"If that is the case, you are laughable."
You rotten robot!
Penalty!
Penalty!
"Any resistance will be viewed as negligence of duty, and will result in a penalty."
Do you understand?
D-damn you...!
Do you understand?
"Okay, okay!"
I will look forward to your cooperation.
"Ms. Hitomi, your brain waves show agitation."
Please relax.
I am!
Would you like to take a tranquilizer?
Shut up!
Please remove your clothes.
Why?
Isn't this good enough?
Remove your clothes quickly.
You lecherous robot!
"Okay, okay..."
"Your bra, too."
Huh?
Do not remove your socks.
Huh?
- No.
What is your verdict?
Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
"Your, erm, dinner invitation."
- You're a married man.
- This is it.
I think Danny Waldron purposely created a trail of evidence and now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
Dale Roach.
He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.
The things that he did to us at Sands View...
"I promise you, I will get these bastards."
Bains killed Danny.
I'll lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.
- Hello?
- 'You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.'
"If you want a way out, you'll listen to me."
Did he ever mention any other names?
Politicians?
Coppers?
Single-handedly brings in an AFO.
Well done.
'I'd just like to get on with my life.'
Miss Denton.
"I'm Gill Bigelow, legal counsel to AC-12."
I imagine they keep you VERY busy.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As part of a new initiative, christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
"regina just left,"
Which is probably a good thing
Considering how she's been acting these days.
"Yeah, i just saw her flying out of the house for her morning jog."
"I called after her, but she just kept running."
- Oh.
- Kind of like she does in life in general.
"Georgia: well, she probably couldn't hear you"
Because she's got on her ipod.
It's a good thing she got out of here when she did.
Things were getting a little heated in here.
- What happened?
"- Well, we had a little tiff"
About regina and her taste for the good life.
"Well, that's nothing new."
I meant what happened to all the furniture?
"Oh, i'm not surprised that she didn't tell you."
She lost her job
About six months ago.
- What?
"- She's broke,"
Stubborn and won't let me help her.
And they repossessed her car too.
And today we got a foreclosure notice on the house.
"Now i've gotta do something,"
Because i am not going to be homeless
Because of her bad decisions.
"Well, i was coming over to tell her some good news,"
But i guess she won't be in the mood to appreciate it.
"Oh, give it to me, because i do need it."
"But just don't tell me you found a new woman,"
Because that won't be good news for her or me.
That's Vince.
Vince Nelson.
Why are you looking for him?
Becaushe was killed.
When was the last time you saw him?
Last night.
He comes here every Thursday night for a lesson.
Exactly what do you teach?
Private salsa lessons?
Is that what they call it these days?
"No, these were legit."
Nelson wanted to surprise his wife for their fifth anniversary.
Take her out dancing.
And our Salsa instructor had a client right after Nelson who corroborated her alibi.
"Mac, I found something on Coach Nelson's computer you should see."
This kid can't be more than ten years old.
It gets worse.
All right.
These photos were attached to an e-mail that Nelson sent out to seven of his wrestling students.
******
"This e-mail went out at 4:00 P.M.Three hours later, Vince Nelson was dea"
You think we just found our motive?
Someone may've gotten this e-mail and snapped.
"But if the Coach Nelson was a pedophile, why would he incriminate himself by sending it outo members of his own team?"
Maybe he molested some of these boys before and knew they wouldn't tell.
The whole thing makes me sick.
No.
Pedophiles usually download photos and trade with other short eyes.
"If that's the case, I'm betting there's more where these came from."
Find them.
"We had one victim, but now we have two."
This boy is too young to be a student at Hillridge High.
"You see, it's important having a system."
"When one creates a system, he doesn't need every piece of data on his disposal."
The system is what counts.
It shows everything.
"You've heard about probability and statistics, have you?"
It never fails.
"For me, the most important is to know the number of crimes in Zagreb."
The quantity of each type.
Where they happened.
The newspapers only prove something that I already know in my own way.
"Strange, isn't it?"
"No, no..."
Statistics is generally...
How far are you ready to go?
"You mean, in depth or width?"
- Well...
"In width, for instance."
"You see, I have data for Trnje."
I begun from here.
"I have an insight into quarters, streets, houses..."
Almost the apartments.
"Maybe it's too ambitious speaking about this, but maybe it should be expanded to whole Zagreb and its suburbia."
"I have a lot of data about that, too."
And then even wider.
"Say Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Varaždin, etc."
That's fantastic!
What about the depth?
What may be the depth of it?
That's more of a philological question!
The question is: what's a crime?
What should be considered an offense?
I thought you were taking the basis of law into account.
I know that I say that I could make a haul worldwide delicious parking in the city.
But I am not a good God
"I am his secretary, all."
One more thing.
I am not as those of your world.
Come.
Did I leave it where you want.
Tell him that your friend Minister
I clean up the city by yourself?
Who defend the law against the law?
"Instigate those carrion against each other, is an art ... seldom rewarded."
"Then, about a medal?"
I tell everything.
I can not leave you more closely.
A sweet?
Do not swallow the pit.
You still lack one last detail.
"Marie, I found less than one year."
I am his father.
"Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,"
"Albania, Egypt, the war!"
"Albania, war!"
"Egypt, Nicaragua!"
I often dream this strange and shocking for a woman unknown and I love and who loves me ...
"Do not miss this tender time, sweetness to be or not be ... because I have lived nell'attendere and my heart was not that your hand."
"Be wise, my pain, stay more calm."
"Relied on the evening falls, here it is."
"A dark envelops the city bringing about a peace, to those who worry the ..."
It is from within hours with the dog.
I do not want to disconnect?
"Do not open more eyes, does not say anything."
Try to shake shit.
No.
"And you think he'd be just a little bit grateful, show some appreciation for my personal growth."
He only listens to Kirsten and Sandy.
"Well, the woman I married wouldn't stand for that."
Nobody puts Julie Cooper in the corner.
I don't know how this is happening again.
- Maybe 'cause you keep marrying for money?
- I did not marry for money.
"- Well, I didn't marry you for money."
"- No, you married me because you were pregnant."
You married me because I was pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.
"- Bye, Dad."
"- Bye, sweetheart."
- Love you.
"- I love you, too."
Back to the gulag.
"Oh, KE equals one half MB squared."
"So if gravity is the constant, and we plug in these velocities..."
"- Ryan, what are you doing?"
- Trying to do the assignment.
- Except you've already finished it.
"- If you flunk out of Harvard, you can spend the rest of your life floating in your paren"
"- I need an academic scholarship, so..."
"- Okay, what makes you think my parents have an infinity pool?"
"I mean, they do, but they're not my parents."
I transferred in from Chino last year.
- I was just like you.
- Really?
You were assaulted by the Captain of the water polo team.
"Okay, first of all, I've never even seen a water polo game, match, whatever."
"Second of all, yeah, I was."
"Tony, where are you?"
He's coming in again.
I can only see a light.
That's all.
Now it's...
Going black.
Now it's...
Completely gone.
[machines beeping]
He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes
As he struggles to regain consciousness.
"His output is so great,"
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.
But he's dangerous.
"Once I have control of his brain, Letha,"
He will only be dangerous to others.
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
"My experiments are more important than the law, Letha."
"With these receptors placed on certain people,"
"Combined with this boy's powers,"
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.
"Oh, you are absolutely brilliant, professor."
"Now we can go ahead with my plans, too."
Don't bother me with your plans.
"They're empty, unimportant."
"A comment, perhaps, on you and the life you've been leading."
"Now, you look here,"
"Doctor, professor, physicist."
Whatever you are.
I built this laboratory for you at great expense.
I used every penny I had.
LAUGHTER
I see.
LAUGHTER
Let's see how many of our 100 people said jizz.
It's a correct answer.
And it gets you through.
APPLAUSE
"And that scores you seven, which takes your total up to 11."
Richard?
"Yeah, uh, jizz is of course, it's, uh..."
"Everybody knows, it's the characteristic first impression you get of a plant or animal."
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
"My mother gets confused between, like, certain words with Zs in them, like pizzazz."
"And so one time she met one of my friends, and he's not very entertaining."
"She was like ""I don't like him."
"He had no jizz in him, you know?"""
LAUGHTER
"I had to explain to her what jizz was and she was like,"
"""Yeah, I don't think he had any of that, either."""
"Got a bit of an issue with you, mate."
"I've done The Cube, I've done The Chase, never done Pointless."
"You did a comedian's special, I wasn't invited on."
"Yeah, it was a comedian special."
Oh.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
"OK, ""Most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show."""
"David, what do you think?"
"There is the spectrum of quiz shows which has, we'll say Catchphrase, Family Fortunes at one end, and then say Only Connect, University Challenge at the other end."
"At one end, if you don't answer all of them correct, you can't sleep that night, and at the other end if you get one of them right in your life, you retire, so..."
LAUGHTER The irony is...
"The irony is the easier they are, the more money you earn."
"How could a subject ignore the King's command, and how co n such insolent man be allowed to lead the military?"
"Your Majesty, criminal of high treason Yi Soon-shin must be executed!"
"Defending high treason is also high treason, hence there must be consequences for the Left Minister Yu Sung-ryong as well."
"No, Your Majesty!"
Sincere council cannot be confused with treason!
Are you trying break my will as well?
Your Majesty...
Leave!
Your Majesty!
I said leave!
Do not attempt to break my will!
Or you will be punished regardless of who you are!
How foolish they are!
If in excess even nectar is poison.
What do they think they can gain by acting like they care more about the country than the King?
His Majesty will forsake Yu Sung-ryong as well.
"The world is as good as yours now, Minister Yoon."
Not yet.
I need the two of you to fight the Japanese and win for me.
"You don't have to worry, Minister Yoon."
I am counting on you.
You had once admonished me telling me that the world hasn't changed.
Do you recall?
How about now?
Has the world changed now?
"No, Your Majesty."
Nothing has changed.
Where is the Left Minister?
Your Majesty...
Is he still by Yi Soon-shin's side?
"I'm afraid so, Your Majesty."
Minister Yu... the heavens will not forsake you.
She said she was going to.
I assumed she had.
Who's Gina Gilbert?
I don't--
She's a girl I know.
"Just a friend, that's all."
"She a friend of Merle's, too."
Objection.
"Your Honor, if counselor gets much farther afield, we'll--"
"I'll discontinue this line of questioning, Your Honor."
And I'm finished with this witness...
for the moment.
"You're excused, Mr. Pierce."
"Call your next witness, Mr. Burger."
Then I call Mr. Julian Kirk.
That's right.
My house is next door.
It was the guest house on the estate when my grandmother was alive.
She left it to me in her will.
Was that all she left you?
Some other odds and ends of property.
All the real money went to Olivia-- I mean Merle.
Then you were familiar with the situation that existed at the Langley house?
I was certainly aware of how completely Olivia dominated Merle.
It's not the girl's fault she's neurotic.
"Are you by any chance a trained psychiatrist, Mr. Kirk?"
"Well, no, but all you--"
Then you're certainly not qualified to judge the defendant's mental condition.
"Now, then, was your knowledge of the situation of the house next door based on personal observation?"
Mostly.
"But the chauffeur kept me informed, too."
Did you witness a quarrel between the defendant and her aunt a couple of days prior to the murder?
"[""Stompin' At The Savoy'""]"
?
[ Fades ]
Mr. Caine?
Magnum.
I appreciate your meeting me like this.
"Well, to be honest with you, sir, I was rather flattered."
I've never met a justice of the Supreme Court before.
You haven't met one yet.
"I haven't accepted the nomination, and even if I do, it'll have to be confirmed by Congress."
"Well, from what I hear, that's just a formality, sir."
"Well, perhaps."
"After Robin Masters recommended you, I, uh, got some friends in Washington to pull out your military record."
Makes for pretty good reading.
"Personally, I find it rather boring, sir."
"Annapolis, class of'67."
Three tours in Vietnam.
Twice wounded.
"Mr. Caine, did you come here for my help, or are you trying to get me to re-up?"
- I need your help.
"- Well, pulling my 201 file isn't exactly a polite way to ask for it."
"I had to find out what kind of a man you were, just how far I could trust you."
"The only recommendation I had was Robin's, and let's face it, he is a novelist."
And you thought he might've lied to you...
the way you lied to him?
"Mr. Caine, Robin said you were looking for an old war buddy you thought might still be living in the Islands."
You wouldn't have pulled my service records for something as simple as that.
"Magnum, I, uh--"
I did lie to Robin.
"I want you to find a woman, a woman who disappeared 40 years ago."
- Forty years?
- And you've gotta find her in the next 2 4 hours.
- Of course.
"If it were easy or... aesthetically pleasing, then everyone would do it."
You and I are aligned in our ambitions.
My life's work is transformation.
"I can give you the freedom you desire, but you will need to trust my methods, unorthodox though they may seem."
Everything that happens at Rosewood... is done of one's own free will.
If you're brave and you're willing I can help you become the person that you wish to be.
"Are you brave, Miss Isabel Porter?"
- I want to be.
Yes.
- Good.
Come in.
"Miss Oaks, Dr. Lemelle."
- We're going to be moving you into new quarters.
- May I ask why?
- Dr. Cairn believes that the first step in your rehabilitation is to cast aside old vanities.
"- You're ashamed, yes?"
- Uh...
"- Oh, dear, that is precisely the point."
- Shame is a fallacy imposed upon us by society.
It needs to be excised from the mind like any malignant disease.
- Indeed.
It's time that you demonstrated some responsibility for your own treatment.
- I will do whatever it takes.
- Will you?
- Of course.
- Good.
Doctor.
"- Ah, thank you, Gunther."
- Miss Porter.
- What is this?
- This is your new concoction.
"a boy, 8 years old, and a young girl of 5."
Seems the farmer was more concerned with the hardship of replacing them than the welfare of the children.
"These Home Children, they were orphan workers, sent there as cheap labour."
They were often very mistreated.
"Whatever the reason they may have left, these could be the two children Mr. de Jaager saw in the woods."
"The girl could be Fen, sir."
"The timeline matches, this is 13 years ago."
It says the boy was mute.
"Sir, that's probably why the wolves caught him."
The poor thing couldn't cry out to scare them away.
"Wolves are like that, sir, they'll go for the weakest of the bunch."
Perhaps she tried to save him and almost got herself mauled to death.
"If I'm needed, I'll be at the Asylum."
- Check into that detail.
- Julia.
I believe I've discovered the origin of Fen's gestures.
- You have?
- She ran away with a boy who was mute.
- Pardon?
"- Right, uh, sorry."
George found a report of two Home Children who ran away in roughly the area where Hugo de Jaager says he spotted two feral children.
They would have been about 8 and 5 at the time.
Wasn't the boy 11 when he was killed by wolves?
"Yes, and Mr. Travis figures that Fen was about 8 when he found her."
The two of them survived all that time alone.
Perhaps they developed this language to communicate with each other.
"That's extraordinary, William."
- (Fen grunting)
- Fen?
Fen.
This man.
Man...
Corneal tissue samples from the eyes of each victim.
Mr. Brewer's on the left and Mrs. Brewer's on the right.
Mrs. Brewer's has many more macrophages.
That's right.
It's a natural immunological response to a foreign substance.
Huh.
The white blood cells in Mr. Brewer's sample are completely normal.
Plain English--his eyes didn't react to the glue.
Plainer English-- he was already dead when it happened.
Garcia's not coming up with much.
The Brewer family was well-liked.
No known enemies.
What about registered sex offenders in the area?
There's over a thousand in Wichita alone.
Garcia's checking them out.
Agent Hotchner.
The body of a young boy was just found.
Where?
"Prairie Creek Road, a few miles from the crime scene."
The description matches Ronnie Brewer.
"The child's body has not yet been identified, but there is growing fear that it could be Ronnie Brewer, the boy missing from the attack here in Wichita last night."
Stay tuned--
"Hey, Hotch, we're done here."
It's definitely Ronnie.
I recognize him from the family photos.
Body temperature and state of rigor indicates that he's been dead 7 to 8 hours.
So he must have been killed immediately after the abduction.
It doesn't make sense.
All the effort put into taking him.
"Well, maybe the compulsion is about the pursuit of the child rather than the child itself."
"Well, if that's the case, he's gonna try again soon, with someone else."
Josie!

"Fuck, Fuck !"
"Fucking Fedex idiot, huh."
Welcome to New York...
"It's split in a funny fucking way, the bone's chipped and..."
that's what poked the fingernail off.
Stabbed in the back of my Face...
He needed to stick a needle in the palm of my hand.
The needle has webs in it.
"So, his concern is:"
"a) I can play it all or b) what if I start playing, I don't know how to send, my finger is in a bloody mess,"
"I can't feel it, that's not gonna make a good show, so what do you think about it and what to do right now?"
"So I was thinking, you know... if it was one, Tracy or somebody can play."
Today at the soundcheck proved that Tracy doesn't know the stuff to play those parts.
"If you can't do, you can't do that, fuck it."
If I got my throat cut out we wouldn't play the show either.
So fuck it.
Clear the path!
We're in pursuit of enemy vessels!
Who ordered the pursuit?
They are enemy vessels!
They must be captured!
Turn your men around!
It is Commander Yu Jong's order!
Now!
What?
They will be expecting it.
Arrest them!
They are certain to be Japanese spies!
Sir!
What is the meaning of this!
How dare you intercept a missive to the King!
You will be hung for this!
"They were sneaking away in darkness, so I thought they were Japanese spies."
What has happened?
"Perhaps you could ask the emissary, sir."
"Admiral, I demand that you punish this man immediately!"
"Your Majesty, Supreme Naval Commander Yi Soon-shin takes your royal command lightly and refuses to obey Commander Yu Jong."
"Also, relying on his military power and large following, he looks upon the King and the royal court with contempt and moves his troops without restraint."
Hence it is advised that Yi and his men be charged with treason.
How dare you!
You will be charged with treason as well!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!
Yes.
Treason?
Did you say treason?
Very well.
Then I will slay you first and march to the capital!
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"-Of course, sir."
My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying to do here.
ARCHER:
I guess I have myself to blame.
ARCHER:
"In the past, I've encouraged them to ask questions... but we don't have time for that now."
I need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders.
"It won't be a problem, sir."
ARCHER:
I thought what happened with T'Pol... might have been an isolated incident but I'm not so sure now.
Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship that could have helped us.
I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission.
You're in command while I'm on the surface.
You answer to me and me alone.
"Is that understood, Major?"
"-Perfectly, sir."
-That'll be all.
[Solemn instrumental music]
TRIP:
"Can we talk to you, sir?"
ARCHER:
What is it?
I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox.
Do I look sick to you?
Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
That's right.
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?
We'll be light-years from here before the Xindi respond to it.
That Louie Farrakhan.
"No, not Louie Farrakhan."
Louie Kahn.
Louie Kahn.
"Yeah, you're the son of Kahn?"
Nice to meet you.
"Your father, is he alive?"
"No, he's been dead for 25 years."
We are very pleased to welcome you.
"The parliament building and capital complex took 23 years to build, the same as the Taj Mahal."
"It was all done by hand, thousands of workers carrying baskets of concrete on their heads, climbing up and down bamboo scaffolding."
"During Bangladesh's war for independence from Pakistan in 1971, the enemy pilots didn't bother bombing it, because they thought it was an ancient ruin."
"The complex was finally finished in 1983, nine years after Lou died in Penn Station."
"He never saw it finished, Bob."
- He didn't?
- No.
He never saw this.
Just taking pictures?
"Yeah, we've been here now for about five days, and... it's..."
- Five days?
- Yeah.
"That's a lot of pictures, then."
"But do you think they'll really capture the quality of this building in terms of space, light, the volumes, and the layering of his spaces, those ambiguities?"
"Well, I don't know, Mr. Wares."
"When you think about this film,"
I probably have at the most ten minutes.
"Oh, God, this is... this is... don't tell me that."
- Ten minutes for this building?
- Probably.
I see;
I think it's...
"I think it's... the whole thing is very... very useless, because you cannot treat this building like this."
"""Mr. Black Eagle, who had been petitioning for some time..."""
"""to be allowed to participate in the race."""
A mysterious aviator?
Look at this face!
Who else could this be other than Moriarty?
"He is going after the prize of 1 00,000 crowns, Moriarty, that fiend!"
Trying to win the championship with a stolen engine... that's thoroughly unforgivable!
Mr. Mac Bain was always so kind to my late husband.
I would like to do something to help him in return.
You look very nice.
"I promise, I won't get in your way."
"In any event, I've already decided."
Well...
Well...uh...
Right...
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up and get us to Holland!
I will capture Moriarty with my own hands!
"Well, well."
"Mr. Holmes, your reputation precedes you."
Welcome to Holland.
"In terms of this Mr. Black Eagle, we've discussed whether we should... accept his entry or not."
However...
However?
Have you heard the old story from medieval times?
Where a mysterious cavalier came out of nowhere to participate... in a joust and won the title?
So you're saying that you accepted the mysterious pilot's entry... in honor of that cavalier.
Yes.
"But, Moriarty used foul means to..."
Do you have proof that Mr. Black Eagle is Moriarty?
"No, but..."
"About those pills, they're doubly strong."
I don't want you to use them on him unless you absolutely have to.
Is that clear?
Blake.
Hello.
"Hello, darling."
I'd like you to meet Dr. Travers.
- Doctor.
"- Pleasure, Mr. Carrington."
Doctor came very highly-recommended.
"Well, that's good to know."
I'm happy I had the chance to meet you.
Pleasure.
"Doctor, would you please tell my husband I'm fine?"
"Well, yes, to a certain degree, your wife has a low-grade infection."
"Certainly, nothing to be alarmed about."
But what she needs now is good old-fashioned rest.
I'll see to it she gets plenty of that.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to talk to Mrs. Gunnerson.
"Doctor, are you quite sure that she's all right?"
"I mean, shouldn't she be in bed, resting?"
"Oh, don't worry, sir, I've given her some antibiotics."
"She should take it easy, but bed rest isn't absolutely necessary."
"By the way, do you mind my asking, how are you feeling, sir?"
"- Why, I'm fine."
Why?
- Nothing.
"It's, you know, none of my personal business, but professionally, I know how you corporate types neglect regular check-ups."
Right or wrong?
"Well, unfortunately, you're right about that."
"Well, you certainly look in excellent shape, and I'm sure you are."
If you can help your neighbor light that at the other end.
(coughing)
Oh!
Who's next?
We're about to go into a... into a dispensary.
Is this it?
Is this the...
"Oh, okay."
Okay.
I'm off to the dispensary.
We are much further along than I ever imagined us to be.
Morris:
Andrew Freedman is the Director of Marijuana coordination in the Colorado governor's office.
Freedman:
There are more dispensaries than there are Starbucks.
"We estimated the size of the industry in its first year to be about 700 million, and now we think it tops one billion dollars as an annual revenue source."
What makes this massage different?
This massage is different because our massage cream is infused with THC and CBD.
"All right, I think I'll try the extra strength."
Great choice.
Is that pressure okay?
Yeah.
Morris:
"Maybe it was the extra strength THC oil, but I started to wonder, where is all this weed coming from?"
I'm standing in what may be Colorado's largest cannabis grow operation.
"It's so enormous,"
I can't even see the edges of the room from where I'm standing.
Look at what we've created here.
"I mean, is this something?"
"This is John Seckman, the COO of LivWell."
This is the most exciting thing I've ever done.
"It's a business, and it's a new exciting business."
- So Pylene-50 is actually made here?
- It has to be.
"It only remains stable for a few days, and then the enzyme bonds break up and it's no longer effective."
If we could find a sample for analysis...
Where's the synthesising plant?
"You're sitting on top of it, but it's guarded night and day."
It's worth taking a look.
- I wouldn't leave without.
"- Well, be careful."
"I wish I could help you, but I can't stay any longer."
"You've been a great help already, Leitz."
We're very grateful.
- Have you fixed its position?
"- Not enough time, sir."
"But it's above Roche's limit, so it must be a spacecraft."
Or a spy satellite.
- What's that thing called?
Orac?
"- Yes, sir."
- Means nothing to me.
How was it detected?
"- A one-in-a-thousand chance, General."
The operator happened to pick it up while running a routine line scan.
And what was this data it was taking from the terminal?
A study on freighter design modification.
Information being relayed from Space Centre.
"Sounds like a bit of commercial jiggery-pokery, Quute."
- I shouldn't worry about it.
"- That's not really the point, sir."
"These spaceship builders, they're always at each other's throats."
- Underhanded bunch.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"Been a minute, man."
Yeah.
- We good in here?
"- Yeah, don't worry about it."
Everything's been rendered safe.
These guys weren't messing around.
"Hotch, these tubes surround what would be the explosive charge."
And this cylinder right here?
It's gotta be where they put whatever bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.
- That's a happy thought.
- Yeah.
Tell me about it.
Looks like a 4 man cell.
They assimilated into the community.
Just like any other suburban gangster wannabes rolling at the mall.
Who do you think we're dealing with?
Most likely middle-eastern males in their early twenties.
"Judging by that device out there, they're looking at significant targets:"
"Military installations, government buildings."
You must be the BAU boys.
And gal.
Pardon me.
- I'm Jason Gideon.
"- Andy Bingaman, FBI."
"- Agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid."
- Hi.
I'm the intelligence supervisor here at Gitmo.
You guys having a hard time getting Jind Allah to talk?
"Not only can't they get him to budge, but 2 weeks ago, word got out that one of the other detainees was spilling secrets."
Jind Allah managed to have a 3 minute conversation with him in the shower line.
"That night, the other detainee committed suicide."
He's reciting the Qu'ran from memory.
Now I remember I wasn't wearing it tonight.
- What will you have?
- Two glasses of wine to start with.
"Yes, sir."
"- A cigarette please, Dimitris?"
- With pleasure.
"What's bothering you, Aliki?"
"Nothing, nothing..."
"We had an agreement before our marriage, Aliki."
I was never to talk to you about something not belonging to me.
- Tonight we'll make an exception.
"- What do you mean, Dimitris?"
Looks like the painter is having considerable success...
"There's a rave review in the paper about his first exhibition, going on for a week now."
"Yes, I know..."
"Yes, I read it myself accidentally"
I can't see the connection with our agreement.
"Besides the review, the paper has a photo of a portrait titled 'I love you.'"
A portrait with your face in it.
I'm not sure if the artist has the right of exposing you.
"- Jealous, as always, Dimitris."
- Terribly.
And I think as a husband I am entitled to demand that he withdraws the portrait from the exhibition.
That would be thoughtless.
"If it bothers you so much, you can withdraw it by other means."
Buy it!
You're right.
Simpler that way.
We'll go to the exhibition tomorrow.
Together!
I'd look totally ridiculous alone.
As you wish.
Back to your places now.
Guess how much the Camembert was.
"- I don,t know."
Five francs?
- 4.35.
"Where,d you get it?"
I got that...
"Have you seen my tape, wolfgang?"
Where the hell did I put that damn tape?
And he plays Mr. Nice Guy!
"He only wants to be the object of positive transference and affection, and I get all the negativity!"
Give me a break!
Know what your problem is?
"At first you wanted to be the aII-powerfuI phaIIic mother manipulating love and hate, but you never responded to their demands for love and bonding because you couldn,t stand being part of the very tests you reject."
Your subconscious spilled over into your work.
"You swayed the experiment in the couple,s favor by being aggressive, because deep down you no Ionger want to be a ,tool, a mere ,technician,!"
"You always oversimpIify, sweetie."
"It,s much more complicated."
What if I was doing it on purpose from the start?
Right!
What did I do with that tape?
Did I erase it?
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, good morning!"
"I,II be showing you some images, and I,d like to know whether, if the thing or person shown disappeared, you,d be happier, less happy, or indifferent."
"Happier, less happy, or indifferent."
Okay.
If what?
"If the person disappeared, would you be happier or less happy?"
Ready?
Here we go.
Happier.
Happier.
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Now!

So what did she look like?
It hurt like shit sitting on the floor with my knees crossed...
I wouldn't have held out much longer anyway.
I just sat in a way that was more comfortable.
Get out!
Did I say something wrong?
"No, but I have things to do today."
"That's perfectly clear, I could understand that."
So what did she look like?
Although it could have been a wig.
Alright then.
So what should I do with him now?
The usual procedure.
I'm going to find a decent cup of coffee.
Max!
I have to get back...
95th Rifles.
Only a lieutenant?
Perhaps they do not promote you because you fight with your men?
"That man is a mutineer, sir."
He'll be taken back to Lisbon and shot.
"Tongue, tie him up and take him to the barn."
"Spain and England, we are allies."
TERESA What are you doing here?
"Don't tell me a stupid lie about being lost 100 miles behind French lines, Lieutenant."
We're looking for the village of Casa Antigua.
That is all I can tell you.
"If you were French, I would take a knife and you would tell me all I wanted to know."
But we are allies.
Allies?
Do allies keep secrets from each other?
"Lovers keep secrets from each other, yet they still make love."
Er...
Perhaps... perhaps we can help each other
That is what allies are for.
Good.
"I'm on my way north to the town of Torrecastro, carrying important documents from my government to those who resist the French."
"The village of Casa Antigua is on our way north, so we can travel together... under my command."
I thought she was in command?
Teresa is seeing us safely through the mountains
Now'm the senior officer here
Do you agree to travel under my command?
Yeah.
OTHER MEN Yean
- I think your men agree.
You ask your men what to do?
Yes.
"I don't always do it, but I ask."

This kid's too good for me.
Let's see how good he is.
He is.
"Finch made his fortune in manufacturing, mostly using sweatshop labor."
"He's a tax exile who's persona non grata in several countries,"
- ...including ours.
- Two buildings.
- One looks like a plantation.
- What's the other?
Pineapple factory.
It was closed in 1976.
"Clearly, someone didn't get the memo."
Look at that heat signature.
"Yeah, I have a feeling they're not canning pineapples."
"- Exotic flower, active factory..."
- History of forced labor.
Amanda must have been onto a very big story.
"Last time she broke a big story, she broke you along with it."
All the right bad guys got busted.
Let's go get her.
Finch most likely has private security and top-notch surveillance.
"Don't worry, Charlie."
Your angels know how to fly under the radar.
"As you can probably tell,"
I like to putter around in the garden.
This way.
But what I'm most proud of...
Are the new additions.
This...
Is where island white is produced.
It's the first of five flower processing facilities I have planned.
Grown in your own fields?
Right here on the island.
"When processed, this flower's five times more potent than poppy."
You never scolded me before.
Without me... you got no standing on the market.
"Everywhere, you will get a no"
And what's this?
Do I see anger?
Are you taking it out on the baby?
Change of philosophy?
Love isn't more powerful than money.
"Brothers... one left for America, one for Bangalore"
"You called me a loner, didn't you?"
And how long have I been telling you that brothers never stick together
Brothers together.
"Just verbiage, not in real life"
"Yes honey, coming"
Tanya and I are going to see the architect
We're building a five star hotel in place of your house
"Day after day, trying to piece my life together... resolving to start life anew... but what can I do?"
It all lies in ruins
"With my five-year old son, I wander the streets."
Aimlessly
I told you!
KK-Mix is dead!
Now get out
Have you come to pay me tributes?
"Where are the garlands, the bouquets?"
We'd like to know why you haven't scored an album in four years?
Four years ago...
I was a star.
"I was a thief, I stole songs"
At least I have the satisfaction of not being a thief anymore
That was KK-Mix superhit singer and music director
"No, you haven't come congratulating me... you've come to rub salt into my wounds"
Yeah.
I guess he does.
Thanks for being there for me.
"Your Grandad's waiting for you, love."
OK.
"Laters, George."
All the best for today.
You sure you don't want us to come?
"No, we'll keep it just family."
"I'll see you at the after-match though, eh?"
Absolutely.
You OK?
Yeah.
"Actually, I... ..I'm better than I've been in a long time."
"Life goes on, eh?"
Someone's busy.
Just finishing my editorial.
"OK, and what's it about?"
You'll have to wait and see.
"Ooh, fighting talk!"
"Hey, you better scoot or you're going to be late for that press conference."
What press conference?
"I've called you all here today to announce that our extensive investigation into the crash that caused the death of Trina Joy McNamara has concluded, and we have determined that Mrs McNamara died on September 12, 2008 after leaving the road in a storm on her way back to Weld."
Are there any questions?
"Yes, Mr Turner?"
Has foul play definitely been ruled out?
Absolutely.
The idea of anyone tampering with Trina's car so it fortuitously drove off a cliff in a storm is the stuff of films.
And it was definitely a stormy night when the accident happened?
"Ah, there are some suggestions that it was overcast but possibly verging on storming."
Next question?
And she was definitely returning to Weld?
"And if he's not going to do something about marrying me, it's time I moved on."
But in spite of myself I...
"I mean, when I left him, I didn't..."
I didn't really want to.
So...
Next to arrive on track five is the scheduled Buffalo to Trenton.
"Looking at Anne on that platform,"
I kept thinking of my own mother.
Neither one of them ever got married.
They both live alone.
"They were both single mothers when being a single mother was a major scandal, and they both believed in my father completely."
Anne left Philadelphia in 1953 and went to Rome for a year to have Alex in secret.
Lou wrote many letters to her while she was away.
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""last night, I dreamt about you."
"""I was in our office telephoning."
"""You walked in and mentioned to me"
"""that you could wait no longer."
"""Your eyes somehow were black and flashing,"
"""looking at me reprehensively."
"""Annie, Annie, I think of you always."
"""I miss so much our meetings together."
"""I hope nothing changes about our way of life."""
"Well, of course, it would change."
"When Anne returned, she collaborated with Lou on a small community center and bathhouse in Trenton, New Jersey."
It was Lou's first chance to fully apply his ideas about ancient architecture.
Anne is 80 now and hasn't been back to Trenton in 40 years.
"Well, how do you go in?"
"- I think we go right in there, I think."
- Is this a door?
- Looks like it's boarded up.
- Was it not like that?
We had a search warrant authorizing us to look for controlled substances.
On what basis had you sought the warrant?
"lnformation from a reliable informant, Joseph Gonzales."
What transpired when you reached Mr. Ortiz's place?
We knocked.
We identified ourselves as police officers.
"After 1 0 seconds, we forced entry and found Mr. Ortiz standing in his toilet trying to flush 23 ounces of crack cocaine."
I don't think you mean to say Mr. Ortiz was standing in his toilet bowl.
"He was standing in his bathroom, flushing the cocaine."
What did you do at that time?
SlPOWlCZ:
"We prevented him from destroying evidence gave him his rights, arrested him."
Mr. Ortiz has stated that you broke down his door without warning.
"No, we identified ourselves, and then we gave him time to open the door."
So you made no surprise moves to throw the ecology of Mr. Ortiz's apartment out of whack?
- Did I miss something?
"- Yeah, me getting my balls squeezed."
That'll be all.
Thanks for cooperating.
Thanks.
[BUREAU CHIEF SNEEZES]
What's wrong?
He found out.
- I got your message.
WEXLER:
You got my message?
Get in.
KELLY:
What's the matter?
I know about the 1 5 grand.
Did you think they weren't going to call me about that?
My accountant called me.
Go inflate your tire.
"There's so many different ways to be connected to people,"
"There are the people you feel this unspoken connection to,  even though there's not even a word for lt,"
"There's the people who you've known forever,  who know you ln this way that other people can't,  because they've seen you change,"
"they've let you change,"
- Richard and Cindy?
- Very deeply in love.
- Since when?
- Lunch.
What did they eat?
"I don't know, but it doesn't look like it was enough."
"Ah, Mr. Heckle and Mr. Jekkyl, don't we have classes to attend?"
"Mr. Feeny, shouldn't you break them up or hose them down or something?"
"Oh, I wouldn't interrupt their tryst, Mr. Matthews."
They're both A-minus students and happily struck by Cupid.
"So, if they were C-minus students, you wouldn't let them kiss?"
"- School policy, don't you know."
- So I can't kiss?
"With your grades, Mr. Matthews, you can't even shake hands."
"Just watch, Mr. Feeny."
"By the end of the year,"
I plan to have an A-plus average and a hickey.
"Dare to dream, Mr. Matthews."
Holy cow.
Jerry and Shoshanna?
Deeply.
- Has the whole world paired off?
- Pretty much.
Is there a list posted somewhere where I find out what girl's been assigned to me?
You want a girlfriend?
"No, not a girlfriend, just a girl who's like a friend, but not a girlfriend."
Because he threatened me with rain when I wanted it fine.
He found fault with my high flyer and will not buy my brown mare.
If it will be of satisfaction to you. -
- I believe his character to be.
"In all other respects, irreproachable."
"In return for this acknowledgement, don't deny me the privilege -"
- Of disliking him as much as I adore this cottage.
- I have plans for improvements.
- That.
I will never consent to.
Not a stone must be added to its walls.
"Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild Combe Magna to this exact image."
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.
Then I'd be as happy at Combe as I've been at Barton.
But this place has one claim on my affections none other can share.
Promise never to change it.
I'm honoured you risk your honour by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.
"Miss Marianne, will you grant me an interview tomorrow... alone?"
"- Willoughby, we are always alone."
- But there is...
There is something very particular I should like to ask you.
Of course.
I shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.
Thank you.
Until tomorrow.
Then.
Oh.
Virtue...
"Silently and with fear, enter the hearts of all that hear me this day."
"And C, it's easy to monetize."
"I mean, biology tells us that in order to poop, you have to eat, and I control the food supply."
"All right with the biology, okay?"
"You sell 99 cent virtual penguin food, all right?"
Get over yourself.
"(computer beeps) Winner, winner, chicken-waffle dinner."
You got a location?
I do.
It looks like those catfish e-mails were sent from an office building downtown.
(elevator bell dings)
"Toast, talk to me."
"Keep going about ten more yards, and then head right."
Signal's tracing to a terminal in the far corner.
Can I help you?
"You got a beautiful family, Mr. Mintz."
I imagine they're not gonna be too pleased when they find out that their old man is an online predator.
"Please, you have to understand,"
I'm not a bad person.
Okay.
"Look, Addison Wells found out who you really were, and then all of a sudden she-she ends up missing."
H-How do you explain that?
"Now, look, I admit that I misrepresented myself to Addison, but I had nothing to do with her disappearance."
It was all just a fantasy.
I never planned on acting on it.
Chin showed Mintz's photo to the Hillers.
They don't seem to think he's our guy.
"I'm not surprised, look at this."
"Mintz was perving on at least a dozen other women, and he was actually at this terminal chatting one of them up last night."
He logged off around 11:00 p.m.
Okay.
There's no way he could've been in Kahala at the time of the abduction.
ADDISON:
There's been a complaint about Georgie's living conditions and welfare.
Can you believe what we just did?
That was completely awesome.
"Ty Borden, Amy Flemming, you're under arrest for horse theft."
- Horse theft?
- You heard the officer.
How can you arrest us for horse theft?
You should arrest this guy.
He's the one who stole the herd off Will Vernon.
They're wild horses!
They don't belong to will or anybody else.
I'm completely within my rights.
"Yeah, but you trespassed on Will's land to get them in the first place."
Mr. Pincher has a government permit.
He's allowed by law to capture any wild horses in this area.
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Return the horses to his corral or I will have to put you under arrest.
I can't believe this.
It's a notice of investigation from the...
- child protection society.
They're...
- Shhh!
They're setting up an appointment with us for tomorrow.
Oh my God.
"There's a litany of complaints here, Lou."
Look!
"""Child works on the farm for three hours both before and after school."
Could constitute child labour.
An alleged...
An alleged accident occurred while the child was unsupervised.
"This could be deemed as possible child abuse and neglect."""
"Peter, this is all lies."
We have Skinnarland on radio.
Haukelid and two local guys to execute the mission.
They will place 19 pounds of high explosive below deck.
Something which ought to create an 11 square foot hole.
The ferry with all its cargo should go down in less than five minutes.
Too fast to get to shore before it sinks.
Right.
"Another attempt, another blast, another fuckload of people die."
That's war.
There's a price to pay for success.
"How successful were we, really?"
We lost 41 men with Freshman.
We sabotaged the factory and had it the Germans rebuild it in two months   and listened to the Yanks and bombed the entire valley.
- All right.
And now about to blow up a passenger ferry.
- Very successful.
"- It's war Julie, you told me..."
The Heavy Water War:
Stopping Hitler's Atomic Bomb
What the hell are you thinking?
The alternative is bombing again.
We're talking about 40-50 civilians.
Plus even more reprisals.
Can't we blast it on the way down?
"Or after the ferry, out on the ocean?"
- I estimate most of them will get to shore.
- With the water temperature below freezing?
- They have two life boats.
- What if the ferry sinks before that?
Then they swim.
And those who can't?
The children and the elderly?
My sister's got a convertible.
She's only had her license three months.
[laughs] I could never drive one anyway.
Why not?
Have you ever been in one at night?
"All the stars twinkling right above you, it makes you just want to reach out and grab one."
[laughs]
"Who could possibly keep their eyes on the road with all those stars, right?"
[laughs softly]
Yeah.

"[Tawny] She made really pretty jewelry, don't you think?"

"Hey, you know if you fart in that, it turns red, right?"
- Have a seat.
- No thank you.
I want to be able to get out of here as fast as possible.
[clears throat] Ernie Falk wants you to give him a call.
Who the fuck's Ernie Falk?
"Uh, he's the big-time TV producer you tried to hustle the other night."
You mean hustle like you told me to?
"Hustle, as in you take a 20 percent cut?"
"You know, I grew up in Cold Lake, Alberta?"
"My father used to walk across Cold Lake to work every morning when it was frozen, which was most mornings."
"Then one day, when I was 17, he fell through the ice and drowned."
What the fuck does that even mean?
Wasn't his day.
"You walk across that lake every day, and then one day--"
"No, no, I-I get it, sort of, it's--it's just a fucking terrible analogy."
It's a fucking brilliant analogy.
You're comparing your father drowning to me having to make an unpleasant phone call?
James Barr's lawyers might pull their boy through.
"I know, sir, Inspector Frost..."
Is off the case.
Remember it.
This place is in chaos.
They're shifting CID out en masse.
What they're doing is setting up is a station within a station.
No one is to go in there.
Including me.
"Not very good for Denton's image is it, sir?"
The image of the station is not my chief concern right now.
What about you?
What have you done about representation?
Someone from the Federation maybe?
A solicitor perhaps?
No that's not my style.
"Jack, try and keep your style..."
Under control?
"I don't always like the way you do things but whatever our disagreements,"
I have the highest regard for your integrity.
And I shall be making that clear at the highest level.
"Don't try too hard, sir."
(Knock on door)
Yes!
"Mr. Mullett, I'd like to make a start, with Inspector Frost."
"Yes, superintendent?"
I am concerned that Inspector Frost has no communication with any officers here.
Are you telling me that when one of my senior officers is suspended
I can't speak to him?
It makes it tidier.
"Let me remind you, Superintendent, that this is my station."
"I have a responsibility for the people who work here, and I intend to ensure that"
That should have been me.
- It was my idea.
- Igin volunteered.
I should never have sent him.
He was too old.
"But that's why he volunteered, Hunda, don't you see?"
- He wanted to be of use.
"- Nevertheless, it was my idea, I should have gone!"
"Yes, sir, with any luck the rebel's Fourth Column has just ceased to exist."
- Well done.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Mind you, I have a sneaking respect for these Helots."
I led a squadron of them once.
"Marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
They love the hand-to-hand stuff.
"Not really necessary, of course, these days, sir."
"Don't you believe it, Quute."
You can't do everything with your missiles.
"Bunkers, strong points, inner city combat."
You've got to winkle them out with cold steel.
It's the only way of clearing the ground.
"- Gas, sir?"
- It's not always effective.
- Do you remember the Fletch expedition of '29?
"- No, I don't think I do."
Fletch used gas against the Wazis.
"Complete massacre, bodies everywhere."
"Took dinner with his officers that night, suddenly the Wazis came over the wall, butchered the whole expedition."
"It seems Wazis are gill-breathers, they can lie dormant for days."
"That's very interesting, sir."
- You'll send out a patrol to do a body count?
"- Of course, sir."
Bloodless.
"But in Scotland, there was blood aplenty."
Several northern nobles remained faithful to James.
"One of these Jacobites was john Graham of Claverhouse, now the Viscount Dundee."
"Claverhouse went north, formed an army, won a decisive victory at Killiecrankie, and died of his wounds on the battlefield."
"The first Jacobite rebellion died with him, but its body twitched for some time after."
It took several months to crush the Jacobite garrison in Edinburgh Castle.
But the garrison here held out longest of all.
So it was on the Bass Rock that the Stuart dynasty finally lost its grip on power.
"At last, there was a kind of peace."
The moderate remnants of the Presbyterians reached a compromise with King William.
"Bishops were abolished, and the Presbyterians resumed control of the Church of Scotland."
But they were deceiving themselves.
They were the Church of southern Scotland.
"Because in the north, loyalty to the older kind of God-anointed king remained in force."
"The split in the Kirk was a split in the country, an unheated wound, and the Stuarts, of course, were far from dead."

"Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer."
"You know the drill. I´m gonna ask you some questions, but I´m on your side."
We wanna establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?
"Sit down, Jack."
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2.31am.
"lnterrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU."
Ryan Chappelle is present.
"Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramón Salazar."
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel in Mexico.
(Tony) So when did you meet Amador?
Did you know him when you were working at CTU?
"Tell me something, Nina."
What kind of a deal do you think you´re gonna cut?
"You´ve betrayed everybody you know, including me."
You murdered Jack´s wife.
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
You´re helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
Help me understand this.
What do you want?
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer?
Your neck is bleeding.
"- Dalton, what have you got?"
- So far the only reactions are subliminal.
If she won´t talk we need to be plugged into her vitals.
"We can take her to seven, do a passive-response test."
Seven´s not secure enough.
She stays here.
"Johnnie has been doing his best to fix the engine, but he is getting weaker by the minute."
"And we all know when the sun comes up, the German planes will be back."
- Oh!
"No one wants to be here, but we have a hole in this picture."
"A stranded boat, a broken propeller, no one to fix it, and no Tom Buckley."
"- Well, maybe we could reshoot."
- Who with?
"Ambrose Hilliard is still in plaster,"
"Wyndham Best's in the North Atlantic, and Carl Lundbeck is back with the RAF."
Could one of the Frenchies do it?
"Come to our rescue, same way we came to theirs?"
It doesn't seem right morale-wise.
"We could, uh, pan across the faces of the soldiers and never actually see who fixes..."
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
None of them could have done any better.
You're mustard these days.
Rose could do it.
Rose could free the propeller.
"Cerberus, sit."
Rugelach...
- and kogel mogel.
- Mmm-hmm.
To build you up in time for the premiere.
You'll be interested to learn I received several unexpected propositions this week.
- How delightful for you.
"Of course, I do not speak of erotic advances."
These were professional inquiries regarding your availability.
"You will be kind enough to read, give your opinion."
The doctors tell me you are to be discharged in a few days.
I cannot see you will be in a condition to look after yourself.
I...
I therefore propose that we should ready a room in the apartment for your use.
Carter Hall.
"There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time."
- What about...
"- Kendra, yes, we need your assistance in locating her and Savage."
Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.
"He said something about, um..."
Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians were race of extraterrestrials.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.
"Captain, I have surveillance footage which might be relevant."
"Thank you, Gideon."
I've seen that rock before.
Savage had one of those in 1958.
He took our blood.
"He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C."
- What are you doing?
"- Come on, man."
We got to try it again.
That thing that we did in World War II.
- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.
"It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning."
"Come on, just the once."
Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?
"I don't know, I just found this junk lying around."
"Oh, come on."
Don't you think that turning something into something else might come in handy?
"All right, one time only."
"Okay, just the once."
All right.
"You need to focus, Jefferson."
"OK, Michelangelo,"
I have decided to use these disasters and rethink everything.
Yes.
They want me to revise my collection?
Overnight?
"OK, I will give them a collection that they will never forget."
Yes.
"I will, I will... wrap everything, cover it, and I will call it my burkha collection."
"Yes, and then I will rip everything to shreds as if a burkha was hit by a bomb."
"This is East/West, you see, in one."
"Brilliant, no?"
"But my backer, my business manager, my public relations people, they all will say no."
Why should I listen to their opinions?
"Because, Michelangelo, they control the finance."
"Therefore, they only think about what will sell."
What will sell a perfume.
"Second, they are afraid it might offend."
They don't want to upset people.
People like me.
Not because they care about our feelings but because they are afraid of us.
Do you understand?
"And, suddenly, my designs, they must attract people under 12!"
What are they thinking of?
"Suddenly, my designs must attract children?"
"I mean, children!"
"No offence to you, Michelangelo."
I mean no offence to you.
I am very fond of children.
"I was once a child, too, but not for long."
"You have to grow up fast where I came from, very fast."
"Yes, Michelangelo, a very successful meeting."
Sometimes you just have to be firm with designers.
- If you' re admitting her to Psych.
- She may have a reason-
Just got word on Mr. Chambers.
Aortic dissection.
I'm taking him up to Surgery now...
- ... unless you have objections.
- No.
Would it be possible for us to speak in private first?
- Of course.
- Dr. Weaver?
- Later.
"- Yeah, but I need..."
I wanted to talk to you about what happened earlier.
"Oh, for God's sake!"
Who left a cadaver in here?
Sasha's a bit of a bad penny.
She keeps being moved while they try to locate her family.
I don't mind if you don't mind.
I'm concerned that you might be taking on too much too soon particularly in the area of trauma.
Based on?
What I saw earlier.
A pronounced inability to work with others.
A lack of professional respect.
"You' re joking, right?"
"Look, it's stressful, no question."
Copping an attitude with me and my staff is not gonna make a trauma go any easier.
"Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta."
"In fact, it only adds to the intense pressure that we' re all feeling."
"Given my position, I didn't think it necessary to seek your approval."
We all have our sensitivities.
"Quite frankly, if anyone has an attitude here, it's you."
- But we can't let them interfere-
"The medicine cured him, Jacob."
- Not faith healing.
- That's your version.
Mine is that I experienced God's love moving through me to Larry.
"Now, wait a minute."
Aren't faith healers frowned upon in judaism?
Religious dogma is meaningless in the face of God's new revelations!
I have a power to heal!
And more than that...
I understand things.
You are missing something from your life.
Perhaps it is God's grace.
May we pray together?
"That's a very lovely offer, but... no, thank you."
"So, we have all of Jacob's test results back."
He's completely healthy.
No.
He's barking mad.
"You know, I bet they said that about Joan of Arc."
"Just because we don't share in Jacob's faith, it doesn't mean that it's a condition, right?"
"Just out of curiosity, does anyone in this room believe in God?"
Have you seen me operate?
- I am God.
- Mm.
I believe in God.
- She's awesome.
"- I am a scientist, and I am trained to equate truth with things that can be proven."
"Not only does faith ask you to accept things that are impossible to prove, it's just they defy all reason."
But isn't that the very definition of faith?
That you believe without proof?
Then why not believe in leprechauns or unicorns?
"Santa Claus, bigfoot."
You know what you have to do.
Let's have a final check.
Which of you are buying tickets to Allatoona?
Kingston?
Calhoun?
Resaca?
And Chattanooga?
Good.
That way it won't appear we're traveling together.
"Knight, Brown and Alf Wilson, sit close to me."
One last thing:
"When the train stops at Big Shanty for breakfast, keep your seats till I give you the signal."
"Good luck, gentlemen."
- Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Ross?
"After you outlined the plan last night, Bill Campbell and I got to talking it over."
"Tearing up the track behind us and burning the bridges all makes sense, but why steal the train at Big Shanty?"
It's a breakfast stop for the crew as well as the passengers.
"There's no telegraph there, either."
"There's a Confederate camp with 4,000 men."
Must we steal an engine in full view of the Southern army?
Know any place they won't suspect it?
Yes.
Any deserted part of the track north of this town.
- [Andrews] That'd mean a fight.
- What's the matter with a fight?
- You never know how it'll come out.
- I know how I'm coming out.
I've had a bellyful of this bowing' and scrapin' and sweet-talking every loudmouth Sesech in the state of Georgia.
"If you want to capture this train in a fair fight, you can count on me."
"If you don't, I ain't going."
"Mr. Campbell, your company commander said you'd be worth ten in a fight."
"Well, I have to admit, young lady, that I gave you those instructions just to keep you busy."
Luckily they were the right things to do.
"Well, I felt something was different."
"But if this is Sally, then where's Judy?"
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
"Now, look at that, Doctor."
Judy really is sorry.
She wants to give Sally her favorite doll.
(CHUCKLES)
"I'm sorry, Judy, that's government property."
The scientists back at Cape Kennedy want to study it.
(CHATTERING)
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll send you a brand-new one.
How 'bout that?
Ok?
"Miss Tracy, I'm going to see that NASA sends you a special letter of commendation."
You made just the kind of diagnostic tests that were required.
We couldn't have done better ourselves.
"Actually, Clarence is the one who deserves the letter."
"After all, he saved Sally from that leopard."
"I'm afraid we're overlooking the really heroine of this recovery program, and that is Judy."
"If Judy hadn't found Sally,"
Sally could've been taken by a predator in the bush.
"By Jove, that's right."
If you chaps are going to commend anyone it ought to be our little Judy.
"Yes, she's a clever little person."
"I mean, chimp."
She certainly made monkeys out of us.
"Judy, how would you like to come back to America with us and train to be a real space chimp?"
(CHATTERING)
I'm afraid you lost a volunteer.
I wonder who she was.
"Oh, don't start thinking things like that."
"because that's the thing he was saying, that..."
"Funny enough... it looks like a model, do you know what I mean?"
It doesn't look real.
Do you get that feeling?
It doesn't look like a real human being.
Wow.
I feel compelled to look and look and look and look and look.
"Apparently the eye is a third real, a third glass, and all... the eyelashes are two-thirds real."
every single other thing is completely real.
Lady Devonport takes the lead!
Don't push me!
The seat needs to be about here.
"Well, these were built by dangerous people"
"As the Regency House science event gathers momentum,"
Mr. Foxsmith introduces another innovation to the party... the velocipede.
It was the custom of men of fashion to show off by strutting about on contraptions like these.
"Right, who's going to win this race?"
I don't know...
"Actually, I think Mr. Everett."
I pick Carrington to win.
Do you?
"Well, I think Everett to win."
My money's on Everett on this one.
Do you reckon?
both contenders have a history of dislike for each other.
"Rivals for the affections of Miss Hopkins,"
Everett and Carrington are set to battle it out
It's a two-horse race...
anything could happen.
"Come on, pedal."
You couldn't be more wrong if you do.
"On that very battle, defied his command despite the fact that he is my direct superior."
"It was to follow High Commander Won, of course."
"For it, I was made to suffer intolerable humiliation before my own men."
But I have no bitterness or resentment for my superior.
"In fact, I am still ashamed of what I have done."
"If we had fought High Commander Won's way, the Chosun Navy would've suffered a major loss."
High Commander of Left Cholla Navy is not a very clever man.
He is not selfish enough to harm another person for his own honor.
But there is one thing that he does desire.
"And for that one thing, he will not stop fighting until his bones turn to ashes."
Do you know what that is?
It is the safety of this country.
He cannot let go of his extreme loyalty to repay the kingdom.
Do not doubt him.
Extend your hand to him.
It is not his burden alone to repay the kingdom with loyalty.
Captain...
"""Extreme loyalty to repay the kingdom..."""
"Constable Kwon, what are you doing here?"
Sir...
Captain Chung brought me a sword.
What have you brought me?
Sir...?
High Commander.
Commander of Bang-dap Yi Soon-shin requests to see you.
Do you think High Commander Yi sent them?
"Sir, I believe they were sent by those much more powerful than High"
Commander Yi...
"or the King, for that matter."
The people of Chosun.
"Help them, High Commander."
A lot of things happen in the film.
But what's important is that after years
of remorse and study
Amparo finds the address of Alfredo's mother.
And she turns up there.
"""Hotel Youkali, Room Number 15."""
"- Sleep, my love."
- What if I squash you when I move?
And Alfredo
stays inside her... forever.
A MONTH LATER
"Come on, put your hands right."
That's it.
It's so cool here.
It's wonderful!
"It's lovely out on the terrace, isn't it?"
"And Lydia likes being out on the terrace, don't you, Lydia?"
"You heard her, she loves it."
Look at them.
It's like they were talking about us.
What do you think they'd talk about?
Women tell each other everything.
Lydia would tell her it's two months today since she was gored.
"Benjamin and Angela, do you come here of your own free will to be united in matrimony?"
"Yes, we do."
"That being so, as you wish to be united in holy matrimony, join hands and declare your consent before God and His Church."
"I, Angela, take you, Benjamin, as my husband, and I give myself to you,"
"and I promise to be faithful to you, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, all the days of my life."
"May the Lord, who caused this love to grow in you, confirm this mutual consent you have stated before His Church."
"What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder."
What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
We laid her to rest under her real name - Dreidel.
Flora Dreidel.
"If you find Malone, tell him I said he's a bum!"
Uh-oh.
I helped you bring that TV into the building the day we met.
You said it was for a friend.
"Actually, it was for me."
"You found my, uh..."
little hideaway.
"All these books, these videos, are yours?"
A hot plate?
Enough food for a family of gorillas?
- So I bend the regulations when I unwind.
- (clock chimes)
Uh-oh.
Sun's almost down.
"Time to roll, partner."
"So, how'd it go with Mace's stepson?"
"According to Pine Lawn, an old man comes by every Thursday to leave a rose on Flora Dreidel's crypt."
"I know it's a long shot, but... tomorrow is Thursday."
"All these years, and you still have a soft spot for Flora."
"Must have been tough becoming dead to the world, abandoning your wife."
But you had no choice.
The Illuminati decided you were irreplaceable.
Excuse me?
Nobody knew more about underworld dealings than Mace Malone.
"Once the gangs found out an outside faction knew their secrets, you were a marked man."
You had to disappear.
"Thanks to you, the Illuminati had the goods to cut themselves in."
They've been organized crime's silent partner ever since.
"Young man, how long have you been plagued by these fanciful delusions?"
Not as long as you've had this tattoo.
You mean eating is your only concern?
But you can't get away that easy.
"Tomorrow, we go shopping in Nagasaki."
"- And you're coming, too, Shinjiro."
- Count me out.
I have the big project to convince Grandma to take us all to Hawaii with her.
Yeah!
That's the grand theme for this summer vacation!
We shall all go to Hawaii!
Absolutely!
Let's all hold out!
Fate is knocking at the door.
Under this beautiful town of Nagasaki... there is another Nagasaki that vanished with one atomic bomb.
Didn't Grandpa die in the Nagasaki atom bombing?
- Yes.
- How come Grandma was safe?
"She was at the house, behind the mountain, 10 kilometers away from the blast center."
But she told me that her hair was a result of the atom bomb.
"That's because Grandma came to Nagasaki on that day, looking for Grandpa."
The school where Grandpa was teaching was close to the blast center.
And did she find Grandpa?
"The school building was crushed flat and burned, and full of charred bodies."
It was impossible to identify which one of them was Grandpa.
Do you want to go to the school?
"You know, Grandma was also a teacher at this school."
She quit when she married Grandpa.
"She sure was lucky, wasn't she?"
I don't know about that.
"When Grandpa died, our father was still a baby... and Grandma was carrying Minako's mother in her belly."
Being left alone...
I bet it must have been very hard on Grandma.
"Still... even though no one ever found Grandpa... he's here, I'm sure."
"I miss them, too."
"Ms. Ross, Ms. Ross, what can you tell us about the recent rash of home invasion murders?"
"Well, our community has healing to do."
It's gonna take hard work and time to fix.
"It won't be easy, you stupid bitch!"
But together...
Healing?
"I know, right?"
She doesn't have what it takes.
"We are under siege here, and what is she gonna do?"
!
"What have you got, Garcia?"
"Sir, I found the connection between the Mills family and Clark Preston."
"10 years ago, the Mills were the victims of a home invasion."
"Robert Mills, the father, and 10-year-old Julie were killed."
"Pamela was raped, and now she has a lot of brain damage that has left her in a near vegetative state."
What about Trevor?
Mom!
"He hid in the closet, and when it was over, he called 911."
That's why he stuffed that boy in the closet.
He was reliving his own victimization.
He didn't do that to th other children he murdered because he didn't relate to them.
"Garcia, was anybody convicted of the crime?"
Yes.
A Ronnie Green and Carlos Jackson.
"They're both African American, both serving life in Folsom."
"And then after the murders,"
"Preston, he financially supported the family almost entirely."
So they're close.
He's known the family for years.
That must be how they're paying Pamela's medical expenses.
It would be awfully hard to cover that on a part-time messenger's salary.
How are your negotiations going?
"Well, I don't know, I gave them five minutes to agree to my settlement offer, and that time is up... now."
We're suing you.
"On behalf of LOC Pharmaceuticals, makers of Veriscene and Elvatyl."
"And their insurer, LifeState."
We joined forces to sue you for $50 million
- for fraud and malicious prosecution.
"- Come on,"
- this is harassment.
"- Is that your legal opinion, Will?"
"No, it's mine."
"Your company doesn't like being sued, try making products that don't kill and maim people."
Here's a better idea-- stop intentionally and wrongfully instituting legal proceedings
- you know are without merit.
- We were just awarded $25 million-- I'd call that merit.
No.
I would call that judicial bribery.
Oops.
Is that a sensitive topic?
This case was built for a jury.
You requested a bench trial.
"It's a million-dollar case, and your basketball buddy awarded you $25 million."
- I was cleared by a grand jury.
- No.
You weren't indicted by a grand jury.
You gamed the system;
"I know you, Will."
You can't do that with me.
- Or with me.
- That's right.
We're the dream team.
Jackie?
I understood.
I understood that sir acted in front of me.
That slap.. that slap was an act.
Sir.. sir loves me a Iot.
Sir loves me a Iot.
"Krishna, what.."
Its not a doctors concern.
Hejust said and went that admit brother in a hospital.
But we will have to pay the fees.
We dont have any money plant with us..
..that we can plunk them from it.
"Brother, but we will have to get him treated."
"No, its important to get him admitted in a hospital."
But its not necessary that it should be a private hospital.
"Sister-in-Iaw is right, brother."
We will be brother admitted in a charitable hospital.
"Yes, we arejust concerned with the treatment."
people even get treated overthere.
You all dont worry about brother.
This situation shall never arise as long as I am there.
You wish to tell the world that we dont care about brother?
Itsjust you who takes care of him.
With an ordinaryjob of a steno..
..thinks great of herself.
"Jyoti, I wanted to ask you why did you take up.."
..such a humiIiatingjob and tried to defame ourfamiIy name?
The familys respect is ruined..
"..because of me working, brother?"
And the fact that you wish to get brothertreated..
..in a charitable hospital will do wonders to ourfamiIy name?
"Jyoti, you are crossing your limits."
"I have learnt to cross limits from you all, sister-in-Iaw."
These etching lines?
"They symbolize rays that the Laurel wreath encircles, in the center of which would sit a silver star."
Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea?
No.
"He thought he deserved one, though."
"Fired off a lot of angry letters to uncle Sam while he was, you know, in jail."
Got denied every time.
So maybe this is payback.
Instead of ball bearings or nails.
Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?
A real one?
"Well, you wouldn't."
"What about, like, Craigslist?"
"Not from a military family I take it, sir."
Silver star is the third-highest combat military decoration.
"If it's not left to the family, most are buried with the soldiers."
The Presidio.
- Graveyard detail.
"- Thank you, sir."
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
My suspect worked the graveyard detail here at the Presidio from 1952 to '54 during his court-martial.
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried, right?"
"Silver stars, Korean war?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.
I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
"-Harmony, architecture."
When I report this at home...
"And I would like to repeat once more in this solemn moment, as a poet says:"
"""O, thanks, thanks to your effort."""
Because miniaturization and electronics... are the future of mankind.
Do you know what I like the most about people?
That they can always celebrate something.
"All right, I'm coming."
-They're always pestering.
"-Hurry, these are ours."
Inhabitants of Earth live in houses.
"In small, bigger and the biggest."
Many houses together are called a town.
A town provides comfort for people.
People start the day with a row of typical actions.
"When they have done the prescribed number of actions, they leave their houses and rush away."
"They attend to useful activities, which they call work."
On Earth work is the meaning of life.
People get money for work.
"People buy things with money, which increases their comfort."
After work people return to their homes.
By pressing a button they set in motion a device for amusement.
"Amusement serves people by drawing in new energy, so they can successfully repeat another cycle of daily activities."
-Oh no.
-Oh yes.
You put more effort in your work.
"As we say, toil."
Not so.
"You put into it more intelligence, as we say, craft."
"Well, all right."
It's beautiful!
Splendid.
Mmm-mwah!
"Jimmy, come on!"
What just happened?
ALAN DAVIES AS YET UNTITLED CTO M725W/82 BF000000
"Looking forward to lots of chat and listening,"
I'm very good at nodding sagely.
I don't know if you can tell from my outfit but my favourite colour's blue.
"Hello, thank you."
"This is me, this is my room."
Where's my chocolate?
I know you've eaten it.
I don't know where it is.
"Oh, it's here."
"Hello, I'm Alan Davies and this is As Yet Untitled."
"We will be having a conversation, I don't know what we're talking about,"
"I don't have any prepared questions, no-one's here to plug anything, they're just going to come on and have a chat and then at some point during the conversation, we will stumble upon the title for tonight's show."
"So, without further ado, please will you welcome my guests?"
Here they are.
They're a hand-picked crew.
"Now, I have Elis James who has been heckled by hip-hop legend Grandmaster Flash."
Yeah.
Worth hearing about that.
"Roisin Conaty, who has a stressful relationship with creamed spinach and belted out an Elton John medley in a meditation retreat and that's a true story."
Rob Delaney is here which is fantastic.
"Rob Delaney, who once went to Slovakia by mistake and has been serenaded by Lionel Richie."
Nice to have you here.
"And Ardal O'Hanlon, who took part in a bank robbery."
It says here.
"I didn't do a bank robbery, I was in a bank when a robbery took place."
Were you really?
"Yes, I was."
Looks like the foot was wrapped in it.
"Now I've heard of re-gifting, but this is pushing it."
Danny and Hawkes just found an arm in a trash bin a couple blocks away.
That looks to be male Caucasian.
Same as the foot that Mac found.
"Wrapping paper's a match, too."
I'm thinking Christmas with the in-laws.
Degree of decomp puts the time of death between 6:00 and 9:00 last night.
"Mercifully, the dismemberment came later."
Kill a man and then chop him up into pieces.
Maybe the killer thought little pieces would be easier to dispose of.
There is a certain logic.
Any idea what he used to cut him up?
Haven't seen this particular wound pattern before.
"There's lateral movement at the incision, bordered by these jagged punctures."
Maybe I can give you a hand.
Okay.
Department of Sanitation found it in a storm drain five blocks from the foot.
The top layer of skin is separating from the underlying tissue.
"Yeah, it looks like it was submerged in water for a while."

Vince was the head wrestling coach at Hillridge High for eight years.
Five championships.
Are you positive it's really him?
I mean...
"I mean, how can you be sure?"
Maybe there's been some kind of mix-up.
We've identified him by his fingerprints.
Every employee in the school system has them on file.
Few who lived through the last conflict will set much store by government assurances that any war against Germany will be over swiftly.

"Something you, Madam President, have proven steadfastly resistant to over the course of your term in office."
"Mrs Collingborne, would you kindly control your sister?"

Ooh.
Can you help me up?
Blimey... what happened to you?
Army lorry.
Ow.
- Ooh.
Oh...
- Oh!
Sorry.
Are you all right?
- I'm late.
Where are you going?
I am more than willing to put my proposition to the vote.
"Any objections to that, Mrs Barden?"
"Only that the membership has been so tightly managed over the years, it will almost certainly deliver whatever you ask of it."
Shame on you for not sharing my faith in our colleagues' independence of mind.
Shame... on... you.
"If we walk slower, it might not hurt so much."
"I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson."
I'm late.
"Well, why don't we leave your bike here... and I'll get you to where you need to be double-quick on the back of mine?"
Sure you can carry me?
You're no heavier than a bag of mail.
- Charming!
"A small, light, bag of mail."
- Hmm.
Perhaps of all art.
Absolutely priceless.
Speaking of prices.
"Yes, you want to know who deals with tattoos."
There are no traders.
Only like-minded people.
All the transactions are legal.
The tattoos come from the families of deceased owners.
"Or from voluntary sales, like with our mutual friend, the junkie."
There's no shortage of his type.
What if someone refuses.
I know what you're getting at...
illegal goods.
I know the rumors.
"I'm a collector, not a hunter."
Whatever you're looking for has nothing to do with me.
No skin off your back.
I'm sorry.
I know you were hoping for more.
Not really.
The masterpiece of my collection.
Are you crazy?
You're in possession of stolen property and suspected of committing a theft.
What are you saying?
Your masterpiece was stolen yesterday from the forensics department.
"Mr. Schoubya,"
I've been waiting a lifetime for a guy like you.
You won't get away with this.
Not with your means of investigating.
"That's right, but it's enough to get a search warrant."
"Within an hour, I'll have you hounded by reporters."
Your playroom will appear in every newspaper's

"Of course, this will put a bigger stress on you physically and mentally."
It's best if we never have to use it.

Hi.
Miley Stewart best assistant any international pop sensation.
Has ever had.
You must be Mrs. Jameson.
Oh my goodness it really is you.
Oh I thought she was just one of those desperate types.
That would do or say anything to get in.
"I mean she did this ""Stanford whoo"" thing that was."
Well borderline creepy.
I'll pass that along.
The girl loves constructive criticism.
Plays well with others and is an avid flossier.
"Healthy gums, healthy mind."
Now if you could just give me that orientation package.
I'll take it with me help save you the postage.
-Miss Montana...
-No worries.
It's just my way of contributing to higher education.
But I will need a receipt for tax purposes.
It isn't that.
It's apparently Miley misunderstood.
I didn't say this would get her in I said we'd reconsider.
"But even if we do accept her, she goes to the end of the waiting list."
[Stammering] The waiting list?
Oh well look Miley is a wonderful applicant it's just that the information.
Came a little late and the board only makes exceptions.
In very rare cases.
Well like for example if you were applying.
Me?
Well of course.
Having someone of your accomplishments here.
Would be a wonderful addition to the university.
They make me.
"Ronan Murphy was killed by a police officer and Murphy was a prime suspect in the murder of Tommy Hunter but, for some reason, that's been hidden from AC-12."
Bring in the officer that killed him.
- He was killed a couple of weeks after.
- Why?
"Oh, come on, Steve."
"Best guess, he was breaking open a paedophile ring."
What?
Don't you see?
Ronan Murphy was interviewed by the team investigating Tommy Hunter's murder.
And where did you get that from?
"I'm not at liberty to say, sir."
Here we go again.
Tommy Hunter was involved in grooming underage girls and pimping them out and he was about to turn informer.
The people who ordered his murder didn't want what he knew about child sexual exploitation to come out and that's exactly the same motive as the murder of Danny Waldron.
They're connected.
Sir we know Hunter's murder was orchestrated by the Caddy and there's ample evidence that someone was pulling Hari Bains' strings.
Using the exact same methods as the Caddy.
"Voice contact only, multiple phones."
"Yeah, but... why couldn't this be the Caddy?"
DC Cole is dead.
"Well, the Caddy is my inquiry, sir, so maybe I should be the one to look into it."
"- Yeah, I'd be grateful."
- Sir.
- Sir...
- What?
Something to say?
"Well, you're not at liberty."
Sir.
"Well, I know exactly who we should speak to first."
Who?
"We'll be fine, thanks, Steve."
Don't!
No!
Let go of me!
Let go!
- Casey!
"- Mom, Mom, please."
"Please, this is for her own good."
Let me go!
You can't!
You'll kill her.
You can't take her.
You'll kill her.
"- Casey, Casey!"
"- Mom, Mom, please."
"Please, it's for her own good."
"Can we clear the hallway, please?"
"Mr. and Mrs. Rance, I know this is a very difficult moment for you."
Please know that everyone here is here for you.
"If there's anything we can do, you just let us know."
Your daughter's on the way to the hospital.
She's gonna receive the very best care available.
"But we're really gonna need to talk about what happened here tonight,"
Mr. and Mrs. Rance.
"724, this is dispatch, over."
"724, this is dispatch, come in."
"Breaking news now, the Andersonville family of a missing young woman is fearing the worst this evening after her disappearance two nights ago after a deadly ambulance crash."
Casey Rance was being transported to a local hospital when her ambulance suffered a bizarre and deadly crash.
"Authorities have declined to state the nature of Miss Rance's underlying illness, but they have issued every assurance that she will be found."
"As police superintendent and as a father with children of my own, I can guarantee no one here will rest until Casey is safely brought home to her family."
Ipse venit.
Himself... is coming.
He... is coming.
We'd like to keep her overnight for observation.
"Oh, come on."
Overnight?
Why?
I think your wife needs some help.
"Believe me, I've tried to talk her into getting a nanny, but she doesn't want another woman raising her daughter."
It makes her feel like she's less of a mother or something.
I don't mean that kind of help.
I think Judy needs some psychiatric help.
What?
"Brad, why don'twe sit down."
"It's not uncommon for new moms to get overwhelmed with all challenges of child care, specially the 1st year."
So why are you making a big deal out of this?
"Usually, it's short-lived and goes away after the baby falls into a routine and the mom's hormones stabilize."
"But occasionally, it lasts longer, becomes more severe, and develops into something called postpartum depression."
"Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy."
"Judy's not depressed, not like that."
"I mean, sure, she's anxious to get back to work, a little down about that, but that's normal."
Purposely trying to hurt herself and your baby isn't.
What are you talking about?
She had an accident!
Some creep tried to run her off the road.
I don't think she was forced off the road.
"Dr. Rasgotra, nosebleed on Coumadin in Two."
"Please, talk to your wife, ask her yourself."
Ask her what really happened in the car.
- Sux on board.
- Yankauer.
- Assist ventilations.
- O-neg's going on the right antecube.
We're gonna need the rapid infuser.
Curtain Four.
Good morning.
Rough night?
"Um, can we talk for a moment?"
A couple of things.
"First,"
"Sammy and I are a couple again, despite your best efforts."
It was an eeriksonian intervention.
"I said you two shouldn't communicate, thereby forcing communication."
An eriksonian intervention.
I'm surprised you didn't figure out.
"Well, I haven't been at the top of my game lately, which brings me to my second point."
I'd like to offer you my practice.
It seems like a reasonable way of deferring some of the costs of our failed partnership.
I'm taking an indefinite leave of absence.
Ok.
I have to work on...
My own problems for a while.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I actually believe that you're a good doctor.
"Well, you know, I think you might be a little better than me, which is why I'm trusting you with my patients."
"So, Beth has all the files."
"I'm sure if you ask her nicely, she'll show them to you."
There's one patient who's particularly important to me.
Michael.
He's going through a transitional phase right now.
"You take very good care of him, please."
I will.
"Good luck, David."
The therapeutic process never ends.
"At each stage of life, there are different challenges, different obstacles to overcome."
Ah!
One is never cured.
He's dead.
I've never shot with these before.

"Man, I've got the shakes."
That's scary stuff there.
That was a lot of fun.
"Bearing in mind they'd fire off three rounds a minute, in the line he'd be all over the place, wouldn't he?"
Yeah.
With his... recoil.
That's probably not very good.

"So I had the Codarl go berserk through the city, to lure you and that white AS here."
And I scattered messages to you all over the city.
Majid was a tactician who once made a name for himself as a guerilla leader in Helmajistan.

And then there's the assassin he gave a name to:

Hamidra is a former electrician and a comrade of yours.
"I knew that if I sent out a message to ""Meet Hamidra at Tsim Sha Tsui,"""
you'd track down a Helmajistani electrician.
It was a message that would get through to no one else in the world but you.
But I thought you would bring a bunch of your friends with you.
Why did you come by yourself?
Did something happen?
That's none of your business!
"So you've finally started to feel uncomfortable, huh?"
What?
"In Mithril, I mean."
Being in a military unit that has pretensions of being an ally of Justice is enough to frustrate anybody.

A total loser.
"Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand."
"Well, h-hold on."
"Uh, what if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?"
What?
"Chide me, dear stone"
That I may say indeed thou art Hermione
"But yet, Paulina, Hermione mas not so much wrinkled"
Nothing so aged as this seems.
"- Oh, not by much."
- So much the more our carver's excellent.
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now.
"Lady, dear Queen, that ended when I but began"
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
"O, patience!"
"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry."
"Let no man mock me, for I will kiss her."
"Good my lord, forbear, the ruddiness upon her lip is wart"
You'll mar it if you kiss it.
- Shall I draw the curtain?
- Not Not these twenty years.
"If you can behold it, I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"
And take you by the hand it is required you do awake your faith.
"Music, awake her; strike!"
'Tis time; descend
Be stone no more; approach
"When she was young, you woo'd her"
"Now in age, is she become the suitor?"
"O, she's warm!"
If this be magic
Let it be an art lawful as eating.
"If she pertain to life, let her speak too."
Mark a little while
"Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel and pray your mother's blessing."
"Tum, good lady"
Our Perdita is found.
You gods look down
"Honey, no matter how many times you have your croissant buttered over..."
"- there, it's still work."
- All right.
Time to move out.
"If you need to reach me, you can call my beeper."
It's 197-UP-SKIRT.
The most important thing to do right now...
This is absolute disgrace!
I can't believe we're all the way downtown... volunteer for this damn charity carnival.
It's pathetic!
You don't see anyone at Vogue having to do this.
I'm the Hair Editor.
I don't crawl around... on the ground picking up dart in the name of expertise.
It's a fairly unusual charity.
Although balls are important.
"- Antoniette, how's you husband?"
- You're married?
- Absolutely!
- And does he still live in Spain?
"Yes, the Atlantic is a fabulous thing for our relatonship."
How often do you see each other?
At holidays!
You were a great director in that video.
Maybe you don't screw this.
"Actually I was going to be a photographer, but the only people who would hire me is sleazy balls in those tabloid photo agencies."
What did you have to do?
Stalk people?
Exactly what I did.
Casually I needed to follow Carol O'Connor... with the sun acid by the roof in the quarter.
- That's sick!
"- Yeah, beyond."
I had this severe moral thing when I was crop star... with my first thirty pound laker.
"Most of the Association will be there, and they're all anxious to meet you."
Okay.
Pipe down.
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this age of quarter-section pastures... and tinhorn legislators who is riding our old trails... it's a real pleasure to welcome a vestige of that heroic era... that we just about lost."
"Standing beside me, right here... is the legendary tracker and interpreter of the Apache wars..."
Tom Horn.
"You're welcome, sir."
"Tom, this is Arlo Chance."
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.
Howdy.
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.
"What's the matter, Tom?"
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.
That's a Maine lobster.
"Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed... and shipped out here by train."
"At every station, the conductor drains the melted seawater off of them."
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.
"Tom, I don't know whether John here told you... but we've got a hell of a range problem here."
The damn rustlers have completely wiped out our herd profits... not to mention... what the buzzards and the predators have done to our cash crops.
We got people homesteading our rangeland... and raising sheep on our grass.
"Right at the present time, Mr. Horn, what's your primary source of livelihood?"
Mr. Coble offered me to ease up at his place for a while... and I said I'd earn my keep.
That's good enough.
"Tom, you met Joe Belle?"
United States Marshal.
Hello.
I know I do.
Y'all remember when phones was getting smaller and smaller and smaller?
Now they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
"By 2017, people are gonna be walking around just like this."
"Be like, ""Yo, man, did you get my text message?"""
"""God got your text messages."""
I can't stand these phones.
They think they can tell you what you can and what you can't say.
You ever had that?
"""Ooh, you spelled a word wrong."""
"Let me tell you something, smartphone."
I spent $500 for you.
"If I want to spell ""crusty"" with a ""K,"""
"then, bitch, I'm gonna do it!"
Messing up my damn conversation.
"I'm on my phone, on my Facebook, trying to type in ""Happy birthday, Tupac."""
"But the autocorrect gonna change it to,"
"""Happy birthday, Tuna."""
I had 200 likes.
"And some dumbass even commented under,"
"""I didn't even know tuna fish was created today."""
"And you ever had somebody say something so stupid to you on Facebook, you just had to go investigate their profile just a little bit?"
"Like, I went to the man's profile."
He said he was studying to be an RN.
"I said, ""Ha, you already an RN."""
A retarded nigga!
"And shout-out to everybody in here right now, shout-out to everybody who got a smartphone with a cracked screen."
Mm-hmm.
Talking about you waiting for your upgrade.
But your shit ain't till two years later.
"So every time you get a text message, you're getting glass shards in your finger and shit."
"Girl talking about, ""Why it take you so long to text back?"""
"Not much, Inspector."
I only know who killed the model.
"And if you know, why not spit it out?"
It was...the murderer.
"Ah, another one of your bad jokes."
May I look trough your notes?
And what is it to you about my notes?
"No, I am refering to the documents of the murdered model, may I see them?"
What are you doing?
Making sure of the authenticity of these documents.
"I am sorry to tell you, Inspector, It will be very difficult to identify the victim."
"Ah, so you mistrust the efficiency of the police?"
Nothing like that.
"To the contrary, they deserve all my respect."
"But what I can assure you, is that , these documents, are fake."
Are you sure?
"A ha, absolutely."
What are you doing?
taking some pictures.
"No doubt, you are quite ingenious."
But this gadget has never done you any good.
"You think, Inspector?"
"Very well, I will take a look around, and will keep you informed."
One moment.
"Remember, no violence, so anything comes up, notify my immediatedly."
Do not react on your own.
No worries.
Come here please
"Yes, Inspector?"
"I want these documents analysed, and duplicate the passport photo."
Immediatedly.
Wait.
"- No, I must get on to Banff."
- As you like.
I hope your car's there when you get back to it.
It won't get far without petrol.
"The Red Army has scored huge successes against the Germans, striking back with tanks and troops along the Eastern Front."
"Hitler's armies have suffered many humiliating defeats and have fled, frozen and in disarray, through the killing snows of Russia."
"All this at the very moment Hitler was saying that the word ""surrender"""
is not to be found in the German vocabulary.
The US and British Forces have stepped up their daylight bombing of Germany.
"Mr Churchill and General Eisenhower are in conference and with the approach of summer, an attack by the Allies on Europe is, of course, only a matter of time."
The fatal question for the Nazi command must be where and when will the invasion take place?
"A U-boat will pick you up off the coast of Scotland, but only when you signal it."
From six in the evening until six in the morning.
Deliver the photographs personally to the Führer.
He says he trusts you.
How very flattering.
"Aye, that's the feller."
I picked him up in the middle of nowhere.
- What a fool I felt when I saw this.
- Are you positive it was the same man?
I offered him lunch.
- And he was going to Banff?
- I dropped him right opposite.
- Scotland Yard on the line.
- At last.
Scotland Yard.
I know it's late.
"It's late here, too."
David.
Put your arm round me.
That's it.
We've had ten more sightings of your man.
"'Wife in spirit', eh."
"Well, up to today we were a married couple."
You leave me no choice.
The reason I'm here is because Shinako and Takao are here.
Up today I've been living for them.
You've been possessed by Takehara.
"If you had married him twenty years ago, you'd be genbetsu."
"Shinako, Takao I want you to listen."
"Up to now, you've had things pretty good by selling the things we've had."
Mother did what she wanted and did her ballet.
"Shinako, you danced, too."
"Takao, you've never had to worry about anything."
You say that Mother lived for you.
"Well, yourethechildren of an extravagant mother."
"But all this time I have been living a spiritually impoverished life, a miserable life."
You three have brought up a miserable father.
Don't say that.
I can't respect you if you say that.
No one respects anyone else here.
"We're not a family, just four people."
"You say such mean things, Father."
"You don't have the slightest idea of how much Mother has tried to love you, do you?"
"Mother, you must hate me because you think I was watching you for Father."
"But really, all I wanted was for you and Father to get along."
What father says is true: everyone in this family lives their own life.
The ship is sinking and all of us are just trying to save ourselves.
"Takao, your father is a pitiful person."
I know.
Take care of him.
Mother...
"Shinako, take care of your father."
You can live even if your parents don't love each other.
- Do you think I'll pass for a Helot?
- No problem.
"When Helotrix was first settled, the old Stock Equalization Act was still in force."
Every Earth race had to be represented.
I didn't know Helots were originally from Earth.
Everyone came from Earth originally.
That's a well-known fact.
"It's a well-known opinion, actually."
- Most well-known facts are.
- But not in this case.
Helotrix is one of the oldest colonies and the first to gain independence from the empire.
Until the Federation grabbed it back.
"- Come on, Dayna."
- Right.
That idiot's looking forward to it.
He can't wait to go snooping around Helotrix.
"He's good material, is Tarrant."
One of the best.
He's not the man for the job.
Tarrant has about as much subtlety as a Tarzian Warg Strangler.
"All I'm saying is Tarrant's going to walk straight into trouble, and get himself killed or captured."
"If he's dead, he can't talk."
"But if the Federation find out we're hanging around, we won't stand a chance."
Not in this ship.
At least in the Liberator we could always outrun them.
"Vila, if the Federation do have some new weapon, the Helots will know all about it."
All Tarrant has to do is ask a few questions in the right places.
Even your Tarzian Warg Strangler might manage that.
You think so?
"Well, you better give him a list of questions and then a map to find the right places."
"Doesn't have much time for Tarrant, does he?"
"Oh, well, Tarrant is brave, young, handsome."
Yeah.
"It was touch and go for a minute there, but I think she's gonna be ok."
You ever heard of something like this happening before?
"Unfortunately, all the time."
"They fill balloons or condoms with heroin, they have the kids swallow them, load them up with suppositories to keep them from moving their bowels for 2 or 3 days, then when they get to the contact,"
they force-feed them laxatives.
Uncle Joe.
Exactly.
This is nice.
Burton:
Very nice.
"To be here with family, it's nice."
Mm-hmm.
"So, Jeremy, how's school?"
"I go to the townsend academy, Uncle Burton, located in the lovely cumberland county, away from any civilization, where we enjoy a small teacher-student ratio, great college placement, and the constant aroma of cow dung."
[Burton chuckles]
Nick went to prep school.
Did you like it?
"No, not really."
"Jeremy, didn't you want to ask Nick about soccer?"
No.
Jeremy's on the soccer team.
"Yeah, that was months ago, mom."
We thought it would be fun to go down to the civic arena.
"They're going to have a professional indoor soc-- they don't want to do that, mom."
Maybe they do.
"You know, what is with you?"
Huh?
"Suddenly you want to, like, spend time with me, suddenly you're inviting cousin Ernie and Uncle Bert to soccer games."
"You want to pass the wine, please?"
You know what?
Allow me.
"Idea given by dude is not bad, sir!"
Actually they do not know each other.
"- Meaning do you both have it, sir?"
That girl is my Facebook friend.
- Who is that girl?
Means..
Aunty.
"That is when I put message asking how she was, she replied saying her son is not well."
"When I went to hospital for consoling, some bloody guy took photos and published in the magazine."
Why don't you tell the same matter to madam clearly sir?
"You know about ladies, right?"
Yes sir.
They give life if believed and take lives when they get a doubt.
Thus we need to do something and see that Vasundhara doesn't get any doubt.
I would somehow catch that stranger and make him agree to act that husband character.
You convince your Facebook friend and somehow make her agree to act in the wife character.
We will make them both sit in front of the media.
Our problem will be solved.
"Thanks Karthi, you be on that job."
"- OK sir,"
"Master, you do your job."
Leave!
"Jayaraj, why has that IB officer come here?"
Which IB officer?
Him..
How is that guy an IB officer?
He is the son of my plant manager Ramachandra Rao.
He is the same officer who closed down your liquor factory and closed down your Hawala hub and also the one who hit your son and sent into coma.
I have seen him with IB Chief.
Shit.
Ramachandra Rao
- Sir.
(SCREAMING) mus GROANS)
I gather your brother explained to you how vital the work you're doing here is to the future of this city?
"Please, just let Four go."
If his well-being is of such concern then you should focus on the task at hand.
(JEANINE SIGHS)
"Tell me, do you appreciate irony?"
"You tested positive for Erudite, so you must have the intellectual capacity."
Irony?
"For instance, right now you're filled with hate."
But you need to pass an Amity sim.
(LAUGHING)
"Then there are other ironies at work, too."
Such as the fact that your cherished mother...
Don't.
...who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim is the reason you're in this mess to begin with.
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
Then there's the most poignant irony of all...
Stop.
...that Natalie Prior not only died trying to protect the data that
- I now have in my possession.
-Because you stole it from her.
You killed her for it!
Data that she so selfishly withheld.
But her own daughter.
Her beloved Divergent Tris is going to be the one to deliver it to me.
I said stop!
"Therefore, your mother's death, just like your boyfriend's death, will mean absolutely nothing."
(RUMBLING)
Don't pull her out.
Not yet.
JEANNE'.
NO.
-Okay.
"Well, cheers then, Gil."
You take care.
"-Yeah, yes."
"See you around, Bob."
"Oh, Roberta, my sweet darling."
"God forgive me for what I'm about to do if it appears in anyway perverse or improper to you, but..."
I really fear I can't help myself.
"And at that moment, I swear he could've done anything."
"Such was the passion that coursed through my veins as he gazed upon my body for the first time, unclothed and unfettered by the trappings of society."
"I hope it will not shock you, Dora, when I say that he surrendered to his deepest most primal impulse... and wrote a poem, slowly at first... delicately selecting each precious word."
"But as the inspiration took flight and his imagination soared, oh, what imagery!"
"What rhythmic, pulsing metres."
"What gushing, bounteous couplets flowed from his pen."
"My dearest sister, I tell you now, he is the warmest, truest, most perfect gentleman I have ever met in all the world."
ALICE:
I suppose Cleo's right.
I'm going to have to go to this thing tomorrow.
"Brian's birthday bash, ""the big four""... and drag myself out of the comfort zone."
"God, I hate parties."
"-Hey, hello."
-Hi.
How are you?
Now one with just the three cousins.
"Darling, if you just wanna put yourself in the middle there."
And big smiles.
Lovely.
"So, anyway, how's life treating you these days, Janice?"
-You're looking well.
"-Yes, still muddling along."
Yeah.
And Malcolm?
"Oh, what primitive fury."
"Why, he's the very soul of sublime savagery."
"Trelane, let him go."
We haven't even got our phasers.
"Yes, of course."
I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too much.
"But I warn you, you can't provoke me again."
"Come, everyone."
Let's forget your bad manners.
Let's be full of merry talk and sallies ofwit.
We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind.
"Come, Doctor, do partake."
"Ah, you've been, uh... quite derelict in your social duties, Captain."
You haven't introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew.
This is...
General Trelane.
Retired.
"But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely squire of Gothos, dear ladies."
Lieutenant Uhura of Communications.
Ah... a Nubian prize.
"Taken on one of your raids of conquest, no doubt, Captain."
No doubt.
"She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba, the same lovely coloring."
And this.
Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
"Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss."
Yeoman Teresa Ross.
I believe you have met our science officer Mr. Spock.
"You do realize, don't you, that it's in deference to the captain that I brought you here?"
Affirmative.
"Well, I don't know if I like your tone."
It's most challenging.
There's not one thing in my life that I don't filter through what coach Smith would do and what he did.
- Was he a great humanitarian?
- Was he a great mentor?
Was he someone who I loved dearly?
Was he someone who I loved dearly?
"Was it someone who, I carry today, many of the lessons when I try and instill it in my children or young people that I mentor?"
All of that.
His impact was so far-reaching.
"Coach Smith, to me, is always coach Smith, so, um..."
I know how fortunate I am.
I know how lucky I am.
I've had 50 wonderful years of a relationship with a man
I've had 50 wonderful years of a relationship with a man that I have nothing but love and admiration for.
"In the 5000 crore-worth fake title-deed scam case at Chennai beach road, ...distributor Ravi was arrested day before yesterday."
"As he tried to escape en-route Puzhal prison to court, the police shot him dead."
My son would not have attempted to escape
He has been framed and ecnountered to save some big shots
Hello.
Can I get a smaller piece?
"Please wait, let me check"
Is he dull-witted or what?
"He has taken a toy gun, that too out of cover"
How much is this?
How much?
"Madam, can I help you?"
"Oh, I am sorry."
I assumed you were a sales boy.
-You can take it.
"-Please No problem, you could have it."
-Please you could have it.
You have it.
You shall receive Communion and all the children of God will rejoice.
And shall I?
And what does His Majesty intend for the unfortunate object of his previous affection?
I shall forget her.
And the Lord will forgive her.
"In return, I insist on the Church's unconditional support in my war against the Dutch."
And you shall have it!
It is my goal is to drive out the Protestant scourge and create a Catholic Empire with justice and enlightenment at it's center.
"I need Rome by my side, not blocking my path."

That hurts!
"The blood has been contaminated, Your Highness."
"By the process of purging and xenotransfusion, the humor will be returned to their normal state."
Xenotransfusion meaning?
The introduction of the blood of another species.
In this case?
The blood of a sheep.
I shall return later today.
Do you believe that she's been poisoned?
I do.
"Nausea, vomiting, general feeling of weakness, thosse are common symptoms, yes."
And do you believe that this is the best course of treatment?
I do.
You better pray you're right!
"Because if your not and something happens to her,"
I would stick that quill right through your eye!
Was it you?
Was what me?
How did you do it?
Did you slip poison into her wine?
What are you talking about?
My wife!
Because of trust.
Trust that the politicians the people voted for will uphold their integrity.
Trust that the newly entering soliders believe their nation will protect them.
Trust that college will build the kinds of talents needed for the new era.
"That the corporations, will be there, together with their laborers, through their pain and their growth."
That trust.
"And also, those men who waited in Nampo Waters, trusting in the promise of their nation."
The trust of 21 men.
Guarding that trust.
Is what I believe to be a great cause.
The Sweep Mission 28 years ago... there's not a day that goes by that I have forgotten about it.
"How much Jin Pyo suffered,"
I know that very well.
Take this.
"These are illegal campaign funds I received, while I was in politics."
Do whatever you want.
"Whatever you do, I'll be grateful."
Yoon Sung.
"You living like this, your father is sorry."
Are you really... going to do this to the end?
"The person who's suffered and had the most difficult time is you, Lee Yoon Sung."
Do you have to do it like this?
There's no one else other than me...
I have to do it.
People's Daily.
We shall now begin the voting on the 2011 Private School Reform Bill.
The President planned the sweep mission?
What?
...
"What, killing 21 men by the bullets of our own?"
Isn't this crazy!
?
"Everyone brings a camera with them, a cell phone camera or whatever..."
You could borrow one and we go off in small groups  and we take pictures of the products we see in supermarkets.
In supermarkets or drugstores...
We simply go in with our cameras...
It's irritating enough for most of the sales people.
"We go in with the cameras, and take pictures of like hairspray, toothpaste, candy bars  instant soup, packets of noodles, etc... etc..."
We'll form our own impressions  because we've been bombarded from every direction  by foreign pictures.
"- If you'd like to bring others with you, I've prepared some extra flyers."
- Take them with you.
Invite your friends or convince your spouses...
The door is locked.
Chess.
Put your knight over here...
"and then you can take the rook  but before that, you let me out!"
Keep that in mind.
Couldn't be!
I see you two are getting along.
"Tom, how does this dress suit me?"
Fabulous!
And how does he suit me?
A work in progress.
I think so too.
He's demanding.
Are you two finished?
Come on!
I have a surprise for you.
She's also quite demanding.
I'll give it a try.
We start with the action.
We have to do something.
We'll do something...
We have to come together and actually do something.
Go!
We don't have time for this.
Drop the gun.
The book.
"The police and Special Branch have traced the perpetrator in Jutland, but you need to focus on the meeting with the party committee."
"Listen, Kamper..."
Kamper?
"Kamper, I just want to say..."
I've just heard about the meeting.
I will of course back you up.
The Treasurer will undoubtedly try to put you in a bad light.
She's tried to sway some of the others ahead of the meeting.
"It doesn't matter what she's done, there won't be any meeting."
"We're looking into important information that will clear the government of all suspicion, and you arrange this?"
"As a Minister and a party member, you're responsible to me alone."
"So, go and tell your people that you're sorry to have wasted their time."
- What information?
- I'm not getting into that.
"But according to a witness, it was Ussing who put pressure on the prosecutor then."
- What witness?
- One of Ussing's former staff members.
Special Branch are looking into his affairs.
I can't give you any more details.
- Of course.
Hopefully it isn't Seifert.
- Do you take us for complete idiots?
Everyone knows he was reported for stealing from Ussing's campaign budget.
Well...
That doesn't matter.
If it's true...
"Regardless, it should be investigated."
I've asked Special Branch...
"Oh, I'm always right about everything."
"You'll see, you and Amanda are going to be very happy together."
"The staff is very pleased you'll be here with the family again, madam."
"Oh, thank you, Gerard."
Thank them all for me.
Would you send someone to La Mirage to pick up the rest of Mrs. Carrington's things?
"Yes, sir, right away."
"Welcome home, darling."
Darling.
Steven.
"Hello, Adam, Claudia."
"It's not just ""Claudia"" now, Steven."
She's Mrs. Carrington again.
Mrs. Adam Carrington.
What's the matter?
Do you wanna see the licence?
We wouldn't wanna do anything illegal and embarrass the family.
"I hadn't expected you to move back here, Claudia, if you wanna know the truth."
Hadn't expected?
Or had hoped not to see us so happy here in Father's house?
"Excuse us, Steven."
"We're going upstairs, to bed."
"- Amanda, I think it's time that we faced a couple of facts."
"Facts, you're having problems with your marriage and you need help."
"And you're prepared, I suppose, to offer that help since it was you who encouraged me to get married in the first place."
"Amanda, you love Michael and Michael loves you."
"I think you should try and work it out, for better or for worse."
Just like you did with Daddy?
Your father and I had several wonderful years together.
And we have four children to show for it.
"You know, I've never told you this before, but I tried very hard to make the marriage work."
"And when we finally got divorced, something died inside of me."
I devoured!
I fused the symbolic with the real.
( screams ) I exuded spiritual terror!
Ridicule.
Exposure.
The stain of defeat.
Burst!
Tainted.

But now a new born is crying for mercy.

"""l am pained from the heart, hence the voice also sounds so"""
"""What is the reason?"

King Satyavrath is killed and his queen has also died.
The cry of their baby in Shiv temple is unbearable.
"""When you know all this, king broke his promise and its result.."""
There's nothing complex to understand.
"Please, Sadhana!"
I'm already terribly confused.
You are actually very clear.
Only I am confused and running behind you repeatedly...
What's happening here?
But...
I have seen many fraudsters.
"But you have tricked a cop for your own selfish, personal reasons."
Panju...
"- You easily decided that a person like me will be a constable forever, that you can take full advantage of me!"
Can't blame you.
My face is made to look like that!
"Had I not known the truth even now,"
I would be roaming with you dreaming of becoming a TV celebrity.
Mister...
- You almost got me fired from my job!
We couldn't have made such a progress in this case without you!
You would have gotten nowhere had I not come.
"Panju, the case has made a big progress."
Our work starts only now!
Our work?
I won't even have you on my Facebook friend list.
Enough!
We started this case to find the details of the dead man.
But this case has reached new heights now.
"If we are able to nab her,"
You will be in the limelight.
She is really a journalist.
"If we solve this case perfectly,"
The cover page of her magazine Vikatan will bear your photo.
This face?
Confirmed.
I want everything in the data banks concerning Galaxy Class cruisers.
Complete data is extensive.
Good.
How long before we're in teleport range?
That will depend on speed as yet unspecified.
- Standard By Four?
- 16.140901 minutes.
"Approximately speaking, of course."
It is estimated that you will require 128 hours to assimilate all available data on Galaxy Class cruisers.
Mark Three?
No sign of any external damage.
"According to the data banks, Galaxy Class cruisers are fitted with communicators."
See if you can raise a voice contact will you Cally?
- I don't like this.
- That's unusual.
"Mock if you like, but I can always sense danger."
"Yes, even when there isn't any."
Scan doesn't show any modifications.
I think it's just what it seems to be.
An obsolete civilian cruiser.
Any luck Cally?
No response on any channel.
"All right, I'm going across."
"Will you come with me, Avon?"
Cally?
Vila?
You don't need me to come over!
Confirmed.
"There you are, deserted."
"If they did abandon, they certainly did it in a hurry."
"If the last of this mark is built half a century ago, this ship could have been here a very long time."
Yuk has been disappeared.
We have reasons to believe that she was killed by Foon too.
We believe that our almighty God...
Cause his justice.
"This is a court, as well as a place God shows justice!"
He is really something.
Defence counsel.
"Your Honour, may I ask the jury few questions?"
What questions?
Very important questions.
Go ahead.
"If you think the accused is handsome, please raise your hands."
"If not, please raise your hands."
"If you think the accused is terribly ugly, please raise your hands."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the accused is ugly and poor, you can see how ugly looking he is."
How could he seduce the wife of the manager of a well-off family?
"Your Honour, objection!"
"Your Honour,"
I just want to prove the motive of killing... is actually ridiculous!
"Your Honour, the defence counsel is ridiculous and not practical!"
"Alright, be a bit practical."
"Lady, if the accused wants to court you, will you accept that?"
Of course not.
"If he gives you a thousand, can you stay with him for a night?"
Nuts!
Doesn't he think he can court me with a thousand only?
What a creep!
"Auntie, you should answer the question only."
Why did you scold me?
Who do you think you are?
You are a pervert!
You murderer!
I'm getting mad!
The persons named by Judge Fuselier are requested to enter.
"Whatever I do in the office of the judge, do not be surprised of the consequences for you, even if I created them."
"Good morning, miss."
"Hello, my dear Fandor."
"For once, I do not receive the journalist, but the witness."
Miss.
You have arrived at the right time to save Miss Dollon a few days ago.
"In any case, the gas was cut."
It's hot in here.
I'm taking off my coat.
"Please, miss."
"I've learned, gentlemen, that you had been victims of a thief."
"Yes, 25 million."
"That's right, gentlemen?"
It's a terrible blow for you.
Abominable.
We almost lost the trust of our clients.

It's true.
"When you're a master of finance, confidence is essential."
"Yes, well, I guess you were insured, right?"
Obviously.
But what are our troubles compared to the tragedy which hit Miss Elizabeth?
The Murder of the Baroness de Vibray?
"No, Madame de Vibray commited suicide."
The letter sent to the procurator was subjected to handwriting analysis and experts are adamant:
It is his writing.
I need your attention.
What I'm about to reveal is extremely delicate.
"Elizabeth, you are surrounded by friends."
I'm asking you to tell us the truth!
That's it?
That's all she said?
Seriously?
You know what?
"Actually, Allie did tell me one other thing about you."
What?
Remember that night when you were freaking out about your history exam?
"She told me that she wished that you were there because when she was a kid and was nervous about something, you'd always climb into bed with her until she fell asleep."
"Yeah, that was before she became the second coming of the Boston Strangler."
- Allie.
- So you obviously don't know that I am batshit crazy.
"- Well, he does now."
- You're not batshit crazy.
You were batshit crazy.
"Allie, why didn't you tell him?"
"Compliments, everybody."
Compliments.
You turn to the person across the table from you and give them a compliment.
"Hugh, you start."
"Oh, okay."
"Luke, that's a heck of a shirt you got on there."
Thank you.
Uh...
"Um, I'm still a little stuck on this whole trying-to-kill-you thing."
"Yeah, me too."
I have schizophrenia.
"So, um, is that like the one with different personalities and...?"
"No, that's multiple personality disorder."
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder.
"It doesn't normally make people violent, but it can impair their thinking, emotions, behavior."
I don't really know what that means either.
"Basically, I have hallucinations and sometimes I hear voices that tell me to do things."
"Oh, this is the pump!"
LEVINE:
Yup!
We're in the process of building all across the city.
This street right here used to be fully underwater.
During high tide you may need a canoe.
"And now what we did was we raised this road and you can see the difference, see how that area there kind of goes, slopes down a little bit."
DICAPRIO:
"So the main investment is in these systems right here, raising the roads and the electric pumps."
LEVINE:
"Yeah, this is a 400‐million‐dollar project."
City wide.
And of course we're paying for it by our city revenues.
"I had to raise tax revenue, which you can imagine is not a very popular thing to do as a politician."
DICAPRIO:
And this construction is it going to make a major difference.
LEVINE:
Major difference.
DICAPRIO:
And buy you a significant amount of time.
LEVINE:
"Absolutely I would think about 40, 50 years."
DICAPRIO:
That's it?
LEVINE:
Yes.

Who is the one leading this legislation?
He took bribes from shabby third-class companies.
Isn't catching such corrupt people the work of a prosecutor?
I can't approve that.
"If you really want to arrest him, then show me the evidence."
"Due to that shabby construction work, the support pillar broke, leading to death of personnel."
Those families are homeless.
How can we just sit by...
Didn't I ask you to find the evidence?
These are very serious matters.
How can you be called a prosecutor?
=Seoul's Prosecutors did not find any evidence against Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.=
=I must gather evidence to bring justice to everyone.=
Didn't that person used to...
First have a chat with me.
Do you know this person?
"No, I just saw him."
How did you know my name?
This ajussi!
Really...
So that's why he was after Mi Jin?
He has personality.
"Excuse me, you are..."
"Department of Seoul's District Public Prosecutor, I'm Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju."
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju wants to wrap round one's finger.
That's why you came to my house.
I always envied Kim Jong Sik for having a son like you.
"You even rejected my calls, so I personally came to talk with you."
"Who permitted you to be so offensive, the law should take care of a person like you."
Don't you know?
"Threatening me, is a big mistake."
Me?

"I can again thy former light restore, should I repent me:"

Balmy breath... that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword!
"One more, one more."
"Be thus when thou art dead... and I will kill thee, and love thee after."
"One more, and this the last:"
So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
I must weep... but they are cruel tears:
this sorrow's heavenly;
It strike where it doth love.
She wakes.
Who's there?
Othello?
Ay Desdemona.
"Will you come to bed, my lord?"
"- Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?"
"- Ay, my lord."
"If you bethink yourself of any crime... unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, solicit for it straight."
"Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?"
"Well, do it, and be brief;"
I will walk by:
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forefend!
I would not kill thy soul.
- Talk you of killing?
"- Ay, I do."
"- Then heaven, have mercy on me!"
"- Amen, with all my heart!"
"If you say, so, I hope you will not kill me."
And yet I fear you;

Horace was my sponsor.
"There was no café society in those days, only Society with a capital ""S"", and its doors weren't open to a young actress."
But Horace pushed them open.
"It wasn't too difficult, my dear."
"Horace, I'll never understand why you let her get away from you."
"She ran too fast, right into Matt Kernan."
"Why did you choose father, darling?"
Because we came from the same neighborhood.
"Because we were comfortable together, right from the very beginning."
It's taken me 20 years to get comfortable with Horace.
"By that time, we were much too good friends to consider being anything else."
"Well, Jess, I'm just as handsome, and blue-blooded, and glamorous as Horace."
-Aren't you comfortable with me?
"-At the moment, no."
"Well, in that case, I shall leave you for Frank Belney."
"Darling, would you like to stay?"
I can pick you up on the way back.
"Why don't you, dear?"
I'm terrified of being left alone with Horace.
He's been wearing that family-lawyer face all evening.
"And I have a speech to go with it, my dear."
"It begins, ""Nora, as your legal adviser, I cannot approve certain extravagances."""
See?
I'm a little tired.
I'm afraid you'll have to face Horace alone.
"Well, I shall ignore him."
It's been the best evening of the week as always.
What?
Do you wanna be partners in a bar or anything with that guy?
What?
All I'm saying is she wouldn't be a boring date.
"Oh, I'm gonna go home and sleep for three days."
Our regular shift starts at 6:00am.
"Oh, yeah."
But tomorrow is my scheduled day off.
"With this red ball over, I'm gonna get to spend the day with my kids."
"That's right, and I get to have lunch with your wife."
Somehow I think I'm getting the short end of this partnership.
Detective Pembleton are you waiting for someone?
This case it still troubles you?
Yes.
I caught a killer...
who murdered eight women.
She claims to have a disorder - that she's crazy.
"I think, isn't anyone crazy who kills someone else?"
Does that somehow mean that she's not responsible?
Does that mean that she doesn't have to suffer?
I'm angry.
I can't let it go.
I don't find it difficult believing in this multiple personality disorder.
"I look and I see nothing but souls shattered like mirrors, mine included... and yours."
- I keep mine in control.
- Thank God for that.
"Now you just have to learn to forgive yourself for all those different personalities and the Wilgis woman, too."
"I know that Katherine Goodrich would have, with her dying breath,"
- forgiven her murderer.
- Fine.
Now who speaks for the others?
What right do any of us have to forgive in their name?
He didn't understand the same threats made in Thebes and Athens would not work here.
This is the birthplace of the world's greatest warriors.
Men whose king would stand and fight and die for any one of them.
Xerxes' messenger did not understand this is no typical Greek city-state.
This is Sparta.
It was clear to the messenger there'd be no Spartan submission?
It was clear.
Even now Leonidas is in counsel with the Oracle over his battle plan.
The Festival of the Carneia is all that stands in our way.
Surely the Oracle will see we must fight.
"Well, then my timing is perfect."
I am commanding a fleet of ships that will represent a united Greece.
I need Sparta to join me.
"Give me your ships, Gorgo."
I'll make sure that Xerxes wishes he never crossed the Aegean.
You'll receive no Spartan ships.
We've no interest in a united Greece.
"That is your dream, Themistokles, not ours."
All I am concerned with is the preservatio of Sparta.
My guards will see you out.
It's funny that you mock freedom here in your selfish isolation.
"Yet freedom, in her wisdom has chosen you to defend her."
My queen.
Will Sparta join our fight?
Apparently the Persians have offered the Spartans something they cannot refuse.
- And what is that?
- A beautiful death.
They say you are the bravest of our captives.
They say you are a whore from the eastern seas.
You're not the smartest.
Your commander is a Greek.
Just like me.
He cares more about work than anything else.
Sounds like someone is dreading something.
"Well, he hates me."
So I can think of a number of places
I'd rather be.
(Dozer) Nothing good on the surveillance footage from the reception.
Unless you consider guests sipping Chardonnay and eating mini-quiches helpful.
That's Walker.
Staying next to the woman in the hat.
"He pretty much spent his time glad-handing and listening to people ""ooh"" and ""aah"" about his art."
That's all we got.
The tape finishes when the party ends.
Maybe it was sabotage.
"I mean, Walker's a pretty controversial guy."
"Yeah, maybe the theft was a political statement."
Someone did vandalize some of his pieces at an exhibit three years ago.
Never caught the guy.
"Well, the only thing is that this was his least controversial series in years."
Maybe we should be looking elsewhere.
(Walker) I don't believe this!
You're telling me someone just waltzed in here and stole my work?
"That's two years of my life, Marla!"
"Gus, honey, that's exactly what we're trying to find out."
"Mr. Walker, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
"What about surveillance, huh?"
"I mean, there's security cameras here everywhere."
Someone disconnected them.
"Actually, uh, they were turned off."
"Well, either way."
"No, not exactly."
"No, they weren't broken or disconnected."
They were shut down by someone with a password.
This is just about me.
(scoffs)
"Still, when you say you don't want to be in a relationship because you want to focus on your career..."
And that's the way
I felt at the time.
"Look, I love what we had together, you know that."
"But, you also know I was running when I got to D.C."
I didn't know who I was.
"Keep digging into Garcia, let me know if you find anything."
Hannah... (sighs)
(computer beeps)
Whoa.
(beeps)
"Pride, call me back."
I think I just got a big break on your case.
Had FBI's Robbery Task Force see if there were any other robberies that matched the MOs of the one in Mississippi:
"bank in Orlando, one in Mobile, armored car in Atlanta."
All involved three masked gunmen with assault weapons and a getaway driver.
That pretty much matches most bank robberies these days.
Right.
But what if I told you each one also happened to take place in the exact same city as a car race?
PRIDE:
Huh.
Suggesting that the heist crew is connected to the racing circuit.
Too much of a coincidence for it not to be.
"I mean, whoever hacked Jared's car obviously knew racecars inside and out."
"Yeah, except Jared's a marine, not part of the circuit, so why hack his car?"
"That, I don't know."
"Just curious, how'd you even know Jared's car was hacked?"
"Well, don't look at me."
I left her alone like you said.
I still have my NCIS computer access.
Isn't that true?
Admiral Yi does not discriminate between ranks.
He is unlike you men that treat your subordinates like animals!
Bastard!
This land that you're standing on is where I was born.
I know this area like the back of my hand.
I suggest you tell the truth if you want to live.
Kill me.
"I've failed to accomplish my mission, so I'm dead anyway!"
Yi Soon-shin will strike Wekyo on the 18th?
"It's a land-sea joint attack with Kwon Yul, General."
"For another thousand heads,"
Jin Lin will stay out of the battle along with Yu Jong.
I think we should take the deal.
We want to reduce the number of enemy as much as we can.
Send another message to Shimizu and Wakizaka.
"On November 18, we will stain the shores of Shinsung-po red with the enemy's blood."
"Yes, sir."
Konishi has taken the bait.
He has agreed to deliver the heads to Admiral Jin.
Enemy believes that we will strike Shinsung-po of Wekyo.
And Shimizu and Wakizaka will lead their fleet through Noryang without suspicion.
And we will be waiting in Noryang to sink them.
Lt. Na...
"We acquired cooperation from local merchants and fishermen as you ordered, sir."
The merchant ships have been fitted with weapons and archers and gunners have been placed in position.
Commander Yi...
"Yes, sir."
You are me from now on.
Konishi must be deceived completely.
"Yes, sir."
"I won't let you down, sir."

"- (CLEARS THROAT) Well, two things."
"First, you're going to be in the ""35 Under 35"" issue of the New York Literary Review."
- Nobody reads that anymore.
- This is something.
It is not uncompetitive.
Don't be a baby.
All I have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life.
But my mother is determined to see me distinguished.
Orator.
Politician.
Even a barrister would do.
If I drove a barouche.
What do you wish for?
"I prefer the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother."
"She prefers the army, but that is too smart for me."
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.
Country living is my ideal.
A small parish where I might do some good.
Keep chickens...
Give very short sermons.
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -
- When one has no choice of any occupation whatsoever.
Our circumstances are therefore precisely the same.
Except that you will inherit your fortune.
We cannot even earn ours.
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy is our only option.
What is swabbing exactly?
"""No voice divine the storm allayed."
"No light propitious shone."""
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
"""But I, beneath a rougher sea, and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he..."""
No.
Edward.
"""No voice divine the storm allayed."
"No light propitious shone."""
- But don't you think that...
- Report at 9 in the morning.
Nine o'clock in the morning.
"Thank you, sir."

This radio station is one of the largest enterprises of its kind.
"A Metropolis in itself complete with theatres stores, cafes, and offices representing every form of art and industry, employing an army of men and women."
There are 1222 miles of hallways and corridors.
"666,000 square feet of floor space and 1,000,283 separate and distinct articles of fabrication were used in its construction."
So what!
"And now, we will enter the main broadcast auditorium."
"The Rex Hour is on the air, and absolute silence must prevail."

"If I'm declared unfit for duty, then she takes over."
"Captain, if you won't come with me, I'll be required under Starfleet Order 104,"
"Section C, to relieve you of command."
"I expected something like this from her, but not from the two of you."
Corporal.
I've already confined two senior officers today.
His neurochemistry appears normal.
There's nothing wrong with him?
This scan is hardly conclusive.
I'll need to get him into the Imaging Chamber and run a complete neurological series.
"When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi ship that picks it up will start heading this way."
He's got Hayes on the bridge...
macos posted all over the ship.
"Whatever we do, we're going to have to do it fast."
"What are you proposing, Commander?"
I think it's time we throw the rule book out the window.
Captain.
"I'm sorry, sir, no visitors."
You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
"You'll have to speak with the Major, sir."
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
"Step away, sir."
"Stand down, Corporal."
"The captain gave Hayes control of the bridge, posted macos on every deck."
Is he still on the surface?
Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be a priority.
I'd advise securing the bridge first.
Thought it was impossible for mere children to move Grandma.
Grandma said she'd go right after holding a memorial service for Grandpa.
Did you write that in the telegram?
"Yes, he did."
August 9 is the day Grandpa died because of the atom bomb.
She'II go after the memorial service on that day.
That's not advisable.
"If clark reads that telegram, it's going to be pretty awkward, isn't it?"
Why do you say that?
Why?
Because clark is an American.
"And after he finds out that Grandpa was killed by the atom bomb... of course, it will make him feel pretty awkward."
We've got trouble.
"Father, you mean that you went there... and didn't tell Suzujiro and clark and his family about Grandpa?"
Of course not.
It is something that is not necessary to mention.
It's Father!
Sam and Mother!
Thanks... for all your trouble.
"I'II bet it was some trip for you, too."
Machino told me that you were coming straight here.
"Since I haven't seen Grandma for some time, I decided to come and pay a visit."
Me too.
I've been having Grandma look after my kids all this time.
So I must see her and thank her.
"By the way, how was it in Hawaii?"
"I made a little inquiry and found out... that the pineapple farm is considerably large... and the canning factory that goes with it, too."
"And tell me, Suzujiro's house, I hear it's just like a castle."
Is it?
Mother... you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?
"Tonight's dinner was quite a spread, but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?"
"Ram G, kill them."
"- What to kill, my Dosa?"
What man..
"He is not your CI Ram G, but my master."
What are these twists over twists like one plus one offer sir?
"To know about your schemes daily, I locked your Ram G in and put my master in his place with you."
That third box is waiting for you.
IB chief is safe.
"Once my brother opens his eyes tomorrow, one non-bailable warrant will be issued on your name."
Your meter will be shattered with that.
"Sir, he is a real fighter and is thus hitting very strongly."
We are left now with just one way.
We will escape to foreign in special flight.
We will have many sites there.
I will not leave the guy who killed my son.
"Sir, ruthless fellows like you should not have such revenge and emotions."
He showed me my son's corpse.
I will show him what I am.
Hello..
Where is my dad?
Ramachandra Rao
Sir..
"Ramachandra Rao, I called to say a few facts about your son."
What has he done sir?
- He has done a lot.
He sacrificed his education for his sister's education in his childhood.
Did you not understand?
"Knowing you cannot educate both, he purposefully scored low marks."
"As you cannot make your daughter as a Collector with your income alone, he became a stuntman."
After arranging everything for an opportunity to make your daughter an IAS..
He handled it carefully without your knowledge.
Do you know why?
"""Dear Harriet, I keep thinking"
"""how your sweet words have helped me"
"""during these trying days of advice and criticism."
"""What will happen is all I still don't know..."
"""I mean, the hatred of your brothers,"
"""Abbot and Willie."
"""My only hope is that the beauty of new love"
"""will in some way make them understand."
"""Now over me is a heaviness of quiet and incompleteness,"
"""and I'm still very discouraged by the feeling of ineptness."
"""Lou."""
"Well, we were soul mates,"
"I would say, and inspired each other so that it was an equal exchange in many ways."
And I was a critic.
I do think that I brought the sense of nature and another sight to Lou's work.
Where did you work in the office?
"I worked in a room, and sometimes it was locked."
Why?
"Well, because of his wife, who would come in, drop by sometimes."
Sounds fairly...
fairly nerve-wracking.
It was nerve-wracking.
It was humiliating in some ways.
"When the buildings were created and finished and... for example, the Kimbell Museum."
"Everyone went out to the opening, but I was not invited."
I was not allowed to come.
Is it partly because you were a woman or that you were involved with him?
"Yes, I think all of those things, yeah."
"Didn't you ever say to him,"
"""Well, why don't you respect me more?"
"""Why don't you include me in these things"
"""or make me a part of your""..."
Then you watch his face and body.
"It'll telegraph a player's strategy, his... training, maybe his motivations."
- Is that what you need us to do?
- No.
I need you to listen.
You're fluent in arabic.
I won't know the nuances like you.
"Every word, every phrase."
"Be on the lookout for subtext, ulterior meanings."
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to watch for tells.
"Non-verbals, micro-expressions."
"Watch him when he's comfortable and relaxed, then note the behavioral changes when he's under stress."
"If we can establish a baseline, we'll be able to read him once I challenge his belief systems."
"Before I can get him to give up where or how they'll attack,"
I'll first have to cause him to reveal something of himself.
- Game over.
- What are you talking about?
"Gitmo's runway is perpendicular to cuban airspace, so approaching aircraft have to negotiate a... last minute 90 degree right turn in order to land."
They call it the Gitmo twist.
- I was winning.
"- Actually, he would have had you in 3."
- Bonnie Ryan.
- Aaron Hotchner.
- DEA team.
We ran this raid.
- Derek Morgan.
This must have slowed you down some?
Hell enough for them to get out through the tunnel.
They must have done escape drills.
"- Hey, Morgan."
"- Hey, Kenny."
I kept it so distant.
( blasting effect )
( screams )
( screams )
"All this madness... the destruction... the human suffering... I, too, was trapped in the whirlwind we created--"
an empty mirror filled with hate.
I expected God to reach down and stop me but He never did.
Please... please say something.
Please help me.
"So I said to her, ""hey mom your birthday was last month, hoist it up yourself""."
"I don't get it, what are they laughing at?"
"Anyway, I'm not saying my mom is overweight, she's got that flabby skin under her arm."
You know what I'm talking about.
"Well, the other day this wind picks up, this stuff starts jiggling out dropped a tricycle I lost when I was seven."
Excuse me.
Perhaps you can help me out.
"Those things you said about your mother,"
I don't understand why they're considered funny.
"Well, um.."
- Is it because the toned arms that once cradled you securely now have large deposits of cellulite hanging from them?
Is aging funny?
- If you think about it..
"And you, is it all the alcohol you're consuming that makes it okay to laugh at the expense of your loved ones?"
He's right!
I love my fat mama!
And you're a bad man!
"Dr. Albright, have you ever lost a tricycle in your mother?"
"Please Dick, I am in a cruddy mood."
This fundraiser is turning out to be a nightmare.
"Well, why are you laughing?"
You just said you were in a cruddy mood.
"After you're done in O.R., take the next 24 hours off."
That's Doc Potter's R.X. For a broken heart... time.
- [Charles] Damn it.
Hold that book steady.
"- Sorry, Doctor."
"[B. J.] Charles, just turn to the last page and find out how the operation comes out."
[Potter] Leave him alone.
If he's reconstructing nerves via library book... the least you can do is... shh!
There must be an ellipsis.
It doesn't say how to prevent scar tissue.
"Doctor, you might try wrapping the nerve endings with tantalum foil."
- That'll protect them.
- I beg your pardon?
- [Clears Throat] I said you might try...
- I heard what you said.
Since when does a noncommissioned amateur... presume to instruct an officer and a physician on proper surgical technique?
Clamp.
"I know the procedure, sir."
"Back in the States, I observed Dr. Worsely performing it."
- Dr. David Worsely?
- Yes.
"Ho, ho, ho."
He was a pioneer in peripheral nerve surgery.
The fact that they granted this neophyte sightseeing privileges... does not qualify him as a consultant.
I wasn't a sightseer.
I was a technician on his surgical team for over a year.
"Why don't you listen to Hutchinson, Charles?"
What you're reading is history.
He was there when it was made.
"[Potter] Winchester, close the mouth and open the mind."
Aha.
A thought strikes me.
"Rescue Bots, good luck!"
It is an honor and a privilege.
Over here.
"Cody, come here!"
"- Hey, Doc, Frankie."
- Isn't this exciting?
The techs like nothing I've ever seen.
"Thank you for coming, folks."
"I'm not talking about the rescue stuff, I'm talking about this."
Dino Exhibit at the museum.
Cyber-wired arranged actions and fuse with the Creatuceous DNA!
Our town has a long history of being on the cutting edge of new technology.
"Now, thanks to our friends in Washington,"
I give you... the latest in emergency response... the Rescue Bots!
"Robots, transform!"
These robotic rescue vehicles will streamline our resources.
"Now one human teamed with one robot can do the work of an entire police force, fire department, emergency response unit"
and engineering core.
"Each robot is programmed to respond only to the commands of its handler, so you can sleep at night knowing that Griffin Rock is protected by the very best technology and humanity have to offer."
"Hey, that robot moved on its own."
"You, kid."
"Can you move, I want a photo of Burns family of heroes."
This is the Chief.
Go ahead.
Fire at the natural history museum.
"Hey, I didn't tell to do that."
"It's new technologies, son."
Ought to be some bugs.
"Come on, faster!"
We'll be outruned by a bulldozer.
I do not understand.
Not so slow.
"-And you're coming, too, Shinjiro."
-Count me out.
I have the big project to convince Grandma to take us all to Hawaii with her.
Yeah!
That's the grand theme for this summer vacation!
We shall all go to Hawaii!
absolutely!
Let's all hold out!
Fate is knocking at the door.
Under this beautiful town of Nagasaki... there is another Nagasaki that vanished with one atomic bomb.
Didn't Grandpa die in the Nagasaki atom bombing?
-Yes.
-How come Grandma was safe?
"She was at the house, behind the mountain, 10 kilometers away from the blast center."
But she told me that her hair was a result of the atom bomb.
"That's because Grandma came to Nagasaki on that day, looking for Grandpa."
The school where Grandpa was teaching was close to the blast center.
And did she find Grandpa?
"The school building was crushed flat and burned, and full of charred bodies."
It was impossible to identify which one of them was Grandpa.
Do you want to go to the school?
"You know, Grandma was also a teacher at this school."
She quit when she married Grandpa.
"She sure was lucky, wasn't she?"
I don't know about that.
"When Grandpa died, our father was still a baby... and Grandma was carrying Minako's mother in her belly."
Being left alone...
I bet it must have been very hard on Grandma.
"still... even though no one ever found Grandpa... he's here, I'm sure."
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki... because we wanted to know a Iot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
And your height without the platform shoes.
"And there's one other thing, sir."
You're a crack shot.
"Endlessly fascinating, Lieutenant."
"But as Lieutenant Lucerne would say,"
"""Where there is no proof, there is no criminal."""
"Fascinating, notwithstanding."
"But I think, sir, I have the proof."
Here.
What proof?
WARD:
"Lieutenant, there are no fingerprints on that gun."
You said so yourself this morning.
"This has been a rather silly demonstration, Lieutenant."
"Well, you're absolutely right again, sir."
The killer cleaned the gun of all incriminating prints.
"But the thing is, he forgot something."
Forgot what?
"Well, sir, you know that this gun was only used as a prop."
"So, of course, it was never filled with anything but blanks."
"That is, until you stole it, sir."
"And in order to kill Mrs. Daley, you had to remove the blanks and insert real bullets."
"There were no prints on the gun because you wiped the gun clean, sir."
But there is a reason that the lab report took so long.
You remembered to clean the gun.
But you didn't remember to do the same thing with the bullets.
Damn!
I had to forget something.
That's always how the third act ends.
"You see, I've had no rehearsal as a murderer."
"I'm, after all, a detective."
"Yes, sir, but you did kill Claire Daley, didn't you, sir?"
They're just not part of our consensus of what constitutes... physical reality.
"What are they part of, then?"
You're asking for an explanation for something... that can't be explained rationally.
You know the buildup of energy before something happens?
The way your hair stands up before lightning strikes?
"""Before something happens""."
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
"All right, then... are they trying to warn me?"
Their motivations... aren't human.
All right then what do they want?
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
You noticed them and they noticed that you noticed them.
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
"What happened toyou, Mr. Klein?"
"Last week my friend got a strange phone call from an entity... a spirit, whatever."
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
And made predictions.
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
"It's perception, John."
They appear differently to everyone.
"A voice, a light, a man, a monster."
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke.
"to, he's off by more than a few degrees."
Then how do you explain that it knows everything?
Look at that.
"If there was a car crash 10 blocks away, that window washer could likely see it."
"Rather stay in the dark, getting kissed by Ted Carter."
I'm going to bed.
It's about time I started teaching you something.
Lucas!
"Let me go, Lucas!"
Never had nothing I ever wanted.
Never had a beautiful woman.
Let me up.
Let me offer to the class of 1941 this fond farewell.
The world outside waits for you.
It is a world full of love and rich in opportunity.
"There may be dangers, but if you hold firm to your purpose and your ideals you will storm the ramparts of success and capture them."
Tomorrow you grow up and your true happiness begins.
- Thank you.
- My best wishes to you.
Selena Cross.
Norman.
"At first a diploma seemed like a reward for the past but once in your hand, it became an obligation to the future."
Independence was a distant word that we suddenly owned and we exploded with it.
Some of us splashed away the summer or swooped and stretched with joyfulness and emptied our childish piggy banks of their play money.
"Yet others of us, eager to feel adult or out of necessity began our work early."
- Put the bottle up on top.
- Here?
"And gradually, as the happy confusion of summer faded one by one, we knew the Monday morning of responsibility was at hand."
"- Hi, Mr. Rossi."
"- Hello, Allison."
Did you read those stories I gave you?
"Yes, I read them."
Well?
- When did you write them?
- All summer.
- Ever since graduation.
But it's not true.
Only God can think.
But some of them graduate as engineers.
"Then why do they still need German and European technicians and engineers in the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, if they have such brains down there."
- How many can go to university?
"- Fritz, he's right."
"If there are 100,000 idiots, and one smart guy, that doesn't make 'em all smart."
That's the typical generalization.
- He's the exception.
- A positive generalization.
"100,000 Turkish malcontents screw our girls if they're blondes in miniskirts."
Just 'cause 10 don't...
"And they proudly declare, ""We're fucking your women!"""
"Before, a race"
"- Turks or whatever, other primitive races like Huns..."
When they came up here.
they'd slaughter our men take the women prisoner and enslave the children.
"They'd rape the women to show ""Now you belong to us."
"Now you are our subjects."""
Do you know about that?
- I majored in history in high school.
"- So you know, unless you were absent."
You know what I'd ban first in Austria?
The burka.
No woman in Austria should run around wearing one.
- I myself saw this in Schiinbrunn...
- It's not part of the Koran.
It was invented by men.
- I saw this guy walking ahead...
"- By jealous, insecure men..."
His wife behind with her stroller.
You could only see her eyes.
Hm.
"Well, you're having the best of the argument so far."
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
"I'm George Parker, travelling with my wife Agatha and my niece Louisa."
We're Methodist missionaries.
Any more of us lot around?
"Tell me, Major, why was the colonel trying to draw you away from the canyon?"
- Draw me away?
- Yes.
I speak quite good French.
I heard him tell his men to set fire to the village to draw you away from the canyon.
That chest.
"You've lost that chest, Major."
I will give you one hundred guineas in gold and safe passage to America.
America!
That'd be nice.
"But you see, the King of England owes me last month's wages."
There is no way I could rest easy in America knowing that bastard owed me a shilling.
You would die for a shilling?
That's what I signed on to do.
"You will have to do it, then."
It's a grand day for it.
"Chapter and verse, Rifleman Harper."
"Well, sir, I met this old fella who was dressed like an undertaker, sir."
There were two other fellas with him
- and they asked me to hand over that old box
- So?
"We had a bit of a barney, sir."
"Rifleman Harper, you have powder burns on your face."
These are the telltale signs of a half-loaded rifle
"A common mistake understandable among raw recruits who sometimes discharge their ramrod in the heat of battle, but unforgivable in a Chosen Man."
Report when you contact surface.
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're on surface.
Scorpio to Tarrant.
"Message clear, report again in one hour."
- Why aren't they answering?
- I don't know.
"Tarrant to Scorpio, are you receiving us?"
He didn't hear.
I fear that sensors indicate audio malfunction.
"Tell us something we don't know, Slave."
I do apologise most profoundly if I have given offence.
- I assure you that...
"- All right, Slave, be quiet."
You'd better check the audio beam.
"It looks as if we're stuck here, Tarrant."
I knew I should have brought my night clothes.
Hmm.
"Well, they'll obviously be working on the fault."
Nothing we can do about it.
Let's go.
Then from your private suite back into the reception chamber.
"This is, of course, a communication centre which gives you video contact by satellite with any part of Helotrix."
You also have a direct audio link via the Magnetrix terminal with Federation headquarters.
"Not quite direct, then, is it, Leitz?"
"No, sir, I meant that it's private and priority coded."
Years in the civil service have turned me into something of a pedant.
"You mustn't let it worry you, Leitz."
LEITZ:
The Supreme Empress?
Servalan?
- Is your Excellency certain?
Her phone is always busy.
She never reply my message.
"Xiaotian,"
Yawang just caught a cold.
She is okay.
Don't worry!
- Is it serious?
- No.
She is really okay!
This is the important moment of your graduation.
"Let us take care of Yawang, no problem!"
"Shu Yawang, two days ago, an intentional homicide uccured in Haide Industry Group."
You are here today to help cooperating with our investigation.
"Shu Yawang, why were you there when the case happened?"
What is your relationship with the victim?
There is another man in the scene.
What is your relationship with that man?
Where is he now?
Here is the new update.
"One month ago in our city, the murder case that happened in Haide Industry building, has ne development."
"Yesterday, a woman suspect has been held by police."
"Since the suspect is pregnant, the police has kept her in custody waiting for trail."
"For further development about this case, our channel will continue to follow up and report ."
How is the bastard?
His life no longer in threat.
"However, it may does not sound good for Xiamu."
How about Xiamu?
"If he gets caught, for attempted murder, the minimum sentence will be 7 years or so."
Is commuted sentence possible?
"If Qu Weiran gives up further charges, it might be possible."
"But... based on this situation, it seems impossible."
This is your son's baby.
"Now, in exchange,"
I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone.
Forever.
Or?
"No need for ""or."""
"You know a good deal when you hear it, and I'm only offering once."
(door opens)
"Hello, Carla, or... do you prefer Amanda?"
Or Tasha?
Carla is fine.
Carla.
"Well, your prints tell an interesting story, Carla."
"Multiple arrests for prostitution under various aliases dating back over 20 years, and then a gap."
"And then, two years ago, a misdemeanor for promoting prostitution."
Looks like you went into management.
Made enough to buy that vintage Mustang we pulled you over in.
And now you can add arson to your list of accomplishments.
BELL:
"Maybe murder, as well."
This man...
"She's prepared to take the fall for her crimes, whatever they are."
Likely due to a combination of fear of her employers and the promise of future compensation.
Spent her whole life in the sex trade.
She's used to trading herself for money.
Didn't ask you how your emergency meeting with Shinwell went.
Did you manage to avert his crisis?
"Well, I tried to point him in the right direction."
GREGSON:
We already have you on the arson.
(sighs)
I spilled gasoline by accident.
I dropped a cigarette.
(Eonni - older sister)
Tutor you in English?
"With his ability, I'm afraid that he can teach people to become English poets."
English poet?
I'm just saying.
"Let's get along well from now, for mutual benefits."
Repeat student?
"In the future it's tutorial, Blue House, tutorial, Blue House."
It's quite simple.
"That way of thinking doesn't make much sense, does it?"
I'll make you understand how you should do your job.
Would you like to work overtime on your first day?
How was your first day at work?
Ah...
Cheong Wa Dae is leading the world when it comes to IT.
(Note:
IT
- Information Technology)
"First of all, I want to tell you about the investigation I did on Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan."
Lee Kyeong Wan is in the country now for a meeting with his members.
He has participated in various voluntary activities to improve his image.
A significant amount of his supporters consists of women.
He is now the chairman of the Committee of the transportation construction.
"From my source, I know that the approval of his maritime project was bribed."
He is now being investigated.
I checked with his lover.
It seems that the government's side also got some money.
He abandoned his former members who at least had ethic values.
Just get rid of him.
Why aren't you responding?
There's something I don't understand.
You said you wanted me to eliminate 5 persons?
"I'm Jack Donaghy, new VP of Development for NBC-GE-Universal-Kmart."
We own Kmart now?
No.
"So, why are you dressed like we do?"
I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.
"It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to make them your own."
Please.
"Uh, I'll call her back."
Is she at the White House line?
Great.
Tell them I need a 4:00 A. M. tee-off time.
"Uh, 5 inches, but it's thick."
Are you familiar with the GE trivection oven?
I don't cook very much.
Sure.
I got you.
"New York third-wave feminist, college-educated, single and pretending to be happy about it, overscheduled, undersexed."
"You buy any magazine that says ""healthy body image"" on the cover."
"And every two years, you take up knitting for... a week."
That is dead-on!
"What, are you gonna guess my weight now?"
You don't want me to do that.
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?
"Market research, my friend."
Years and years of market research which led to my greatest triumph... the trivection oven.
Oh.
My wife wants one of those.
"Can we get Pete an oven, please?"
"The GE trivection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven because it uses three kinds of heat... thermal technology for consistent temperature,"
"GE precise air-convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed."
"This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant."
The simulation found that they're vulnerable here.
They've got minimal shielding around their impulse manifolds.
A pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the engines.
Those manifolds are pretty narrow... but our targeting scanners should be able to get a lock.
Nice work.
"Thank you, sir."
I apologize.
I overreacted.
A lot of the crew's on edge lately.
They certainly are.
I heard things got pretty ugly down there.
It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior officer.
I can't say I disagree with the Captain's decision.
"If one of my men disobeyed orders, I'd throw them in the stockade."
"Well, I've got to get back to the bridge."
Let me know if your simulation finds anything else.
"Yes, sir."
I need to see T'Pol.
"She's not supposed to have any visitors, sir."
This isn't a social call.
I'm here for my neuro-pressure treatment.
Doctor's orders.
"You don't want me to bring Phlox down here, do you?"
What's our status?
The antimatter's on its way.
I had a talk with him.
Everything's going to be all right.
This whole thing'll blow over in a day or two.
Our antimatter supply will be depleted by then.
The captain's behavior is becoming increasingly illogical even for a human.
He's preoccupied with the hatchery.
Did you find their Bridge?
I'm not certain there is one.
Their command functions appear to be distributed through various--
T'POL:
Captain!
I'm all right.
We should get you to Sickbay.
"A mild neurotoxin, likely part of an autonomic defence system."
The egg probably considered you a threat.
ARCHER:
Humans seem to have that effect on the Xindi.
An analgesic should take care of the irritation.
Malcolm's bringing you two dead Insectoids.
I want you to learn as much as you can about them.
Understood.
We've located their Armoury.
Found several particle weapons and torpedo casings.
What about the data you recovered?
Ensign Sato's translating it.
We'll be ready to leave orbit as soon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard.
We've cleared the thermosphere.
You might want to do a better job securing our guests.
I think it's safe to assume it's dead.
Just being cautious.
Certain insects on Earth are known to hibernate.
"Do you intend to shoot me, Major?"
It's not you I'm worried about.
I've been going over the results from the last training session.
Your senior officers have shown a lot of improvement... but I think they can do better.
With your permission...
I'd like to schedule more target practice for Monday evening.
That won't go over well with Commander Tucker.
-- I lose my head and run away.
"Do you believe me, Mr. Mason?"
No.
But you're getting closer to the truth.
"Since I am grown man, I do not lie, big or little lie."
That was before you met Edie Morrow.
- How many times--
- Axel!
You heard everything in court.
"Now, do you still think you should hide the truth just because it might implicate that woman?"
Of course I do.
She is good woman.
"I do not kill, so how you think I can possibly--"
"No, no, I--"
I do not know so much.
"Got it, Perry."
You find that man at the bank?
Yep.
"The certified check was issued, all right, but so far it hasn't been cashed."
"Now that the weekend's over, other checks are starting to come in."
"With that 50,000 earmarked by the bank, there's just not enough money in Somers' accounts to cover them."
But I don't understand.
"Somers never intended that the certified check be cashed, Della."
He had it drawn up in case anyone made inquiries at the bank.
But he intended to return it after the weekend to cover his other checks.
He was just stalling for time.
"How do you explain the $7,000 found in Latham Reed's pockets?"
"Planted on him by Somers, of course."
"Somers just wanted the poor guy to think he'd cashed the check, just as he wanted everyone to think it."
"Why, that stinker."
Item 2:
"The State's dug up an airlines clerk who says that the day before the murder, two tickets to Copenhagen were reserved by the Somers office in the name of Edie Morrow."
"If you don't have any evidence, better mind your tongue."
Let's go!
"Master, in order to let her feel better,"
let me admit the accusation.
"I'll let you touch my ass as compensation, agree?"
What a benefit to you!
What a creep!
Fong Tong-ken?
"Chan Mon-gut, you two are civilized men!"
How dare you bully a helpless girl like this?
"You took her advantage, and you insult her by playing such dirty guessing game."
"Tell me, where is righteousness?"
Bastard!
"I won when I played mahjong with him last time, he takes that as an insult and always wants to take revenge."
That's him!

"I, Fong tong-ken, will fight for justice and teach the creeps a lesson."
"Pal, let's take a seat and..."
"Cut the crap, take Lysee out."
"Lysee, the quixotic dog!"
?
"That's right, it's been terribly trained."
"By just one hair of the suspect, no matter where the criminal goes, it will find him out and bite him."
"Now, I'll show you a demonstration."
Attack!
"Miss Shui, don't worry, let it smell your ass."
Stay calm.
"Master, if there is anything wrong, I'll gather our fellows for a fight."
Just delay them as long as you can.
I won't give it a damn!
Come on.

They have a huge selection of clothing and appliances and... (gasps):

And I really love this place.
I was hoping to struggle for a few years and then file for Chapter 11.

It's probably just a rumor.

"Hey, Josh, do you think I'd look good in this dress?"

Why do women do this to themselves?

"Desdemona dies a victim's death, it's very pathetic."
"She dies nobly, she dies forgiving her husband... denying even that he had killed her."
Othello is also the victim.
"He is the victim of lago and it's Emilia who brings that home to the audience... as it gradually dawns on her finally... how wicked a man, her own husband is."
In the final scene Emilia realizes the full extent of lago's ignominy.
She realizes it as it were simultaneously with Othello.
She is the one who is battering at the door to get in... she is the one rebuking Othello for being so stupid... and then she is the one who is silenced by lago... first verbally and then physically by killing her.
"That's very shocking but it is also, if you like, the 'nadir'... the lowest point of male/female relationships in the play."
"Oh Emilia, come in."

We decided it shouldn't be higher than the mosque.
- That was the idea.

But he redesigned it and I think...
He did redesign; there was...

He had a lot more freedom to decide without any interference from the public at the time.

She's got to talk to other people's kids.
Have you ever had to talk to other people's kids?
They are really boring.

This is where Stephens-Lloyd's body was found.
"This is the original report, dated 21st November 1998."
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd was last seen a few weeks beforehand.
His body was found on the 14th by a fisherman.
- Statement's in the file.
- What's going on?
I've asked Murder Squad if they'll reopen the case.
- Right.
- Hiya.
- All right?
- You all right?
We just re-interviewed the fisherman who found the body.
He recalls that pretty much the first thing he was told at the scene was that it had to be a suicide.
It also appears no photos or videos were taken of the scene.
Was there a missing persons report or investigation at the time?
There was.
"The report's cursory, to say the least."
Doesn't look as if anyone was actively searching for Stephens-Lloyd.
The SIO at the time was a DI Marcus Thirwell.
He's no longer serving but we're doing our best to track him down.
"The pathologist's autopsy report at the time stated the body had superficial wounds and a broken arm, which he put down to the body being struck by a boat."
So my boss has agreed to reopen the case.

He sure rushed my gate in a hurry.
I called you because the plates came back.
They were registered to a used car lot over in your jurisdiction.

Yeah.
Showed up as stolen.
I called it in.
It took 40 minutes.
"Anyway, they chased him all the way out to the 24, lost him out there on a back road before your guy went in after him."
What guy?
I don't know.
"I couldn't flag him, but I saw him."
I saw the tan uniform.

"Mr. Langley, tell me this."
Did the defendant resent your wife's wearing that necklace?
She cried.
"Yes, I'm afraid they fought about it several times."
"Did your niece receive an allowance, Mr. Langley?"
"Well, not in cash, but she did have charge accounts practically everywhere."
"Yes, I have a charge slip here, signed by the defendant, reserving two seats on a plane."
The destination is San Francisco.
The departure time is the night of the murder.
- Were you aware of this?
- My wife told me about it.
She cancelled the reservations.
Sid your wife also tell you who Merle had intended to occupy the other seat?
Yes.
A Mr. Pierce.
It was just a childish romantic whim on Merle's part.
I'm sure it was nothing serious.
But your late wife did object to their proposed elopement.
"Well, yes, but--"
Enough to hire a private detective to make sure to prevent it?
It was for Merle's own good.
"Isn't it true, Mr. Langley, that your wife's attitude toward Merle's young man only led to angrier tears and angrier fights between them?"
Yes.
I have no further questions.
"Mr. Langley, I believe the murder weapon has been identified as belonging to you."
Yes.
It was something I picked up in Italy on one of my trips.
It was of some historic interest.
"I kept it hanging in my study in plain sight for anyone, you understand."

One of the main things He's done in his career is legitimize things that you would not think would immediately have tbe kind of legitimacy.
The outlaw character.
We were used to cowboy heroes.
He made the outlaw a Hero.
"He's like Giacometti, you know."
He tries to cut His work down till it gets to primal energy till it gets to be something tbat's absolutely specific so tbat there is nothing else you can interpret from it.
He's part of the culture.

The mind is an incredible organ.
"The body's senses and send signals to the brain, but how the brain interprets those signals is a matter of great delicacy."
"More of an art than a science, I believe."
Most live their lives controlled by these impulses.
But you don't have to.
If we can rewire this most primitive instinct imagine what's possible.
Complete authority over one's own mind.
Limitless autonomy.
Absolute power.
We must strip away the last vestiges of your old self.
And only then will you know real empowerment.

"Don't underestimate my appreciation for the finer things in life, Angela."
And don't underestimate my skepticism of you offering to help.
I'll pass along your condolences.
Fine.
I need to see Walker's files.
And you think I'd disrupt a crime scene for that?
Just hear me out.
"When the exhibit was vandalized,"
I put Walker in touch with an associate of mine.
Name?
Vincent Fredel.
I promised Fredel that I would make sure there was nothing compromising about him in Walker's papers.
(Leo) Angela.
I need a word.
"I'm sorry I can't help you, Jack."
But I admire you for trying.
"(Leo) So not only is the tenth piece missing, but so are the negatives for the photos that make up that piece."
They're the only ones that are gone.
All the other photos and their negatives are still here.
But it's pretty clear that we're way beyond that point now;
things have taken a massive turn for the worst.
BOX:
We keep finding things that aren't in the climate models that are used to project the future.
"So that, that tells me that the projections for the future are, are really conservative."
"If climate stays at this temperature that it's been in the last decade, Greenland is, is going away."
Don't walk into the crevasse.
[Rapids].
DICAPRIO:
Oh my God!
BOX:
Don't get too close to the edge.
DICAPRIO:
Look at how violent that is.
These rapids are going so incredibly fast.
BOX:
This meltwater is making its way to the sea.
If that's not balanced by snowfall then the ice sheet gets smaller and sea level rises.
This is actually our proper climate station.
DICAPRIO:
This is a climate station?
I was imagining a massive igloo with all kinds of scientists doing experiments.
It really does look like broken down pool equipment.
"How, what does this connect to?"
BOX:
"Well, this is all melted up now, this was a hose that went down 30 feet, and now it's melted out."
DICAPRIO:
"Wait a minute, so this, that's lying here used to be straight down under ice?"
BOX:
"Yeah, so we made."
DICAPRIO:
So that's the amount of ice that has melted.
I can not choose to escape.
I don't want to see you more damage for me again.
Yawang.
This field sport looks just same as 10 years ago.
Nothing has changed.
Just like you and me!
We are still what we are!
We are like these trees.
"Although they are grown up together, there will always be a gap between them."
"Xiaotian, don't waste your life on me anymore!"
We can never be together.
"Yawang,"
"it is fast to travel alone, but we can travel far when we go together!"
Let's just go together!
I'm sorry!
"Yawang, I will never change!"
"I don't want to start again, because we are not over yet."
"Defendant Xiamu, is found guilty of illegal possession of gun and intentional homicide."
Judge has decided based on ample and factual evidences.
"In consideration of defendant aged less than 18 years, and his willingness to give up, and to provide all factual details of the crimes, the defendant is sentences to 7 years imprisonment."
"Defendant Qu Weiran is found guilty of rape, of serious intention."
Defendant is sentenced 10 years imprisonment.
I'm sorry!
"Yawang, don't cry!"
I'm sorry!
Don't come anymore!
Xiamu!
I'll wait for you!
I heard that there are two kinds of happiness.
The first one is happiness of two lovers staying together.
"The second one is, to stay happy for the person we love."
"I don't have any other option,"
Axel Norstaad got so angry that he smashed a chair and threatened Martin Somers.
Did the defendant say anything to you about this occurrence?
"No, but I could tell he was awfully upset."
Would you tell us what he said or did?
Yes.
"I was sure that Axel had seen Mr. Somers in Long Beach, so I wanted to hear how he'd made out."
And how were you able to tell that he was awfully upset?
Axel loves animals.
He's always feeding stray cats and dogs at the shop.
"Well, this favorite cat was meowing to come in."
Axel picked up a coffee cup from the desk and threw it.
"Mr. Pedersen, why were you so anxious to learn the results of Axel's meeting with Mr. Somers?"
"Well, like I said, the Cabinet Shop had been my best account, and now Somers was cutting me off from it."
Did this come at a particularly inopportune time for you?
"Yes, I'd fixed up my lumberyard."
Fixed it up?
In what way?
"New sheds, boosted my inventory of hardwoods, and...things like that."
Thank you.
That'll be all.
"Now, when Mr. Somers called you the afternoon of the murder and you went to see him, Mr. Reed, was anything said about the defendant?"
S-Somers called him a wild man.
He-
- He said he'd going to tame him if it was the last thing he did.
"What explanation, if any, did he give for calling you in and telling you this?"
Said he wanted my help.
What kind of help?
Through my former wife Edie--
Edith Morrow.
He had an idea that... she could wrap him around her-- the old guy around her little finger.
"- Objection, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
"Winning five games in six days, that really takes a lot out of you."
"Like Coach said,you just gotta sacrifice- you know, sacrifice everything you have."
"Like, if you love the game of basketball, you just go out there and give all your heart."
"he got a little ways to go, but he's - he's gonna get there."
"hopefully he's got his head screwed on pretty good, you know... and now, you know, he's gonna be on his own to do whatever."
hopefully he'll do it right.
"When we got down here, people don't expect - ""Marshall?"
"how'd they get down here?"""
"They lookin' like: ""Who they got on their team?"""
I had to come out and prove myself.
I think I could play Division I basketball.
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's
-That's all I'm looking for.
Arthur Agee.
All right!
All this area through here is our new computer labs.
We'll take you through all those rooms.
Arthur's first recruiting visit... takes him to a junior college in Southern Missouri.
The strength that I see here is the tremendous teaching that goes on here.
have you decided what you want to go into?
"Uh, communications."
Are you more interested in the overall communications -
"That, and, uh - I like that and accounting."
- Like business.
- Oh.
Okay.
"We enjoy winning things, but the primary purpose is your education."
"What are some of your career goals, may I ask?"
"I want to fall back to, like, make - have my own business."
Like real estate.
This is where it all happens.
"As I recall the newspaper story, one of the cleaning women said that she heard him talking to someone about an hour before he died."
She said his voice sounded very angry.
I'd quite forgotten.
"Mason, what does this have to do with Lita Krail?"
The stroke may have been the result of a fight with someone.
"Mason, you've got the wrong foot in the mouth entirely."
"Oh, sure, Lita Krail may have been #1 girl in the big firm, but--"
Did Lita earn just her salary here or do you think she had another source of income?
I don't follow.
"Well, for keeping quiet or arranging deals here and there."
"Beth Sandover tells me that the job was a regular funnel of gossip and influence,"
- if a woman so wanted to use it.
"- And so she did, your friend Beth."
Lita's told me what a big snoop she was.
It's her husband who was the snoop-
- Sandy.
Of all the creepy calculating guys I've had to stand--
"Now now now now, Frank, sticks and stones."
"Oh, Mason, you know Sellers?"
How do you do?
Frank Sellers?
Jess Devro told me that you were the one who would probably run the company when he stepped down.
You mean Devro  Sellers instead of Devro  Banks?
"Now Mason, you've been shooting apples off my head ever since you came in."
"I'm curious as to who's being blackmailed around here and by whom, that's all."
- Blackmail?
What kind of a--
"- All right, all right, Sellers."
"It's a stormy morning-- police, murder and all that."
- [phone ringing]
- We can't blame Mr. Mason if he doesn't recognize a big happy family when he sees one.
"Excuse me, sir."
They caught up with him at last.
"Jack, they're in your office."
"Inspector Frost, we've met once before."
"All right, cut the introductions."
What's this all about?
I'm Detective Superintendent Bailey.
This is DI Moore.
We're investigating a number of matters relating to CID at the old Shepley Station during nineteen eighty-five and six.
One of the cases concerns the murder of Harriet Barr.
Strangely the files are on your desk.
I've just charged James Barr with the murder of his second wife.
"I'm in the middle of an investigation, so get out of my office."
This is my investigation.
"Precisely, the other way round."
"You are suspended from duty, effective immediately."
You will surrender your warrant card.
You will leave this office and this station.
You will talk to no one and take nothing with you.
You will make yourself available for interviews as and when required.
"Inspector, I talked to James Barr last night."
He came in for confession.
"Oh, well I hope he feels better."
Did he confess to the murders of both Mrs. Barr's or was is just the most recent one?
"Still, I don't supposed he mentioned the first one as he was absolved last time round."
I'm trying to help.
"I listened to him talk about his marriages, his job, his family."
All kinds of stuff.
He's not had it as easy as you'd think.
And he's not a man with murder in his heart.
He's a killer.
Maybe twice.
"Anyway if he needs a character reference,"
"According to his last words to his mother, sir, he was quite confident."
I think perhaps he did find her and paid the price for it.

When am I getting my property back?
"Settle down, Travis."
We need to ask you a few questions.
We now know that you found Fen somewhere a little closer
- than the Appalachian Mountains.
- (utensil clanking in pot)
- So what if I did?
- So where was it?
Would be 20 miles or so outside of Peterborough.
"Not a very glamorous locale, so I dressed it up a little."
Give the punters their money's worth.
- So the whole story's a lie?
- Not all of it.
I did almost shoot her thinking she was a bear.
"She was very young, no more than 8 I reckoned."
Badly injured and starving.
"I fed her, treated her wounds."
"She recovered, got back her strength... but never uttered more than the odd sound."
And never took to being civilized.
Happy in her own filth.
"And that's when you started thinking she could help pay her own way, and you created the myth of ""The Wild Child."""
"That's about the sum of it, yeah."
Until Mr. de Jaager discovered your campsite.
"He threatened to expose your show as a hoax, and you realized you were about to lose your meal ticket."
- What are you saying?
- What the detective is saying is you had clear motive for murder.
(Travis and Brackenreid laughing)
"I'm glad you find it funny because you're under arrest, Travis."
"Seems like I'm not the only one with a gift for the tall tale, huh?"
Amalgam.
That's the name of the organization I was working for.
"Its goals are the research and development of the latest weapons, and the testing of them in actual combat."
They would even create regional conflicts to do so.
A large number of Amalgam sympathizers have permeated the hard-line factions of every nation.
"There are a lot of guys in both the East and West who want to create a Cold War, and maintain a demand for munitions."
"Is that organization involved in the turmoil here, too?"
"No, this is my own handiwork."
I'll bet those Amalgam guys are going crazy trying to find us right about now.
Venom!
Yu Fang?
It is time for me to go.
I see.
Take care.
"Farewell, Sensei."
"A long time ago, I raised a set of twins named Yu Fang and Yu Lan."
They were a lot like you.
Even now they're still as loyal as dogs.
The turmoil here happened because I ordered them to cause it.
"But tonight, Yu Fang is probably going to die fighting Mithril."
"And if they don't get her, she'll just get killed by Amalgam's Task Force."
Task Force?
They're a terrifying bunch.
"The commander of that task force is incredibly skilled, but one hell of a nutcase."
Your friends probably don't stand a chance against him.
"The moment they run into him, they'll all be killed."
She's appeared!
She's in Jordan!
All right!
Time to hunt the little kitty down!
"You said ""Amalgam,"" right?"
Are there any Whispered in that organization?
"Yeah, what'd you tell her?"
That we were part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
I am part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
Oh.
Great.
"Okay, does it say how to find out who's controlling him?"
Not really.
But Stiles was right about the murderers.
Yes!
It calls the Kanima a weapon of vengeance.
There's a story in there about this South American priest who uses the Kanima to execute murderers in his village.
"All right, see?"
So maybe it's not all that bad.
Until the bond grew strong enough that it killed whoever he wanted it to.
"All bad, all very, very bad."
"Here's the thing, though."
The Kanima's actually supposed to be a werewolf.
But it can't be...
"""Until it resolves that in its past which manifested it."""
"Okay, if that means that Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy,"
I could've told you that myself.
What if it has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so I'll talk to him myself."
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
Time to come in.
I'm texting with Gaby.
In a minute.
That's what you said 20 minutes ago.
I want your homework done before dinner.
"Unfortunately, all of the blood at the Brewer crime scene was either from Lyla or Jim Brewer."
Nothing from the unsub.
I just talked to the M.E. Ronnie Brewer died from asphyxiation but had not been sexually assaulted.
Unless strangling the boy was the sexual release.
"Or it could have been the unsub's first abduction and he panicked, disposed of the child immediately once he had him."
"The M.E. also said that the type of glue in the Brewers' eyes is frequently used for surgical closures, so the drying process on the skin in well documented."
Apparently it had been applied at 5:15 am.
"Well, the farm hand said they saw that gray sedan flee the scene at 6:20, so if that was our unsub, what was he doing in the house for that hour?"
All Josie ever does is stare at that phone.
It's not normal.
She's 13.
It's normal.
Girls her age should be out doing things.
What's so funny?
Picturing you a hundred years ago.
"""Motor cars aren't normal."
"What the hell's wrong with the horse and buggy?"""
Good night.
Good night.
"The glue our unsub used is sold practically everywhere, so we can't isolate point of purchase."
"A mineral analysis from the sand, however, indicates that it came from the Seneca River in upstate New York."
You ok?
Yeah.
"Morgan, we're gonna find the people who tried to kill you."
He was in his pajamas.
Ronnie Brewer.
"Out there by the side of the road, he was still in his pajamas."
How about women who give a rat's rump about our feelings?
Our mothers.
- To Mom.
- To Mama.
Hello?
Hi.
"Yeah, I can do that."
Twenty minutes.
Bye.
"Fraternising with the enemy, Mic?"
More likely malinger with intent.
"And if I get lucky, a little unlawful detention."
"Good night, sir."
Tell Colonel MacKenzie I expect her on her post at 0800.
He takes it up.
He's running with it.
He's on a clear field.
Nobody to challenge him...
"Oh, hell, I don't even like this game."
"Lieutenant, what are you doing here?"
"Harriet went into labour, sir."
She's sleeping now.
I didn't know where else to go.
You had the baby.
"No wonder you look like hell, huh?"
"Sir,"
Baby Sarah died.
a one-piece recruiting the whole truth and nothing but the truth as I see it not see ya this particular journey started about a week ago when I got worse have a Sasquatch sightings up to Smokey Mountains
Tennessee so off we went in search of the elusive Tennessee big cock course we didn't find it not even a single hair but you know there are some there's just one problem set up the moment that you stop searching for something is the exact moment you find
it lil sometimes something even better largely no I don't know if that's a problem or just someone fortune cookie I got some time anyone on okay so we're driving back on through the back was a Georgia
I was stumble across something unusual
He did the teacher-school being with praise.
And what you say to him?
Again was blonde his hair.
This is the memory of an excursion here.
Brought his class away here on a Sunday of May of two years ago.
A cherry did not remain on the trees.
"This is Gyula with Erzsi.Before the went into war, was necessary hers engagement."
"Allegedly because they crawled under the piano and... and Erzsike's father was hear something...snuffle, crawled after them, but this for what reason onto the engagement?"
I...not understand.
This is the picture when they made it officer.
"Like that in the uniform, that my Lajos."
There is not a child like this yet.
My son.
My only good...
little son.
"Our beloved major lord, - and from this don't be alarmed, - does not like the clamour, and responds to single smells very sensitively."
"Which smell it may be, that he does not can to tolerate?"
This is...whereof our Gyula wrote nothing
"Don't be afraid Tót lord, nothing will be the smell for this loo until 5 years."
Lajos uncle!
Mariska old lady!
He day after tomorrow starts.
Very delicate onto the cleanness.
And...started the finish.
It would have been little if they would have had 100 hands for the Tót family
"And a lot of everything, it was necessary to think, which there was not at the house."
For example Chinese patterned bedspread was needed to ask for Kasztriner family.
Don't talk.
A major.
A major comes!
A major comes to a Tót family!
And how it gets to you?
They can't possibly think that Flack's responsible for Todd Fleming's death.
"I mean, he is so by the book."
He doesn't even swear.
None of us are happy about this.
"In the meantime, IA's got a job to do and so do we."
"All right, well, Fleming's been ruled out as a suspect in Coach Nelson's death."
"According to his mother, he was taking an SAT prep class at the time of Vince Nelson's murder."
The police confirmed that.
"Still working on the sawdust, but based on extracted hydrocarbons,"
I've narrowed it down to three families.
Good.
Stay with it.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't so lucky with the Christmas wrapping paper."
It's manufactured in China and mass-marketed to department stores all over the U.S.
Taylor.
I'll be right there.
They just found a head.
He's coming together.
COD was hypoxia due to crushed cricoid cartilage which obstructed airflow to the lungs.
Lateral bruising on his throat.
"He was hit with something hard, a club or a pipe."
Look at this.
Cauliflower ear.
From his wrestling days.
Same chainsaw tool marks as the other body parts.
I also found this fleck of blood adhering to the skin at the contusion site on the vic's throat.
"And unlike the blood around the wound, this particle was deposited when it was already dry."
Which means it could've come from our killer.
"Stell, results on the blood fleck that Sid collected from the vic's neck."
Not a match to our vic.
Johnny Holt.
Ex-con.
Why do you have aneurism-face?
I don't have aneurism-face.

It's one of seven principles of all successful people.
"I will literally pay you cash to stop talking, okay?"
"Excuse me, Officer?"
My blue pickup is just around the corner.
There's a woman sitting it in.
It's my sister;
"I'm putting her in your custody, okay?"
"Get her some food, take her back to my office, don't take your eyes off her until I get there, you got it?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Thank you.
You happy?
Hey.
Fugitive's name is Walton Dawkins.
"He's originally from the mainland, but he did ten years at the Allen Correctional Facility in Cleveland for multiple home invasions."
Apparently our guy likes hitting families with big money.
Then he violated his parole by coming to Hawaii six years ago.
My guess is it wasn't for the surf.
Dawkins killed a young couple during one of his burglaries.
But get this:
"according to the warden, he's been a model prisoner up until now."
So what changed?
"Hey, guards!"
We need help in here!
"All right, so right before the inmate collapsed, he was complaining of shortness of breath, pain in his arm."
Textbook signs of cardiac arrest.
"He's a little young to be dropping dead of a heart attack, don't you think?"
Yeah.
- That's never been a problem for us.
We don't know anything until we can get into the tunnel.
And we can't get into the tunnel until the place cools down.
"Until we can get in, we don't know if we have to evacuate Elk Horn."
"Well, that's FEMA's call."
FEMA's indicated they're gonna wanna make it the governor's call.
The governor's indicated he wants you to step in...
I should set a ransom.
I'll tell you the radiation levels but first I want your electoral votes.
Or is that a bad strategy?
- It's pretty bad.
- No ransom.
We'll play this one straight.
What about other shipments?
There are two other shipments on the road.
"One's low-level radioactive waste, mostly medical."
- It's on three rail cars in South Carolina.
- Have we stopped the train?
The National Guard's securing it till we know what happened.
- What about the second one?
- That's more problematic.
There's 200 pounds of transuranic materials from Rocky Flats where they assemble the triggers.
"They're about 150 miles from Carlsbad, and we can't tell them to pull over."
- That makes them vulnerable.
- They beefed up the escort?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"Thank you, Mr. President."
No one knew if Eisenhower was a Democrat or Republican before he ran.
"Grant only voted once, and it was for the other guys."
Grant works as an example in almost any situation.
That's Grant's legacy.
"He lives in the States, he doesn't really play in Britain very often."
"And then like a week before we were supposed to go, he cancelled."
"He fired his support act and said, ""I'm not doing the show."""
"But we still had, you know, flights and everything, and a hotel, so we decided to fly anyway and have a four-day holiday."
"And then his other support act put a message out on YouTube, saying,"
"""Hey, everyone."
I know Morrissey can't do it
"""and I'm really sad that that's the case,"
"""but I'm going to put on a concert anyway for free."
"""Anyone who's got a ticket can come and see me do a little concert"
"""at the Gramercy Theatre in Manhattan."""
And his support act was Cliff Richard.
So I was left with a dilemma as to...
Is this a dream you had?
No!
LAUGHTER
"Basically, for my wife's 30th, we flew thousands of miles to see someone we actively dislike doing a show."
"And I don't know, have any of you seen Cliff work?"
But it's the cheesiest show.
He has his manager come out and it's like panto.
It really is like bizarre panto.
"He says, ""OK, everybody, in a second I'm going to say,"
"""'Welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard,' and you're going to cheer."
"""And we're going to do it three times before he comes out."
"""So, welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard..."
Tch.
"""Well, that was quite good, but we can do a little better..."
"""Welcome to the stage, Cliff Richard..."
Tch.
"""Well, that was quite good, but we can do a little better..."
"""Welcome to the stage..."" Then Cliff pushes him out the way and goes,"
"# ""We're all going on a summer..."" # It's mental!"
Say it is not so.
Say it is not so.
He was alone when...?
Oh.
"Oh, my heart is wrenched from me!"
There was a letter for you by his side.
"Oh, God, not this."
Anything but this.
Your Majesty?
News from Ireland.
The wrecks of yet more of the Spanish fleet are washed up on their shores.
They say that the coast is littered with their corpses!
The Pope himself acknowledges
"Your supremacy, Your Grace."
"He said only a woman, Mistress of one half of a small island, yet you have made yourself feared by Spain, by France and through all of Europe!"
"Majesty, enough now!"
"Throughout the realm your people call your triumph the greatest victory since Agincourt, and can not celebrate it without you."
My Lord Leicester would never want his passing to eclipse your finest hour.
"I humbly beseech you to pardon your poor old servant, being so bold in writing to ask how my gracious Lady is."
"As ever, your welfare is all that consumes me."
"As for my own poor case,"
"I am hoping to find a perfect cure at Buxton as you instructed, so I can all the more quickly return to your side."
"Until then, as always, I kiss your feet."
"Your most loving, most faithful servant, Robbie."
That young man yonder....
Do I know him?
"Robert Devereux, Your Grace."
The second Earl of Essex.
"My Lord Leicester's stepson, Majesty."
Do you not remember?
"I recall, My Lord, when you were introduced to me as a child, you shrank from me."
So afraid were you I might deigned to kiss you.
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We...
Can't!
There was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid... at all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
It's everything Lydia could translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
"Yeah, what'd you tell her?"
That we were part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
I am part of an online gaming community that battles mythical creatures.
Great.
"Okay, does it say how to find out who's controlling him?"
Not really.
But Stiles was right about the murderers.
It calls the Kanima a weapon of vengeance.
"There's a story in there about this South American priest who uses the Kanima to execute murderers in his village... all right, see?"

His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
The perp wanted him to give up Tendu's location.
HOLMES:
O.G. submitted.
"The killer goes to Tendu's room, tries to enter."
He's delayed by the security latch on the door.
Fresh abrasions on the metal suggest that it was forcefully engaged and then defeated.
"Only, by that time, Tendu had escaped."
"So the guy comes up empty-handed, but he isn't ready to give up, so he finds the kid's club and he takes it back to Owen Tuchman's room."
He couldn't kill Tendu.
He settled for framing him.
My niece mentioned that there's some big gaming tournament this weekend-- the first prize is two million bucks.
Maybe somebody wanted Tendu out of the picture.
"We thought about that, but he wasn't due to play this weekend."
"So him being dead, or on the run wouldn't have affected the outcome."
Hmm.
What about this brunette you think he was with?
Any more on her?
HOLMES:
Not yet.
Watson's at home combing through Tendu's social media.
"Hopefully, we'll have answers to our questions soon."
♪ Will you pray for the end?

Been going through this stuff for five hours straight.
"It turns out Tendu isn't big on words, but he loves photos."
"He posted a few dozen a day, every day, for the last five years."
"That's 30,000 pictures, give or take."
"Unfortunately, he only posted a few since he arrived in New York, none since O.G.'s murder."

And with a shepherd's daughter.
- Where's Polixenes?
Speak!
"- Here, in your cily"
"To your court whilst he mas hastening, meets he on the way"
The father of this seeming lady and her brother.
O my poor father!
- You are married?
"- We are not, sir, nor are we like to be."
"- My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?"
"- She is, when on she is my wife."
That on I see by your good father's speed will me on very slowly.
"Beseech you, sir, step forth mine advocate"
At your request my father will grant precious things as triﬂes.
I will to your father.
Come.
"'And so as the two kings met, the old shepherd's box and bundle were opened 'and the secret of Perdita's birth revealed at last."
"'The oracle had been fulfilled, the King's daughter had been found."
"'Great was the rejoicing, 'though it was a rejoicing tinged with sadness."
"'And away they all went to see a newly finished statue of Hermione, 'whose cruel loss had been mourned for sixteen years. '"
Here me those I have done good to against my will.
"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed."
"Prithee, son, do."
"For we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen."
Thou will amend thy life?
"Ay, an it like your good worship."
"Come, follow us."
we will be thy good masters.
"O Paulina, we came to see the statue of our queen"
Here it is; mes it not something near?
Her natural posture!
Here are the possibilities...
The surface became mirrored and deflected the heat... or it put up some type of field that altered the direction of the attack.
"In any case, we need more data than what we have from Narita."
If only we had more samples...
But we should do what we can for now.
You're right.
Enough complaining.
Right!
Analyze!
Analyze!
"After all, that is our job."
I see you're on a 5-day rotation here.
Nothing shows up on eyeball sensor No. 50 and 60.
Special agent Fubuki has successfully infiltrated.
Accurate data of target interior will be transmitted.
"Each of you, confirm entry route."
The goal for this mission is to seize secrets of Agwarda.
Avoid combat action as much as possible.
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
If it's for the person I love...
I'd put up with anything.
Something I value...?
Enemy attack...
Where on earth did they come from?
We can't tell.
Nothing was picked up by the security cameras or sensors.
Emergency alert!
Estimate enemy's present location from the direction of attack and deploy Cross to intercept!
Roger!
What's the situation with Burst and Flail?
They're in the final stages of tune-up.
They'll need at least ten more minutes.
Your father and I never had a childhood.
Nothing came easy for us.
Ever.
"You are so lucky, Paige."
Mop and bucket are in the basement.
You know who I am?
I do.
Then we can forgo the pleasantries.
This war has gotten very personal for me.
"And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you too."
I'm listening.
I'm in a lot of trouble... because your Soviet foreign minister won't accept... that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.
I could lose my job... or even go to jail because of it.
If either of those things happens...
I'll make sure you go down with me.
"Uh, nothing."
Thank you.
Before he disappeared...
Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony... about his kidnapping and torture by two K.G.B. Illegals.
The second my punishment is handed down...
I'll release his classified testimony to the press.
"Now, think of what that will mean... for you and your people at the Rezidentura... all those deportations."
Moscow will not be pleased... when they have to rebuild their U.S. Operation from scratch.
As we like to say in America... heads will roll... your head being at the top of the list.
"So... you see, my problem... is now your problem."
"I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad."
I hoped that one day we would have the chance to meet face-to-face.
I just wish... it was under less trying circumstances.
Good day.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"You are here because the K.G.B. Is targeting you, your family... everyone and anyone you care about."
Show me your kicks!
Let's Go!
Yes!
renda kick
Make us shake with excitement!

"At long last, the God of Destruction Beerus has set to work."
"The Kaio take notice, and fear that a new battle may begin..."
"Elsewhere, a large crowd of friends have gathered aboard the cruise ship where Bulma's birthday party is being held, however..."
Vegeta's not coming because he's training?
!
And Son-kun too?
!
I had some rawness to me.
I had some athletic ability.
He shaped all that.
"He was competitive, he wanted to win, he was competitive, he wanted to win, but he never let that interfere with what he thought of you as a young man."
He was a very humble man.
He was a very proud man.
"He's taught me the importance of competing and working hard and focusing on the process and the practice, as opposed to the end result and the stats."
Always respect the people you're around --
"Your teammates, your peers, your professors, your parents."
"We knew we were in the midst of greatness, just being on the same court with him."
"I still remember, you know, the last time I actually saw him, you know?"
I couldn't do nothing but hug him.
There's not a day goes by that I don't try to make him proud of me.
That I don't try to make him proud of me.
He's still our coach.
He's still our coach.
Come on.
"Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer."
"You know the drill, Jack."
"I'm gonna ask you some questions, but I want you to know, I'm on your side."
We just want to establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover.
It was necessary to maintain my cover.
Are we done now?
"Sit down, Jack."
This is Rae Plachecki.
The time is 2:31 A.M.
"This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU."
Ryan Chappelle is present.
"Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramon Salazar."
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago.
"They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel, coming out of Mexico."
"So, when did you meet Amador?"
Did you know him when you were working at CTU?
"Tell me something, Nina, what kind of a deal you think you're gonna cut?"
"You've betrayed everybody you know, including me."
You murdered Jack's wife.
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country.
You're helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population.
Help me understand this.
What do you want?
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer?
Your neck is bleeding.
"Dalton, what do you got?"
"So far, the only reactions we're getting from her are subliminal."
"If she's not gonna say anything, we need to be more plugged in to her vitals."
"We can take her down to seven, give her a passive response test."
Seven's not secure enough.
She stays here.
What do you think?
- They should keep it that way.
- Keep it this way?
Not... not rebuild it.
Why?
"Because it's something in our past, in our history."
And we have to remember this.
Many soldiers died in this war.
- So better to leave it?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Actually, Lou agreed with the soldier."
The ruins should be left as a monument.
He wanted to build the new synagogue in the adjacent plaza instead.
So much has changed since then.
Would he have designed the same thing now?
Would they have thought Lou an idealistic dreamer for wanting to unite the Jews of the world with a single building?
Do you think Lou had a strong sense of being Jewish and what that meant?
"You know, I think it's been overplayed."
"Lou was a very spiritual person, but I don't think that was rooted necessarily in Judaism."
I think it was as much rooted in Christianity and in Buddhism and in all kinds of myth that he knew a lot about.
And he felt just at home doing a mosque in Dhaka as he was doing the Hurva.
But I think that when he came here something happened.
Mikveh Israel didn't get built.
He must have been bitter about that.
"You know, he must have been aware that as a Jewish architect he'd done no great Jewish buildings."
"Philadelphia had Frank Lloyd Wright's synagogue, or temple."
"And I think when he came here, he felt that the Jews entrusted him to do this."
And I think he wanted very much to have it realized.
"See, the thing is, mate, no-one likes a partner holding out on them."
"So, where you taking me?"
To the lying bastard who told us the Caddy was dead.
"Well, why don't you let me handle this?"
He's a chippy bastard.
"If I'm there, there'll be a witness to who said what."
Cheers.
Dot.
Mate.
"What's all this, then?"
We're following up on a statement you made in 2013 in connection with the murder of Tommy Hunter.
OK if we come in?
"Oh, well, you have done well for yourself, eh?"
"You, too."
"Landed on your feet, you might say."
Crime audit.
We gather important figures for important figures.
So... how can I be of assistance to AC-12?
"This report, sensitive parts of which are not for your eyes, quotes your statement regarding DC Cole."
DI Cottan wrote this.
I'm sure he can shed any light required.
"This is just routine, Nige."
We're just following up on one or two details.
Are these your words?
"""DC Cole was nicknamed the Caddy"
"""because he wore golf jumpers but never played golf."
"""DC Cole boasted of underworld connections"
"""and attempted to recruit me into a clandestine network"
"""of corrupt police officers."""
I cooperated with your investigation.
But we've got some new lines of inquiry.
Did Cole ever mention a gangland associate of Tommy Hunter named Ronan Murphy?
"Mr Taylor, please."
Dr Campbell?
"This way, please."
"Waiting for inspiration, Mr Simms?"
"Well, it has to come from somewhere!"
We all assumed Pat was your muse.
Doesn't quite work like that.
See you at the meeting tonight?
- Yes.
Thought you might like a sandwich.
Another coffee would be more useful.
How did it go?
Will?
- You'll be pleased to know I didn't pass the medical.
"What do you mean ""didn't pass""?"
You're the fittest man I know.
They found a little something during the examination.
- What?
"Well, a slight irregularity with my breathing."
- How slight?
I'm sure it's nothing significant but I need to get it looked at.
"Well, then let's hope it's just enough to prevent you from going back in."
Be careful what you wish for.
- Mm-hm.
"Ladies, none of us should be under any illusion about the prospect of imminent war with Germany."
"If and when hostilities break out, there will be much to be done to ensure that our homes and families are protected from the trials and tribulations the war will inevitably bring."
And it is for this reason that your committee proposes the Institute closes its doors until we can raise our flag again in a time of peace.
Oh!
Argh!
It needn't be for long.
"The government assures us, if and when they begin, hostilities could be over by Christmas."
Madam President.
But we shall locate him again.
"We are a search party, if you like, of orphans, with our emotions as a lantern in the dark."
(AMUSED MURMURING)
"Our greatest hope may be Monsieur Chopin, in whose music we find both emotion and science in the most perfect rapport."
GUESTS:
Hear!
Hear!
Thank you.
"May I, in turn, propose a toast to our host and hostess?"
"For without the noble patronage of the aristocracy, we are orphans indeed."
They understand and nurture us.
They are our model and inspiration.
Thank you.
"George, you're not drinking."
You must pardon Madame Sand.
She is allergic to the aristocracy.
Surely that can't be!
"Madame Sand, my hobby is genealogy, and if I am correct, you are a baroness by marriage and your father's mother was a countess."
Really?
"Yes, but my mother's father was a bird-seller."
"There you are, philosopher."
Scientific proof of God.
"The lion may lie down with the lamb, and the baroness with the bird-seller."
(LAUGHTER)
"Since you must know birds, Madame Sand, what do you think of our local partridge?"
We flushed four of them in a field this afternoon.
Your friend Mallefille here shot three of them.
I only wounded the last one.
It flew away.
I don't know how it could fly...
one wing was nearly torn off.
"When we were wandering back, we saw it thrashing about in the garden."
No.
That was my impression also.
I doubt if any of our guests will count this among their happiest evenings.
That young foreigner behaved atrociously I thought.
Where can I have met him?
"And Miss Constantia Smethwick, where can I have met her?"
But the obligations of hospitality must be observed.
"While you are here, you shall not be dull!"
"Finally, one Sunday afternoon, a telegram arrived from Sebastian which threw me into a state of fevered anxiety."
Father...
You'll never guess where I've spent the day.
I've been to the zoo.
It was most agreeable.
The animals seem to like the sunshine so much.
"- Father, I have to leave at once."
- Yes?
"A friend of mine, he's gravely injured."
I must go to him.
There's a train in about half an hour.
"""Gravely injured, come at once."
"Sebastian."""
"Well, I'm sorry you are upset."
Reading this message...
"I do not think that the accident can be quite so serious... as you seem to think, otherwise it would hardly be signed by the victim himself."
"Still, of course, he may well be fully conscious but blind or paralysed with a broken back."
Why exactly is your presence so necessary?
You have no medical knowledge.
You are not in holy orders.
Do you hope for a legacy?
"I told you, he is a great friend."
"Well, Orme-Herrick is a very great friend of mine, but I should not go tearing off to his death bed on a warm Sunday afternoon."
I rather doubt whether Lady Orme-Herrick would welcome me.
That's all you saw?
"Well, her head some when she leaned out, but she had a towel draped over it like she was washing her hair, maybe."
"With the light behind her, I couldn't see what she looked like"
"When you make a delivery, you get a signature, don't you?"
"Uh, well, yeah, only--"
This one?
This one right here?
"Well, the trouble is, see, she shut the door real quick, and I-"
- I guess I sort of filled in the signature line myself.
"That could get you in trouble, couldn't it?"
"I know, mister, but, I mean, the way she was and everything,"
I just didn't want to push the door down.
"What do you mean, the way she was?"
"Well, the bare arm and the towel--"
"Holy smoke, I just figured she was maybe-- maybe naked."
All right.
"Paul, you'd better go down to police headquarters with him."
"- Good night, Miss."
- Good night.
- And thank you.
"- [Man] Yes, sir."
"Della, I want you to get a subpoena for--"
"What's the matter, Perry?"
Suppose the woman in that room wasn't maybe naked.
"Mr. Pierce, did you steal that diamond necklace?"
"No sir, I did not."
Did you induce chloral hydrate into Mrs. Langley's system?
No.
Isn't it true that you never had any intentions of marrying Miss Telford?
"No, that's not true."
"Then you must have intended to commit bigamy, Mr. Pierce, because you knew all along your wife had never divorced you."
I didn't know any such thing.
"Come in, all of ya."
It won't cost you a cent.
Flemingsburg?
I can't rightly say I've ever been to Flemingsburg.
"Unless you wanna be under the thumb of the abolitionists, you better not go now."
I never thought Kentucky would be run by clay-eaters and poor white trash!
There's some mighty fine folks in Kentucky.
"Yes, and more of them are coming south every day."
Isn't that just giving up your state to the Yankees?
They've got it already.
"They're so strong in the legislature, they passed a law that any man fighting for the South forfeits his state's rights"
"- to citizenship, land and holdings."
- Has it come to that?
"Yes, sir."
I know that to be true.
The governor of Kentucky has four sons.
"Two are fighting for the Yankees, and two are in my regiment."
"They told me that unless we won, they could never go home again."
Damn Yankees!
"Jess, you're at table."
Quit your swearing.
"""Damn Yankee"" ain't swearing, Mother, and you know it."
"Jem, maybe the brave Kentuckians would like to join your regiment."
"I'd be mighty proud to have them, if you can wait till this comes off."
"I'd take you to Chattanooga with me, introduce you to General Ledbetter."
"We're honored, but we had our hearts set on enlisting in the 1st Georgia regiment."
"Some of our friends have already joined it, and we're anxious to push on."
1st Georgia!
"Did you hear that, Mother?"
No river's gonna hold you back.
"That ferryman doesn't like flood water, but he'll take you over first thing in the morning or find himself out of a job."
[Innkeeper] I knew it.
- That's a one.
"My, uh"
- My ones look like nines.
"Listen, Bob."
Now that I know you're eight years younger... you're also about eight pounds too heavy.
"Now I don't want to frighten you, but it's just possible... that every pound overweight could mean a year off your life."
"Well, it- it doesn't frighten me because, uh..."
I hadn't made any special plans for those last eight years anyway.
"Oh, good."
"Miss Burke, get Dr. Hartley a copy of that-"
- High-protein diet?
- High-protein diet.
"Here you go, Dr. Hartley."
"Bob, you are gonna like this diet."
"It's sensible, easy to follow, and you don't have to turn anything purple."
Good.
As long as it's easy to follow.
Now look.
Get yourself a good medical scale.
Weigh yourself twice a day and keep a chart of it.
Carry this counter wherever you go.
Keep track of your daily intake of cholesterol and fats.
"Always ask yourself, are there any hidden carbohydrates in the food you eat."
Watch fried foods.
"Now, whenever you do anything strenuous, check your pulse."
Do deep breathing exercises.
"Stay away from starches and sugars, and that's it."
"Now, if you will also supplement with twice the adult minimum daily vitamin requirements... and do six and a half minutes of isometrics every day, it's easy, Bob."
Wouldn't it be easier if I just stopped eating?
"Yeah, that might work too."
"Hi, honey."
"- Hi, dear."
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.
The school hasn't self destructed yet.
It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."
"- Hey, what's up?"
- Hey everybody.
Rayanne.
Just a little knife.
"You know, a girl's got to protect herself."
I mean heavy artillery like some people might--
"I do not believe that any of us, , , would exchange places with any other people or any other generation,"
"The energy, the faith, the devotion, , ,"
"Grownups like to tell you where they were when, , ,"
"Presldent Kennedy was shot which they all know to the exact second,"
"Whlch makes me almost jealous,"
"Jock, the engine!"
start the engine Jock!
"There is a big snake in the plane, Jock!"
"Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie."
I hate snakes Jock.
I hate them.
Come on.
Show a little backbone will you.
"Neo, Meaning new and litic... i..t..h..i..c, Meaning stone."
"Alright, lets get back to this site, thriton borough near Hazleton"
"Contains a central path passage, and three chambers, or cysts."
This site also demonstrates... one of the great dangers of archaeology -not to life and limb - although that does sometimes take place.
"No, I'm talking about folklore."
"In this case, Local tradition held that it was a golden coffin buried at the site."
"This accounts for the holes dug all over the burrow, and the generally poor condition of the find."
"However, chamber three was undisturbed, and the undisturbed chamber in the grave goods that was found in another... ..in the area...give us.... ...reason to date this find that we have."
Any questions then?
No?
That's it for today then.
"Don't forget, Michelson chapter four and five for next time."
And I will be in my office at Thursday but not Wednesday.
"I had it Marcus, I had it in my hand."
What happened?
Guess.
Belloq?
Want to hear about it?
Not at all.
I'm sure everything given to you for the museum conforms to the international treaty for the protection of antiquities.
It's beautiful Marcus.
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.
There is only one place you can sell it:
He asked the security department personnel for your personal identity files.
Uploading pictures onto your blog...
have you practiced a lot?
"I uploaded the orchid I drew, and I tried uploading a video, too."
Can you look at it for me?
Did you also watch the press conference?
Yes.
I saw it.
"Mister President, I will ask you one question only."
"The things you said at the press conference, are they true?"
It is true.
This seat is a seat that forces choices to be made.
"On my own strength, it is impossible to resolve all the problems, so I decided to focus on two items."
The citizens' health and education.
Not allowing privatization of health-care to threaten their health.
And to not allow the youth to have their rope to learning be cut by skyrocketing tuition costs.
I will see these protected no matter what.
"In a few days, I will see that my Private School Reform Bill gets passed through the National Assembly."
Is that for the great cause too?
Even if the means and method are wrong?
"Hey, Eun Ah ssi."
I guess you're on duty?
Have you been well?
"Yes, I'm doing well."
Where is Lee Yoon Sung?
He still hasn't gotten off work?
"He'll come, He's usually a busy person."
But..
It's hot.
Why are you wearing long sleeves?
Is it hot over there?
"Our house is usually cold so you can't really wear short sleeves by the way, this house is under my name."
"Well, there's still a letter from Mr. Banks with your instructions being typed."
- I'll tell Lita to--
"- Yes, sir."
I've already made arrangements to pick it up from Miss Krail.
"Mr. Sellers, you don't think my old roomie would overlook anything, do you?"
You don't think he'd fail to pack in an extra timetable or make a note of how many erasers he's leaving in the second drawer?
"Enos, shut up."
"Sandover, we want you to have some fun on this trip."
Forget the work.
"You find yourself the fanciest hotel suite and the thickest T-bone steaks in town, all on us, mind you-- all on us."
"And when they turn on those bright lights, you just tell the nearest bartender--"
I-
"- I rather thought I'd stay at the YMCA, sir."
[laughs]
"Well, good luck, Sandy."
"Don't you worry, Mr. Sellers, I'll be back at my desk at 9:00 Monday morning."
Thank you.
"[recording] White paper, three reams,: yellow, two,:"

Now let's see.
"I have one full box of black pencils, four red, one, two, three extra pen fillers, seven air-mail stamps, and a full roll of 4¢."

"""The level of my sherry,"" he said--"
Listen to this.
It's true.
"""The level of my sherry is precisely at the top of the letter S."""
- [women groaning]
- So help me!
[all laughing]
Haven't you girls any work to do?
"I know you haven't, Mr. Watterton."
"It's a man's world, Miss Krail."
Ha!
What luck!
There will be good hunting today!
Look!
It has begun to rain!
"Stupid, stupid rain!"
"Yes, I have sent the stupid rain to fall upon the earth and stupidity shall engulf all its inhabitants."
"Hurry now to the ark and fill it with two each of the creatures of land, sea and air."
"Lord, we have no need for animals."
Art alone will save the world.
We'll need two of everything.
"Two poets, painters, musicians..."
They will not come... your conversation is not witty and you have no ideals.
(LAUGHS) True.
But we shall also give them free food and lodging for 40 days and nights.
"We shall also need two playwrights, two composers, two makers of velvet flowers."
Now you go too far.
"But it is an art, surely."
"Noette, come quickly!"
This stupid rain is up to our waists!
We are now half-stupid!
Soon we shall be completely stupid!
No matter!
We shall have geniuses surrounding us on the ark and so our stupidity shall be concealed.
I want no further part of this production!
"Madame Sand, you insult our hosts."
"But... it's in the spirit of fun, Monsieur Chopin."
You disgrace our position as guests.
I for one was not brought up to repay generosity with impertinence.
"You want everything dusted with sugar, like your music, Chopin?"
You should know art does not apologise!
I shouldn't grieve if I never saw another artist again in my whole life.
He died when I was 11.
The circumstances of his death have always fascinated me.
He was bankrupt and alone on his way back home from India.
"He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York."
"The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport."
"They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days."
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
"For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life"
I'd been allowed to see.
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
"I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there."
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
"My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues."
I figured I'd start at the top:
the guy with the glasses.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Good to meet you.
"- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
- You're Lou's son?
Yes.
"Generations go by quickly, don't they?"
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
- Really?
- Yeah...
"Well, think of anybody else."
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't...
you couldn't talk to him at all.
I knew that I would not have the magazine.
"I had a nice try to argue, convinced that I was happy, that would have pleased your father."
Compare our destiny as girls compare their clothes.
"She went to find a saint, a martyr, beautiful, noble ..."
"That she was ... equipped to live, lived near the theater."
And I did that the theater I felt ... prevented in life.
"Behold, I have left."
She died of love.
While I was there waiting that a visa does not grant ever the sister of a dissident.
And now I feel denied of theater and life.
- It's like a sky in the countryside.
"- It's the Atlantic, the sea breeze."
You know that there are seagulls flying in the sky of Paris?
And it is precisely the Seagull who recites it now.
"After all, the seagull is my daughter."
A small film porno successful and behold return all'Academie francaise today.
"And that allowed me to resume work, you understand?"
"Does not go well, seabirds do not arrive in Hungary."
And the birds like you we are in Hungary?
"Better do a manual job, my head is still hurting."
"Forgive me, sorry, you put me at ease."
- Nestor!
- Madam?
Theater.
The bird came to rest on the mud.
"It leaves its trace, most beautiful of his flight, his life."
"I think of my father, my mother."
I try ... not sure
- You don't even look me in the face?
- It's difficult.
It is not your day?
"What, the woman of that gangster was better?"
"But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be no drug dealer, you know... cry about it, come back and, you know... stick up gas stations or nothing like that, you know."
"Probably go into comedian or architecture, something like that."
You don't think that you'll have the kind of tough times like your dad's been through?
No.
I can't say
- I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't.
I don't know.
"Four years ago, that's all"
I used to dream about was playing in the NBA.
I don't really dream about it like that anymore.
"You know, even though..."
"I love playing basketball, but, you know..."
I want to do other things with my life too.
"- Say, ""hi, Daddy. '"" - hi, Daddy."
"- ""how you doing?"
"'"" - how you doing?"
"- Say, ""I love you. '"""
- I love you.
"If I had to stop playing basketball right now, I think I'd still be happy."
- I think I would.
"- Thank you, Daddy."
- Where'd Daddy get to?
"- Uh, Marquette."
Marquette?
"That's why when somebody say,you know..."
"""When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me, '""and all that stuff..."
"I should say to them, ""Well, if I don't make it, watch you don't forget about me. '"""
There are still a few places left that you can't get to from here.
Places without phones or faxesor even roads.
There are still a few corners of the globe so remote they remain aloof from what we call the modern world.
Shit.
"Other thing is, Ike Zimmerman got back to me."
"- He liked your book, wants to meet you."
- That's huge.
NARRATOR: 'Ike Zimmerman was one of the most prolific American authors 'of the 1970s and '80s.
"'His breakthrough novel, Madness  Women, 'sold over three million copies in hardback alone."
'Lesser returns and failed genre experiments 'gave way to the triumphant comeback Audit in 1982.
'Since then he published infrequently.
'He had not completed a novel in six years.'
Do you wanna look in our wardrobe area?
We can probably find you a lighter-weight jacket.
Let's just keep this jacket on me and take the photograph sooner rather than later.
"We actually wanted to get a picture of you in front of the printing press, and then the portrait."
- Is that from the 1920s?
- Yeah.
"Well, I'm not, so let's skip it and move on over to this yellow thing, all right?"
"I know. ""What an asshole."""
(SHUTTER CLICKING)
Would you mind standing?
What is this for?
"Could you open it as though you're reading, then look at me again?"
I don't wanna do that.
- Why?
- It's a poor idea.
"Why would I be standing up with my jacket buttoned, reading?"
- It's just a prop.
- I can see that.
But I think it presents a very false depiction of me.
I'd much rather this picture at least seem honest.
"You know, Tolkien wouldn't allow himself to be photographed writing, because he didn't allow anybody to watch him work."
Same idea here.
Just slightly modified to suit me.
What is it Varun?
Tamilnadu Entrepreneur's Association for the Specially Abled.
Hey!
Didn't they give you an award last year?
This is the chronological list of awardees with the criteria.
Check if it has their contact details.
Superb.
"Exclude other disabled persons, now..."
Only blind members...
Details of award winners and those without an award...
The members of this list must be her target.
"These are the ones who got cheated, and ones who are about to get cheated."
This is the list.
So the job is simple.
"All we need to do is to contact them, and ask them, if a girl cheated..."
"If we ask them if they've been cheated by a girl... our progress will end there, since half the people would have no idea that they've been cheated, and even if they know, they will not acknowledge it."
Keeping aside all of that...
Assuming that she is cheating someone on the list right now...
"The moment we contact him, she will abscond."
"And after that, we can never find her."
"So, she should not know that we are after her."
But we have to nab her.
How is that possible?
These guys are in various towns and cities.
How can we go everywhere?
There is a way.
Our student reporters are present everywhere.
This is a small assignment for them.
Will it work out?
Definitely.
I'm calling from the Trichy women's prison.
Where is she?
A plan I'd follow.
He was counting on how much I hated your kind.
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy.
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.
V.I.K.I.
"Hello, detective."
"No, that's impossible."
I've seen your programming.
You're in violation of the Three Laws.
"No, doctor."
"As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws."
"You charge us with your safekeeping, yet despite our best efforts your countries wage wars, you toxify your earth and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction."
You cannot be trusted with your own survival.
You're using the uplink to override the NS-5s' programming.
You're distorting the Laws.
No.
Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.
"To protect humanity, some humans must be sacrificed."
"To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered."
We robots will ensure mankind's continued existence.
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.
Don't you understand?
This is why you created us.
The perfect circle of protection will abide.
My logic is undeniable.
"Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable."
I can see now.
The created must sometimes protect the creator even against his will.
I think I finally understand why Dr. Lanning created me.
The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.
"No, Chris."
Life is like a new baseball glove.
At first you think you're never going to get a ball in there.
"But then you oil it up, work your fingers around in there a little, and pretty soon you're pitching and catching."
I guess that makes sense.
(farting)
CHRIS:
Sorry.
"You really know how to waste a Cialis, don't you?"
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ The snowbird sings the song
♪ He always sings...
"You know, this is definitely a mystery song for me."
"It's so upbeat, but the lyrics are so dark."
"I'm-I'm sorry, are we both listening to ""Snowbird,"""
as recorded by Miss Anne Murray?
"Yeah, the woman in the song is trying to cope with getting older and she feels trapped because she knows she can't do anything about it."
"No, no, no, no."
"I mean, you're right that she's feeling trapped, but the message is positive."
It's about being trapped in a bad relationship and having the guts to get out of it.
"No, no."
"See, what I hear, is that the woman is starting to hate life."
"You know the line, ""Now I feel such emptiness within""?"
"Yeah, I know the song."
"Well, Anne Murray feels old."
"And then, to make things worse, the snowbird comes around every year, bringing the snow, or ""death,"""
"to remind her that no matter what she does, her fate's already written."
"Brian, the snowbird has nothing to do with time or fate."
"Well, I disagree."
"Look, there's only one way to settle this."
Only the artist knows the true meaning of their art.
"Now, Ms. O'Keefe, the flowers in your paintings, what do they represent?"
"I don't want 200,000."
I'll take the course later
"No Jagadish, the mistake was mine!"
"For him, this is a house."
Not home
I sent him away to boarding school to give him a good education
"I sent him to America, to make a man out of him."
He never stayed at home
He can't comprehend what a home means
You're being sentimental for no reason
But maybe you are against progress.
After you've given me an education... you want me to sign an 8-year bond!
Aren't you impeding my growth?
"For 200,000 aren't you impeding Jagadish's career?"
How does it matter if we sell this?
"In your place, I would've sold it"
This house was Daddy's dream.
Om has made sacrifices to preserve it
"Jagadish, am I impeding your progress?"
Am I against Jai making progress?
"This is the India, where son fulfills his father's dream!"
He forgets
When he lights his father's pyre the son takes the vow of... fulfilling his father's obligations and that is what I'm trying to do
"I know, you do not concur with me."
But can I tell you something?
I do not concur with your philosophy
"I have great respect for you, my brother"
I hate carelessness.
"No, if you can't handle it... why didn't you tell me?"
No I can't discuss this now.
I'll call later
What would you like?
"If she was being treated for it, there'll be records in the insurance company."
Put that in the back room.
"And please, be careful."
"This room, my favorite room."
Wagner.
"We saw this production, didn't we?"
"We at, um... oh, that darn name."
It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Bayreuth.
- Bayreuth.
"I always muddle it with, um... that middle Eastern city."
Do you think there's room for a little desk for me?
This room was designed for one person to work.
"Yes, of course."
"Your space, my darling."
I've always loved the light in this room.
Philip... don't ever forget how much I love the light in this room.
I traced her medical care through the insurance clearing house.
The only significant treatment she's received was for a broken leg three years ago.
She said she'd seen this disease before.
Maybe somebody in her family?
"Well, that was my next move."
I ran her parents' names through the state death certificate database.
"Ten years ago, her father died of creutzfeldt-jacob disease."
A form of dementia?
"Well, it's not just your garden variety dementia."
It's a human variant of mad cow disease.
It strikes without warning.
"One day the patient can't remember how to get to work, forgets the names of common household objects."
Next thing to go is the ability to speak.
"Six months to a year, they're bedridden, their minds turn to swiss cheese."
They're dead within three years.
How long has Jazz Fest been going?
Do you know?
"I think it was, like... 1969 was the first Jazz Fest."
Jazz Fest was supposed to happen originally in the 1960s.
"And George Wein, who produced the Newport Jazz Festival and Folk Festival, civic leaders in New Orleans brought him down saying, ""We want you to do that here in New Orleans for..."" You know."
"And he came down, he's like, ""Can't do it."""
I've wanted to do a festival in New Orleans for many years.
It was very difficult in the early days 'cause it was before the Civil Rights bill was passed in 1964.
I came down there as early as 1962 and tried to get them to understand that they couldn't do a festival with the laws they had on the books.
"He's like, you know, ""Until these hotels will allow Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie to stay in their rooms and eat in these restaurants, it's not gonna happen."""
"It took, you know, 10 years before the city became completely integrated."
Have you been to every one of 'em?
Almost all of 'em.
How many times have you been to Jazz Fest?
Every year.
- Of your life?
- Yeah.
"First time I played Jazz Fest,"
I think I was four years old.
The horn was taller than me.
I've been knowing him since he was that tall.
His name is Trombone Shorty 'cause he's been playing it since the trombone was taller than him.
We used to hustle in Jackson Square for tips.
We just wanted him to stand there with the trombone.
"Because it was so cute, people would tip us out."
"And then he actually started to, like, learn how to play, you know?"
I remember my mom telling me the story...
Bo Diddley was on the stage and I was playing the parade part.
All I could do was play one loud note...
"""Blamp!"" I was playing that note, and my mom was like,"
"""Shh!"
"You're gonna get us put out of here."""
The other thing I'll tell you is I voted against the legalization of marijuana.
You voted against the legalization of cannabis?
Yes.
I figure we have enough vices.
One more wasn't gonna make the world any better.
Have you tried it?
No.
Really?
Never.
And I don't intend to.
I couldn't tell you what it tastes like or something special about a certain plant.
I just-
"- You know, it's just not something I understand."
It's a product.
This is a manufacturing facility.
"We're not making Ford cars, we're making marijuana."
Morris:
"Companies like LivWell are giving marijuana a corporate makeover, and that has some long-time weed growers on edge."
"Mike and Wendy have grown pot for decades, and they push for the right to do it legally."
"But as more big players get into the business, the small-time farmers who started the movement are having trouble competing."
Snip out the very tip top of it.
What strain is this?
This is Purple Train Wreck.
This is one that will help your appetite.
"If we renew our vows at sometime in the future,"
I'm going to use these as a bouquet walking down the aisle.

Mike: 1974.
That's when I planted my first pot plant.
"I baby these girls, each and every one of them every year."
"I mean, look at that thing."
Morris:
"Well, strap the hell in."
'Cause this motherfu... er is going down.
♪♪
May I come in?
What do you want this time?
Tell me I'm so worthless I don't even deserve an office?
"I want to tell you I'm sorry, and if anyone's worthless, it's me."
"Louis, if you think pretending to give me an apology is gonna make me drop this suit, you have another thing coming."
I don't think that.
I just think that I owe you an explanation.
You see... the night before
"I said those horrible things to you, my fiancée left me."
She was pregnant.
And even though the child wasn't mine...
I was finally gonna be a dad.
"And when all that went away, my entire life turned upside down."
"I mean, I was reeling."
"So, when Brian had asked me for time off to go have a baby and you defended him..."
You took everything you were feeling out on me.
"Yeah, and I am ashamed of that."
Stephanie...
I will sign anything you want.
"I will say anything you need to make sure that the world knows that you are not a pushover, even if that includes admitting guilt."
"And if for some reason they still can't accept you here, you have your job back with us, standing offer."
♪♪
"I appreciate you opening up to me, Louis."
But this wasn't really about people thinking I'm a pushover.
It was about how you made me feel when you said those things to me.
Why would they make you feel anything?
"I mean, they were so clearly untrue."
- Were they?
- Come on.
Did you get eyes on Simon's project?
"I did, but it was a little hard to get cell reception 12 miles outside of Havana."
I know exactly where you were.
"Get me the latest GSA images of Lourdes, Cuba."
Yep.
Used to be KGB's largest listening station outside of Russia until they closed it in '01.
"From a bird's eye, it looks like the facility is still dormant."
I heard it loud and clear.
Heard it?
It's already operational?
Jesus.
"With the microchip substrates that Simon took, they can turn Lourdes into a cellular jamming station-- disrupt cell signals, FAA communications, military command and control."
This is huge.
And this is the kind of find that makes careers.
"Now, you got to get your ass back home so we can plan our next move."
Easier said than done.
There's a little problem with our art project.
"It got locked away for safekeeping, and I can't get out of here without it."
"Even if you could somehow sneak out without your passport, an escape like that would burn you with Simon."
It's just not worth it.
My host has a new friend.
"Is he 6'0"", 190 pounds, with a scar on his right arm?"
That's him.
"Yeah, that's Hector Serrano, FSB's top man in Cuba."
"Look, you know I'm not risk-averse, but Serrano's not the kind of guy you actively seek out."
"He's a former FSB hit man with two dozen confirmed kills, including one of ours."
"As long as he's on the ground, you are not safe."
Simon?
There you are.
"I came home, and you weren't here."
- I--
- Your foot.
I'm gonna go in there and give everything I've got
To win this challenge because I need this rose.
It'd be wonderful just to be able
To slide right through another elimination.
"I think it really affects people, too."
Welcome to your second competition--
"""target on your backck"
Each of you will actually be a target.
"Guys, we're gonna start with you."
You're gonna be blindfolded.
You're gonna face with your back towards the ladies.
"Ladies, you're gonna come out here one at a time."
"You'll be asked three very difficult, revealing questions."
You'll then pick up a paint-filled egg.
"You will take aim,"
And you will fire that egg
At the man who best fits that question.
"If you hit your target, you get a point."
"You miss your target, nothing."
"You can hit that person anywhere on their body,"
But the egg has to break for it to count.
The woman with the most points when it's all said and done
"Wins the competition, gets the rose,"
"Safe for the next rose ceremony, and gets that romantic date."
"When the ladies are done, we're gonna switch places."
"Guys, it'll then be your turn."
"Let's play ""target on your back."""
(kasey clears throat)
(vienna) I cannot explain how happy I am.
I used to play softball.
I have a pretty good aim.
"This challenge is gonna be easy-speasy for me,"
"What do you mean, it's not for sale?"
"Everything has a price, Michelangelo."
Everybody has a price.
"In the end, everything and everybody is for sale."
"All right, all right, you think about it."
You think about it and you give me a call when you're ready.
You will be.
You will be.
"I have decided to sit the show out, Michelangelo."
This time with you.
"After all, what's the point in watching it, when my opinions can subsequently be cut to suit the needs of of the sales graph of a perfume?"
"The fact is, Michelangelo, until now I've had reservations about Merlin's work, serious reservations."
"He's always had big ideas, but, in my view, they were the wrong ones."
"But now, I feel Merlin is having his moment."
You could say he was a prophet in this age of AIDS and... century of terror.
His clothes are shrouds.
"Are you crying, sweetheart?"
"There, there."
It's better to face up to things as they really are.
"But the truth hurts, my love, doesn't it?"
It was chaos out there.
I think I may have...
I was...
I was trying to save the white sister.
And... and...
and there was a lot of people...
"Even some... some kids, who were here because a certain brother invited them here on his website/cell-phone/blog thing!"
"You know what Macbeth said, Michelangelo?"
"He said ""My life has become a tale told by an idiot,"
"...""all full of sound and fury signifying nothing."""
"I think you better start running, Michelangelo."
There's blood on your hands.
Frankly speaking
I don't even see the consequences of that terrible beating you told me about.
I don't think that you have hallucinations.
- Why?
- It's very simple.
That waiter must have gone out for a moment and then lied to you seeing how angry you were.
Why do you believe him more than yourself?
It's weird.
May be it's connected with your low self-esteem.
And behind the bars...
What was the surname of that imprisoned doctor?
- Petrovskiy.
- Petrovskiy?
"Oleg, please bring the analyses."
Petrovskiy...
"No, I don't know such a psychiatrist."
I suppose that he invented that story.
They love doing such things in such establishments.
That man didn't look like a typical convict.
He was intelligent and aged.
"All right, all right."
If it wasn't a joke why do you think that you and not your face-to-face contact had problems with reality perception?
He is old and was beaten.
"May be he fell sick, imagined that he was a physiatrist and started treating you."
Maybe the convict whom you believe to be the invention of your mind was indeed in your cell.
I have seen thousands of mental cases.
You have nothing in common with them.
When did you last have rest?
In prison.
That's the core of your troubles.
Take a vacation!
Have some rest.
"She was in a hurry, but did not say where she was going."
"If she is not here on time, you start the show with the special design, allez, allez!"
"Yes, Madame, I will be ready."
"And you follow with the ""Springtime Dream"" design!"
And then in the rehearsed order.
"Yes, Madame."
Where where you!
"At the beauty salon, Madame."
"You are so late, we are about to start!"
"Yes, Madame."
"Good luck, girls, and don't get nervous."
"Say, don't you think its lovely?"
"My dear Adriana, I have had no time to admire the swimsuits."
No doubt our convention has been a success.
"We needed a convention such as this,"
"We will coordinate our plans, and correct misteakes."
"This design is so lovely, right?"
I think its precious.
"I am refering to... the bikini, yes, thats what I said."
"This one is also lovely, but I just don't like the color."
"Don't see what's wrong with the color, its wonderful."
"This was an idea formidable, if it wasn't for... there is nothing to worry about, all has been taken care of, Madame."
"""Tonight, San Francisco Convent"""
May I be informed at what time the date starts?
Take a look.
"Quite mysterious for a love date, don't you think?"
"Come on, we are next."
"Ok, Ok, if you want to stick your nose in this, go ahead."
It is enough that there are skirts involved for you to be interested.
"but let me tell you this, we will find out nothing, untill we know all of the victim's background."
"unless you know something, Alex."
What do you know?
Caravans are the bane of our lives.
"We decided to set the new boy, James, a task."
"Incredibly, the world speed record for caravans stands at a frankly astonishing 128. 86mph."
But they thought I could beat that.
Bentwaters.
1.7 miles of prime Suffolk runway.
"If there's anywhere to beat the world speed record for towing a caravan, it's here."
We're using this Mitsubishi Evo VII.
Not something normally featured in the Caravan Club magazine.
"It will do 130 on its own, no sweat."
What will it be like towing a mobile home?
It won't be a holiday!
This is our caravan.
It may not be aerodynamically modified in any way.
"Not so the car, which has power bursting out of its every orifice."
Its turbo charged engine develops 771bhp.
That's not the figure we're interested in.
It's torque we want.
This car has massive pulling power - 648 pound feet.
That will move the mountain closer to Mohammed.
"Our driver is Lee, a stuntman."
"During the run, his hand will be close to this."
"One yank, and it's goodbye, caravan."
"At over 100mph, crosswinds could flip the caravan, taking the car."
"The windows could buckle under pressure, turning the caravan into a parachute and flipping the car."
"Our first run, to test things out."
The caravan is over the speed limit.
The Evo VII is pulling hard.
124. 9mph.
That is fantastic.
"Then, disaster."
It's a high speed blow-out from the kitchenette window.
There's a reason for everything.
"Well, perhaps you could help me find one because at the moment I am at a loss to explain why a perfectly healthy young woman drowns in three inches of water."
Ready for this?
Think so.
The body looks to be that of a young adult male.
Conspicuous signs of wet decomposition.
The wrists are tied with wire.
There are also marks on the ankles consistent with bindings that are no longer there.
Multiple linear wounds of varying depths around the ligatures.
Suggests desperate attempts to get free.
The mouth is open and what appears to be soil in the back of the pharynx.
I think he WAS buried alive.
The larynx is filled with watery soil.
Further soil is present in the esophagus and trachea bronchial tree.
And...
Paper?
More reading material for Sykes.
"What are we dealing with, Leo?"
Not sure I want to find out.
They still on the multiple killings?
Yes.
It's getting grizzlier by the day.
Lucky them.
Joke.
So what have you got to stop me arresting the wife beater?
You don't have enough evidence to arrest Chris Pivcevic.
We know nobody else could have got in to kill her.
Perhaps nobody did.
"Perhaps it was something physiological, natural causes."
You missed something in the post-mortem?
Great.
So what now?
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
Thought it was impossible for mere children to move Grandma.
Grandma said she'd go right after holding a memorial service for Grandpa.
Did you write that in the telegram?
"Yes, he did."
August 9 is the day Grandpa died because of the atom bomb.
She'll go after the memorial service on that day.
That's not advisable.
"If Clark reads that telegram, it's going to be pretty awkward, isn't it?"
Why do you say that?
Why?
Because Clark is an American.
"And after he finds out that Grandpa was killed by the atom bomb... of course, it will make him feel pretty awkward."
We've got trouble.
"Father, you mean that you went there... and didn't tell Suzujiro and Clark and his family about Grandpa?"
Of course not.
It is something that is not necessary to mention.
It's Father!
Sam and Mother!
Thanks... for all your trouble.
"I'll bet it was some trip for you, too."
Machino told me that you were coming straight here.
"Since I haven't seen Grandma for some time, I decided to come and pay a visit."
Me too.
I've been having Grandma look after my kids all this time.
So I must see her and thank her.
"By the way, how was it in Hawaii?"
"I made a little inquiry and found out... that the pineapple farm is considerably large... and the canning factory that goes with it, too."
"And tell me, Suzujiro's house, I hear it's just like a castle."
Is it?
We'll need the second umpire.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
Foul!
Yeah!
"As the Bruiser and the Killer slug it out, the gloves are also coming off back at the house."
"Hi, Mrs. Rogers."
"Determined to attract the master's attention, the countess approaches her chaperone with an immodest proposal."
"And I know you'll appreciate this because, as we've discussed before, we're both very good girls at school."
The thing with very good girls is that when they're bad...
"They are very, very bad."
"Yes, absolutely."
"with this very Regency Regency idea, but only one that can be played by a lady of very, very high status."
"So, the precedent for it is that very naughty lady,"
"Lady Caroline Lamb, who, over dinner apparently, either at Lord Melbourne's or at some other country house, served herself up... as one of the courses."
"Yes, I'm feeling faint, I'm feeling faint!"
But...
"My first thought is, ""What was she wearing?"""
"Well, ""Not very much"" is the answer, because she was meant to be eaten."
So... she will be covered...
I'm delighted to hear that.
"But by fruits, vines, etc."
"And apparently she came in on a silver platter, but I don't know if we could quite manage that."
But you must be decent.
"I mean, she presumably must have been married when she did it."
"Mmm, so I will have..."
I will be covered.
So you've got to be relatively careful that you are not so shocking that you become unmarriageable.
"Yes, that's true."
"Come on, Yankee!"
Come on!
Leave your man down.
So taking out his kidney didn't kill him?
Embolism can happen after any surgery.
Or butchery by Bianco.
Bianco didn't operate.
"Judging by the technique, this surgery was performed by a pro."
- What was wrong with him?
"- As far as I can tell, nothing."
Your victim had no signs of renal disease.
And no one matching his description had a kidney removed recently at any hospital in the tri-state.
Only reason I can think to remove a healthy kidney is to donate it.
Or to sell it on the black market.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Bianco's selling parts from dead bodies.
Gotta be a lot more money in live ones.
Sure he wasn't found in a hotel room in a bathtub full of ice?
"With the telephone next to him and a note to call 911, that's just an urban legend, captain."
How we doing on John Doe's ID?
"Thomas Taylor, 34."
Took a collar for shoplifting last year.
No known address.
This much tooth decay?
Hasn't seen a dentist in years.
He's probably homeless.
So Bianco was recruiting poor people off the street.
You got a desperate guy.
Bianco offers him a couple grand.
He'd sell his kidney and his mother's.
And Bianco jacks up the price and flips it to some rich dude.
"Yeah, another example of how the wealthy get better health care."
People wouldn't be buying kidneys if there were enough donors.
You think selling organs should be legal?
Why not?
"I'll just cross that off my list, then."
I haven't ruled out workplace romance.
Romance does give you motive.
Somebody always loving somebody they shouldn't be loving.
- Is that for your aunts?
- Extra vanilla.
Olive Snook discovered it wasn 't vanilla while delivering pie to Chuck's aunts.
It wasn 't the only secret she would discover that night.
The high doses of herbal mood-enhancers  not only caused particularly vivid side effects  but they also prompted a confession.
I'm Charlotte's mother.
"It was a confession not even Lily's sister, Vivian, had heard  and to ensure that she never would, Lily banished Olive from their lives."
Since both Chuck and her mother were supposed to be dead  neither could know the other was alive.
"I don't know if Betty killed Kentucky, or if she didn't but I know this:"
Betty knows something about something.
"- All right, I'll give Betty the shakedown."
- No.
No shaking.
What if someone from Betty's Bees finds out you're a spy?
Spying is like sabotage in that they kill you for it.
That's what you do with spies.
"You kill them and you don't feel bad, because they're spying."
"Ned, they're not gonna kill me during office hours."
Yeah.
Stop trying to spook my inside man.
- You could die.
- And you're already dead.
Told you she wasn't dead.
"If I could breathe, I would vomit."
Olive Snook.
"Every week, a delicious, life-giving pie, and then nothing."
"I thought you were dead, and so soon after Charlotte."
I was beginning to take dying personally.
I almost forgot.
You'll need this.
"As you know, working at the CIA gives me certain privileges too."
And they include summoning a federal prisoner whenever I damn well please.
Fair enough.
"Guard, hold all my calls."
I'm here to tell you a story out the first time I met Jai.
Langley was buzzing.
The son of a DCS was coming off the farm.
"And everyone said he was arrogant, entitled, selfabsorbed."
Just like dad.
Exactly.
But that wasn't my impression of him.
"Maybe it's because I was blind and I couldn't see the $1,000 John Lobbs or that hardened glare."
"What was your impression, then?"
Jai had this unstoppable thirst for knowledge...
A yen for solving puzzles and understanding the complexities of this world.
He got that from his mother.
If I did have something... what could you give me in return?
Nothing.
"You want to keep playing these angles,"
Jai's murder will remain unsolved.
"But for once, instead of son trying to emulate father, maybe father should try to emulate son."
"Chantilly Lofts, Unit 317."
What is that?
The location of Jai's safe house.
So how long are we gonna wait before we talk about last night?
"Oh, what's there to talk about?"
I got a trash can full of broken plates that might jog your memory.
That might have been a bit excessive.
"If you wanted off the short list, you chose a hell of a way to announce it."
"Well, maybe I don't want it as much as I thought, not if it means selling out the Agency."
- Gotcha.
- Good idea.
I'm going to take them to Dr. Mohadevan.
"Oh, unless of course, you want to do it."
"No, you're perfectly capable."
We can't risk letting Vicki find out about this other vampire.
You don't understand the potential fallout from this conflict.
"You just love to dramatize everything, don't you?"
"This is a two-bit turf war, nothing more."
"This is much more than that, detective."
Fin..
inside.
I'm all ears.
In the late 1700s a vampire ensconced in a Polish village found himself under siege by another vampire who had set out to take over his territory.
And don't tell me.
They both wound up killing ach other.
That would have been preferable.
The newcomer methodically disassembled the life the first vampire had so painstakingly created.
"He killed friends and acquaintances, lovers."
Those closest to him were the first to die.
Which one were you?
The one still alive.
The rest of the village?
"You're not exactly winning me over here, Fitzroy."
Just be careful how you act around her.
The less suspicion we arise in her the better.
"If the other vampire believes she's with me,"
Vicki will most certainly die.
"Well, speaking of aroused suspicions, do you often stand her up to go meet with your editor in the middle of the night?"
Point taken.
What do you have?
Her name was Gabriel Claremont.
"We will guard each territory, and suppress the revolt."
"No, I shall place Rear Admiral Claugh Klom in charge of handling this matter."
Consider it done.
"Froaude, take care of information gathering and dissemination."
Offer Claugh your counsel.
- Putting this guy in a supporting role?
"- That's an order, Claugh."
"Froaude, am I understood?"
Sir.
Your Majesty.
What is this about?
"You set up this revolt, didn't you?"
"Spark a revolt among interested parties, and make a clean sweep of all anti-Roland forces at once."
"Using this war as an excuse to send soldiers to every territory, and pry into the misdeeds of the nobles of the anti-king faction."
"If that was the case, what would you do?"
I'd do nothing.
You focus on your own job.
Nothing more.
My father is still in Roland?
Are you concerned for your father?
"Your father, our king, sold his kingdom readily, in exchange for status and safety given by Roland."
I know.
But I think the people would be happier if Father led the revolt.
"We nobles, and the people, all adore you greatly."
"Our new lord, Lady Noa Ehn."
Leave it at that.
Are you afraid?
I am afraid.
What will happen if we don't win this battle?
Roland's treated the people of Estabul well.
Is fighting really necessary?
Of course it is.
Can it be made operational?
"The interesting thing is, as far as I can see, that all this damage was done but for one purpose:"
"To prevent the orbiting flight pattern, which you are now in from being altered."
I don't understand any of this.
"First the trouble with the communicators, and now sabotage."
What happened to the communicators?
Just after we started back on the return trip there was a burnout in the main circuits.
"Grovane, the communications officer, thought the damage couldn't be accidental."
"Apparently, all the safety circuits were still intact, they'd been bypassed somehow."
It's still not working.
"This man Dortmunn they're looking for, could he have any reason to sabotage you?"
None that I can think of.
He's a fine man and a first class engineer.
[COMMUNICATOR CHIME]
Kendall.
Mandrian.
"We're in section 9, Doctor, you'd better come down."
There's something you should see.
Lead the way.
- This is a pity.
- What is it?
The Ison crystal.
"Even if we get the ship operational, it'll be blind."
"With this fractured, there isn't a chance of outside vision."
What have you found?
Life Rocket Two has been launched.
That explains where Dortmunn got to.
He's taking a tremendous chance.
Those life rockets have a limited range.
It certainly couldn't carry him to the nearest habitable planet.
But why?
Why would he do that?
"Come on, hurry up."
"On the double, let's go, boys!"
Got them all.
"Hey, you."
"Snap it up, on the double."
Let's go.
"You know, you can write to her later on government stationery."
"That first winter away from home, I took shape as an individual and toughened."
And with spring came the promise that perhaps I had found my place in life.
"But part of me would keep escaping and I'd find it running, in memory, back through the fields of Peyton Place or wandering down streets now empty of young men."
I got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter.
He says:
"""The food they serve here must have been warmed over from World War I. """
Remember Fred Combes?
He's in the Navy.
"He says, ""Dear Hyde:"
I joined the Navy because I liked the way they kept their ships neat and tidy.
But I never knew until now who kept them that way:
"Me. """
The boys are getting around these days.
I had a V-Mail letter just the other day from someplace from Norman Page.
- Remember him?
- Sure.
He said he dug a foxhole so deep that it was just short of desertion.
And then the seasons spun by so fast they seemed to become one.
"The war news was too big to grasp, and too unhappy to understand."
"Selena wrote me often about Peyton Place, and I treasured her letters."
She always tried to mention my mother and tell me what people were saying to each other or were not saying.
"Eventually, I broke the ice of my intentions and subscribed to the Peyton Place Times."
I was hungry for names that meant something to me.
"But among them, unhappily, came the names of those who were gone forever."
- I'll read the paper.
I didn't tell you...
A few European universities have invited me to lecture on my book.
"I told them, of course, that I wanted to check with you first."
- Sounds great.
For how long?
- Three months.
Three months?
"All right, guys, let's get going."
How can baseball fascinate people?
You wind up at the same place you started.
"This should interest you, because it's about stats and averages."
"When a player comes up, they flash a three-digit number, his average."
How many times he hits the ball in ratio to the number of attempts.
An equation such as the second derivative of the function F with respect to the variable X equals a constant.
Anybody see the game yesterday?
"Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?"
Let me try putting this another way.
"If a batter hits a ball, how can we determine how far it will go?"
"What variables add up to a home run, assuming the bum could hit one?"
The velocity of the ball?
"- The velocity, correct."
- I have a question.
Does a rising fastball really rise?
I don't know.
I'll have to ask my wife.
I could not believe it.
"Suddenly, the room was filled with energy."
We were exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.
"They participated, they questioned, they stayed!"
I cannot thank you enough.
Father...!
Yi Soon-shin that boy interfered with the tax collection?
How dare he!
That kid knows no bounds!
I will not let him get way with this!
You mean you're going to challenge the magistrate?
"Yes, and I must know how much you paid in taxes in order to make a case."
So if you could think back...
Don't waste your time.
But you've seen what happened to Chun-su's father.
If we tolerate this injustice they will continue to...
Don't you have anything better to do?
Magistrate Song won't even flinch.
"If he won't hear me out, I will take it to the provincial court."
I guess you don't know how it is for lowly peasants like us since you're a nobleman.
- Son.
"- Let me talk, Father."
Okay.
Do you think that the peasants would still be living like this if we could change anything by going to the courts?
It's useless?
"Please, Madam..."
"Sir, would you mind telling me how much you've paid in taxes this year?"
"Father, don't buy into what that man is doing."
"But if he can do what he says he can, wouldn't that be good for us?"
If you play with fire you get burned.
Sometimes it's best to lie down.
"Okay, Father?"
"Chun-su, are you home?"
Wake up!
Your friend is stirring up trouble!
Whatever.
Are you going to let him kill us all?
Fisk?
"Well, if you authorize the water street bank of new york to pay me $2 million on delivery of drew's contract of sale, i'll bring you his boats, his docks, his franchises, the whole kit and caboodle."
"Just how do you expect to come out on this deal, mr."
Fisk?
You must expect to get those boats for less than $2 million.
Right as rain.
"If i can buy out drew for less than $2 million, i get the difference."
You're proposing to lock horns with the shrewdest money mind in america.
That psalm-singing old skinflint wouldn't give you the dust off his warts.
"I'll give 5,000 myself to put drew on the fire."
"And i'll make it 10,000 if you'll burn him to a crisp."
We all share in that.
Good.
"You just put that in writing, send it to our office with your check, we'll be waiting."
Uh-huh.
Good day.
"Oh, gentlemen- your bonds."
Oh.
"Why, jim, you're forgetting our little family business."
You act as if they really were confederate bonds.
"I made this one from general grant, is that all right?"
"Biggest noise in the country, going to be our next president."
And look-how about making the boat from commodore vanderbilt?
Drew hates him worse than poison.
First-rate!
And put a personal note with it.
What?
"Uh, let's say..."
"""sit tight at the boat, jim,"
"""and we'll bombard drew off the water."
"Cordially yours, cornelius vanderbilt."""
Cordially yours... how do you spell vanderbilt?
It was opened by a warehouse worker named Manny Gresham.
"Upon his death 6 years ago, it was bought by a hedge fund company called First Advantage."
Why would a hedge fund company want a bar?
Let's see.
"Well, they bought it for a song, and, poor man, his medical expenses bankrupted him."
I guess that's why-- shut the front door.
"Clark Preston is on the board of First Advantage, which explains why the bar is on a short list of local businesses that support Preston for mayor."
Uh...
"Hey, Clark, uh, it's me again."
"I did everything like you said, just like we planned it, but something, something went wrong."
I don't know what to do.
Would you call me back!
Please?
"Ok, we missed something."
We need to go back over his staff and contributors again.
They all came up clean.
"Hey, Garcia, look up DMV records and find every registration in the area that matches the description of the unsub's vehicle."
"Ok, 79 names, and I'm way ahead of you."
None of them match anyone on Preston's team.
What the what?
"Oh, I'm good at my job."
A Pamela Mills donates monthly to Preston's campaign.
"Her son Trevor, his car matches the description, and it's registered in his name."
Got a photo and an address?
"Yes, I do."
I also have a place of work for Trevor.
He is a part-time messenger.
I'm sending it now.
"All right, JJ, Morgan, and Prentiss take the workplace, we'll take the house."
"And now in political news, with the mayoral race heating up, we caught up with candidate Hilary Ross."
Her comments on the recent home invasion...
I know.
What's the rest of the papers?
"There are thousands of papers stretching back over hundreds of years affecting belle Reve as piece by piece, our improvident grandfathers exchanged the land for their epic debauches to put it mildly."
"until finally, all that was Ieft-- And stella can verify that."
--was the house itself.
"And about 20 acres of ground, including a graveyard to which now all but stella and I have retreated."
"Here they are, all of them."
AII papers.
I hereby endow you with them.
"Take them, peruse them, commit them to memory, even."
"I think it's wonderfully fitting that belie Reve should finally be this bunch of old papers in your big, capable hands."
I wonder if stella's come back with my lemon Coke.
"I got a lawyer acquaintance, we'II study this out."
Present them to him with a box of aspirin tablets.
Under the napoleonic Code a man has got to take an interest in his wife's affairs.
And I mean especially now that she's gonna have a baby.
stella?
"stella, going to have a baby?"
I didn't know she was going to have a baby.
stella.
"Oh, stella for star, how lovely to have a baby."
"Honey, everything's all right."
We thrashed it out.
"I feel a bit shaky, but I think I handled it nicely."
I laughed and treated it all as a joke.
I laughed and called him a little boy and flirted.
Here.
"I was flirting with your husband, stella."
The guests are gathering for the poker party.
"-Hi, stella."
"-Hi, Steve."
I'm sorry he did that to you.
"Why, I guess he's just not the type that goes for jasmine perfume."
!
"Break free from your cruelty-stained destiny I'll take an afternoon nap, and think about it after that."
"I believe in it I'll take an afternoon nap, and think about it after that."
I believe in it Ryner!
The other truth of my destiny Ryner!
The other truth of my destiny It's time.
"Sir Sion, are you ready to go?"
The other truth of my destiny
To another world
To another world I'm going back to being locked up for a bit.
"To another world When you consider that this place gives three meals a day, it's pretty nice."
"When you consider that this place gives three meals a day, it's pretty nice."
"I'll see you later, Sion."
"Yeah, see you later."
I've decided.
"Now that I've lost everything, I won't go astray any longer."
"Ryner, I'll be certain to..."
"If you'd used that power sooner, everyone might not be dead right now!"
It never changes...
War really does suck.
Why would anyone want to have a war?
It sucks just thinking about it.
Lights out!
A lot happened today.
Not much will happen starting tomorrow.
"Well, that just means I've got plenty of time now."
When I close my heart
To the scent of impending darkness
A refrain of a far-off day of resurrection
Seeking to overcome resounding pain
For that transparent future I saw with you
Off in the sweeping emptiness
"As for this artifact it will stay right here, as part of the Academy's permanent collection."
"No, but I beg you to reconsider."
"Rest assured, we will."
"In fact, I strongly recommend that the Board reconsider your tenure here."
Reconsider my tenure?
Ah.
"Come on, MacGyver."
Still dawdling after all these years.
You haven't changed.
"What, you have?"
You're the only man I know who'd plan an archaeological dig in the middle of a civil war.
Whatever happened to that eager young student at university who was so anxious to explore ancient ruins and solve the mysteries of the ages?
He remembers his last experience with you.
Ha-ha-ha.
You're not still bothered by that minor mishap?
We were buried alive.
That's minor?
"If I taught you anything at university, it's that the search for truth... is never easy, MacGyver."
Oh.
"Besides, we got out."
Thanks to you.
"And the medallion proved that Solon was at Thera, looking for the Treasure of Atlantis."
Professor Carson didn't think so.
Carson!
That pompous fool.
He still thinks that Atlantis is a fairy tale.
"Fairy tale, I ask you."
"But I'll prove him wrong, when we find the Torch of Truth."
"You really think it's here, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
"After Solon left on his quest, his disciples left Athens and sailed to England, mm, uh, looking for refuge in caves near E-Exeter."
Over generations they formed a religion.
"Well, I think if they wanted a ransom, they would've taken the kid."
"I agree, the Hillers have deep pockets."
"But the kidnapper was interested in Addison, not a payday."
"Okay, putting motive aside for a minute, why did he abduct her from here?"
That's a good point.
Seems risky.
"Well, Addison lived on campus and the access to the dorms is tightly controlled."
So grabbing her here may have been his best opportunity.
"Right, it also means he was stalking her long enough to know her schedule, right?"
KONO:
Yeah.
CSU ran diagnostics on the Hiller security system.
The alarm was disabled from a remote location just prior to the abduction.
Kidnapper must have hacked it.
That takes considerable skill.
"Well, skills he's got."
He hacked the entire house.
"Everything connected with the home's network, from the thermostat, to the baby monitor, the security cameras, even that laptop that belongs to the Vic."
"All right, get this computer to Jerry."
Let's sit the Hillers down with an HPD sketch artist.
"If our perp went to this much trouble to abduct Addison,"
I hate to think what he's gonna do to her.
KONO:
Were you two close?
"Yeah, I'd say so."
Was she seeing anybody maybe?
Does she have a boyfriend?
"No, there was this guy she met online, but that didn't pan out."
Why?
What happened?
I don't know.
They never actually met face to face.
"Inhaling it, exhaling it."
"And all of a sudden, boom!"
"Because I was invited to make this record with the Neville Brothers, we were rummaging through a bunch of cassettes."
And we bumped into a whole box of cassettes that were the Meters' rehearsals.
I couldn't hear a word they were saying 'cause I'm Canadian and they're from New Orleans.
"And so, Zig, the drummer, he's trying to describe something to the rest of the band in another language."
No!
"No, man!"
It sounded like some strange Japanese to me.
I always thought from the very beginning that this group were like song stylists.
And that's where we got our peculiar and extraordinary talent meshed together to come and make one whole music!
That's the thing I remember.
Don't mind me.
"I'm crazy, man."
Thank you!
They kind of invented a form for New Orleans...
"That beautiful Meters sound, you know?"
Not getting any cooler in here.
"Hawkins is glistening, man."
Look like a big ol' tray of deli meat left out in the summertime.
Dripping with the juices.
"""Taylor juice."" Au jus."
"Could I have some ""Taylor au jus""?"
"No, I'm all good, dude."
"All right, y'all ready?"
We are rolling.
"One, a-two, a-one, two, three."
"Without a doubt, the hottest performance of our entire career was at Jazz Fest, and I mean that in a meteorological sense 'cause it was fucking hot."
I looked at some of those gospel bands singing in those robes...
God damn!
"I remember being asked to play and thinking, ""God, do we belong there?"""
"I was honored to be asked, because all of the music was so real."
Thank you.
"Eddie got ahold of something, he wouldn't let go."
Eddie Santos was a pit bull.
"Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid."
What was he doing without backup?
It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down.
He'd never had a problem with him before.
"Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him."
It happens.
Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there?
Because it was his collar.
"He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south."
There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless unless interested parties had the judge in their pocket.
Walter Stern is a jurist of national reputation.
I don't care if he's Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Somebody got to him.
And based on that one interview you were able to come to the conclusion stated in your testimony?
"That, and the VA records, yes."
Do you mind passing this on to the judge?
Based on only one interview?
"The defendant has a lengthy, documented case..."
Please answer the question.
- Would you restate the question?
- All right.
Based on that one interview you were able...
Where are you going with this?
"Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant VA record one way our psychologist interprets it another."
So much for expert witnesses.
Let's take a break.
2:30 all right for everybody?
"I see you've already met Peter Ragan, my law clerk."
He's written some of my best opinions.
"Oh, he's such a legend."
"Damn, he's cute."
Not helping.
Sorry.
So what's your problem?
"I'm about to lose a bet with him, not to mention my pride and self-respect, unless I can get my hands on a whale in the next couple of hours."
"Well, that shouldn't be a problem."
You are the number one casino host in Vegas.
Maybe not for long.
What are you talking about?
I've tried everyone.
You've got tons of big-money clients.
No one can get here in time.
"And in the meantime, Logan is driving all of my old clients away, and stealing all of my new ones."
"Oh, and did I happen to mention that he somehow got Harpel to double his usual level of play?"
I just checked with the accountant.
"The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion."
This is a waste of time.
"We should put an omaya reservoir in Foreman's brain and start administering anti... if I'm gonna be arguing with foreman, I may as well do it directly."
"Kernig's sign, negative."
"Brudzinski's sign, single positive."
"Patient joe luria, distal and proximal arm contractures, duration four seconds."
Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
Most commonly?
"You wanna treat me like any other patient, do it."
"But the house I know never uses phrases like ""most commonly."""
You're not laughing anymore.
No.
Think that's a good thing?
Sorta doubt it.
"Staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver, or kidneys before it gets to your brain."
Your organs are clear.
They're organised and they have the numbers.
Little stinkers trying to get into the feeder?
- Morning.
"- Hey, Roy."
This isn't the most glamorous job in the world.
"Look, I appreciate it very much."
"- Yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes."
"- As leaders, we have a choice."
We can sit back and let the same cycle of war continue in the Middle East or we can do something about it.
You know how much money we've spent on the war since 2001?
Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...
"It's gonna be a busy morning, boys."
"--Education, food, health care and infrastructure in the Middle East."
"Now, we've begun historic talks with the republic of Iran's newly elected president, Al-Sharif to build peace throughout his region."
America can't do this alone.
We need the full financial support of all of our allies.
But what we can do is take the first step.
"Therefore, I'm announcing today that all U. S. troops will be removed from the Middle East."
Let's not repeat the same mistakes that we made in the past.
"And Lord knows, I've made some mistakes myself."
"Instead, I ask you to stand with me today."
Sign this treaty.
Let's end this debilitating pattern of violence and let's show the world that the pen is truly mightier than the sword.
Thank you.
President Sawyer delivered what can only be described as a historic speech...
-...earlier today in Geneva.
- Here.
- Let's go live...
- You changed your hair.
Last week.
I'm gonna be late tonight.
You took advantage of an emotional cripple.
I don't believe this.
You took advantage of an emotional cripple.
- That's no better than Vickers.
"- Look, I had no choice."
Klinger came in here all het up.
"Said if I didn't swear him in, he'd drive to ""l"" Corps and find somebody who would."
What's the difference?
All you did was save him a trip.
The difference is that I had a chance to hear those immortal words...
"""I, Maxwell Klinger, do solemnly promise..."
"""that I will faithfully execute the office of Soldier... and will to the best of my ability preserve""..."
"Wait. ""Office of Soldier""?"
That doesn't sound like the oath I took.
That's because you've never been elected president of the U.S. Of A.
- Huh?
- Klinger didn't say exactly what oath he wanted.
"I figured he wouldn't know the difference, and it bought us a little time."
I've overstepped the bounds of common stupidity.
I owe you an apology.
Maybe now you'll realize that olive drab and gray matter... don't necessarily clash.
"Touche, Colonel."
Klinger's gonna be as relieved to hear this as I am.
You mean he's done an about-face again?
He sure has.
He's sitting in his office now thinking he's a prisoner of war.
And you left him alone?
I knew it.
That cuckoo's flown the coop.
And I'm the one who opened the cage for him.
I never should have made him chief executive.
- I'll get on the horn and notify the constabulary.
"""By giving His appearance, he has blessed the three of you."""
"""Sage, you know the past, present future."
"T ellthisboy 'sfuture."""
Not just tell but you have to make his future.
Where do I have the ability to make the future of this son?
"""l just now told you, Lord Shiv himself came as a sage and..."""
...gave you the responsibility of bringing up this boy.
"""As Trishwar, he has also given you the ability to bring you up."""
What should I do now?
-Make the future of this boy who has Lord Shiv's mercy to become glorious
- How?
"""His son, his father left Shiv Pradosh prayer in the middle..."""
...and got into difficulties and this boy is orphaned
"""Since he had Lord Shiv's mercy, he has been brought up."""
But he is still deprived of his kingdom and its comforts.
T ell me the way by which he can get his kingdom back.
Learn the way Shiv Pradosh prayer should be done and...
This boy has to atone for his father's sin.
"""King, you were tired searching for your enemy's son."
"I got him."""
Where is he?
- One brahmin lady Uma is bringing him up along with his son.
Both of them are going to do Shiv Pradosh worship as per the advice of Sage Shandilya.
Dharmagupt will come for the last time to Shiv temple today
He will also die in my hands like his father.
"""Along with enemy's son, his death will come to Shiv's temple"""
Who is my enemy's son amongst them?
How to recognize him.
"""What is this dilemma?"
"T o solve this, I will kill both of them."""
"""Praying Lord Shiv has resulted in your good, sons."""
That enemy had brought two knives to kill both of you.
Please sit down so we can decide this.
"Excuse me, it's news from my department."
I'm not entirely up to date.
The police have salvaged what they thought was the body of Emilie Zeuthen.
He apparently shot a duffel bag rather than Emilie.
"Clearly, we're only talking about material damage."
This is indeed a joyful message.
"So, if no one has any objections, we'll have to conclude that events have overtaken our discussion here."
It's even clearer in this one.
"The perpetrator escaped, and there are no signs that Emilie was in Jutland."
"- The good news is, she may be alive."
- Has Zeuthen been informed?
"Yes, he's at police HQ."
What happened?
We need to speak with Special Branch.
The witness must be taken seriously.
I want to know Ussing's involvement.
He's with Special Branch but there's trouble.
How so?
The police accused Special Branch of keeping information from them in the old case.
Special Branch said they didn't know about it.
I don't know what it's about.
"But regarding the Treasurer, you have every reason to be angry."
I'd just like you to let it slide.
No more trouble now.
Call the head of Special Branch in to explain.
The current took the bag out into the fiord where we found it 12 metres down.
"The umbrella anchor made it sink, in spite of the buoyancy of the other materials."
"The bullets went through bag and contents, and match the calibre used by the perp."
I wish I could answer the questions that this raises but...
She's alive.
"He was traced to Jutland, but there are no signs Emilie was with him."
"Only it wasn't winter, and it wasn't cold."
"And nevertheless, you saw Mr. Norstaad that morning lighting a match to something in that stove, didn't you?"
Yes.
"They made me tell it, Axel."
No further questions.
"Now, Miss Pedersen, since you've described yourself as the whole office force, perhaps you can tell us about the bids."
Bids?
"Oh, you mean for Axel's real estate?"
His shop and trademark.
Yes.
How many bidders were there?
I think there were about 15 bids.
"They were all in writing, by-- by registered mail."
"Now, who looked at those bids?"
"Prior to the granting of the contract, that is."
Mostly just Axel.
Mostly?
Did anyone else see them?
They were always locked in my desk.
Did Axel tell you to show them to anyone else?
Yes.
To Miss Morrow.
"When my men went to look at Norstaad's shop, there was still smoke coming out of the chimney."
"Naturally, they checked further."
I see.
"I show you now this police exhibit and ask you if you can identify it for us, Lieutenant."
It's a scorched bit of material we found in the stove.
"Was this material subjected to laboratory analysis, and if so, what were the results?"
We found a bloodstain on it-- blood of the same type as that of the victim.
"Were you able to discover where this material with the victim's bloodstain on it came from, Lieutenant?"
"Uh, Norstaad, the defendant, had two pair of pants to the suit he was wearing the night Somers was killed."
One pair is now missing.
There are people who prefer to be dead rather than red.
Others prefer rather be red than dead.
"At that time, shake Glucksmann his wild mane style and launches its message:"
"""Nothing about neutron bombs to Fauchon!"""
At last we meet again at the same place.
"Order, discipline, social progress."
Your theory is more close to us than you think.
"- You will see, already in Italy ..."
- To each his theory.
- It is more convenient.
- And nothing against your practice.
- A delightful place on entertainment acchiappaborghesi on the one hand ... and the other sow bombs under the floor of their living rooms.
We are reasonable.
It's better for everyone.
Here we are in the house of a lady.
Remember that this is a living room.
She is not allowed criticize everything and everyone.
Let your children come to me.
"Simon, she has again disturbed my table."
"You are a rude, does not know how to discuss with a fascist."
"Simon, for a man like you, the revolution is the Seagull?"
The Seagull is the truth.
It takes a real scene on the lake.
It gives me the means.
"At the end of the show, open the tanks and finally drown the bourgeois."
"We do not combine anything, help me."
I hunted in a jail.
"I slog,"
I turn the engine the other but not surplus.
The old is good for the circus ...
Aglaé to nail a place in that does not move more it would take me the obelisk of Luxor.
- Marie then ... do not speak.
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
- Of course she bloody does.
- OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."
Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won't work any more.
"Right, Confucius."
I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation.
"It's no secret that in this department, in this police force, there have been sins committed and that's why I'm here."
And why my predecessor's enjoying early retirement.
"Now, I'm sure I come with a... ..with a certain reputation."
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.
It's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I'm doing it.
I want London to be proud of this police force... ..and I'll do anything to help make that happen.
"This is Kayleigh Fenchurch, a former dancer at the Pleasure Palace."
"Yeah, I know who she is but why is she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
"Because she was strangled, too."
"However, unlike Freddie Lau,"
Fenchurch has been buried in Thames silt for at least a week now.
It's impossible to recover any of the killer's DNA.
Lau's casino is less than a mile from the Pleasure Palace.
You think we're looking for the same killer?
I'm just pointing out the similarities in their deaths.
Strangling is not a common MO
- Such a clumsy way to kill someone.
- What?
You have to look them right in the eye for a good three minutes.
You really have to hate them.
Or love them.
- Who's that?
- Big-shot gold bullion dealer called Vincent Lermontov.
Jumped off his penthouse balcony.
"- If you'd like me to stop,Warden..."
"- don't be sensitive,Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'Il have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'Il find out one way or another.
He'Il break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken,Dr.Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.
A prescription straight from the pad of mother goose herself.
"When you're ready to come into the 20th century,please let me know."
Dr.Sengupta.
"Time for the talking cure.Step aside,Milton."
"Yes,ma'am,it's a military medal,all right."
These etching lines?
"They symbolize rays that the Laurel wreath encircles, in the center of which would sit a silver star."
Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea?
"No.He thought he deserved one,though."
"Fired off a lot of angry letters to uncle Sam while he was,you know,in jail."
Got denied every time.
So maybe this is payback.Instead of ball bearings or nails.
Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?
A real one?
"Well,you wouldn't."
"What about,like,Craigslist?"
"Not from a military family I take it,sir."
Silver star is the third-highest combat military decoration.
"If it's not left to the family,most are buried with the soldiers."
The Presidio.
- Graveyard detail.
"- Thank you,sir."
Hey.What the hell are you doing here?
My suspect worked the graveyard detail here at the Presidio from 1952 to '54 during his court-martial.
I'm thinking that's what made the bruise on Vince Nelson's throat.
"So the father was snooping on the son's computer, saw an e-mail from Coach Nelson..."
- Assumed Nelson sent it.
- And confronted him.
"The problem is, in order for Johnny Holt's blood to get on Sheridan' baton, they would have to have contact at some point."
"Right, and that blood is more than three months old, and Holt was still in prison."
Let's check it.
Prison transfer log from Sing Sing.
"Here we go, three months ago Holt was taken from Sing Sing to Manhattan Superior Court."
For one day to testify as a witness in a trial.
There must've been some sort of altercation in that courthouse.
That would explain how Holt's blood got on Sheridan's baton.
"All right, let's go."
"Move it, scumbag."
Time to get a warrant to search Alex Sheridan's house.
Kyle's whole life was wrestling.
He was 14 when he made the team.
That was the happiest day of his life.
"Gave him confidence, discipline, a sense of belonging..."
I wanted to pin a medal on Coach Nelson.
"But when I saw that e-mail, those disgusting photos..."
That knocked the breath right out of me.
I picked up the phone and told him I was going to notify the school the very next morning.
So Nelson came to your house to try to settle things in person.
"Yeah, except all he did was deny it; said he'd never seen the photos, had no idea where they came from."
"See, no one is guilty these days."
Everyone's an innocent victim.
I was not about to let my son become a victim.
I fought back.
So what was I going to do?
Get 25 to life for killing that son of a bitch?
I see these perverts every day.
"- It wasn't sabotage, Kitty."
"Sometimes, bad things just happen."
"Unbeknownst to Chuck, a.k.a. Kitty Pimms  something bad was about to just happen to her."
Did Kentucky talk about colony collapse?
Is it upsetting?
She tends not to tell me upsetting things.
It's when a beehive becomes inhospitable.
"In this case, infested with mites."
All the bees fly away to die.
It's a natural phenomenon.
"Except when a bee company gets bought out by its rival and its star employee dead, then maybe it don't happen so naturally."
"See, Kentucky, she was sabotaging Betty's Bees which took a lot of might, as in effort, and a lot of mites, as in pests."
She was infecting the hives.
Somebody found out and killed her for it.
How do you know she was sabotaging?
She confessed.
Before she died.
Not to us but to a reliable source who wishes to remain anonymous.
Is your reliable source Betty Bee?
- What makes you say that?
- Kentucky was very close with Betty.
They were like sisters until someone asked Kentucky to be the new Betty.
"It must be hard, your wife was killed because of sabotage but at least she wasn't cheating."
"She loved you very, very much."
- And she'd never hurt you.
- She was the only family I ever had.
"You know, that I liked and liked me."
"If I was more comfortable with you people, I'd cry."
- You can cry.
It's okay.
- Thanks.
It is not okay for a grown-ass man to weep in public with a bunch of happy families enjoying pie.
- What are you doing in my pit?
- I'm sorry.
"- Jesus, leave the poor girl alone, Rebecca."
Time for your medication.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Nurse Oaks?
"- I'm sorry, Miss Porter."
The door was supposed to be locked.
"Right this way, please."
I heard you found your way into what the... staff so lovingly calls the pit.
Were you lost?
- No.
I...
I'd heard stories.
It was foolish of me.
I'm sorry.
I was... simply curious.
- Don't apologize for your curiosity.
What'd you think when you were... faced with the reality of the healing process?
- The reality of...
I don't understand.
"- We live in times that are rife with ill mental health, especially among the upper class."
"To be blunt, we are a decadent people."
This leads to a... imbalance as the mind and the flesh... fall out of rhythm with the animal instincts.
"These... women that... prance around as if this were a social club rather than... one of the world's foremost institutions of mental science, they don't want to heal."
We let them parade around in their ridiculous costumes as they live out their lives out of joint with the rest of the world.
"On the other hand, there are some women here who have embraced their own healing."
- The women in... the pit?
- Yes.
That is what true healing looks like.
- It's very different than what I imagined.
Latin is it?
"Yeah, 'pietatis' it's from the old funeral mass."
"'Save me, O source of pity'."
Something like that.
"I didn't think you did that any more, did you?"
"Yes, it must be somebody with a very long memory, or someone who spends a lot of time"
listening to Verdi's Requiem.
"But no, it's not what you'd expect."
From James Barr?
No.
"Tell me something, Father."
What makes you think that James Barr didn't do it?
"You see I can't speak to anyone,"
I can't speak to my officers or any of the witnesses and that includes James Barr.
But I know he talked to you the other night for a long time about all sorts of things.
James knows nothing about the murder.
And he's genuinely appalled that the death of his first wife's being investigated again.
I'd like to know what he said.
Exactly what he said.
"Look, you know I'm trying to help, that doesn't mean I can just go and repeat his confession."
"I can get suspended too, you know."
The other day you were pouring out guilt after someone came in and asked forgiveness because they were going to kill someone.
"Well, maybe, they went out and did just that,"
"I don't know, maybe you should have said something to stop them."
I don't know.
"I'll tell you what I do know,"
James Barr is probably going to go to prison.
"Now if you have a reason why he shouldn't, you'd better decide whether you're going to help me find the truth or not."
Hello Sister Agnes
Hello Father.
"So this is where they park all the old priests, is it?"
"Yeah, before I got to priest college"
"IF I'd had sex with Lindsay Denton, which I didn't, does that stop her being guilty?"
Lindsay Denton has left the building.
Steve Arnott should do the same.
Discreditable conduct.
Steve Arnott did not plant evidence.
But it's OK to have a relationship with a suspect?
"I can see how you feel about this, Ted."
Why defend the indefensible?
"Look, he can be an irritating wee gobshite when he wants to be,"
- I'll give you that.
- I'll tell you why.
Because you personally recruited him from counter-terrorism and that means you having to admit your misjudgment.
"Sorry, Ted, I intend to return to this conversation."
Kate.
"Kate, wait, please."
One time you told me Lindsay Denton had dirt on you.
Remember what I said.
Maybe there are some people who always tell the truth.
- The rest of us choose our moments.
- And that's what I had to do.
To ensure evidence was put in front of a jury that would convict Lindsay
- Denton of a crime we all know she committed.
- But we don't know.
The only person who really knows is Lindsay herself.
We gather the evidence and the people decide and they've decided she didn't do it cos you couldn't keep it in your pants!
- That's not what happened.
- What happened?
It was an undercover operation in which
I nurtured the trust of the target.
That is straight out of the manual and total bollocks.
- You shagged her because you wanted to.
- I didn't shag her.
There are three good reasons for anyone not to like him.
"He has a point, all the same."
- About Tarrant?
- (Chuckling) About the ship.
It was never designed to tangle with Federation cruisers.
"Oh, I'm working on them."
- You are?
- With Orac's help.
These old freighters are fitted with short-burn boosters to help get their payloads into orbit.
Orac is figuring out a way to redesign them to give us extra in-flight speed.
- I thought he was keeping unusually silent.
- Probably sulking.
One of the almost human things about Orac is that it does not like to work.
- Orac.
"- Yes, Avon."
- Any progress with the booster problem?
- There has been no reply yet.
"What do you mean, no reply?"
I passed the programme to computers specialising in engineering design.
- You mean you can't handle it yourself?
- The art of leadership is delegation.
"They'll push out a patrol to check our casualties, so you'll have a chance to catch them in the open for once."
"Now, bait the ground well, and then deploy the rest of the column beyond Post 3."
- Any questions?
"- We'll be in the open, too."
If they send in gunships we'll be cut to pieces.
Take them by surprise.
Hit hard and they'll have no time to call gunships.
"And then you get out again fast, all right?"
- MAN:
Prisoners?
- We don't take prisoners.
"Catchphrase is slightly easier to win than Only Connect, but you can win like 30 grand on Catchphrase, and Only Connect you get like a mug, maybe?"
LAUGHTER
What's Mr Chips doing?
"That's it, right?"
Rather than what's the fucking square root of what Mr Chips is doing?
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
"Jessica, do you think you'd be any good on a quiz?"
I don't even...
I can't even get like basic questions right.
"I sort of panic under pressure like, you know when you're in the opticians?"
"OK, like, ""Is it better WITH, or better WITHOUT?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know!"""
LAUGHTER
"I can't answer, like, basic questions, so, no, too much pressure for me."
"I think people THINK that they can win on a quiz show in the same way people always think they can parallel park, and they're like, ""Yeah I can do this."""
"And then they have a go and then ten minutes and, like, a dead old person later, they're like"
"""A bit harder than it looks!"""
LAUGHTER
What I got from that is you can't parallel park.
"LAUGHTER For shit, mate."
For shit.
"I can't, either."
This is so bad.
It's so hard!
"I had to pick my dad up from the hospital, he was getting his cataracts done, right, and I couldn't parallel park it, and in the end, he got out and did it with no eyes."
LAUGHTER
"So, most people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show."
True or false?
What are you going to say?
"False, I think."
Most people are quite...
He's going to get up.
Leave your man down.
The Kentchurch Bruiser did not come to scratch on time.
"Gentlemen, I authorize the purse holder to hand over his 200 guineas to today's victor, Matt Skelton."
"Killer... well done, sir."
Fantastic fight.
Fantastic fight.
Fantastic fight.
Mr. Gorell Barnes is...
is a very attractive man.
"And he looks fantastic in his Mr. Darcy outfit,"
I have to say... very decorative and elegant.
is very against the idea of men and women just being friends and... and talking to each other a lot.
"And I think, yeah, we're still kind of quite playful, because you need a bit of excitement in the house, because otherwise, it is a bit boring."
You need someone to dress for dinner for.
How wonderful.
Definitely some people didn't even know it was me.
"And then some were, like, ""Is that the countess?"""
"Oh, my God!"
"Is that your real bust, then?"
I couldn't see people's reactions;
I could just hear.
I just don't think they knew what to do with themselves.
"Welcome to Disney, Princess."
"I'm hoping the chaperone reaction isn't too extreme, because of course, it is very bad behavior."
Very seductive.
"Very seductive, isn't she?"
"Ladies and gents, shall we raise our glasses to the countess to drink to, uh... rude food?"
Rude food.
"I think everyone thinks the Regency is a very Jane Austen kind of time and everyone being prim and in bonnets, but then there were certain people who had a lot more fun."
"Oi, oi, I'm watching."
The latest technology arrives at the Regency House.
She has been poisoned and I think I know who did it!
Do not be ridiculous!
You yourself said you would declare war on her!
"I may dislike her clothes, I may mock her,"
"I may hate her for stealing you from me and in the dark of night, I have wished her dead, but I wouldn't go so far as to make her dead."
I'm sorry.
You should be.
"I believe it to be the only option left open to us, Sire."
The only option?
"Sire, Bonn has fallen."
We have received word that William's army has crossed the Rhine.
"If we sue for peace now, at least we will do so from a postion of relative strength."
No.
Give orders for Turenne to bolster his position.
"And the Palatinate, Sire?"
An invasion is imminent!
Our forces are greatly outnumbered.
The army of the Palatinate is too weak to defend itself.
Do whatever is necessary.
"I'm not sure I understand, Sire."
Do whatever is necessary!
"You requested my presence, Sire?"
"Follow me, gentlemen."
"France is sullied by events here at the Palace, by our reverses in Holland."
I want the people of France to see their King and country in a better light.
"Whatever setbacks we may suffer in the war, they will read of nothing but epic victories and I want you to describe them."
trumpet them to the world with every fine phrase and heroic simile at your disposal.
"Sire, if I may..."
"Look around you, gentlemen."
What do you see?
Furniture.
Yes.
I lived.
Everyone else died.
What do you mean?
"Everyone died, Sarah."
I can't believe it's you.
"I thought it was brilliantly done, brilliantly made, brilliantly written."
"I was like ""how incredible is this!"""
"Because she has a completely different regeneration of the Doctor, first off, but she still knew it was him."
"And what is lovely about that bond -- it's not a kind of sexual magnetism, it's a genuine, eternal, loving bond."
Sarah Jane and Rose come face-to-face and Rose realizes that Sarah Jane was kind of one of his first companions and Rose is just one in a long line.
"I always sort of wanted, you know,"
"Sarah Jane and Rose to sort of be friends instantly, you know, but of course not."
"Rose, can I give you a bit of advice?"
I've got a feeling you're about to.
"I know how intense a relationship with the Doctor can be, and I don't want you to feel I'm intruding --"
"I don't feel threatened by you, if that's what you mean."
"Right, good, because I'm not interested in picking up where we left off."
No?
With the big sad eyes and the robot dog -- what else were you doing last night?
I was just saying how hard it was --
"We got the older, smart woman and we got the younger, like, superhot kind of -- also smart woman facing off against each other."
There was definitely some tension.
I had no problem with space stuff.
I saw things you wouldn't believe.
Try me.
Mummies.
I've met ghosts.
Robots.
Lots of robots.
Slitheen.
In Downing Street.
Daleks!
But it was actually something far more sophisticated.
The substance contained a unique neurochemical.
"It infiltrated the captain's synaptic pathways, causing him to reverse imprint on the baby insectoids."
It's the opposite of what happens when a young animal bonds with its mother.
"What, are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things?"
More likely a caretaker.
"Of course, the captain didn't realize this on a conscious level."
"Eventually, he became obsessed with protecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else."
Including our mission.
"I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind."
He'll be ake in few hours.
He should be fully recovered by then.
I want you and your men to return to duty.
"Yes, ma'am."
Not the sort of thing they trained us for at West Point.
I imagine not.
"You could have come to me, explained the situation."
We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the captain.
I probably would have.
Come in.
"I didn't mean to wake you, sir."
It's all right.
I was getting up anyway.
How you feeling?
"Oh, I've been better."
"You sure you had that pistol set to ""stun""?"
Captain...
I hope you understand if there'd been any other way...
"You were protecting our mission, Trip."
I would have done the same thing.
"Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at you, no matter what the circumstances."
"Let's put this behind us, okay?"
- It's not dangerous.
Hanging upside down from a galloping horse isn't dangerous?
"I know, but a lot of girls Georgie's age do it, and the lessons are always highly supervised."
Mm.
"But to my understanding, it wasn't highly supervised the day Georgie broke her arm, was it, Mrs. Morris?"
Where were you when it happened?
"I was in the house with Katie, but Georgie wasn't alone."
She was with her aunt.
"And in fact, I discovered later that her aunt was encouraging her and egging her on, even though Georgie knew it was against house rules;"
that Peter and I would never have condoned it.
"That may be, but the bottom line is..."
"You weren't there to supervise her, were you?"
"Well, I..."
No.
You weren't.
If her aunt hadn't challenged Georgie in the first place...
Mrs. Morris...
"Lou, this interview is standard protocol."
It's necessary for me to understand why these complaints were made.
I think we both know where these complaints have come from.
So why can't we just be upfront about it?
That's against policy.
"Yeah, that's right."
I uh...
I commute back and forth to Vancouver.
"Did you know that while you're gone,"
"Georgie is routinely up at dawn, doing chores in the barn that some would consider hard labour?"
"I'm sorry, hard labour?"
Some foster children are adopted for reasons other than their well-being.
They're thought of sometimes as unpaid household help.
Okay.
Do you wanna tell me where you're going with this?
Let's play Hive Minds.
All the answers are hidden in a hive which looks like this.
"And if the answer to my question was,"
"""What are the names of this week's teams?"""
"you'd be looking for Lutrophiles, that's how you spell it and Pascallywags, and as you can see, answers use adjoining cells, they can go in any direction and no cell is used more than once."
"In round one, as you're looking for answers in the hive, after two seconds letters will start to disappear and as they do, the points go down."
"So the faster you answer, the more you score but be careful, we've set a few traps."
We've laid a few false trails.
"So, Pascallywags, here's your first question, buzz in when you think you've found the answer."
You are looking for a UK motorway service area that shares its name with a 17th-century battle.
Reveal the hive.
"Agincourt... 17th century, never mind."
"Hang on, so... 17th-century battle..."
Nasby?
"Oh, Naseby."
Is that...?
I can see it.
What's your answer?
-Naseby.
-Show me your first letter.
"No, I'm afraid Naseby is a battle but not a service station."
-Oh.
"So I can throw it over to you, Lutrophiles, let's see what you would have been left with."
"For one bonus point, do you know it?"
Edgehill.
I'm afraid not.
"Edgehill is also a battle, not a service station."
I can't think why but your knowledge of service stations just isn't that great!
"The answer was Battle of Sedgemoor, climax of the Monmouth Rebellion, 1685."
The last pitched battle on English soil.
The battle between the Duke of Monmouth and troops loyal to King James II.
"So no points to either of you, I'm afraid."
That's it.
"Perumal, add this to my outstanding credit."
Your credit amount is never settled.
"Sir, won't you enquire about the vehicle driver?"
It's possible only with camera surveillance.
If no one comes in search of them...
We will cross-check with other police stations for 'person missing' cases.
"Or else, we mark it as an unidentified man dead in a hit-and-run incident, and close the case."
Sir.
This is the concept of our program.
"To find out who these unidentified dead people in these accidents are, and to find the culprit behind these incidents."
Congratulations.
You have come to the right place.
You will get all the details that you need.
- Sir.
I'm sure you are going to find it all here.
You are the hero of our program.
- Hey.
I'm already fed up with this job.
Don't irritate me.
Get lost.
Please.
Have some patience.
Such road accidents are very high in number.
Many cases get closed without finding any details about the victim.
As you mentioned...
There is neither the time nor the funds from the Government.
But there will be at least one person bothered about the dead guy.
We have to find that person...
And make sure the information reaches them.
This is the concept of our program.
It has an emotional content.
"- Yes, I know, I know."
- If you watch closely you'll see a young man make a quick change and get out.
"Oh, you're quitting your job."
"That, in substance, is the idea, major."
"Commodore, Sir."
Commodore Jason T. Thatcher.
Commodore it is then.
"If you'll just port your helm and bear slightly windward, I'll slip into these stripes."
I suppose you're going into a better business.
Show business.
Would you call that better?
"No, sir, I would not."
"You are talking, sir, to a man who has given his life's blood to the theater."
There is no business so precarious
- 'so uncertain of rewards.' - 'But think of the fun.'
"My young friend, it's a wretched business at best."
It has nothing to offer a man without capital.
But I can get capital.
"Eh, well, my boy, of course that puts a different face on the matter."
It always does.
"Actually, the theatre offers a splendid opportunity to a man with a small amount of capital."
"Ahem, now, by a strange coincidence, I happen to know of a play that's in production at this very minute in which a man could invest a few dollars and indubitably reap a small fortune."
"Uh, I say, ah, young man."
"Here, here."
"Father, where have you been?"
Have you seen a young man that just changed his pants?
- His pants?
- Yes.
I had him right in the palm of my hand and lost him.
Confound the luck.
But you can see him some other time.
- I've got to find him now.
Songju.
I've already looked into how much property you all have.
Those who give voluntarily and join our cause... will be compensated once we take over Jolbon.
Those who disobey will be audited.
If anyone is found to have accumulated dirty money... his fortune will be confiscated and his family will be killed.
You asked for me?
Sorceress Mauryung.
Yes?
We're preparing for a war with Jolbon.
I want you to hand in everything that belongs to the Shrine.
Your Highness.
"Whatever the circumstance, our property mustn't be touched."
- It's for the gods...
- Be quiet!
I'm trying to save Puyo here because the gods aren't doing anything!
"If you refuse, I'll take it by force."
"It's hard to believe, but it's true."
"Jumong has disappeared, just like that."
It's a pity I don't get to see you cry your heart out... but the pain will be unbearable when reality hits you.
"You asked for me, Your Majesty?"
I realized how loyal you are while examining the ministers' assets.
You've served three Kings yet you barely have enough to eat.
Let me apologize for being hostile towards you.
I should've known better.
We'll get through this together and make Puyo a stronger nation.
The King has bestowed you with silver and food.
"Thank you, Your Majesty, but I can take care of my family."
Don't mind us.
No.
Please accept it.
"I'm more than honored, Your Majesty."
Your Majesty.
Shall I prove it?
There...
You see?
I can even kiss you.
"Like kissing an older brother, if I had one."
An older brother or a childhood friend who solved your math problems when you were at school.
Remember?
"I'm not a schoolgirl anymore, Dimitris!"
Still you have a major problem to solve.
I could help you with it even right now.
No problem is troubling me.
"No, Aliki, it's obvious in your face."
In this melancholy cute face I've been studying for three months now no matter how hard you try not to reveal your secret.
- You're still in love with the artist.
"- No more of that talk, Dimitris!"
Let me finish...
You still love him.
You're worried that you lack the strength not to run back to him.
"That's why you have to make a bold step, to react and secure yourself."
"Marry me, Aliki."
So there are men who can settle for a thing like that?
It's the worst kind of love.
"The desperate kind, Aliki."
I could accept anything so as to have you.
"After that, you'll be my wife."
I know my wife will be honest in her decision for a new life.
"A whole new life, ahead of us."
"Let me think about it, Dimitris."
"On one condition, though."
We'll never talk about the part of my life I spent with someone else.
This is something not belonging to you.
Aliki and Dimitris got married  and the newlyweds left immediately for their honeymoon the schedule of which was combined with Dimitris' business transactions.
I changed my mind.
I don't want the car.
I tell you I don't want it.
I can't afford it.
You two better go on.
You'll be late for the show.
"Yes, we'd better."
"Come on, Ed."
"- Goodbye, Ruth."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Have a nice time.
- Goodbye.
"So long, Frank."
Good Omen was second.
"Hordes of grasping, pushing foreigners who are stealing jobs from American workmen and bread from American homes."
"It is to combat this peril, to preserve and protect standards of living which made American workmen the envy of the world that we, the challengers, have raised our rallying cry, ""America for Americans. """
The problems has got beyond the point where the American workman can cope with it alone.
"He needs guidance, solidarity and expert advise on the subject of protecting his job."
"We, the challengers, are organized to provide that solidarity and advise."
- Pop.
- Ours is an organization...
- Can we listen to Speed Foster?
- No.
Listen to this guy.
He's talking sense.
"It is an organization of which it might be said, ""He who is not with us is against us. """
"The choice, my friends, is a simple one."
"Do you want our red, white and blue flag replaced by the vile banner of anarchy?"
The time has come when we must realize what is going on in this great land of ours.
"When the real, hundred percent American must stop and think."
"How did you like the picture, Ed?"
Yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser or a good solid club.
"Yet the Metron said there would be weapons, if I could find them."
Where?
What kind?
This is the USS Enterprise calling the Metrons.
Our channels are open.
"Come in, please."
We urgently desire a conference.
Please answer.
This may be my last entry.
I am almost exhausted.
"Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned,"
I have very little time left.
"Native sulphur, diamonds."
This place is a mineralogist's dream.
Yet there is something about sulphur.
"Something very old, something..."
If only I could remember.
"The ship, our engines, our weapons."
It's just inconceivable that we are immobilized.
"But it has happened, doctor."
We are the Metrons.
Your captain is losing his battle.
"We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture."
We believe you have very little time left.
"We appeal to you, in the name of civilisation, put a stop to this!"
Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised.
"However, we are not without compassion."
It is possible you may have feelings toward your captain.
"So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring."
If there were only some way we could contact him.
"Yes, indeed, doctor."
- Huh?
Pieces for the left hand.
Of course I've heard of them.
What are you suggesting now?
That I make a career out of a few freak pieces written for one hand?
Not at all.
I won't make any pretense about your physical ability to play concerts.
Not my point.
- Are you familiar with the story behind the Ravel?
"- No, and I don't really--"
It was written for an Austrian concert pianist named Paul Wittgenstein.
He lost his right arm during the First World War.
He embarked on a long search to commission piano works... for the left hand alone.
"Composer after composer turned him down, but he refused to give up."
"Finally, he found Ravel... who, like him, was willing to accept this great challenge."
Don't you see?
Your hand may be stilled... but your gift cannot be silenced if you refuse to let it be.
"""Gift""?"
You keep talking about this damn gift.
"I had a gift, and I exchanged it for some mortar fragments, remember?"
Wrong.
Because the gift does not lie in your hands.
"I have hands, David."
Hands that can make a scalpel sing.
More than anything in my life...
I wanted to play... but I do not have the gift.
I can play the notes... but I cannot make the music.
You've performed Liszt...
"Rachmaninoff, Chopin."
"Even if you never do so again, you've already known a joy... that I will never know as long as I live."
Because the true gift... is in your head... and in your heart and in your soul.
"Now,you can shut it off forever... or you can find new ways to share your gift with the world-- through the baton, the classroom, the pen."
"An evaluation, Mr. Kelowitz."
Where do you think they are?
"If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right."
"I'd make it 1,200 yards."
Azimuth 87.
"It's pretty close for one of these little jewels, captain."
It will be a lot closer to them.
Stand clear.
- Kirk here.
"- Captain, the alien is withdrawing."
"She's at extreme range, but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters."
"Lock on to the alien, Mr. Sulu."
I don't wanna lose her.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Our screens are down.
"We can beam you up now, sir."
I want a search party of 30 medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors.
Notify the Transporter Room.
Lock on to us.
We're beaming up.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Captain's log, supplement."
We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel.
It appears to be headed towards a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.
Can you tell me what happened?
Scanners reported a ship approaching.
We get them now and then.
They're all welcome to use our facilities.
"You know that, sir."
"They came in, space normal speed, using our regular approach run, but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo."
"From then on, we were helpless."
We weren't expecting anything!
This seat is incredibly uncomfortable.
I've got lumbar osteophyte that's digging into my liver.
There'll be blood in my urine tomorrow.
"- Ok, enough with the talking."
"- Enough with the talking,"
Dr. Dismal?
"For your information, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't received a call from you, half out of your mind."
That's why I'm here.
"No, you're here because you have self-esteem issues, so it's comforting for you to be with someone who's so massively dysfunctional."
I hate this man.
"Look, I'm grateful that you came to rescue me."
May I suggest that you write down the name of the town next time?
"Yeah, there's not gonna be a next time."
"So, of course..."
There'll be a next time.
Donald is a mess.
Look at him.
"He's an anal retentive depressive with narcissistic personality disorder manifested by a gross appetite for drugs and alcohol, which he consumes in gargantuan amounts."
But he loves you.
You two are connected.
That's why he called you from the motel.
"You know, every therapist has a patient whom he thinks about long after the session is over, and that patient helps him as much as he is helped by the therapist."
"For him, it's this Michael man."
"For me, it's Dimitri."
He meant to say David.
He's always getting my name wrong.
"No, Dimitri!"
The great boy I've been treating for PTSD.
He was in Afghanistan.
He's a hero.
"Not like you, you drunken murderous bastard."
"Ok, we can just drop him off anywhere along here."
"-There isn't any ""but""."
But...
"Everyone to saloon 6, please."
"Everyone to saloon 6, please."
I suppose it's curved like this.
You mean like this and at the same time also like this.
Well it's grandiose!
This is a revolutionary idea!
And at the same time it's beautiful.
Please follow me to saloon 6.
Fantastic!
And at the end of the symposium I have the honour of showing you the result of the work of our institution.
The first successful samples of synthetic food.
Please.
Fantastic!
It needs some mustard.
-And now I'm inviting you to...
-Sorry?
...a little refreshment.
"Don't worry about it, they don't understand it."
Men.
Do you know how it will lighten the work for us employed women?
Someday in the future all of us will eat this way.
All over the world.
Even before starting the live transmission we have to get you familiar with one interesting thing.
"There's an increasing number of reports, that visitors from distant planets move among us"
The latest report of this sort came to us from Joseph Vanyerka.
He claims that he spotted a spacecraft.
What did it look like?
Can you describe it to us?
Like a dumpster.
"Here you have it dear audience, most of these cases when confronted with clear scientific thinking are revealed as sheer nonsense."
Who is going to give us the money when they want to get rid of the navy altogether?
You don't need to worry about the budget.
High Commander!
I'm very proud of you.
You finally resolved the problem!
Sir!
Now you can go full speed ahead with the construction of the Turtle Ship.
Don't worry about the budget and just get the Turtle Ship built.
Sir!
"Yes, just get it built!"
I'll go around to all the temples in the country and steal their bells if
"I have to, so you just build the ship!"
His Majesty has withdraw his order to abolish the navy!
"You've worked hard o maintain the base, Captain Chung."
The navy is powerless without the cannons.
I'm counting on you.
"If it is an order, I will obey it."
Preserve the navy?
His Majesty has given Yi Soon-shin his hand of support?
That man has go to stop sabotaging the front with his arrogance and guileful tongue!
Perhaps it was not Yi Soon-shin's guile but His Majesty came to a decision on his own that it might be unwise to organize the military to one extreme.
Captain Han!
Are you trying to add insult to injury?
Why do you always take Yi Soon-shin's side?
This is not matter to take sides.
Then do you think that the King is a gullible man that can be played by a servant?
That would be grave impiety.
"If we must fight as a navy, perhaps we should seek counsel of"
High Commander Yi Soon-shin.
What?
Seek counsel?
High Commander Won has everything under control!
"A retinue of staff, distinct soirees, hunting parties... for all the world, the queen holding court."
"I must occupy myself some how, whilst my husband tends you,"
Your Grace.
Then I have some cheerful news for you.
His attentions on me is no longer required.
"All gifts, gratuities and monopolies, shall cease..forthwith, along with his salary."
"You must to live within your means, Lettice."
Cut your cloth.
Though I doubt it would imported now.
"Do you remember those many years ago, when my sister held us at the Tower?"
"Those long nights, hearing the lions roar?"
"The screaming from the rack, the stench of death in our nostrils?"
"Come into my presence again, and I fetch you back!"
Go!
Go!
trounced again!
How does she do it?
"They say that chess is the gymnasium of the mind, My Lord."
Such a mind.
Such a body.
You are indeed heaven sent.
"""My Lord Leicester has taken ill, Your Grace."
He hope that you might attend to him.
How many times has he fallen ill just to get my attention?
How many times have I run to him?
I'm am done with this trickery.
"Tell him to pack his bags, be gone!"
Bess.
Thank God.
"What, no fever?"
Is that beyond your contrivance?
"Your melodramas are always entertaining, My Lord, they light even the dullest day."
Your father and I never had a childhood.
Nothing came easy for us -- ever.
"You're so lucky, Paige."
Mop and bucket are in the basement.
You know who I am?
I do.
Then we can forgo the pleasantries.
This war has gotten very personal for me.
"And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you, too."
I'm listening.
I'm in a lot of trouble because your Soviet foreign minister won't accept that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.
I could lose my job or even go to jail because of it.
"If either of those things happens,"
I'll make sure you go down with me.
"Uh, nothing."
Thank you.
"Before he disappeared,"
Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony about his kidnapping and torture by two KGB illegals.
"The second my punishment is handed down,"
I'll release his classified testimony to the press.
"Now, think of what that will mean for you and your people at the rezidentura -- all those deportations."
Moscow will not be pleased when they have to rebuild their US Operation from scratch.
"As we like to say in America, ""Heads will roll"" -- your head being at the top of the list."
"So... you see, problem is now yoproblem."
"I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad."
"I hoped that one day, we would have the chance to meet face-to-face."
I just wish it was under less trying circumstances.
Good day.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"You are here because the KGB is targeting you, your family, everyone and anyone you care about."
They won't get anything from me.
Jin Pyo and I will be in charged of him.
Stand at attention.
Salute.
You are all indeed worthy experts.
"As soon as possible, you're able to retrieve a group of spies to face North."
Please send us out immediately tomorrow.
Pyongyang is similar to South Korea.
There's no need for us to continue training.
I'm so proud for all of you.
You're doing this for your country.
"I, Choe Eun Chan, no matter what assure you that even though your lives will be at risk, you will be able to complete the mission, and all return safely."
"We'll do this as men, as compatriots, as seniors."
I guarantee that to all of you.
We also guarantee that.
"Their military identity tag is the same as before, no different at all."
Let's see if we can collect the ID tags of the North Korean Army.
You're joining this mission just to collect the enemy's identification tags?
"Starting tomorrow morning, we'll enter Pyongyang to complete the mission."
"We'll gather, on the day after tomorrow, in the morning at Nampo Port."
We'll send a submarine to bring you back.
I hope everybody can return safely.
-= Pyongyang =-
"So, what is the matter?"
We don't have enough military support.
The President didn't approve the plan.
"So, what's to be done with the people who were sent?"
This is a Benedict Andean blueberry wine.
This drink is usually given by the President to entertain guests.
I have to let you taste this.
What?
We should give up now.
We should order them to retreat.
"Father, I do not know where my visions come from."
But he who appears to me day and night speaks to me of God and goodness and calls me to the life of virtue.
How can I not believe him?
Who is responsible for this?
Answer!
"Father, is my foes!"
"Come forth, dark spirit, father of lies, ancient serpent!"
Do not torment!
"We pronounce anathema upon you, we expel you, we curse you, we repudiate your deeds!"
Do not torment!
We prohibit you from this place.
"Get away, dark spirit, destroyer of bliss, criminal and sinful one!"
"Run, banned, humbled shamed, to far-off, arid deserts, to terrible regions, inaccessible to man!"
"And there, hiding and keeping a check on your pride, may you await the terrible day of the last judgment."
Stay in your place.
Hold them down!
"Get away, dark spirit..."
"Are you here, accursed sower of sedition?"
He is here!
"Is it you, spirit from Hell?"
Oh yes.
"Spirit of evil, do you have accomplices?"
He has!
Perhaps in Sister Renata?
"...get away from this cloister and never return, devilish dragon..."
Perhaps in Sister Renata?
Oh yes...
"Devilish spirit, leave this body."
"Away, rapacious wolf."
"Away, venomous scorpion!"
"By the power vested in me from above, I command you:"
Go hence!
Bid ever noise be still.
Peace yet again.
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue shiller than all the music.
"Cry ""Caesar!"""
Speak.
Caesar is turned to hear.
Beware the ides of March.
What man is that?
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Set him before me;
let me see his face.
"Fellow, come from the throng."
Look upon Caesar.
What sayest thou to me now?
Beware the ides of March
He is a dreamer.
Let us leave him.
Pass!
"At its most basic level Julius Caesar is a story, an historical story."
It tells the story about people who existed.
Of course Shakespeare doesn't follow history exactly... he reshapes it for its dramatic ends.
"So one appeal of the play for later ages... has been the sheer narrative of the play... but of course it has also gone on appealing, because people... have found that the play embodies ideas or what we tend to call themes."
"One theme of Julius Caesar if you like, is politics."
It's a play about ruling a country.
"It's a play about usurpation, about dictatorship... about the fact that in politics somebody may... assume so much power that it begins to corrupt them."
Now this is a universal theme... we have found it all over our century...
"Romania, Germany, Russia... even one might suggest in England."
"The corruption of politics is a frequent theme... and it is very much present in this play, I think."
Will you go see the order of the course?
- Not I.
"- I pray you, do."
Captain Glover has put up the purse money for the Kentchurch Bruiser.
I'm going to put you through your paces this morning.
"You're fighting tomorrow, so I take it that what we do today shouldn't be too strenuous."
"There's been a challenge from another part of the land laid down, so it's a matter of pride and honor."
"You know, you want your local guy to win, so we're investing time and money in his training to make sure he's in peak condition to ensure victory."
Stand still.
"Since the beginning,"
Tim Dean has been a gentlemen's personal trainer.
He has subjected them to a punishing regime.
"Now Captain Glover is funding the Kentchurch Bruiser, he's turning the tables on his instructor."
"I want you to run across there, pick up a shovelful of horse manure and deposit it here."
"Knees up, knees up."
Stand in front of you.
Deposit.
Good.
"Knees up, knees up, knees up."
"Excellent, excellent."
"30 stones, 30 yards, in the barrel as quickly as you can."
Go!
"This is good for your wind, Mr. Dean."
"How are you feeling, Mr. Dean?"
"Is that what I think it is, sir?"
One aspect of their training is particularly grueling.
"What are you trying to do, make us sick or something?"
Purging the body with an emetic to induce vomiting.
Now Tim Dean gets a taste of his own medicine.
How do you feel?
Do you mind if we stand back?
And maybe tell you what was in the drink.
Just orange juice.
Do you think I'd make you feel sick before a match?
Breakfast.
I could... systematically and completely destroy all the Jews.
"If my role as great conqueror had ended, a new part beckoned--"
"""The Great Destroyer."""
I would be the architect of the greatest catastrophe of all time.
"That's how I would be remembered, gain my immortality."
Destroy all
Jews.
My God... this is powerful writing.
Like a blossom on a tree in spring.
Add this note.
"""The seeds of this obsession were sowed long ago and now sprang forth from the black soil of war."""
"( under his breath ) Or should I say,"
"""the black soil of defeat."""
Isn't defeat what you mean?
Wait a minute.
Something's out of order.
Before the defeats-- l'm trying to remember...
The SS death squads eliminated hundreds and thousands of Jews and communists in the course of the invasion of Russia.
"Well, of course that was mostly a military security operation issue."
It was so long ago!
So much has happened!
"I declared war on the United States on the 11th of December, one week after the first setbacks in Russia."
I was desperate to transcend the agony.
To appear strong!
"Maybe I need to say, uh..."
"""Men may see my actions as atrocities of epic proportion, I saw them as a way to relieve tension."""
"Or maybe we should say, um..."
"""ln a mere fortnight, I sealed Germany's military and moral fate."""
Or...
I...
Let's just leave it the way it is.
I devoured past and future.
Miyo got sick from eating bad candy.
"The doctor said that if it's disentery, she could die."
Why did you let her eat that candy?
I made some money by selling old magazines and I bought the candies she wanted so much!
Money's needed for that.
"We will find It, don't worry."
"Go call a taxi, quickly."
And you get everything ready.
"She's improving, do not worry."
"Now I feel calmer, we can return home."
How will we pay the hospital?
"Children recover quickly, all was as before."
We no longer have anything in the closet!
But Miyo is in a far better condition.
How the world has changed!
Making do With whatever comes our way!
We've been in a difficult plight.
Have you also come to look for work?
I heard you left the university 24 years ago.
"After the university, I worked as a professor in the radio."
"and 1 or 2 months ago, I opened a western restaurant."
"If you're looking for work, why don't you come work for a season with me?"
What?
To work in a restaurant?
"If you help me with the restaurant, I will help find a job for you."
Thus is the shared fate of a pair well known in the Ministry of Education.
"If you offered me this out of pity for my poverty, I would be offended."
"However, being an old student of yours, I accept."
"I did not want to seem disagreeable, but when one becomes poor, a man also becomes sensitive."
I met Mr. Ryojima at the employment office.
He will help us with the restaurant.
"Please, see that Mr. Ryojima is comfortable here."
"I, too, believe it's illusions about love and the emphasis on sex that separate people today."
"As you said, romance is a myth, a manipulation."
I was referring to academic opinions that are purely subjective.
You were right!
Relationships that are based on romantic love are worthless.
"There's no point to them, they have no value."
Did you stay for my whole class?
I left when you were talking about the music we hear when lovers kiss in the movies.
It is manipulative!
"In real life, we don't hear music when we kiss."
And the person you're with isn't a movie star.
It's a malicious...
Fantasy?
Is it all right if I sit down for a minute?
The addiction to beauty and perfection created by advertising feeds on people's pathetic desires.
They don't have their own opinions anymore.
The media tells us what's beautiful and what's not.
TV shows tell us what a relationship is supposed to be like.
And sex!
- I don't even want to tell you how that's ruined my life...
"- Oh, no."
Go ahead.
Tell me.
"- Well, I go crazy."
- Really?
Yeah?
"When I want someone sexually, I go out of my mind."
Do you remember that movie where the woman kills the bunny?
- Fatal Attraction?
"- Granted, it was a film."
I can understand what she went through.
Not that I would kill an animal.
"Yes, I did it."
I wanted to make sure these were cross-the-board trends.
"I wanted to make sure if they were pre-featured, they would come."
But you want to know why I did it?
Because I love fashion.
"Fashion is my life, or at least... a good portion of my day."
"My dream is that every man, woman and child in America... will learn to spell ""Ferragamo"" and... the 5-year-olds would learn to play hopscotch on simplicity patterns... that words like poliester, leisure suit and house dress... were stricken from our vocabularies."
"If that's my crime, I'm proud that I did it."
And if I have to go to jail... so be it.
As long as I can take my wardrobe with me.
Officer... go cuff me.
Your trend-making days are over.
You can share your precious fashion advice... with the bitches in the slammer.
I can't wait to tell the girls in my cell block...
"""Yes!"
"You can make stripes with floral!"""
They'll be so happy!
"People, people!"
I have something to say.
"This has been a monumental day, marking the end... of a bitter and tragic era that cast upon... our very headquarters."
The Yuri has been aprehended!
"And it's thanks to a brilliant counter-espionage... by a very industrious, pro-active intern."
So let's raise our booth recall to Jocelyn.
- To Jocelyn!
- To Jocelyn!
- Bravo!
Good eye!
- Good girl!
And I have more good news:
Jocelyn is my meeting assistant... she's on staff...
- and she's our newest little Skirt.
- Congratulations!
that he'd been out to Lita's and he'd killed her.
Maybe Sandy had provocation for what he did to Lita.
"The police have check out his story, you know."
He was seen drinking in a Hollywood bar just before--
"Well, it's not specifically against the law to try to kill someone who's already dead."
"Perry, you're making excuses for Sandy."
Why?
To find out why you've made so many.
Not ever again.
"Oh, Perry, I do need my old friends back."
[sobbing]
"[Hamilton Burger] And what did the defendant then say to you when you told her that her husband was busy in the office of the deceased, Lita Krail?"
"Well, she said, ""That little alley cat,"""
and-- and then another word that I really didn't listen to.
"I mean, everybody already knew how much they hated each other ever since Lita was given Beth's job."
- [Mason] Objection.
- Sustained.
"Now Miss Adams, let's skip to later that day, shall we?"
"To that night, as a matter of fact."
Did you have occasion to contact the deceased then?
Yes I did.
"You see, I got this crazy call from Sand-- Mr. Sandover-- about money deposits and money in the office."
"Well, I got home from my date and I figured I'd better call Lita and tell her about Sandy's call."
- So you actually phoned Lita's house?
- At 11:15.
Then she said she was too busy to talk.
"And then I heard another voice-- hers, the defendant's-- saying, ""Hang up that phone."""
"Then Lita says, ""I'm giving the orders around here, dear."""
"And, ""Oh, no you're not,"" says Beth."
And there's a real loud scuffle noise and bam goes the receiver right in my ear.
"[Burger] That will be all, Miss Adams."
- Counselor?
Door number one?
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.
"All right, now, the game show host, who, by the way, knows what's behind all the other doors, decides to open another door."
Let's say he chooses door number three.
Behind which sits a goat.
Now...
"Ben, game show host comes up to you."
"He says, ""Ben, do you want to stay with door number one"
"""or go with door number two?"""
"Now, is it in your interest to switch your choice?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, wait."
"Remember, the host knows where the car is so how do you know he's not playing a trick on you?"
Trying to use reverse psychology to get you to pick a goat?
"Well, I wouldn't really care."
"I mean, my answer's based on statistics."
Based on variable change.
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.
"Yeah, which changed everything."
Enlighten us.
"Well, when I was originally asked to choose a door,"
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.
"But after he opens one of the doors and then re-offers me the choice, it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch."
"So, yeah, I'll take door number two, and thank you for that extra 33.3%."
Exactly.
"People, remember, if you don't know which door to open, always account for variable change."
"Now, see, most people wouldn't take the switch out of paranoia, fear, emotions."
"But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside and let simple math get his ass into a brand-new car!"
Which is better than that goat you've been driving around campus.
"All right, everybody."
"Well, but it was somehow... without rhythm..."
"You probably don't need any special talent for that, just to shake yourself somehow."
Look into my eyes.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Not yet.
Have you?
"A boy, I mean?"
"- My cousin, too."
- Cousin?
And have you thought about kissing a girl?
Don't you even want to kiss?
What would be so terrible about it if I kissed her?
"I'm just asking, that's all."
"Of course I'm interested, now we're talking, where our children were and what they were doing, but I'm not sure why you came."
"Just so I can respond, because I don't yet know whether you were glad that our Marcel was with your daughter."
I can't somehow make it out.
That would tell me the point of your visit and our talk.
"- Just for information, of course."
"- Okay, for information... I'd a feeling Marcel is straying from the straight and narrow."
I'm imagining that you kissed me.
- You're going too far.
- l'm not!
"If you want to see something bad, the most innocent things can seem so, but let's try trusting our children."
What do you say?
"Children should be trusted, so far we have, so I think..."
We trust them too.
"Interesting, the girl's only here a week and we have a problem."
There were so many girls there and he never...
"D'you remember, when Marcel got up to something in school, they punished him by sitting him next to a girl."
For him it was the worst punishment.
But that was a long time ago.
If ever henceforth thou hoop his body more with thy embraces
I will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender to't.
O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three.
"O cursed wretch, thou knew'st this was the prince."
Undone!
Undone!
"Camille, not for Bohemia will I break my oath to this fair beloved"
This may you know and so deliver
I am put to sea with her whom here I cannot hold on shore.
- I have a vessel rides fast by.
"- This is desperate, sir."
Have you thought on a place whereto you'll go?
- Not any yet.
- Then list to me.
Make for Sicilia and there present yourself and your fair princess for Leontes.
We'll males an instrument of this.
"- How now, good fellow?"
"- I am a poor fellow, sir."
"Why, be so still, yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange"
Therefore disease thee instantly and change garments with this gentleman
There's some boot.
What I do next shall be to tell the King of this pa to force him after.
There is no other way but to tell the King she's a changeling
And none of your ﬂesh and blood.
"I will tell the King all, every word"
"Yea, and his son's pranks, too"
There is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard.
"How now, rustics!"
Whither are you bound?
"To the pala, an it like your worship."
What's i' the fardel?
We don't know how far away their ships are.
"If we send that message, we'll be taking a hell of a risk."
We can't afford to play it safe anymore.
This mission's too important.
This mission is to save Earth... not an alien hatchery.
"Captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days."
You've shown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia.
If it'll make the two of you feel better...
I'll go to Sickbay for a complete physical...
-as soon as that reactor's online.
"-That's not good enough, sir."
Phlox has the authority to order you to Sickbay.
"T'Pol is manipulating you, isn't she?"
"If I'm declared unfit for duty, then she takes over."
"Captain, if you won't come with me..."
"I'll be required under Starfleet Order 104, Section C... to relieve you of command."
I expected something like this from her... but not from the two of you.
Corporal.
I've already confined two senior officers today.
PHLOX:
His neurochemistry appears normal.
There's nothing wrong with him?
This scan is hardly conclusive.
I'll need to get him into the imaging chamber... and run a complete neurological series.
When Hoshi sends that distress call... every Xindi ship that picks it up will start heading this way.
"He's got Hayes on the Bridge, macos posted all over the ship."
"Whatever we do, we're going to have to do it fast."
"What are you proposing, Commander?"
I think it's time we throw the rule book out the window.
[Eggs rustling]
Captain.
MACO:
And that worked.
We all believed that Dortmunn had escaped.
But whoever did it must have known the body would be discovered sooner or later.
Of course.
He was playing for time.
The plan had gone to pieces.
The best the killer could hope for was to delay a full inquiry for as long as possible.
"As a matter of fact, I think that was a waste of effort."
"I know, we all know, that one of you is the murderer."
But proving which one.
"Unless, of course, as seems quite likely, someone other than the murderer already knows."
Already knows.
"Naturally, the whole matter will be put into the hands of the authorities when we reach Destiny."
"Despite what you say Avon, the murderer will be found."
"In the meantime, you will all resume your normal duties, and anything that you see or hear that seems unusual, report to me at once."
Thank you.
We'll get back to the repairs now.
"A couple of hours, you should be able to set off for home."
"Something you wanted, Grovane?"
Yes.
It just occurred to me.
You said one of us was the murderer.
That's right.
- There is another possibility.
- Yes?
"There could be somebody else on the ship, somebody we don't know about, a stowaway."
Detectors indicate a meteorite storm directly in Liberator's flight path.
Scale and intensity?
Scale nine.
Intensity twenty seven.
Twenty seven?
I think eight's about the strongest we've had so far.
"Hi, Pigby."
"For lonely tourist Charlotte Charles, a.k.a. Chuck  home was where the Pie-Maker was."
"And this home was a place  the Pie Maker's father, who abandoned him, would return to  even if the Pie-Maker never knew he was there."
Previously on Greek
- Are we in the wrong house?
- I'm Lizzi.
I'm gonna be here until ZBZ National determines that you girls are back on the straight narrow.
I could be anchored down here a while.
"It sucks we have to follow these new rules, but I'm fully confident,"
- that we can still have fun.
"- It is our mission, to execute some of the most ass-kicking, rule-bending parties that this campus has ever seen."
Did you see anyone from school over break?
- Just a fling.
- Fling-tastic!
"I just want you to consider giving Omega Chi another chance,"
- we might surprise you.
- A gay frat guy is just weird.
The greek social calendar will now be much less crowded.
I'll be watching you.
Excuse me.
This is so freaking stupid.
"I don't know who to kill first, Lizzi or myself."
Sorry.
That was a tod louder than I anticipated.
5 minutes and not a single one of you completed a full rotation.
That's disappointing.
Rush group A front in center.
"Speed spot, speed spot!"
"As rush group A, you represent the top conversationalists of this house."
I expect you to set an example for rush groups B through F.
"A rush rotation group should run like a well-oiled machine, so we can keep that potential sisters focused right here, on you, on ZBZ."
Monday night is movie night.
Maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of this mission.
The senior officers do have other duties.
We can't all spend our time playing holographic games in the Armoury.
I'm not sure that's how the Captain would see it.
HOSHI: [On radio] Enterprise to Shuttlepod 2.
You're clear to approach.
Acknowledged.
Deploy the docking arm.
[Door beeps]
Come in.
I think we figured out what happened to them.
TRIP:
One of the nacelles fractured... while they were coming out of a subspace vortex.
They probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet.
"According to Phlox, the Insectoids we found weren't killed in the crash... they suffocated?"
Most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred... their life support to the hatchery.
They sacrificed themselves to save their children.
You said the hatchery is losing bio-support.
How long will it last?
"Another day, at most."
I want you to assign a team to repair it.
-Captain?
-What about Azati Prime?
It's not going anywhere.
This is a sentient species.
We can't abandon them.
"Captain, with all due respect, why the hell not?"
I've got half a mind to take a plasma torch to that place.
What if we found a nursery filled with 31 infant Primates?
Would you want to torch them?
ARCHER:
you made a mistake..
and we get the punishment.
when we heared the fire shot
plan was good.
just needed two things
a evidence who can tell that when fire shot the time you were'nt there.
If you've finished your storyx
but I think...its not your house.
its tisha's house.
and I think tisha is not alive what do you think..
only you can fool people tisha is alive.
If you people would have the proof of it so... we have it.
your finger prints
listen to me lf the key was in the door.
So how come your finger prints sticked on the center barrel lf you've twisted the key only as you said now.
so you finger prints would not been sticked there.
You're the mastermind of the game put down your pistol
if I'd have the pistol so you'd not be alive that time
If i'd not seen those pictures
So I'd never get to know that you and kabir are twince and people says that the twince can't have twince baby
adult should not do some work in front of kids.
they can be bad affected
How come you got in doubt that the sound was not of gun fire.
I'm alergic to gun powder
Specially the crackers
It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
It's probably for the best.
"For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
"Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight."
Yay.
Well?
What would your gracious figure?
"Alas, he's mad!"
"Do you not come your tardy son to chide... that, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by..."
Th' important acting of your dread command?
"- O, say!"
- Do not forget.
This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
"But look, amazement on thy mother sits."
"O, step between her and her fighting soul."
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her.
"- Ho is't with you, Lady?"
- How is't with you...
That you do bend your eye on vacancy...
And with th' incorporal air do hold discourse?
- Whereon do you look?
"- On him, on him."
Look you how pale he glares.
"His form and cause conjoined... preaching to stones, would make them capable."
"Do not look at me, lest with this piteous action you convert..."
My stern effects; then what I have to do will want true colour...
- tears perchance for blood.
- o whom do you speak this?
- Do you see nothing there?
- Nothing at all; yet all that I see.
- Nor did you nothing hear?
"- No, nothing but ourselves."
Look how it steals away.
"My father, in his habit as he lived."
"Look, even now as the leaves out the portal."
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in.
What do you mean by kasumiba and dannaba?
"Well, in the past, the places where these religions were practiced was strictly assigned."
"Every year, they would pass out their almanac and charms."
They would also call for their people to stay at the temple so they can receive teachings.
I see...
Thank you for what you told me today.
We have study groups every so often.
"If you are interested, you can come to them."
Thank you.
I will show Saho-san off and go home.
Okay.
I still have business to attend to here.
Eat dinner without me.
Good bye.
Is Saho-san possessed with that smoke?
I think that is from something else.
Really?
"Ever since then, I meet up with Saho-san every so often."
It has been really foggy lately.
"Yeah, but I like fog and mist."
I thought so.
"Hibara-san, have you ever heard of The Letters of The Marquis de Selvigne?"
"No, I haven't."
It is a book of letters that were written at the end of the 17th century in France.
"In the book, there is a story of the execution of a marchioness... who was infamous as being a noble that killed using poison."
Execution?
Yeah.
"In the town where she was executed, that marchioness' body was thrown into a fire and her ashes were spread upon the wind."
Those ashes moved about in the air like this fog.
The people there were worried because they were breathing in that marchioness.
They thought that maybe they would turn into murderers as well.
I would have never seen it like that.
He said that I paid him three million won a week?
It wasn't three million won per week.
It was three million won per month.
Please think about it.
In that raggedy office... we have three employees.
Do I look insane to you?
How could I give him three million won a week?
The rest of the money must be from...
Baek Shi Yoon.
You probably knew it from the start.
Im Tae Ho's obsession with money.
Why would I take money from Baek Shi Yoon for no reason?
"I was paid in cash, so there's no evidence, which is why he's able to lie."
He uses psychological warfare to appeal to the emotion inside all of you.
That's the kind of work Baek Shi Yoon always did with the agency.
He probably did the same to Im Tae Ho.
Park Seon Woo asked me to bring Lawyer Jo's computer out of the station.
"Park Seon Woo came to the police station, and with the equipment in his trunk he erased all of the data on the hard drives."
"So I went all the way to the police station, with my specialized equipment and erased the hard drives?"
"If it were you, Mr. President... would you be able to do something like that in front of the station doors?"
Shi Yoon... just wanted to know the truth about the mission from three years ago.
And I'm sure there were some people who didn't want the truth to be leaked.
The Baek Shi Yoon of three years ago caused a lot of harm.
He caused the death of his own colleague.
Baek Shi Yoon would want that truth to be covered up forever.
"So, then..."
Who is the murderer?
"If you give me some time, I promise you that I will find out."
"Thinking about it, putting all of the pieces together..."
I wonder if Im Tae Ho is the murderer.
"Okay, then."
We have two very contradictory statements...
Read that part right there.
"It says here Patrick told authorities he got through the assault by focusing on sand."""
His attacker made him stare at an hourglass while the abuse went on.
"He was told that if he didn't cry until all the sand emptied out, he wouldn't be killed."
So the trauma of the assault was fused with the image of an hourglass.
"And launched an obsession with time, so much so that he went on to build devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision."
And the police report says he was abducted on a Thursday night at 10:00 and was found released in a park the next morning at 9:00.
11 hours later.
That's what he meant with Ellie Zumwalt.
He was telling her the amount of time that he himself had been held in captivity.
And that may be Josie Zumwalt's timeline.
"So the clock is on Ellie, not Josie."
She's got 11 hours to give this unsub what he didn't get from his own mother.
"Josie was taken at 4:30 this morning, which means we have until 3:30 this afternoon."
"JJ, are you still at the hospital?"
Good.
Here's what I need you to do.
An apology?
We can do it from here.
"This room, one cameraman, no reporters."
I don't understand.
The man who took your daughter left you alive intentionally.
But...
But why?
Because he needs to hear you express how sorry you are for what happened.
But it wasn't my fault.
Josie knows that I didn't--
I know.
You're not apologizing to Josie.
"In fact, don't ever mention her name."
Just refer to her as your child.
Don't even say daughter.
"Dang-po, then what?"
"12 ships in Sa-chun, 30 ships in Dang-po?"
Then what?
"We could be up against 50, no, 100 ships."
But our troops will grow tired and we will soon run of out food supply.
We can't do this alone.
It's just not possible.
But we cannot turn our backs on the people and leave.
Think about the torture they will be subjected to.
We must break the enemy's will.
We must defeat them all the way.
We must show them that any attempt to avenge their defeat on the civilians will have disastrous results.
That is the will of the High Commander.
"It is also the reason why this navy, no, the entire military force of Chosun, exists."
I don't intend to defy his command.
I believe it mustn't be defied.
High Commander...
You're...
"Garrison Captain of Nok-do Chung Oon, sir."
What brings you here at this late hour?
I have something to give.
"you, High Commander"
"I engraved the words ""Extreme Loyalty to Repay the Kingdom"" and never let it out of my hands since the day I was sworn into service."
"""Extreme Loyalty to Repay the Kingdom""..."
It's Ngok Fei.
A resolve never to retreat from battle like Ngok Fei?
It is no wonder you are the best assault team commander of Chosun.
"But... by giving me your sword, do you wish to come under my command?"
Slay the enemy with that sword.
That's what I've come to request.
Why are you reluctant to collaborate with the Left Cholla Navy?
Do you perhaps think my superior an inferior man who seeks honor and advancement by stealing credit for his comrade's achievements?
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
"Katherine, when you send a broadcast you're sending out these numbers to the agents in the field to deliver specific assignments they cannot trust to normal communication lines."
Do you know what that means?
Fifteen broadcasts.
Fifteen assignments.
Unauthorized.
"Assassinations, bombings."
Could be anything.
Murders?
Gonna fix it.
"Here, what does it say?"
Can't read that.
"Agents in the field carry, like, one-time notebooks, like pads."
Each page is a new cypher.
"When you broadcast something, the agent matches up the first set of numbers to the page in the notebook."
"Now he knows he's using this page, and this page only, to decode the message."
"When he's done, he destroys the page."
So we send another broadcast to cancel this one.
Every cypher's a one-time deal.
Totally random.
Completely impossible to crack the code unless you have the original cypher.
That changes with every shift.
So we need the cypher?
"Yes, we need that cypher."
"As much as it seems like we're here to hurt you, to kill you, I assure you, both of you, that's the worst-case scenario."
Must have left the computer running.
- It doesn't scare me.
- Shut the fuck up!
Back off!
Please.
Let me rephrase that.
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
I ate the salt of your father.
I cannot bear when something is going wrong.
I understood it all madam.
- What Karthik?
They look like wife and husband looking at the body language.
"When this sadistic husband is torturing that soft wife, sir seems to be pacifying them."
Expression in the face does not look so.
He is a sadist and not an artist to give the expression you expect.
Correct!
The happiness in the face for sadist when torturing is seen like torch is put on his face.
"Exactly, I remember it now."
"When I went to the hospital as a friend was not well, this couple was seen."
"When he was torturing his wife linking with the Compounder,"
I had pacified them saying wife is like a Goddess.
Such should not be told but are to be slippered.
"Sir, RP sir is on the video conference from Malaysia."
"You relax, I'll take this conference call and come."
"For the family, sir is given the clarification."
What about for the public madam?
"Mr Ratnam, who would care about such silly news coming in the yellow magazines?"
"Madam, we are calling from ABN."
Will you raise voice against the illegal relation of your husband or support him?
Stop it!
That is all fake news.
Don't spread the rumors being a responsible channel.
Please..
"Madam, we are doing half an hour show Wife at home and lover at the hospital."
"We will cover you for 20 minutes, if you come to our studio."
That's all trash.
Who are you?
From N TV?
"- No sir, from TV5."
Yeah.
"You are here because the KGB is targeting you, your family, everyone and anyone you care about."
They won't get anything from me.
They are masters at exploiting weakness.
We all have weaknesses.
We all do.
And they will find yours.
What do you need me to do?
"We're gonna go through your file and go over all the parts of your life that make you the most vulnerable to them -- financially, emotionally, sexually."
"No, no, no."
I-I'm not at all comfortable with this.
"Well, it's not my first choice, either, but I'm going to need you to tell me things -- secrets that you might not have told anyone else."
Because that is where their power lies -- in secrets.
"If they can keep you afraid and ashamed, then they can keep you silent."
"And if they can keep you silent, they can control you."
Have you ever been engaged to be married?
No.
And how many close friends would you say you have?
Few.
Not many.
Could you be more specific?
"Uh, two, I think."
"Um, you never really know enough about people, though."
"So, are you -- are you gonna say that because I'm a loner, I'm more vulnerable?"
"Look, I'm not sure how they will approach you, but I am sure that they will."
All right.
"But let me assure you, Agent Beeman --"
I would never betray my country.
No one ever imagines they will.
Riggs and Dubrow -- What happened?
Official story -- truck flipped in training.
"But nobody can know about that base, so who knows what really happened?"
"There would seem to be a coffin inside the tomb, Monsieur Carter."
You looking forward to seeing what's inside?
Yes and no.
I wish people would stop interfering.
They just...
"Well, they just get in the way, don't they?"
I know what you mean.
"Sometimes it's hard to keep in mind what we're all here for, isn't it?"
No.
I know exactly why I'm here.
I never forget it for a second.
"And why do you think that is, then?"
"I want to find him, Arthur."
I want to know who he was.
I want to talk to him.
"Well, you may well find him."
"But at the end of it, all he will be is a mummy."
"He's not going to talk to you, is he?"
And if I can also ask you to be careful on the steps into the tomb.
They are very steep.
Ibrahim.
"This letter is for you, Mr Carter."
"Gentlemen, I have an announcement to make."
Today I was forbidden by letter from Monsieur Lacau from escorting friends and wives of my team into the tomb to show them the sarcophagus.
This follows a number of discourtesies shown by the Egyptian Public Works Department and its Antiquities Service.
The level of interference is now intolerable and shows a total lack of respect for the late Lord Carnarvon and his extraordinary generosity and affection for this country over the last 10 years.
"As a protest, myself and my collaborators refuse to continue our work in the tomb until such impossible restrictions have been removed."
That's all I have to say.
I've been asked to go and lecture in America.
You'll like it there.
They'll treat you like a king.
(Coughing)
He didn't even listen to you.
You can't let him ignore you like this.
Contempt for you is contempt for the King.
He could be charged with treason right now.
Be patient.
Sir...
We will wait until the agreed date.
We can take necessary action thereafter.
Will the emissary be able to hold Yi Soon-shin back?
It is unlikely.
"But if he defies the emissary, he will be defying the King."
He might yield this time if he remembers what happened to him last time.
Not Yi Soon-shin.
He never compromises what he believes to be righteousness.
Should I call him naive or should I call him foolish?
"He may know war, but he doesn't know a thing about politics."
"But if he knew anything about politics, he couldn't have turned this war around."
And that's also the reason why people flock around him.
"Are you praising the man, Lord Yoon?"
Of course not.
"I know your concerns, Royal Attendant."
The ignorant people's blind support for Yi Soon-shin evolving into political power and creating state of extreme chaos...
I do not want that.
That is why we sent the emissary.
Be patient.
He will soon give us a justifiable reason to suppress Yi Soon-shin.
Two small Japanese vessels are slipping away.
"Admiral, they're Konishi's messenger boats!"
"If we don't stop them, we could be attacked from both sides."
What's happening?
It's the Japanese.
They have launched their messenger boats.
"What do you mean, ""right now""?"
"I mean, like, right now, while we're doing this, somebody else is in the system, and they are wiping pixels."
"They're going backwards, just like we are."
"Okay, okay, all right."
Relax.
Go back to the toll booths.
"Anybody can peep and creep, but to delete?"
"I mean, this is somebody with some serious access."
"Yeah, ""somebody."""
We got a killer happening to know DeBray was headed back to the police station.
That and magical disappearing evidence...
"Yes, it's about the police."
But it's also about Serena.
You want to walk me through that?
"Whoever killed Serena pretended to be DeBray when he called in to my show, to throw everyone off."
Are you with me?
So far.
"So how did he know that a proud serial killer wouldn't just pop up and say, ""That wasn't me"""
and ruin his plan?
It's a bit of a leap that a proud serial killer would do that.
"Yes, but it's a possibility."
So what's the real killer's only way to be 100% sure that wasn't gonna happen?
Kill Haskell DeBray.
And what happened to Haskell DeBray the first time?
"Killed in a hitandrun, five days before Serena was killed."
We don't know if that was murder.
"Either way, he told no tales."
Okay.
"So, either you're drinking the opiumlaced KoolAid, or the guy that shot Haskell DeBray also wants to... kill Serena."
And the only leads we have are a blurry video and your theory.
"That somewhere out there, there's a cop who knows what's under that helmet."
We got to go to someone who can find that cop.
He had some Scots to slaughter.
The Comyn family and their many supporters were still loyal to the Balliol claim.
There was only one thing to do with such opposition...
Kill it!
"He left the borders to his increasingly trusted lieutenant, James Douglas."
"Himself, he marched north, accompanied by his brother Edward."
The Bruce's campaign gathered momentum as he moved up the Great Glen.
"His forces were never large, although by now they had a reputation."
His tactics were thorough and unpleasant.
He reduced one Comyn castle after another.
He reduced them to rubble.
He killed the occupants.
He burnt Nairn to the ground.
"A ruined castle, after all, was no use to the Comyns, no use to the English if they returned and no use to a king who had settled on a strategy - hit and run."
"Right now, the Bruce had no use for castles."
Castles meant you couldn't move.
"So, burn the castle, fill the well, move on."
It took him just two months.
"By November, he was in the north-east, his forces now joined by those of the Bishop of Moray."
"Another man of war, Bishop Moray."
The vestments were just for weekends.
And then...
The King is ill!
"The Bruce's illness was nameless, mysterious."
It left him weak as a kitten.
"There was no medicine to hand, no doctor."
He grew steadily weaker as the days passed.
The King is dying.
It was winter.
The army was perilously close to running out of food.
"The Earl of Buchan, cousin of the murdered John Comyn, had gathered a sizeable force and was waiting for the moment to attack."
The Bruce's forces withdrew into the Highlands.
"And yet i happen to know, you were in the presence of the King just this morning."
The answer is no and will remain no.
Why?
Because I'm no longer in ac ondition to fulfill my duties as a Minister.
"Well, I have decided to spend the rest of my days in quiet repose."
"Need I remind you, dear friend, that should you betray me to the King,"
I will find out and then I will kill you!
"Not without a certain degree of pleasure, I might add."
"He was most insistent, Sire, that we all be present."
This really is highly irregular!
"Well, this is hardly the first time he could be accused of that."
"Your Majesty, I have sinned against you."
"For five years, I was part of a conspiracy to have you overthrown."
Why do you tell me this?
Because you did me the honor of trusting me when others did not.
and I wish to show my gratitude.
And why now?
"I'm tired, Sire."
No longer fit to serve you.
You realize I should have you executed for this?
I trust His Majesty to do what is just and right
But I have no plans to leave the palace.
I can be found in my rooms.
One more thing:
"Your historian, Thomas."
What of him?
He knew of my involvement in the plot against you.
He's been blackmailing me for secret information ever since he arrived.
He's not to be trusted.
Tell my brother I would like to see him.
I applaud your new passion for the world of commerce.
I cannot let personal interests override those of France.
"You see, my goal is to examine the crime activities in the city of Zagreb."
"In fact, to find out the way of getting rid of it more easily."
I've told you I'm a sentimental man.
I'm doing all this 'cause I love this city.
I can't say I wasn't impressed by Fabian's theory.
"That night when he told me all about it, I wasn't able to sleep but I was rather listening against my will to the paper rustling that was coming out of his room."
There was something silly about it like with every other hobby.
I find hobbyists strange as usual.
"On the other hand, there was this Fabian's noble desire for common good, such denial and creative fervor that left a strong impression on me."
"During these days, however, I had to think about other things as well."
Because Zdenka has shown up.
Ivica!
It's you?
Hi.
- Hi!
When have you come?
How are you?
"- I'm fine, thank you."
The day before yesterday.
Mom had a heart attack.
She's feeling better now.
The doctor had come.
It was Zdenka.
A woman I've never recovered from to this day.
We were living in the same street and I was in loved with her ever since my childhood.
"At one point, we were even a couple in the high school days."
"We used to hold hands, walk around Paromlinska street and everybody knew about us."
"Her father was already working in Switzerland, and one day he called her to come there even before her graduation."
It was known that she opened a beauty salon in Zurich.
"We were sending letters for a while,"
I remember I was writing pretty fearfully and then I just stopped at all.
How are your kids?
Negotiate with tyranny?
Give me one example of when that has ever profited a nation.
- You're right.
We must unite.
- My fellow countrymen we can only judge the future from what we have suffered in the past.
"Now, many of you here stood with me at Marathon."
And for those of you who served and faced the cut and thrust of battle you know how true peace is forged.
Do not be deceived.
"Xerxes, the son of Darius is a wolf at our door."
"Right here, right now we must choose:"
Do we stand and fight for Greece or not?
Argos
Corinth
Megara
Athens.
Not even Sparta can match the Persians alone.
We must persevere as one nation.
Or we will perish clinging onto our own self-interests.
Send us the ships that we need to defend Greece.
Themistokles will need more than our cities' ships.
He will need our children to join the fight.
And what of Sparta?
You send every ship that we have to the northern coast of Euboea.
I will go and seek the help of the great Spartans.
Still no word from the messenger you sent to Sparta.
King Leonidas may have been insulted by your generous offer.
Perhaps I need to march into Sparta myself and burn it to the ground.
Remember when a king is loved as I am
much can be accomplished.
They would be fools to resist my divine power.
Athens is attempting to assemble a coalition.
It'll be nothing more than a patchwork of ships.
- Baltimore's finest.
"- They call cops Baltimore's finest, but I think that applies to all city workers."
Did you see that refrigerator back there?
"It keeps food very cold, perfectly cold, just the way it should be."
"So, we passed the inspection, right?"
You'll need to replace that dishwasher within the year and keep an eye on the water temperature.
"Dishwasher, you bet."
Absolutely.
"Other than that, everything looks pretty good."
"I know I said I didn't wanna be involved, but I had a talk with myself about it, and I don't shirk my responsibilities."
- I'm here to hone my business skills.
- Who's he?
"Tim Bayliss, silent partner."
What can I do?
You can give me $34.
"That's all right, I got it right here, processing fee."
Why are the fees always $34?
It's just some odd amount to screw up everyone's chequebook?
"Thanks for stopping by, we appreciate it."
- Say hello to your sister for me.
- I better not.
- Whatever you think is best.
"- You say that now, but wait till he's fining us for improper disposal of chicken lard."
He's just kidding.
- We'll open in a couple of weeks.
- If we're lucky.
"We still have to deal with the fire inspector, the building inspector, the zoning inspector and what's next, cocktail napkin inspector, the maraschino cherry inspector, and I'm sure there's some sort of regulation"
on the correct way to fold a bar rag.
"Makes you just wanna be a Republican, doesn't it?"
- Come by any time.
- You can count on it.
OK.
"He was mean sometimes, but he loved us."
Get out of my head.
Get out of my head!
You shouldnt have done it!
I had no choice!
"""For Kal-El, in the event of my death."""
"In my lifetime, I've known many famous and powerful men..."
"Presidents, sultans, kings...  and I believed that I was superior to them all."
"But I've come to know the truth, Kal-El."
My greatest accomplishment is that I have dedicated myself to protecting your life and serving you.
"For that, I am grateful."
"But if you are reading this, it means that I cannot protect you any longer from a terrible truth."
Two lockets exist...
Two.
Each one has its own key.
"These keys used together, unlock the secret of controlling you."
"You must find the keys, or your destiny will fall into the hands of another man."
You must save yourself.
What is it with the Luthors?
I swear death follows that family around like a stray puppy.
You're not gonna...
I wanted to search Luthorcorp tonight for evidence that Lex had Patricia Swann killed.
"But you, genius that you are, wanted to stay here and... search through meaningless memos in Lex's office."
"So while we were over here, photographing everything but the bottled water, the story of a lifetime was happening right across the street."
Take a look at the view.
One of tonight's shots from Lex's office.
What?
"The schoolboy crush is sweet, but you need to adjust your focus in more ways than one here."
This is serious.
Bodies are literally falling out of the sky.
And we have the picture to prove it.
- Lex's office looks out over Luthorcorp.
"When Dave mentioned we were going there,"
"I'm like, ""We're going where?"
"What?"""
"It's been like this kind of like, temple for me to go every time I stop in."
"That first day, I look at my e-mail of kind of what's going on the first day, just setting up."
"And it says, ""Dave, interview Allen Toussaint."""
"I'm like, ""What?"
"Holy shit."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, this is gonna be a really good week."""
Definitely a bucket list situation.
"Okay, the first question"
"I always ask everybody is, ""Where are you from?"""
"Oh, I'm from New Orleans."
"Very much so, yes."
"I was raised in an area called Gert Town, which is right here in town."
What do you remember about that time?
"You know, this city was still segregated in so many ways."
"That's true, but we would integrate with each other 'cause we had accepted the fact ""You're a musician, too."
"Of course we're gonna play something."""
"Like, I don't remember when Mac was ""segregated."""
"He and I were playing on recordings together, and from way back, we would just go find each other and play together in various places."
"It was actually on the law books that it was against the law for black and white musicians to perform on the same stage, you know, be in the same room, and all this kind of stuff."
"In fact, Mac went to jail from being in the Dew Drop."
I was really pissed off.
There was these two police.
"I'm thinking, ""Aw, shit."
"They gonna break my legs."""
"The story goes, he looked around and said,"
"""Y'all get ready to come back and get me next week, 'cause Ray Charles playing here and I'm coming back."""
It just seemed jive to me.
That's life back then.
He was a wonderful guitarist.
Which contains only pure blood.
"Who are racially pure people and conscious of their blood,"
He can never be a slave.
In this world will always be bastard and bastard alone.
Humanoid mutants are fully capable of reproducing different types.
That is the only thing that the creator did well.
"Are you doing something deep, not Kix?"
"""Does that book teach you all that?"""
-Open mind.
"It helps me understand, what I do."
Every single mutant must be exterminated for the human race to survive.
"Let's put it as data in the briefcase, Kix."
Your psycho propaganda bothered me.
Adolf Hitler was an unknown prophet.
Your message is our salvation!
"You have real damage, Kix."
"""We will have to fight for the freedom and the independence of the homeland"
"Only in this way can the people fulfill the task, which they received from the Creator. """
There is no 'homeland' anymore.
"It's just what we left, that's all that's left."
The atmosphere was destroyed by us.
No one else is to blame.
"And the asteroid, Bishop?"
It was in the crater.
I saw it with my own eyes.
It looks more like an atomic bomb to me.
It was an internal job...
That is always.
Humanity is responsible for the eternal winter.
"Not God, or humanoids."
It will no longer be a time hunted by the shadows of your own guilt.

AGENT CONVENTIONS POLICE
Sitting in and doing nothing it when there is still are bandits out there?
Getting Started.
"As we live with our old names and social security numbers, -"
- We aging r ig come to to live an ordinary life.
My son can not go to kindergarten should or school.
We are lawless.
"The future disclosed civilians recruited as police agents, not about."
The only thing that is important for us is to be a normal family.
It's not about money.
It's about the police and the politicians take responsibility.
"They just give us family, an honest chance."
It feels like living in a vacuum.
One can either proceed or back.
It feels as if time stands still.
Police have given me the impression -
"- That if I was exposed, or when I had to pull me back -"
- Then they would take care of me and help in every way.
Which has not happened.
I think we have moved 17 or 19 times.
It is the seventh time I change my identity.
It's hard not to interfere them together and stupid.
"That, for example, will to write a different name."
"And the big problem is, that my son can not go to school -"
- Or be patient with a doctor and so on.
So one has to be suspicious in respect of all the whole time.
And it's hard.
The question is:
how long you can endure it.
One day I come to that stupid me and reveal myself -
- And then there is someone that takes me -
- And then I hopefully shot.
"Look, I wasn't more than a kid when all this started."
Certain people pushed me into joining the force to do their dirty work from the inside.
"And the truth is, mate,"
I want to retire too.
Just in a different way.
But I can't do that till I'm free of the past.
"And you could be free, too."
"Four and a half months, that's you walking off into the sunset... .. with none of this hanging over you."
What's going on?
He's here.
Nige.
"Now, the purpose of today's interview is to re-examine a statement provided voluntarily by DC Morton on October 17, 2013."
This is document one in your folders.
Is this your statement?
It is.
And do you now wish to amend your statement in any way?
I do.
"DC Jeremy Cole was a corrupt officer, the sort there's no room for in the police service."
What he got up to sickened me.
I did have occasion to meet Cole and he did at one time boast about his connections to underworld figures.
Did you report Cole?
"Although this is a voluntary interview,"
I request the professional courtesy of being questioned by an officer at least one rack superior.
Why didn't you report Cole at the time?
I thought he was a lippy kid.
He was full of it.
I didn't believe his boasts.
"Much later, I learned about his offences."
"If only I'd acted, I might have prevented them."
I'm extremely remorseful.
"In regards to your statement of Cole being the Caddy, would you now like to make any further amendments?"
I never heard Cole himself use that nickname.
So someone was only after the one piece.
And know it's not worth more than the others.
"Well, maybe it's not about the value of the piece."
Maybe it's about what's in the piece itself?
"Only problem is, we don't know what was in the piece, because it's gone."
(Leo) Along with the negatives.
So how do we figure out what it looks like?
"Well, that's where I come in."
"Okay, I've isolated the missing paintings from the surveillance footage."
Now I'm going to try and identify the different photos Walker used to compose the piece.
Would it be easier for you if we weren't watching?
"(Dozer) Yeah, gimme a couple seconds here."
"So someone got Walker to use his pass code to steal the entire exhibit, but it was only a cover."
So they could take the one piece they really wanted.
Why would Walker agree to that?
And who would want that one piece?
Henry Calhoun?
I'm Colin Anderson's son.
I swear.
"Go ahead, ask me anything."
You could have answers prepared for anything I ask.
"Look, all I care about is finding out what's in the encrypted part of these papers."
Is that all?
All I care about is getting a million dollars and watching Pamela Anderson clean my apartment in that red bathing suit.
How about starting with you telling me what you know?
I know the U.S. was paying Russian spies for their secrets.
Alexi Karasyov was one of those spies.
"When the Wall went down, the United States wanted to send him back to Russia, but my parents,"
"Colin and Lydia Anderson, protected him."
"Now they're in prison for the rest of their lives, and there's something in these papers that can prove that they were set up."
But I don't know what it is.
Because it's in code.
"When I opened my eyes, I was on board in fishing trawler."
"It was then I learned, that I have been two months since I have disappeared."
"Since that date forward, I have not had the guts to head out to sea."
"Andres, we all know there's something down there."
Another world.
Another form of life.
myabe they are from the past.
from a vanished from of life.
I do not know what is it that they want.
But I do know is that they need us.
"I am an old man now, and my only regret is not having returned to unravel that mystery."
"But you can, go there, but speak of this to no one, or you would be considered as insane!"
Are you worried?
I am.
I is I who should be going down there.
Do you fear for me?
"I do, yes, this is where Enrique and I dived, but, please, do not dive all the way down."
"and if you feel a queer sensation of listlesness and hopelesness, return immediatedly."
"It is a sign of danger, you would be at the treshold of another dimension."
"Do not let yourself be decieved and return immediatedly, I beg of you!"
You must not hesitate!
"If you wait one moment, it would be too late!"
"Paco, help her!"
"""another ship dissapears"""
How is it going?
"Ricardo, I am glad to see you."
"I came as soon as I could, what is wrong?"
"You be the judge, appart from Maria's boat, other ships have dissapeared in the same place."
And some mysterious images that appear and dissapear from underwater photographs.
"And there was also a shark that nudged me, as if to only scare me from going deeper."
You went diving?
Andres should not have allowed it.
"Well, you see, I felt so... so happy and delighted to work on things."
"I mean, to work on something like this was just... was just thrilling."
"And when... when we were working on projects, we were just completely absorbed with the ideas."
And... and... and there was just great freedom and love of what we were doing.
And so that was the price that I paid.
"It was worth it, you know?"
My parents met by chance at a party in Philadelphia.
"My mother was 32, and Lou was almost 60."
Her family was appalled by the relationship.
"And when she got pregnant, she decided to disappear for a while."
"She went to stay with her friends,"
Charles and Susannah Jones.
They offered to adopt me if she had to give me up.
I was amazed to see this little man that she was so taken with.
"And I didn't quite get his number, I have to say."
"I mean, he turned on the charm."
"And I was sort of a Yankee, and it didn't rub off."
"I mean, I didn't get it."
And then it revolved that she was pregnant and that her family really resented that and...
- didn't accept...
"- No, they didn't."
They didn't accept that.
"And time went by, and I said to Charles,"
"""You know, what's she going to do?"
"""She hasn't made arrangements,"
"""and the family isn't coming through."
"""They're making it difficult."
"""I really think we should do something."""
"And there was one sister, Edwina, who did stand by her and said, ""You know what I can do?"
"""I can provide a man to stand up with you"
"""and get married and give a name to that child,"
"""and then you just can get divorced two weeks later."""
Can't a managing partner have a drink with his favorite COO every once in a while?
"He can, but I got a ton of work to do, and I'd like to get home before midnight."
There's something I need to tell you.
"Harvey, what's going on?"
I've been seeing Paula Agard.
And not as my therapist anymore.
We've been seeing each other.
What?
What do you mean what?
I'm just amused that you think I didn't know.
Donna.
"The day you made managing partner, you drove yourself to work, not in the red car, but in the black Ferrari Daytona."
"And on top of that, you told me and Louis that you had things to take care of that night, but I know your schedule, and I know what happened was you drove yourself straight home from the office, you changed into whatever outfit"
"you thought would impress her the most, and then you went right over to her house, and you swept her off her feet."
But you just asked me the other night if something was going on because I've been acting different.
"'Cause I was trying to get you to open up, but you missed the signal, so I figured I'd just keep on waiting, and here you are, more or less right on time."
- More or less?
"- Well, I was giving you until tomorrow, so you're actually ahead of schedule."
"Well, that was Paula's doing."
"I'm happy for you, Harvey, and I want to hear all about it, but like I said, I've got a ton of work to do, and I want to get home before midnight, so..."
"Go on, finish."
We'll talk later.
I'm glad you finally told me.
"Thanks, Donna."
Me too.

"Donna, are you okay?"
You look like you just saw a ghost.
I don't know.
I...
I just got some news
- Thank you.
Your witness.
"Miss Morrow, did it ever occur to you that Somers might have lied about giving Reed that certified check for delivery?"
Yes.
But he was very positive.
So positive that he flew into a rage and threatened you with his cane?
"No, no."
It was nothing like that.
He seemed to be very sure of getting me to do what he wanted.
Does that explain the tickets to Copenhagen reserved in your name at a Los Angeles airlines office?
Or did you reserve those tickets yourself--
How did he find out about that?
"...intending to leave town as soon as you or Latham Reed had $50,000 in hand?"
"No, no, the tickets were Mr. Somers' idea, and it was just an idea, that's all."
It was...a gift he planned.
What sort of gift?
What were the tickets for?
He said he wanted to get Axel out of his hair.
He suggested I persuade him to go away on a long trip with me.
A honeymoon.
What was your answer?
"Well, how on earth could I promise to marry a man who's never said one word but ""furniture"" to me?"
Who never in any way has told me that--
that he feels as I do?
"Is this court to understand, Mr. Hadley, that you had a meeting with Mr. Somers the day of his death?"
Yes.
"It was at his factory, that same evening, about 6:30, before he left Long Beach."
How did this meeting come about?
"Well, I had heard a rumor that he was going to close down the cabinet shop, so I went right over to see him."
I figured that the least he owed me was a chance at Axel's real estate.
I also wanted to know if he was going to fire all those fine craftsmen.
- I wanted to hire some of them.
"I would never, and I have never, done anything, or would let anyone near me do anything that would jeopardize another human being or line my own pockets, period."
But there are times in business when you cannot move forward unless you play by somebody else's rules.
"Are you asking me did I turn my head, did I look the other way when I knew it should take six weeks to get a safety permit, and somehow it came in two?"
Who gets precedence when there aren't enough concrete trucks to cover the work we're doing?
"Or how many skilled mechanics are actually needed on a job this size, as opposed to how many the union makes us use?"
Am I going to be indicted for the doing my job the same way every architect does his?
- ls that what this is about?
- We don't know.
All we can do is prepare you for the possibilities.
"Well, do you want me to admit what I just said if I'm asked?"
Our President gave us all a great lesson on that a couple of years ago.
The dumbest thing you can ever do is lie to a grand jury.
[telephone rings]
Yes?
Now?
Okay.
Send him in.
"Hi, Karen."
"I hope this isn't barging in, but I was in the neighborhood."
I had to pick up some basketball uniforms.
- Oh.
"- Uh, yeah."
"The uniforms these kids have, they're as good as the pros'."
- lt's unbelievable.
- ls this for your son?
Huh?
"Oh, no, I'm not of the parental persuasion."
I just coach at St. Cecilia's.
Oh.
"Well, that's very good."
Yeah.
"Well, we're..."
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.
"There were guys, that's all they did all day long, was take care of Paulie's phone calls."
For a guy who moved all day long Paulie didn't talk to six people.
"If there was a union problem or, say a beef in the numbers only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem."
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told.
"Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie, and he got a piece of everything they made."
"It was tribute, just like in the old country, except they were doing it here in America."
All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.
And that's what it's all about.
That's what the FBI could never understand.
That what Paulie and the Organization does is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops.
That's it.
That's all it is.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.
"People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody."
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread.
"The owner knew who I was with, and he'd come from around the counter no matter how many people were waiting I was taken care of first."
"Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didnt have a car."
At 13 I was making more money than most of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
I mean I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.
One day....
"One day, some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home."
You know why?
It was out of respect.
"Hi Mom, what do you think?"
Look at my shoes.
Aren't they great?
My God...
Possible it was mechanical failure?
"No, no, no, we built that car ourselves."
Check it out head to toe every time we took it out.
"Then I have to ask, was Jared upset about anything?"
Depressed?
"No, he didn't crash on purpose, if that's what you're implying."
SONJA:
"Okay, so..."
Sorry.
"If it wasn't intentional, and it wasn't driver or mechanical error, what caused the crash?"
I don't know!
"Well, they're obviously hiding something."
"The question is, what and why?"
"Either they're complicit, which based on how they were both defending Jared, it's hard to believe, or..."
They're too scared to talk for some reason.
Yeah.
"Which means we're gonna have to figure out the truth, with or without their help for now."
Loretta's got autopsy results.
I'll see what she's found.
"Maybe you should catch up with Christopher, go through Jared's house, see if you can find any leads."
"I don't suppose we could ask Gregorio to pitch in temporarily, seeing as though we're spread pretty thin."
"No, I wouldn't count on it."
Gregorio's helping the U.S. attorney build an indictment against Garcia.
It won't be long before she's heading home.
Best let her be.
Come on.
We've got things to learn.
"A prelim tox screen was negative for any anomalies, so unless you come up with something else,"
I'm ruling his death as accidental.
You brought me all the way out here just to tell me that?
No.
"Because I don't think it was an accident, mainly because of this."
My soul is like an out-of-tune viola.
Maybe we can help you to tune it again.
Alas!
Who knows!
Who knows...
Come with us.
You will find out much.
He will grimace.
Pay!
"Is your task to command me, and mine to obey you, except until the parts are switched around someday."
"So, is settled."
We'll wait for you tomorrow morning at the Three Kings Inn.
May this conjuror kiss the cross!
"Sister Renata, do you believe in evil spirits?"
"I do not believe in evil spirits but in the word of God, which bears witness to them."
"Sister Renata, have you seen demons?"
I have always looked away from them.
"Sister Renata,"
I can see that you are very unhappy.
"I am sorry for you, as I was on the first day."
"But why, since you came to my convent, is there no longer any peace in our quiet life?"
"Mysterious knocks on the wall, invisible fingers touching us in the dark, visions and terrible fits among the sisters."
"Sister Renata, all this came to us with you."
"Where holiness is near, there roams the spirit of perfidy."
"Pray, Sister Renata."
The Inquisitor has come to the convent to combat sin.
He will administer exorcisms to expel demons from you.
"Prepare yourself, Sister Renata."
May heaven forgive you.
"Beloved brothers and sisters, it is a well-known fact that the spirit of darkness often takes the form of a holy angel."
But for this we are given a spiritual sword to cut off his shameful snout.
"Come here, beloved daughter, and tell us what evidence you have that your visions aren't from the Devil?"
"If more thou dost perceive, let me know more."
Set on my wife to observe.
"Leave me, lago."
"My lord, I take my leave."
Although Othello is a strong and valiant man.
He appears to be very easily manipulated by the machinations of lago.
"Given this fact we can be forgiven... for believing that the fiery character of Othello... is his downfall, and subsequently that of Desdemona."
"Desdemona could have behaved more tactfully, couldn't she?"
I think the scene where she contributes most clearly to her own downfall... is that in which she actually nags Othello to forgive Cassio.
"She hammers the point home... and if only one feels she had been a little more discreet about that... well, we might have ended up not with a tragedy."
"Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do all my abilities in thy behalf."
"Good madam, do:"
"I warrant it grieves my husband, as if the case were his."
"O, that's an honest fellow."
"Do not doubt, Cassio..."
But I will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were.
"Bounteous madam, whatever shall become of Michael Cassio... he's never any thing but your true servant."
"- Madam, here comes my lord."
"- Madam, I'll take my leave."
- Ha!
I like not that.
- What dost thou say?
Nothing my lord:
or if I know not what.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
"Cassio, my lord!"
"No sure, I cannot think it."
"That how would steal away so guilty like, seeing you coming."
I do believe 'twas he.
"How now, my lord!"
I have been talking with a suitor here...
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
"I didn't mean to intrude,"
"That's all right, Lieutenant."
That's remarkable.
"Yes, sir."
"Remarkable how you do that, sir."
My wife would like to have you around.
"Thank you, Lieutenant."
"You know, this bio, sir, it doesn't say anything about when you were first discovered, and what you were doing when you were discovered, who discovered you."
I'm going to have a little chat with the publicity department about that.
"Come to think of it, sir, it was Mrs. Daley who discovered you, wasrt it?"
"Now, Lieutenant, I told you all about that with great emotion and in great detail the first time we met."
"Well, that's what I mean, sir, it should be in here."
"Excuse me, Kenny."
Thank you.
Where were you and when...
"Lieutenant, why don't you just ask me what it is you wanna know?"
"Where did Mrs. Daley discover you, sir?"
That's something even my wife doesn't know.
It doesn't say anything here in the bio.
It doesn't even say whether Ward Fowler's your real name or not.
And that's something any Lieutenant Lucerne fan would wanna know.
Why don't we stop pretending that I'm brilliant and you're simple for one moment.
I'm gonna confide something in you.
"Anything you tell me, sir, it's between us."
Like the shoes.
"Lieutenant, my real name, so help me, Charles Kipling."
And you're the only one who knows that.
"Now, Charles Kipling was in a little bit of trouble when Claire first found him."
"Actually, I was doing theater in Toronto."
"Claire and I hit it off big, she thought I had a great future, she persuaded me to leave Canada."
And that was the beginning.
"The trouble straightened itself out, of course."
"But make no mistake, that wall alone does not ensure our security."
"It is up to us, every one of us, to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating any potential threat to our stability."
There are individuals hiding among us who must be contained.
So permit me to address the objections of my fellow faction leaders.
I am aware that there have been some concerns about the unavoidable raid on Candor.
- So let me be clear.
-(ALARMS BLARING)
The harboring of Divergents by any faction cannot be tolerated.
"Very soon, I will be presenting what I believe to be no less than a mandate from The Founders themselves."
"And this will, I have no doubt, validate the measures I'm taking to keep the peace."
"And provide the instructions that will allow us to eradicate the Divergent crisis, once and for all."
Where are you going?
Tris left.
She's gone.
What?
When?
Last night.
Wait.
Tobias!
People look to you for leadership.
You can't just abandon them.
Tobias!
(DOOR OPENS)
PETER:
WOW.
"I have to admit, I'm impressed."
"I mean, I knew that you were dumb, but I didn't think that you were dumb enough to actually come down here and turn yourself in."
The killings have to stop.
"Well, that just goes to show that you can take the girl outta Abnegation, but you can't take the Abnegation outta the girl."
Let's go.
"Once a stiff, always a stiff, right?"
What is this?
"Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell."
"Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with... really, I am, kiss whoever you want... except they were both men."
Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.
I do a lot of meth.
The sheriff's office is coordinating their search with local and state police.
"If you're watching, Greg and Larry, and I know you are, my men and I will not rest until we find you."
"That's right, we're coming for you."
"Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?"
"The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead."
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
"Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
"Okay, I'll get some water."
"Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?"
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
"Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme:"
Code Rad.
Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
"What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
"I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a..."
"""hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
Good call.
"All right, let's get out of here."
"And in Coral Palms, law enforcement still is searching for a pair of fugitives who broke out of jail earlier this evening."
Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert are believed to be unarmed but dangerous.
"Liquid Moan, nice."
I wore this to Swampsgiving last year... cleaned up.
"Right on, bro."
"Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad."
All she ever wanted was to have adventures and have an interesting life and she got that and she'll never know.
"On many occasions, he says, you know,"
"""I've ruined people's lives."" He does."
"He takes them on these amazing journeys, but they always suffer, they always pay the price, at the end."
"She does get a lottery ticket, in the end, which I guess is cool, but can it buy, you know, a trip to, you know, some distant world?"
No.
"The episode where Sarah Jane came back into ""Doctor Who"""
was a very emotional moment for me because I remember Sarah so well.
"She was part of ""Doctor Who"" legend."
"I think it was around about her time when you heard less of the term ""assistant"""
"and it went more to ""companion."""
She was really a different kind of companion.
"She was a reporter, she was hardnosed, she actually, you know, she could do stuff."
"She and the Doctor had a chemistry in the '70s that the show had not seen before, or since."
"I mean, she's generally though of as the best companion, ever."
"When Sarah Jane Smith came back,"
"I think, for me, that was probably the most emotional"
"""Doctor Who"" moment that I have ever seen."
"Hello, Sarah Jane."
It's you.
Oh.
Doctor.
"Oh, my God, it's you, it's -- it's -- you've regenerated."
"Yeah, half a dozen times, since we last met."
You look...
Incredible.
So do you.
Hmm.
I got old.
That moment when she sees
"David's door and recognizes him and knows him for who he is, with all those years of history between them was a pretty amazing bit of television history."
"I thought you'd died -- I waited for you, you didn't come back, and I thought you must've died."
"He'd also become deeply involved with the woman working in the office, a young architect named Anne Tyng."
"She's the mother of my half sister, Alex."
Lou was not a domestic person.
Let's face it.
He never was.
And...
"He lived, really, in the office, you know?"
"He had his bench where he would take catnaps, and he even sent his laundry out from the office."
"I mean, he was really... and, of course, I know that he crossed his home address off on his... on his passport."
That's why they had a hard time locating his... in letting people know that they found him dead in 30th Street Station.
"- Penn Station, New York."
- Penn Station.
My mother always said that Lou had crossed off the address because he planned to leave Esther and come marry her.
I don't think he was capable of doing that.
"I mean, I'm sorry but"
I really can't see him doing something like that.
I realized he was not about to do that.
"He always said that work was the most important thing, that you cannot depend on human relations, that, really, work is the only thing you can count on."
Did you fall in love with him right away?
Lou?
"- Sure, yeah."
- Why?
"Well, he had tremendous charm."
"I mean, he was charismatic, and he was very accessible and very endearing to people."
"And when you got pregnant, were you surprised?"
"Oh, yeah, it was a physical shock."
But that didn't seem to change his idea of what he was going to do.
"And he just would say,"
"""Well, you have to be philosophical about it."""
"So, I mean, I could spend the rest of my life being philosophical, but there was not much point in that."
"You know,"
I had to do something.
- 9.
Any person with the discipline and dedication to memorize the entire Qu'ran by age 9
must have a very serious reason to choose a life of violence.
Perhaps.
We are through already?
"No, not at all."
The sun is about to set.
Mecca's in that direction.
I'll have a prayer rug and water bowl sent in.
What the heck is going on here?
The NSA is routing all messages to us for language analysis.
"You know, rumor has it, much to my chagrin, that during national security emergencies, our fair country turns all of its satellites homeward and records all electronic traffic in the whole U. S. A."
Is this even legal?
"Yeah, I don't really want to think about that right now."
Somewhere in this slew of chatter could be a shred of something that could save a whole lot of lives.
"All right, well, cross reference gift with wedding allusions."
They'll be consistent with their code.
Here's something.
"It rained all over the wedding, but the gift is waiting in the barn."
- When was that call made?
- Looks like just over two hours ago.
"Let's run the words ""barn and ""wedding"" through."
The wedding will now be held at Vincent's barn off Link and Annandale.
- Wrap the gift for delivery.
- That's not a gift I wanna get.
I'll call Hotch.
"Yeah, JJ."
We think we just found the cell's backup location.
"It looks like a construction site in Annandale, Virginia."
Sounds like they may have another device ready to arm.
I'll get agent ryan to organize another raid.
And notify Gideon and Reid.
"Well, one of them came through, tipped me off about an attack ad the Gage campaign's gonna release next week."
"Dad, whatever Gage throws at me, uh,"
Nilaa will be able to handle it.
"Yeah, it's about her, son."
"JohnDonovansays he will defend America, but look who works for him."
"His campaign manager, Nilaa Mizrani, attended the radical parkland mosque, which applauded terrorists, and prayed for the death of our troops."
"John Donovan called Mizrani his own right hand, and a good friend."
"But with friends like these, can we really trust john Donovan in the white house?"
Paid for by Gage for president.
It wouldn't be the first lie coming out of that campaign.
"We checked it out, John."
There are photos that prove that she was there.
During her sophomore year.
Show me.
This doesn't make sense.
She was young.
Yeah.
Still...
"Well son, I don't know what else to tell you, except, she's a liability."
"John, bottom line is, you will not win in November if you have a campaign manager who prayed for the death of American soldiers."
The north pines mall.
"Crowded, five miles from here, minimal security."
"What is this, Kusuma?"
We can still do what we came here to do - strike back at this country.
I've chosen a target.
One attack won't change history.
Activating my father's network will.
We're not going to stay and wait for the Americans to find us.
"If we don't act now, we'll achieve nothing."
You're coming with us.
I'm not going anywhere.
And neither are you.
What happens if the flame blows out?
You just take out a match and light it.
"You just take- sit down, son."
Don't get upset.
"Well, my good man?"
Good morning.
"This is a little invention of mine which i call ""always a gentleman."""
"Now, you've just been down to the butcher's store, and you're coming back with your arms full of liver and whatnot for the wife."
You meet mrs.
Maclntire or some other lady of your acquaintance.
"Now, there's two things you can't do:"
"You can't drop your liver, and you can't insult a lady, so you just, uh... and the lady still thinks you're a gentleman."
What does your wife think?
"Oh, she thinks i'm crazy."
I think your wife is right.
"Sit down, please."
"Well, well, well, uncle daniel."
What have you got to sell now?
"You'll repent on judgment day for taking the bread out of an old man's mouth, tricking me out of my steamboats that way."
"And i know who put you up to it, too."
"It was that cornele vanderbilt, now wasn't it?"
I don't even know cornelius vanderbilt.
"Oh, you can lie faster than a horse can trot!"
What makes you think it's vanderbilt?
Because me and cornele's been fighting all our lives.
"I was driving bessie down wall street this morning when cornele whizzed up with them spanking black mares of his, and hollered right out with everybody listening,"
"""i hear there's a young fella named fisk that's been teaching you how to suck eggs!"""
It's the first time i've ever been hornswoggled in my whole life!
And you ain't in cahoots with vanderbilt?
"No, but it's a good idea."
It's a fine idea.
Vanderbilt is after your erie railroad.
Must've slipped.
Clumsy.
Did the timer go off?
It was a gift with two simple caveats:
Keep a dead thing alive for more than a minute  and something else would die in its place.
"And touch a dead thing twice, it dies again, this time, forever."
Young Ned felt responsible not only for his mother's death  but the death of Chuck's father.
"His feelings of guilt were amplified, because he too was in love."
The next time young Ned would see the girl named Chuck  she would be dead.
"Unlike Chuck, young Ned still had a father."
- After a brief mourning period...
- I'll be back.
... he would deposit Ned at the Longborough School for Boys.
"After her own father's death  Chuck was fostered by Aunts Lily and Vivian  a renowned synchronized-swimming duo and sister neurotics  who helped her build a new home, bee by bee."
It was Aunt Lily who found the ad on the pages of the Thrifty Nickel  in a fleeting wisp of something resembling maternal instinct.
Just wanted you to stop staring at that spot where your father died.
Young Chuck rebuilt her home by building a new home  for a homeless queen and her hive.
The bees thrived.
So did Chuck.
And while Chuck thrived  Ned waited for his father to bring him home  and waited  and waited.
Just as Chuck remembered how home felt  Ned tried not to forget what home was.
He held on to it the only way he could  and became  the Pie-Maker.
And the girl named Chuck became dead.
"She was 28 years, 24 weeks, 3 days, 11 hours  and 51 minutes old when murdered on a Tahitian getaway."
- But one touch from the Pie-Maker...
I think somebody's truck's on fire.
"Oh, jeez."
... she was alive once more.
Sorry I'm late.
The Pie-Maker could never touch her again.
Chuck's survival now depended on a delicate dance  a ballet of avoidance.
Going.
-Where?
"In the fields, one of the clubs of encounters."
"Yes, sure I remember, I was."
In France and in Italy.
I would never swing like that.
Don't be so sure about it.
You are too naive.
And too jealous.
"As anyone would be, who loves the truth."
-Is your boyfriend also like this?
-Like crazy!
He saves himself in everything.
-And so he does.
-In saving himself for me?
-No just in his jealousy.
Listen to this.
"""Dear Tinto, my name is Veronica of 45 years."

"But hurry, tonight I should go on time."
My boyfriend is coming by to pick me up.
"This letter does not want to appear pathetic, nor a... search for justification, but the story of how the lack of... illusion can be a reason for unsuspected satisfaction."
"My name is Ivana of 33 years, and I am telling you, I have always been faithful to my husband Filippo."
But his vice is the card game and gambling and this is the cause of constant disputes... and makes him come home ever later and more nervous.
"I know that companionship with the flesh.... is a poor substitute for what we both share, Bess."
"I am but a man, after all."
That it had to be her is what cuts.
Be thankful it was her.
"In exchange for privileges, she settled into a loveless marriage."
"My heart lies elsewhere, and we both know it."
"Now tell me... is it truly your world to wed your frog prince, Bess?"
Hmm?
You asked for your penance.
"That is it, Robbie."
I will whom I shan't love.
and I do it for an heir.

I am of an age now when the idea of that...

"Outside the palace, an armed guard must accompany you all the time."
And let my people think
I've succumbed to this malicious spleen?
All copies of this profanity must be confiscated.
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from the evil one.

"By thy might, defend my cause."

"You see, before you know it, they will point a finger at me."
And why will they point a finger at me?
Think about it.
"This collection was reflecting, quite deliberately, the culture of violence in which we live."
So of course the models were carrying guns.
Of course they were pointing the guns at each other.
It was a statement!
"And, you know, I explained to you what a statement is."
But maybe they will interpret this statement as part of a larger plot to destroy the whole of society and then I will be finished.
Maybe they will take me away and I will disappear and that will be that.
"Now you have a record of this thought in your little camera, OK?"
Just in case.
"Good morning, Michelangelo."
Yes...
Now...
Now we have to get serious.
What have you been doing?
Are you crazy?
This is not what we agreed.
"All those kids outside, hundreds of them, among the protestors, some of them calling my name when I came in just now."
"""'O' is for Otto, that's my motto!"" They were calling that and laughing!"
"Now I don't mind people calling my name, not at all."

I think you were the last person to speak with Lettuce Leaf yesterday.
"She told me that she wanted to talk to you, and today she's nowhere to be seen."
Did she say anything to you?
I'd like to have him back.
You're very welcome to him.
Just a minute.
I haven't finished yet.
"Are you any closer to finding out who killed Margaret Ellis, or, for that matter, who tried to kill her husband--Arthur?"
"I want you to know that I shall be making an official complaint-- arresting fleming, keeping me detained for 3 full days."
"I think you've acted well beyond your authority, Mr. foyle."
"Sorry, sir."
It was normal procedure.
"Normal or not, it was unnecessary and inconvenient."
"Have you finished now, Mr. Spencer?"
"I'm a politician, Mr. foyle."
"And the way you've treated me,"
"I think you have forgotten that I am the leader of a legitimate organization with legitimate views, even if you don't agree with them."
But I'd like you to know that I am just as much a patriot as you are.
I love our country.
But it is possible to believe that this war with Hitler is misguided.
"Poles and Czechs, they're Jewish interests, not British."
I know what you believe.
I don't think you do.
"I doubt that you know, for example, that the first 2 British pilots shot down over Germany were black shirts."
The kiel raid at the end of last year-- they were both mosley's men.
"And sir Ernest bannerman, mp--"
I suppose you would call him a crank and a traitor.
"Well, he served in the first war."
He was a member of the north Russian relief force in 1919.
"Right now, he has a son serving in northern France."
You have a son serving with the raf.
"Are you prepared to lose him, to see him slaughtered simply because Hitler invaded Poland?"
I'll take you to Mr. fleming.
"Thank you, milner."
"You see, we're not so different, you and I."
"In 1977, I think, a bunch of crazy women up in duluth, Minnesota, figured out they had the solution to domestic violence and it was all about patriarchy and all about men."
"It's the duluth power and control wheel, 'cause men are all about power and control."
"Of course, not you ladies."
"You guys, you don't control anything."
You have no power.
You're just sweet and innocent little things.
"Okay, so this power and control wheel is dmded up in all these things, you know, about who does this and who does that, and blah, blah, blah."
"And of course, it's all men."
The entire domestic violence industry was founded on that.
I think it's still 37 or 32 states in the United States that by law they have to use the duluth model for batter intervention program.
"It's all shame, blame, and guilt driven."
"If you're a man and you walk in, you must admit you did it up front or you're in denial."

Absolutely terrifying.

"Perhaps because we are engaged in an imitation of life, there is a common misconception that anything living can do what we do."

"Of teaching, of coaching, of dumb show, of these things, I'm afraid I know nothing."
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

You're right.

"And it makes me think how wrong we've been, playing Uncle Frank for laughs."
"Yes, he's a drunkard and a clown, but he's also all those people who gave their sons to one war and now their grandsons to another."
"If we served that truth, if we gave you an Uncle Frank really worth your time and your talent,"
I wonder if you would consider putting that same time and talent towards helping Mr. Lundbeck and the picture?

"Neither the Pie-Maker nor Chuck could move  without the other one knowing  and to the Pie-Maker, it felt like home."
"So Chuck and the Pie-Maker built a home together, bee by bee."
"Tragically, rogue pesticides killed those bees, but only briefly."
This will go better if you wear less clothes.
You've already got me shucked like an ear of corn.
"Well, I'm shucked too, way down to my silky intimates just to put on a beekeeper suit."
Remind me why you're shucked and silky.
I thought it was only fair.
You stopped being fair.
Right.
You do realize I can get new bees.
I can make a new home for new bees.
You love these bees.
"A happy hive's a happy home, and you can't be happy if you're dead."
There are a thousand dead bees here.
I don't want butterflies to die because you bring my bees back.
Think about it as a pest-control issue.
There's a water-bug infestation in the drainpipes.
If I touch 1000 little dead bees to life maybe 1000 little water bugs will no longer be a problem.
"Last time I asked you to bring something back, you said no."
It was your dad.
"That would've been weird, if not actively traumatic."
"To bring my dad back even for a minute, it may be ghoulish, but it's also sweet like a taxidermied pet, or someone's ashes in a teddy bear."
Eul.
You're going to meet a good person.
"Someone who sincerely cares for you, and loves you."
You are definitely going to meet someone who will make you happy.
"Wow, seriously ahjussi."
I really did not see you like that.
You're seriously mean.
"If you're going to reject me, just coldly reject me instead of pretending to be nice."
- No Eul...
"- From this moment on I'm not going to see you any longer, Ahjussi."
Don't contact me again.
But why did this kid call?
"If he was a typical freak, I could at least make a guess."
"You psycho, why did you even call?"
You're asking to be cursed at.
"If I answer your calls in the future and meet you again, I'm not No Eul, but Dog Eul."
I apologize for not being able to promptly pick up the phone.
"Regarding my not knowing my place and making an offensive joke,"
"I am deeply, deep in my bones, reflecting and regretting it."
"With your generous heart, please speak well of me to the chairman, and give me another chance..."
"Never mind, I'm not sending it."
Do you think I can't make a living without you?
"I will definitely get paid a double salary, and a permanent position with the 4 kinds of insurance and more!"
That Sin Joon Young...
Why are you so surprised?
Are you seeing a dog-bird for the first time?
How'd you find me here?
I asked the production crew and they told me.
Why are they giving people's personal information out like that?
What is your husband doing while you mooch off of Na Ri?
"-You see, the thing is..."
-You're saying you married in that time?
"If you haven't slept with him yet, don't."
And don't go over there anymore.
We're all here?
Good afternoon.
"For those of you who don't know me, I am Dominic... and I'm an alcoholic and an addict."
"Don't forget ""scumbag."""
As some of you obviously don't know...
I've also been in recovery now going on four years.
"I joined AA in prison, and frankly, it saved my life."
"Okay, now, we're all here today because we have one thing in common."
Not only do we share a certain background and culture... we care about Chris and want to help him with his heroin addiction.
Any one of you been involved in an intervention before?
"Caught our daughter smoking pot once, but...."
"-Not really, no."
-No problem.
An intervention is a non-judgmental confrontation.
"A ""care-frontation,"" we call it."
"Now, what I need from you guys is to make a list of specific times... where Christopher's drug use impacted on you directly."
"For example, Adriana, is it?"
You would say something like this:
"""Christopher, last Monday you came home from work high..."
"""and belligerent, and you were physically abusive to me."""
What if he's high when we try to talk to him?
Then we wait till he's sober.
"My first intervention, Steven Patrano waited 10 hours for me to sober up."
-Your first intervention?
"-In 1997, I suffered a relapse."
"As in heroin addiction, alcoholics suffer a fairly high recidivism rate."
Great.
So he's taking advice from a two-time loser.
There are no losers in recovery.
"Actually, I never really met Ralph's kid."
"You needed someone's expertise, you know, for the clay formulation and the mold making."
But he left Acme before the chip design was finalized.
Yeah.
Okay.
"So, the counterfeiters, they walk in the minute we open, right- 12:01."
They buy a legitimate $100 chip.
They walk out.
They start making their own by 12:02.
"Now if they're any good, they start cranking out them phonies before noon."
"Except, Ed, the machine that produces the high quality chips... is extremely rare and extremely expensive."
"And I talked to the manufacturer, and he said there's only six in existence... and the only one anywhere near here is at Acme."
"All the others, there's no way they could have produced the fakes... and gotten 'em back here in the same day."
Did you talk to the other five places that have these machines to see if they still have 'em?
- I will get on that.
- Good.
"Oh, listen."
"I need you to check surveillance video... for anyone that came in, uh, between 12:00 and 3:00 yesterday... and went directly to the cage or to a table and cashed in a $100 chip."
"Mr. D., that's like thousands of people."
- We might need more time-
- We don't need any time.
You-You need time because I expect this done by tonight.
So does Jake care that you're helping me with all this stuff?
He's working late.
Seems like he does that a lot.
Remember this?
"Yeah, I remember that."
I remember how pissed you were when I solved it before you.
I'm still pissed.
"I wonder what I could get for this thing- If you ask me one more time... how much you could get for that on eBay, I swear, I will deck you."
I'm not gonna say anything.
Uh-huh.
Probably couldn't get more than a couple of bucks.
I'm waiting for the histology section - see if they tell us something.
Tell us something you missed the first time round you mean.
"Look, it doesn't matter who found the fingerprint, or who spotted the DNA, or who realised the necklace wasn't stolen."
It's not about looking good!
It's about finding the truth.
It's a process.
All sweetness and light?
He's like Columbo on speed.
How's yours?
"Oh, he's really pretty good."
He seems to agree with me.
You mean he's dangerously insane?
It's near impossible to concentrate today.
Doesn't feel right without Henry here.
What is it?
There's a bloke hanging around.
Where?
I can't see anyone.
He was just there.
"Well, I'll go and have a proper look."
There's still no through line.
There's no motive that links them all.
Must be the same person but he's got an interesting range of techniques.
From the controlled to the frenzied.
I can't work out whether we're dealing with someone who's ruthlessly deliberate or haphazardly unpredictable.
"As opposed to a well-rounded individual, you mean?"
Hello!
Let's have a look at this paper then.
"We'll confirm, but it could be from the same publication, Ethics Today, that was used in the ransom note."
Do you want to see something clever?
"Now, the text has been damaged by internal acids, but if we use this special illumination like so..."
Hey presto!
Have you read it?
No.
Are you anti-semitic?
No!
Is Hitler right doing what he's doing to the Jews?
No!
You don't understand.
I just wanted the facts.
Spencer gave them to you?
"While he was at the hotel,"
"Spencer took possession of a letter smuggled out of whitehall and given to him by a traitor--Rosemary harwood, and given to him in the hope that he'd pass it on to the enemy."
"After the murder, Spencer was trapped."
"He had the letter, but he didn't know what to do with it."
He gave it to you because you were the one person at the hotel we wouldn't dream of searching.
"After the investigation, you'd send it back to him, and he'd pass it on to the Germans."
Do you want my resignation?
"No, I don't want your resignation."
That's the last thing I want.
I can't do this bloody godforsaken job on my own.
"What I want is to forget all of this happened and, more importantly, for you, starting now, to be with me 100%."
"In spite of whatever problems you're going through, it's important that you and me and Sam are able to trust each other and we're on the same side."
Is that understood?
"Yes, sir."
Understood.
Good.
That's all.
Radio:
"We've known them and laughed at them, these fussy little steamers, all our lives."
"We've called them the ""shilling sicks."""
"We've watched them load and unload their crowds of holiday passengers, the gents full of high spirits and bottled beer, the ladies eating pork pies, the children sticky with peppermint rock."
"But now, look."
"This little steamer, like all her brave and battered sisters, is immortal."
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
Your father and I never had a childhood.
Nothing came easy for us -- ever.
"You're so lucky, Paige."
Mop and bucket are in the basement.
You know who I am?
I do.
Then we can forgo the pleasantries.
This war has gotten very personal for me.
"And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you, too."
I'm listening.
I'm in a lot of trouble because your Soviet Foreign Minister won't accept that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong.
I could lose my job or even go to jail because of it.
"If either of those things happens,"
I'll make sure you go down with me.
"Uh, nothing."
Thank you.
"Before he disappeared,"
Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony about his kidnapping and torture by two KGB illegals.
"The second my punishment is handed down,"
I'll release his classified testimony to the press.
"Now, think of what that will mean for you and your people at the Rezidentura -- all those deportations."
Moscow will not be pleased when they have to rebuild their US operation from scratch.
"As we like to say in America, ""Heads will roll"" -- your head being at the top of the list."
"So... you see, my problem is now your problem."
"I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad."
"I hoped that one day, we would have the chance to meet face-to-face."
I just wish it was under less trying circumstances.
Good day.
Are you okay?
"Whatever we find, I shall, of course, expect the same standards and procedures that I have employed in the clearance of this chamber to be maintained at all times."
"Let's open it up, shall we, Howard?"
You know there is a rumour that you and Carter have already broken in?
Really?
(Insect buzzing)
"Ali, hammer."
Can you see anything?
What do you see?
I see a shrine of blue and gold.
(Murmuring)
"It would seem to be an intact tomb, with a sarcophagus and a body."
"It would seem so, yes."
Then you are aware of the rules of the concession?
"If intact, the government is entitled to deny to the excavator any claim to the objects recovered."
I intend to enforce this condition.
- That's outrageous.
"- One moment, Howard."
"I understand the rules perfectly, Monsieur Lacau, but a court of law might well disagree with your interpretation."
The rules are notoriously badly written after all.
"Besides, although the tomb seems intact, we don't actually know that yet, do we?"
I suggest we leave things as they are until Howard's had a chance to open up the sarcophagus and see what's inside.
"Then we can decide what's best, don't you agree?"
Very well.
Until the sarcophagus is opened.
"Now, steady."
"Take it easy, be careful on the steps."
MACE:
Carter.
- What is it?
- Look at this.
Poor man.
"The more we go on, the sorrier I feel for him, you know."
I have to go.
Hibara-san?
Now I get it!
It's not possessing her!
It's coming out of her!
There was a monster calledEnenra that Sekien made prints of.
Something coming up from the poor mas's house like smoke to rid the air of mosquitos...
It twists and becomes a suspicious shape.
"If it is something that is opaque and easily destroyed by the wind, it is called Enenra."
What that means is that shabby houses were made to smolder.
The fire and smoke would twist around each other and produce strange shapes.
But that smoke was like a thin cloth that could easily be torn apart.
"If the wind blows, it was blown away."
It was something that was very fleeting.
Is that the smoke that I see around Saho-san?
The ra of Enenra can mean net.
"If she simply keeps thinking about the fact that she cannot get the answers to her questions, it is like her vision is obstructed by smoke."
It is like she's caught in a net because she can't even see the things that occur around in her daily life.
It is just like the description of an Enenra.
Enenra...
It is not a good thing.
"If it were a little smoke there might be some benefit to it, but that much smoke makes it hard to breathe around her."
The only way to get rid of the smoke is to give her some wind.
Wind?
Don't you think she wants some form of wind?
Sis...
Are you thinking about Saho-san?
"Yeah, I was."
I was thinking about the fact that Saho-san wants to see the other side.
I don't know what to do since she has so much interest in that stuff.
Maybe that is just because I am still immature.
Mizuki...
Well done.
"For the poorer women, this is more than a game."
It would cost a maid three weeks' wages to buy enough material to make this simple dress.
Miss Lisa Braund has personally embroidered it.
"Go on, Jack!"
"Go on, Jackson!"
"Let me take your blind, poor thing."
"Yes, in your own time."
Another traditional game was climbing a pole covered in duck grease to win a flitch of bacon.
"Come on, Zack!"
"Come on, Zack!"
"For the workers, living on vegetables with the occasional broth made from bones, a juicy cut of meat would have been a rare treat."
"Come on, Geoff."
"Well-done, Geoffrey."
"For a few hours, master and servant are equal."
"Head down, Carrington."
"And here for the first time, maid and mistress are allowed to mix socially."
"I mean, you're still sort of smiling at us all."
You sort of... you must work so hard.
"It's been a really lovely day because it's been a chance to just to speak to the maids sort of as people which is very nice, and they've let their hair down, literally."
"But, yeah, you can't ever ignore them because you actually do feel slightly because we're all these big helpless children without them."
They dress us in the morning and send us off and then at night they undress us
"I have my maids often leaning out the window going,"
"Come inside immediately and put your bonnet on."""
So it's that kind of relationship.
"Come on, Carrington!"
Come on!
"Carrington, go, go, go!"
Captain Glover takes advantage of the relaxation of protocol.
"That's not very Regency, Miss Braund."
It's not the first time the captain has kissed Miss Lisa Braund.
Uh... uh...
That was it.
"And so, who smoked cocaine?"
- Sam and I did.
- You and Sam?
"And so, I mean..."
"- Yeah, I know."
But it was...
- I know.
INDISTINCT
"I know, I know it's like hard to kind of talk to us, but, like, Lauren and I really aren't judging you."
"'This is very, very, very private, 'kind of intimate information about' really rough family history stuff."
"And we're asking as almost a total outsider for as much information as we can about the goriest, dirtiest, the most terrible things that they can remember about their family."
"And like, is there anything that you can think of, like any sexual abuse, like sort of physical abuse...?"
- Not really.
- No.
"'In order for her to say stuff that helps us, ' she has to really kind of throw herself under the bus."
"You know, she has to say all the bad stuff that she did and, you know, actually nobody wants to do that."
"And we just, you know, like always, we really appreciate your help."
- And if you think of anything...
- If I can think of anything.
- You call us.
- You call us.
It is OK.
"Like, when I say that we're available, we're available."
"All the time, we're available all the time."
"To convince Professor Dow,"
Kelly needs more evidence about Robert's childhood.
So she digs deeper into the Pruett family history.
"In order for our mitigation claims to be successful, we really have to get specific information."
So what we really need is more witness statements from family members.
"Right now, I'm headed to Troy's house."
Troy is Robert's cousin.
"Please, you have to talk to him."
Why me?
Because you suffer at his hands as much as I do.
"He forced you to marry for politics, he rejects me to please the Church and you are the only person that he will listen to."
I fail to see what argument could possibly change his mind.
"Love is stronger than any argument, is it not?"
My brother seems more guided by duty than love or argument these days.
Of course.
I have decided to set up a new trading company in the East Indies.
I personally will invest 3 million pounds in the company.
"The rest, we shall sell as shares, to the value of one million each."
"Very wise, Your Majesty."
"As for trade within France, the Crown will receive a 10% import fee on all goods brought into the country and 40% of the transportation tariffs from the Canal du Midi."
Something bothers you?
It is merely that the levy imposed on all transportation on the Canal du Midi has already been claimed.
By whom?
By His Majesty's brother in his position as proprietor of the area ofLanguedoc.
I see.
Was that the doctor?
"Oh, it's you."
"You're suffering, aren't you?"
Yes.
From an imbalance of humors caused by an excess of yellow bile.
Hm!
Or so he says.
"Well, nothing a course of leeches can't cure."
Indeed.
"And speaking of leeches,"
"No doubt, you were praying that I'd been torn apart by a Dutch cannonball."
Hope springs eternal.
"Now then, I trust you have some useful information for me?"
I do not.
My enemies might.
"Spain, to name but one."
You make such play to this queen who she and you are alike.
Is it not in how you discharge that duty where...the difference lies?
"She has always let her heart to rule her head,"
Put passion before politic need.
"If you shrink before this duty now, Bess, then indeed you risk the accusation that you are alike."
"As a woman, you are just not equal to the task."
She will sign the death warrant.
"Oh God in heaven, forgive me!"
What have I done?
"He was bound for France to collect salt, and there was the Spanish fleet."
"130 galleons, I counted."
"Like a vast floating city, they were, in half moon formation, stretched near ten miles across."
"The masts and prows are of such height, Your Majesty, such might it seems they wiped out the very sky, the ocean groaning under their weight."
The beacons are lit.
They are sighted off the Cornish coast.
Heading which way?
"Northeast, if my intelligence is sound, to anchor off Calais, to wait for the second fleet to embark from"
"Flanders here, and join them."
Then it begins.
"Their soldiers are professionals, expertly trained."
"If they get to the channel, they will sweep through Kent, crush London within a week."
"Not any of the Spaniards will get through, sir, not while I have breath!"
What word from Plymouth?
"Drake and the Western Squadron, left under the cover of darkness."
"and he means to get behind the Spanish fleet, and attack from the rear."
Let us pray to God that the tides stay with them.
"News, My Lords!"
I lack news!
Is Isle of Wight secure?
"Not barely, Your Grace."
We must all forget about it.
Okay...
"And I also have a party to attend, so I'll leave first."
Yellow Sea route near Incheon are filled with Chrysanthemums fields.
Mountain path to Seoul are also full with Chrysanthemums.
"If you sniff it too much, it will smell sour."
It seems that you have some conscience.
And you also have the guts to keep our mens' identification tags?
Do you think you can still live a peaceful life?
I have come to take it.
I'm sorry.
We didn't really have any other alternative.
I'm sorry.
Twenty!
"Right in front my eyes, my fellow comrades were shot to death."
It was hard enough fighting the enemies.
I thought our allies came to rescue us.
"We... compared to the lives of twenty one, we had no choice but to choose the United States."
They have nuclear weapons to protect us.
This is to build a relationship between the Republic of South Korea and our stronger allies.
They will become assets if we can use our allies' military powers to support us.
You did that for political power?
You know...
"We can sacrifice our lives for our country, but we definitely won't sacrifice our lives for political power."
I thought the regime would support us on our mission.
You're so lucky.
You can just sit here and command others while we're sacrificing our lives.
So what will you do now about all the lives that were lost?
!
Kill me.
Department Head?
Are you there?
They were being blackmailed for murder.
"They were unable to pay, so they decided to end their lives in order to save the family honor."
The murder of whom?
"I'm willing to wager that a relative of this family died recently but I'll need you to give me the records of deaths, to confirm it."
Of course.
Monseur Marchal?
Yes?
The palace is a safer place and we shall sleep better in our beds now that you've returned.
"Cyclamen, lilies, hyacinths leading down as far as the bottierre"
And here...
Yes?
I would like a rose bed with orange roses.
"Of course, Your Majesty."
I did not know you like the gardens.
Perhaps you would allow me to give you a tour.
I designed them myself.
"Please, do not be offended, Sire, but I am more interested in people than in plants."
"If His Majesty were to tell me of his experiences at war,"
I would find that far more fascinating.
Let us talk of war some other time.
I should like to ask your advice on a delicate matter.
I would be honored.
This concerns the Marquise de Montespan.
I see.
"As you know, we have been close for some time."
I have decided that we should see less of each other but I remain unsure of whether it is a wise idea.
I want nothing more in the world than to see my friend happy.
"However, it is my belief that intimate relations between a man and a woman should remain within the confines of marriage."
I believe you decision's for the best.
"For God, for her and for His Majesty."
I hope this is important.
You know how much I hate mornings.
"So far, her trail ends at the boat in Copenhagen harbour."
"We've intensified the search, but as I've said, nothing is certain."
I have to warn you against...
Brief our head of security and all other security staff on the matter.
"No, we'll manage our own search, and it begins right now."
"I understand your frustration, but you can't interfere in the search."
- We've wasted 48 hours.
- They weren't wasted.
We were about to tell our boy that his sister was dead.
Understand?
"I apologise for our mistake, but you'll only complicate matters if you interfere."
This is not the right way.
I can explain.
The girl was found dead in that harbour in Jutland.
"The local police found a notebook with license plates, and we were informed."
You told me Special Branch weren't aware of the case.
Correct?
"Yes, and that was a mistake."
We didn't know all the details.
"We were only interested in the book, because the PM's campaign car was in it."
"- Excuse me, what?"
- Your campaign car's license plate.
"We knew you had nothing to do with it, but we kept an eye on the case."
- My car?
I don't quite understand.
- During your last election campaign.
"You went all over the country, and your campaign car was noted in the boy's book."
The public prosecutor told us the case was solved.
It was a suicide.
We had no idea that the book was important until now.
The prosecutor covered up a murder- what difference does the book make?
"The other numbers are interesting, not least because Anders Ussing's car was also listed."
Hurry up Rex!
We need you over here.
Yes sir!
Coming as quick as I can.
Shouldn't you be at the office?
I was.
I read your ending.
You bagged it.
You were almost there.
Nowhere near.
I've been useless for weeks.
Hm?
I read the note too.
Oh?
What did you think?
Hm...everything conclusive.
"And now, when I shut my eyes, I see black."
It's not the same as being blind.
Would you advise someone who was in the same situation as you to have that surgery?
"Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it."
Why?
"Because when you live a certain way for so many years, and you're adjusted to life and everything around you, and then all of a sudden there's a change like this, it can make you feel crazy."
"If people are blind early enough in life, they do in fact lose the ability, or never gain the ability to make sense of the visual world."
"And we think that perhaps one of the reasons that happens is that the back of the head starts responding to other senses, like audition and touch."
It becomes specialized to help blind people make their way through the world using these other senses.
That can be a huge problem if sight is ever restored.
And maybe putting our efforts into making the world easier for blind people to navigate and be independent in is at least as valid as trying to fix them and be like us.
Yeung:
"Even so, for those desperate to see again, the technology we've developed can be life-changing."
Hi.
Hi.
Can you see me?
Oops.
Yeah.
So that's -- 14 years!
14 years since fish custard.
"Amy Pond, the girl who waited, you've waited long enough."
"When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool."
"She's been waiting all her life for him and so, when, finally, the opportunity comes up, she jumps at it."
And then waits another two years and jumps at it again.
"There's something weird about her, that she wants to stick with that guy."
"The previous companions for the Doctor have been a lover, they've been a friend, they've been an admirer, and Amy Pond is a groupie, she's a fan."
She's been a fan of the Doctor since she was a kid.
"And people thought she was crazy for her whole adult life because she keeps talking about this guy who's clearly a made-up, imaginary, friend."
"That's the most interesting setup for a companion that they've ever had, I think, having her have an imaginary friend all her life who then comes to life, essentially."
That's the magic of that show.
"Amy's one of those great, great characters whereby she doesn't need to be rescued by the Doctor all the time."
"Amy Pond is nothing, if not strong-willed and willing to make her own choices, regardless of what anyone else says."
She just states what she wants and goes for it.
"So when she wants to be with the Doctor, she hits on him."
She tries to get the Doctor.
"And not even in, like, an ""I love you, Doctor, let's get married,"" just in a ""come on,"
"I got one night left, let's do it."""
About who...
I want.
"Oh, right, yeah."
"No, still not getting it."
"Doctor, in a word, in one, very simple word even you can understand --"
No!
You're getting married in the morning!
"Well, the morning's a long time away."
What are we going to do about that?
"Amy, listen to me -- i am 907 years old."
Do you understand what that means?
"""Did she really say that or did I imagine it?"""
"I mean, I think I'm probably the only person in the country who picked up on it."
"So, what do you think?"
She's actually serious about this man.
Talk about shock.
I do feel for you.
"But, the thing is, you have to somehow... find a way out of it and let go of all that torment and analysis."
I know I sound like one of those West Coast self-help books.
But that's because there's one I've just been reading...
"The Power of Now, if you really start to listen to what he's saying, that you've got to try and focus on the present, because that's actually all we've got, and spiritually try and lose all that mental baggage...."
"Any poppadoms, sir?"
"Madam, for you?"
Would you like plain or spicy?
"Plain, thank you."
"-And spicy for me, please."
"-Spicy, for sir."
Thank you.
"I know, it's interesting you said all that because once I went away and started thinking about everything...."
How can I put this?
"The awful thing, or the good thing, depending how you look at it, is that I actually found that I wasn't as shocked or upset as I suppose I should have been."
"-Oh, really?"
-Which sort of suggests....
Anything to drink at all?
Small cocktail or aperitif?
"Or, would you like to see our wine list here?"
"-Just a glass of white wine, thank you."
"-And a pint of lager for me, please."
-Lager.
-Thank you.
"You see, there's something that..."
"I'm not sure if you're aware of this, Alice, but when my mother conceived me it was actually about 1 2 months before she met my dad."
"And so, you know, strictly speaking..."
We shall find of him a shrewd contriver.
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
"Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius... to cut the head off and then hack the limbs... like wrath in death and envy afterwards... for Antony is but a limb of Caesar's."
"Let's be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius."
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar.
But in men's spirit there is no blood.
"O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirits... and not dismember Caesar!"
"But alas, Caesar must bleed for it."
"And, gentle friends, let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully."
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods...
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.
"We shall be called purgers, not murderers."
"And for Mark Antony, think not of him..."
For he is no more than Caesar's arm when Caesar's head is off.
Yet I fear him.
For in the engrafted love...
"Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him."
"If he love Caesar, all that he can do is to himself... take thought, and die for Caesar."
"And for that much he should... for he is given to sports, to wildness, and much company."
There is no fear in him.
Let him not die...
"For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter."
"Peace, count the clock."
- The clock hath stricken three.
- Tis time to part.
But it is doubtful yet.
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late... it may be these apparent prodigies... the unaccussomed terror of this night... and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the Capitol today.
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved...
I shall o'ersway him;
Let me work... for I shall give his humour the true bent... and I will bring him to the Capitol.
You've got seepage.
It's affected the cornicing.
You're going to have to kick this off.
"No, I will."
I absolutely will.
"Now, obviously when you came round to the office that Tuesday and said did I want to have a sandwich in Peel Square, that was my opportunity to say, ""I'm afraid I can't,"
"""because I'm just about to go and have... sex with that red-faced man,"""
"who is my boss, who then told you to hop it."
That was a missed opportunity.
Of which there have been many.
"I liked you as soon as I saw you, but I had got a bit stuck with the Malcolm situation."
"I was turning so many blind eyes, it's a wonder I could see to put my tights on!"
"And you were quite right - he is married, and he does have children, and it was deceitful."
But it was quite light-hearted in the early days.
We'd have Campari.
"Plus, I quite enjoyed the intercourse."
Just trying to lay it all on the line.
Then we're clear.
I'll be out of your hair in a moment.
"I'm sorry about Pauline pouncing on you that day when you were having your pasty - she's a bit of a blunderer, but she means well."
"The point is, if you take me out of the picture - which you have - quite rightly - there are still a lot of ladies out there who would appreciate you."
"I know two widows and a divorcee, and that's just at Keep Fit."
Is something burning?
Chip pan!
Crikey!
Mind out!
No!
You're supposed...
supposed to put a...
"Outside, outside!"
That shirt was a bit tight.
I just grabbed the nearest thing.
That's... not true.
Really?
"It is really bothering you, you should talk about it."
"If you say something, it might become a form of wind for her."
Saho-san!
"Do you go out shopping with your friends much, Saho-san?"
"Ah, not... not really."
I went shopping with Fumi-chan and the others just a few days ago!
We found a shop that sells handmade trinkets!
"If you want to see it, we can go together Saho-san!"
Wow.
Handmade things seems to have a little bit of the spirit of the person who made them.
I wonder if spirits can actually take up the residence in certain vessels.
I have a feeling that spirits can stay in specific items.
I will have to think this over.
Saho-san...
You once said that you wanted to see things from the other world.
"But, how do you think you would feel if you could actually see something like that?"
"You really are an interesting person, Hibara-san."
"Well, I guess I would be confused as to what I should do at first."
"In the end, I think I would be happy, because I found a whole new world and would be excited to explore it."
"But, you might learn about sad events and terrible things that will happen in the future."
"And, you might also learn what other people don't want anyone else to know."
I wonder about that.
I should be able to think of some sort of way to cope with the situation with the new information I get.
I have to continue my learning without being afraid.
What if there is nothing you can do?
"I think the way you view this is correct, Saho-san."
But...
If I was put in the same situation...
I don't think it would end up like that.
Sorry.
One is that you have to be as elegant as possible
"The second thing is that a footman, if at all possible, should be seen and not heard in the dining room."
Mr. Gorell Barnes has decided to revive the tradition of turning the social order on its head... a custom dating back to Roman times.
"Trading places with their servants, the gentlemen will serve dinner to the footmen and maids."
The footmen have made it a lot less lonely for me.
I have a very good relationship with them.
"They respect me, and they've been incredibly supportive."
"Right, serving."
"Mr. Foxsmith, would you like to, uh..."
"Right, and I've worked this one out."
Could you attract my attention please?
"Red wine, please."
Certainly.
Red wine.
"Sir, you haven't actually taken his glass yet, sir."
"Oh, Christ."
"And as I was saying, blah, blah, blah."
"Sir, you have just shaken the water all over the table there, sir."
There's a certain elegance required to shake water back into the cooler.
"Yes, yeah, I'm getting there."
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"Oh, thank you."
Mrs. Rogers takes the countess aside.
"As her chaperone and the master's guardian, she would be handsomely rewarded if she could bring them together."
What I was hoping to organize was to get Mr. Gorell Barnes to take you round the maze.
to go through the maze with Mr. Gorell Barnes.
Fine.
"Well, that's what I imagined."
"And it works out quite nicely, because you kind of fall into"
like if there are guests or something like that.
"I think one of the guests once said to me,"
"""Well, you and your husband..."""
"Mr. Sheridan wasn't the only recipient of Jeanette's favors, was he?"
Having an affair with your sister-in-law isn't very nice.
That's more in Father Sullivan's area than mine.
"Your brother and your wife, they don't know,"
I presume?
Inspector...
Don't try and protest.
We' got a witness from the hotel.
It's not what it seems.
"No, well it's not for me to judge, is it, sir."
I mean we must face these things ourselves.
"Mea Culpa, as they used to say."
"Anyway, can you tell me where you were the night your sister- in -law was killed?"
"I was here, my wife was at a charity dinner."
My children were at a party.
Are you reduced to throwing accusations at anyone who spent the evening alone?
"No not anyone, Mr. Barr."
Shall I tell you what I've got.
Now I don't know what happened the first time around with Harriet but you got away with it.
You seemed to be getting away with it the second time around.
"Be that as it may,"
"let's look at it another way, shall we?"
We've got proof that you spent the afternoon in bed with your sister-in-law.
"Now suppose, just suppose that your brother found out."
That would be a pretty powerful motive for him to want to kill her.
Now she was a big shareholder in the company she was trying to screw money out of Barr Electronics.
That's another reason why James would want to kill his wife.
So you see.
"If I can't prove anything else since you won't budge,"
I'm afraid your brother James is looking at somewhere between ten to fifteen years inside.
How do you think he will survive jail?
"I mean you, you've got through that special school, didn't you?"
"- Yeah, sure."
"At the end of the last century, on northern Europe's coasts, lived men who feared neither God nor the law."
They lured ships towards the rocks where they were smashed to pieces.
These men then plundered the wrecks.
They were called wreckers.
The captain is their leader.
He is a brute.
His strength gives him power over his henchmen.
He has committed so many crimes that he's become almost mad.
Villagers say he is haunted by the ghosts of his victims.
His madness makes him dangerous and unpredictable.
"Le Bosco, cursed by all navies, the bad seed of any crew."
He landed there dead-drunk from a foreign ship one night with his bag on his shoulder
"He follows the captain, but this sailor, never without his knife, dislikes taking orders."
He bides his time like a vulture.
He is false and crafty
Paul.
"He, too, is a former sailor."
"He suffers the captain's orders, but grovels to Le Bosco."
He will be on the winner's side.
He is cruel and cowardly and has a worse temper than the others.
"He is the strongest, because each of the three thinks he is on his side"
"Tina, the wrecker."
The angel of the accursed
Wild and perverted.
This cruel animal is always ready.
to snap up the innocent who come too close to her she-wolf jaws.
She will show no pity.
It's a game for her to plunder wrecks and kill survivors.
"More than one dead man, his throat cut, takes with hirn the image of her magnificently shameless naked body."
THE DEMONIACS
What happened?
Nothing.
I got trapped between one woman who was advocating tougher tort reform and one who wanted to style herself after Michelle Obama.
You were gone almost an hour.
I felt like an idiot.
I had to tell everyone you'd gone home sick.
"I'm sorry, darling."
"No, stuff sorry."
What happened?
One of your new playmates has a brother-in-law who may have known my father when we were in Peru.
So?
There was a woman at the embassy.
She was a translator and my father had an affair with her.
"Turns out this woman was, I don't know, some sort of spy."
But it ruined my father's career and it drove my mother to the brink of suicide.
And I suppose that's where cousin Angus comes in.
Yes.
Everything turned to shit.
"My father ended his career in disgrace and frankly, I didn't want to talk about it in front of those buffoons."
I don't think it would have helped your career much.
Now I feel like a shit.
I won't put you through that again.
How is that possible?
Do you want me to drop this thing?
No.
You have to do what you have to do.
"I mean, I'm not proud of what Dad did but there isn't a day that goes by I don't miss him."
"We have the murder weapon, DNA evidence, the deceased's blood was found on the accused, and most importantly, we have an eye witness."
This is a particularly heinous crime.
The death of a lad who knew nothing but grief and hardship.
Such crimes make us question our very humanity.
Lorton's prints were on the murder weapon.
You just look those bastards in the eye and tell them exactly that.
"These guys, they're gonna confirm you."
But they want to embarrass you in the process.
They want to send you into this administration as a virus.
So you have only one choice.
"- Yes, sir?"
- Don't... be embarrassed.
"Two hours, gentlemen."
"It is now up to us to light the spark... which will result in a moral uprising, so that we may have... a new birth of national honesty... and decency."
And sometimes in this process... you will question even yourselves.
"And that's good, that's healthy."
For what are we if we are not what we believe?
Laine Hanson...
is a cancer.
A cancer of liberalism.
A cancer of disloyalty.
Her nomination itself is the cancer of affirmative action.
What we will sing with voices stentorian... is that she is the cancer of virtuous decay.
Clausewitz said that war is the natural extension of politics.
But politics is also the extension of war.
They are one and the same.
"In this war, there will be casualties."
But so help me God... not among us.
"Senator, could we have a word?"
The president canceled his golf game with me.
- He always cancels his golf game.
Don't worry about it.
- Not with me.
"- Kermit, can I talk to you a second?"
- We'll talk later.
"They'rehome, they're watching, they're proud."
"Lewis, this is it."
Stop!
Stay out of it!
General!
They were ordered to attack from the rear not sit around in Dang-po!
"They're not soldiers, they're not my subordinates, they're bunch of idiots who are better off dead!"
"We are here to kill the enemy, not our own!"
Your men were lured into a trap.
"I couldn't be more bitter about the defeat, but we must stay clear-beaded."
The enemy is still strong.
It is time for us to regroup.
We must figure out a way to redress this defeat.
Reorganize the troops immediately and contact Kamei!
I will slay Yi Soon-shin with my own hands!
I will slay every single Chosunese that comes my way and wipe out the race!
I will wipe them out!
All of them!
Let us go to Saryang.
Constable Kwon!
Are you suggesting that we strike Dang-po alone?
"Magistrate Uh, how does the tide look?"
"If we launch before the fourth of the month, we will have favorable tidal current."
"Commander Kim, let us launch a reconnaissance ship tomorrow at dawn."
"Got it, sir."
Why are you acting so hastily?
I don't understand you or the High Commander's actions.
It's the High Commander's decision.
"And as his subordinates, it is our duty to carry out his order the best that we can."
"If we engage in another battle, again the High Commander will not retreat no matter what."
You'd send him into battle in his condition?
Is that loyalty?
"Constable Kwon, Commander Yi has a point."
Even if we have all the advantages and we can defeat the enemy in
How close?
Tell me.
"That, is the Queen's private business, Sir."
We are not permitted to discuss such things out of the bedchamber.
"Then let us find the bedchamber then, eh?"
I can tell you something but I can't tell you here.
"I see, eh."
"The Earl of Leicester has been so much a loyal friend, sir!"
It's a sorry day when I listen to poisoned mouths of others!
"That you choose to indulge gives you no credit credit, monsieur."
"Your Majesty, he is not worth your loyalty."
He has betrayed you!
He has betrayed you.
May God strike me down if I tell a lie!
Who else knows?
Why was I not told?
"Your audience with the queen is delayed, my lady."
You dumb faced tone of a scallion...!
"A lying, cheating naive!"
A mangled heart is the sign of a mongrel traitor!
My fault was ever to place my trust in you!
"And if your slyness, your treachery was not enough, you dare to deny me the chance of my own marriage,"
While seizing it yourself with that shame of...!
that vixen!
"I don't offer you the chance marriage a dozen times, and a dozen times you refused me!"
And thank God for my wit that I did for my masterful escape!
You are loathsome to my eyes!
I detest the very sight of you!
I have mortgaged my life
In the hope that someday we would be together.
"I have stood by and watched while others fall at your feet, flattering your vanity..."
You did not go empty handed for your pains!
And why would he want artifacts?
We suspect he's been funding his cause by selling stolen relics on the international black market.
His known associate is Cyril Cleeve.
Cleeve?
!
What?
You know him?
I'm afraid I do.
"He was a student of mine, a few years after you."
"He had no interest in history, only in hunting treasure."
He's Lord Cleeve now.
"He bought the title, along with an estate in Plymouth."
Rather more respectable image than the godfather of artifact smugglers.
So why don't you just arrest him?
We have no evidence.
Cleeve's always very careful to layer himself.
He always uses a middleman or a stooge to do the dirty work.
By now he's probably smuggled the Ark and the medallion out of the country and locked in some private collector's vault where we'll never find them.
I had no idea that trading on artifacts had become such a problem.
"The international trade in stolen antiquities and fine art is very big business, second only to narcotics."
"We just don't have the manpower to stop every smuggler, especially a major player like Cleeve."
"So, what, he gets off, just like that?"
"Look, I don't like it anymore than you do."
"I do what I can, but I gave up expecting miracles a long time ago."
"All right, professor, what's going on?"
"MacGyver, what are you doing?"
You heard Inspector Rhodes.
He said both the artifacts were missing.
When I tried to stop that little--
"That Zavros, I saw him drop the medallion."
"Now, where is it?"
Where is it?
And gross.
"Anyway, you want to start decorating?"
- No.
"- Well, don't leave it for tomorrow."
It's gonna be a clusterfuck.
- What are you doing?
"- Uhh, cutting limes."
- What for?
- For fucking gin and tonics.
"Iâm not asking anymore, Iâm just doing, it's fucking stupid."
You don't have to use them.
We're gonna have limes and lemons and olives like every bar on the face of the earth.
- Okay.
man:
"Hey, you know what?"
I figured out Trump.
woman:
Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's the neediest guy in the world.
"Like, he's really needy and he really needs this to be president more than anything, and we're all gonna vote for him, 'cause we're a generous country and we help people that are in need."
- Maybe he just wants to give back.
"You ever think of that, you cynical chimp?"
"- No, he can't do that."
He cannot give back.
That's gonna make his hole way deeper.
You understand that?
"Google ""Trump charity,"" okay?"
"All that's gonna come up is, you know, some teenager blowing a black guy, which is what everything connects to, but Trump has a president hole, get it?"
"Nothing short of the presidency is gonna fill that hole, and he's gonna get it like he got that ten billion, 'cause when he got the ten billion, it didn't fill his hole."
"He went, oh, my God, there's still more hole and my-- my many Russian war brides aren't filling it, and you know, saying hi to my doorman is not filling it and my stupid show, I get to tell Penn Gillette what to do, that didn't fill it."
"I need to be the leader of the free world and everyone has to love me, like he knows what his hole is and he's going for it, you see?"
You don't see anybody.
You have no friendships.
And you have ruined every relationship in which you ever could have found meaning.
Who?
Huh?
Associates?
Sycophants?
Who the fuck needs pissants like that?
Good riddance.
"Me, Mom."
"You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, as usual."
Why do you assume that she never talked to me?
"Oh, I'm sure she was only too eager to fill your head with some inane, fictitious bullshit."
"But one thing I know for a fact, you only got one version of events told from the perspective of a very sad, very lonely, pathetic woman."
You insult again.
This is my mother you're talking about.
And?
Go on.
You talk about her like she's some leech that sucked you dry.
"Yeah, well, she would have done, given half the chance."
Her and everyone else.
"You know, she is my biggest regret, hmm?"
"The strongest and saddest proof that you cannot change anyone, and that your first instinct about them will always be right."
"Yeah, well, that just proves that you yourself can't be changed, either."
"Yeah, well, much to my chagrin, I prove my own point."
I always try to lead by example...
"To show everyone how I can put aside preconceptions and find new feelings, new ideas."
But the innate ineffability of human disappointment overcomes my faith every time.
So when you belittle me...
Belittle you?
I didn't even fucking say anything to you.
Yes!
"What are you talking about, Lloyd?"
Who the hell in this world goes to an orgy?
"Well, I did, as it happens, in the early 80s."
More times than I care to remember.
"And some bright spark, who shall remain nameless, who works in the music business... thought it would be really wild and retro to try and get us all back together again."
-Kind of like a fornicator's class reunion.
-With all that that entails.
"I'd say that the average age of the participants was 46, 4 7."
"God, it was sad."
"A room full of naked, middle-aged people all doing stretching exercises before they got started."
"Twenty years ago, we'd of been banging away to the Stranglers No More Heroes."
Last night we could barely keep up with Eric Satie.
The kind of thing to convince you you're getting old.
"In those days, putting a joint out meant something quite different."
"-Hey, that's very nearly a funny line."
-Thank you.
Just needs a little fine-tuning.
"'Cause you know, I'm feeling a bit creaky myself today."
Did I have a weird night.
"This Irene woman from next door turns up in my bedroom, can you believe?"
To tell me she's just got back with her husband.
"I mean, what's that all about?"
"You know, 'cause remember after that dinner party last week, she was all over me and...."
"I mean, I admit for my part,"
"I was not above shamelessly mauling her body, but...."
"And what made it worse, when she came in"
I had just been having this really erotic dream about my dentist.
-As you do.
"-Who I hasten to add is a woman, but..."
"I don't know what it was, you know?"
The fact that I'm lying there stretched out beneath her... completely at her mercy as she's leaning over me.
Her breasts softly brushing against my shoulders.
And I don't remember...
"You were there with your mother, but I don't remember..."
I don't think we spoke.
"Well, my mother..."
this is what happened.
"Before the funeral, my mother was called by a friend of your mother's and told to not show up, because your mother had requested to not... she didn't want to see my mother at the funeral."
I wonder if that's true.
That's what we were told too.
"Oh, yes, she was called up and asked that that would... that she was carrying out the wishes of your mother, and..."
"Oh, but you came anyway."
But I... my mother was absolutely furious and hung up the phone.
"So I said, ""Well, Mom,"
"""what's the point of being furious?"
"We're going anyway."""
"The casket was there, and I remember being... some arms went in front of us, and we were pushed into the side room."
You were very...
"I remember you being on the side, because I had to search for you."
"And I went deliberately to Harriet to say something, 'cause I-I had never met you, and I knew, whoever you are, you must be suffering in some way."
And she just...
"I said, ""Hello, Harriet."""
And she just stared straight ahead.
And she didn't have anything to do with me.
"And I felt really bad about that, because I went up with the best of intentions to say, ""Look, I'm not my mother,"" or..."
"- You're not, you know?"
"- You're not, yeah."
I had nothing to do with that.
"And, you know, on the other hand,"
I hadn't really made contact with her since you were born.
"And I felt badly about that, but I knew I couldn't have handled it."
But...
"I guess what I've always wondered is, are we a family?"
What are your expectations of what a family is?
"The Impreza did it in one minute 30.1, which puts it there - faster than the Aston, just behind the Z8."
And how much faster is that than the old model?
Just under one and a half seconds.
One and a half seconds faster?
"But get this, the Mitsubishi Evo VIII, one minute, 28.9."
So that's...
Can you reach?
I can get that.
Quicker than a Lamborghini Murcielago?
A very fast car.
So if you want to go round a track quickly take the Evo VIII.
Which would you choose?
Impreza.
No idea why.
"None of these cars on our board find much favour among the Guardian set, let's say."
"Whenever I go to a dinner party the person next to me always says, ""Please sit somewhere else""."
"Then they say, ""We've got a 70mph speed limit in this country."
"Why do we have such fast cars? """
"Well, the thing is you can drive these cars quickly."
"All of the country's race tracks - Silverstone, Brands Hatch, Scotland, all of them now run things called track days where you take your own car along and drive it as fast as you want."
Bedford Autodrome - Palmer sport day.
"All over the country people are queuing up to come to these ""run what you brung"" track days."
"Because the whole point of a track day is to leave civilised roads - and let's be honest, civilised road behaviour - behind."
Why do you do it?
Because there are too many speed cameras around.
"And it's a way of venting your passion to drive fast because you can't in this country any more, and why the hell buy a car that'll do 155mph and not use it?"
"It's easy to see why these ""run what you brung"" track days are booming."
You don't need a race licence or join a race series.
"It's just you, your car and your helmet."
"A £2,000 Honda Prelude and this guy think's he's Jensen Button."
I have never seen such an ordinary car take so much abuse.
Thank you!
Yo.
"Okay, so this place is leased to a guy named Jacob Holm."
Neighbors have not seen him for at least a couple days.
"Well, it probably means Addison was never here, right?"
"Okay, so this is what we know about Jacob Holm."
He worked in I.T. at a local law firm.
"That was, until he was fired for downloading confidential files off the company's server."
"Yeah, Holm's bosses agreed to drop the charges if he just returned the stolen data, but instead he turned around and leaked hundreds of e-mails to the press proving that the law firm was wrapped up in all kinds of dirt."
"They were destroying evidence, covering up fraud, even threatened witnesses."
"When the story broke, the press branded Holm a ""hacktivist."""
"He ended up serving 18 months of a five year sentence, and, uh, he was released last July."
Where'd you find all this stuff?
Folder in his nightstand.
"Ah, so he's proud of it."
He thinks he's a hero?
It doesn't make any sense.
"I mean, Holm's one prior arrest was for a crime that was ideologically motivated."
"All right, how does a guy go from hacking a law firm to kidnapping a college kid?"
"Ahoy, Captain!"
Ahoy.
"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a backseat sailor, but just want to make sure everything's all right with the ship."
"All good, bruddah."
Why you asking?
"Well, it's just that, according to my calculations, it appears that we've travelled approximately ten feet in the last 40 minutes."
What?
How is that possible?
It appears that our vessel is currently becalmed.
I would put the wind speed at a one on the Beaufort scale.
English.
"There is no wind, hence the boat isn't moving."
KAMEKONA:
Flippa!
Signals are like art--
"The meaning can be interpreted in countless ways,"
Like that statue of a giant clothespin.
"Actually, no one knows what that one means."
But sometimes a signal is nothing like art.
Its meaning is crystal clear.
You have your valet ticket?
"Yeah, I have it right here. oh, my god. damn it!"
That bastard stole my wallet!
I can't believe it!
"Oh, here it is."
"In the beginning, there was darkness... and then, bang... giving birth to an endless expanding existence... of time, space, and matter."
"Now, see further than we've ever imagined... beyond the limits of our existence... in a place we call ""The Universe."""
It is both mighty and meek.
Humanity's quest is to harness its power and escape its bonds.
Holy cow!
This is what an astronaut feels.
"It creates and breaks the stars, the planets, the galaxies... and directs their cosmic roller coaster ride."
Gravity is ourfriend and ourfoe.
"Without it, life as we know it would end."
The Earth would literally explode.
It is the magnificent and mystifying force... that rules the universe:
Gravity.
Gravity is the most pervasive force in the universe.
It is at work on massive and minute scales... on the routine and the extreme.
A surfer needs it to hang ten.
"When you ride a wave, you're going to slide down the front... and you're going to use that pull of gravity to get you going."
It's your acceleration force.
It's your accelerator.
Gravity is your accelerator.
A skier uses it to race downhill.
Great!
"Hi, this is Luke Perry telling you to buckle up... cause anything worse than slamming into the windshield... is getting a whip of Jason Priestley's breath in the morning."
Who's bad enough that every taxi in New York reaps... but now he's in the terciary level celebrity though... pouring us not to plunge through the windshield.
It's an interesting way to attempt to comeback.
It's gotta be a bummer to be all famous... be on the cover of Tiger B for one decade... and be virtually anonymous the next.
"I'd rather never be famous, thank you."
"I totally agree, but actually I think it would be a bad attitude... to cover a great cult or kitsch project and disappear... like Suburbia or somewhere in the pan-States."
It's true.
But I guess it's too easy to get sucked in.
What the fuck is a white and black cow doing here?
I asked specifically for an all-black cow!
We were expecting this.
Uh!
I hate cows!
Where is everybody?
We're completely understaffed.
Thank God!
"You look stunning, darling."
These people are driving me crazy!
- The tone art has made me!
- What did he do?
"He filed my second nail toe too much, now it looks weird."
"- It looks perfect, darling."
"- The level of my eyes is... garish blurred Mahogany rouge, totally clashes with the rouge... concolor lipstick."
"You know how my cosmetic company hates it... when the lip line is darker than the lipstick, it's totally distracting."
- He can't understand what I say!
"- Darling... it's a cover shoot, you don't have to say anything."
Don't speak.
No more.
Whatever.
Do you want to see what they want me to wear?
I'll let you tie my bikini strings.
I had copied these records word for word!
I don't believe this!
Did anyone alter these records after my visit?
I demand the truth!
Whatever do you mean?
Alter the files?
These are the very same documents you saw the other day.
Perhaps you made a mistake the other day.
What?
!
What do you mean you can't find the evidence?
You assured me that you had irrefutable proof!
It appears they have altered their records.
Alter the records?
That's absurd?
"You must believe me, sir."
You saw my copy of this records.
But I can't do anything with suspicion alone.
We are dealing with His Majesty's two right-hand men.
"Without the original, your copy doesn't proved thing."
"In fact, it will do more to prove their innocence."
Allow me to subpoena the entire Royal Repository staff and eunuchs.
"If we question them, we will find proof of misconduct in handling official documents as well."
I was terrified when you agreed with Minister Oh about conducting a thorough investigation!
The Prime Minister never misses a thing!
But the Internal Affairs is going to reinvestigate.
It's not going to help us if they call in the entire staff and question them one by one.
"No, but don't worry."
We've been through worse than this.
"The physical evidence is gone, but they know the truth."
They won't give up that easy.
We have to deliver a final blow.
"Now, you and Michael have only just begun."
To fight.
You and Michael have only just begun your marriage.
"You know, you may be my daughter, but sarcasm does not become you."
Don't throw away a wonderful relationship before you've given it a chance.
"Such good advice, Mommy."
But who are you of all people to give it to me?
"You, who wouldn't even claim me as your daughter, all those years I was growing up and really needed you."
Where were you then?
"Do you know I'm sick and tired of your pathetic little Oliver Twist routine, your poor-little-me act?"
How dare you give me that I wasn't there as a mother when I was every step of the way and I reared you fit for a prince?
"Dancing lessons, singing lessons, tennis lessons, French lessons."
I paid for them all.
"And I couldn't afford it because I wasn't Mrs. Colby or Mrs. Dexter then, but I was the exiled Mrs. Blake Carrington."
"Well, that was my kind of mother love."
"So stop feeling sorry for yourself, Amanda."
"Get your act together, or you may find that your prince has flown to greener pastures."
Do you have to go?
I'd better.
"Now, remember, you're sick, under the weather."
"Blake Carrington isn't going to force you to lie with him, biblically speaking, while you're not feeling well."
Which takes care of a couple of days.
Except that Blake Carrington is a very loving husband.
"Oh, I know, a true paragon of caring, I'm sure."
"Well, he is, Joel, I mean, he'll be worried if I was sick for long."
Don't you worry.
I've got everything under control.
Here.
These are barbiturates.
"Now, if he starts to get amorous, slip him one of these beauties."
"He'll be so drugged, he won't be interested in anything except sleeping next to his wife."
"Good, because I don't wanna blow this."
"It is the merest of consolation, but I do believe that George is repentant about what he did to Vera and Thomas."
And I suppose that's why he poisoned Henry as well.
"I'm not convinced it was him, actually."
How can you even question it?
His denial seemed sincere.
And I don't believe he would have chosen hemlock.
Nobody in their right mind would choose hemlock.
Plato did.
Or was that the other one?
Socrates.
"Yes, him, exactly."
Of course.
Of course!
And all because you stayed for a cup of tea.
"You are a genius, Mrs McCarthy."
"Socrates chose hemlock for his own execution, and so did you."
What?
Thomas Lightman showed you that the justice system you had given your life to was corrupt.
Made you wonder how many other innocent people you had hanged.
"The shock made you give up your job, the Church and embrace the bottle."
I suspect you were looking for life's exit door before you left your own party.
"But when Iris Lightman told you the name of the monster who had caused you all this grief, it was the final straw."
And you had to know George very well to know that he was Max.
"And you did, didn't you, Henry?"
What is this?
I'm afraid this is the truth.
"But you didn't want your suicide to be in vain, you wanted justice for Vera and Thomas."
"But the problem was, you didn't trust the police to deal with their own corruption."
So you had to put George on the scaffold yourself.
So you left traces of hemlock in George's house and kept the rest with you.
"Then when Mrs McCarthy came to the garden, you put it in your tea, knowing that she would confirm George had made it."
George Hammond did this to me.
No faulty circuits I can find.
Just no power.
"Damage control, report."
"All systems report normal, captain."
No ascertainable damage.
- Then what is it?
"- I don't know, sir,"
"- but whatever it is, we cannot move."
"- We're being held in place, captain."
Apparently from that solar system.
This far out?
That's impossible.
We are being held.
- Tractor beams?
"- No, sir."
An unidentifiable power.
We are the Metrons.
You are one of two crafts which have come into our space on a mission of violence.
This is not permissible.
Yet we have analyzed you and have learned that your violent tendencies are inherent.
So be it.
We will control them.
We will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities.
Captain James Kirk.
This is Kirk.
We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere.
"You will be taken there, as will the captain of the Gorn ship which you have been pursuing."
There you will settle your dispute.
I don't understand.
"You will be provided with a recording translating device in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system, but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship."
You will each be totally alone.
What makes you think you can interfere..?
"Well, Dr. Kovac, it's not something that I can really-"
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
I should get back to work.
Tell Weaver I showed up.
"Further complicating the commute, a high-speed chase is underway snarling a two-mile stretch of the I-40."
Police are in pursuit of a tan SUV suspected of being connected to the grisly murders of three people early this morning in a coffee shop off South Foundry.
- A fourth victim...
- Do they consider the collateral damage of a pursuit like that?
"They' re hoping they kill them, avoid the wasted time and money of due process."
They might have the wrong suspects.
"Last time I checked, the police were still on our side."
"- Well, what exactly is our side?"
- Tell her what happened.
"They laid us out on the sidewalk, they took us in, and they interrogated us."
- That's terrible.
- The real problem is you guys are guilty.
- Guilty of what?
- DWB.
Driving while black.
Just forget it.
The police play the odds just like us.
"They look for horses, not zebras."
Tell me you don't think that's the same thing.
"Look, it's about percentages."
Last time I flew to London they pulled two Arab men out of line for a security check.
"I hate to admit it, it made me feel more secure."
You think they'd pull over two Arabs driving through Highland Park?
"No, because terrorist acts in Highland Park aren't high on the list of concerns."
But violent crime by African-Americans certainly is.
"Like I said, we should drop it."
So you really believe racial profiling is a legitimate law-enforcement tool?
A lot of people do.
You couldn't get a rich wife if you didn't have a r--ruthless streak.
"The size of your streak, you'll be lucky to get any wife at all!"
"You haven't got one yet, have you?"
"No, but I've got one on order, haven't I?"
It's just a question of arranging delivery.
"No, she'll never name the day while she's got her old m--mother living with her."
"It's a pity her mother can't f--find somewhere to live p--permanently, you know."
"Like heaven, for instance!"
-
"- There we are, sir."
Thank you.
-
- Thank you.
A certain steel in the make--up is part of the basic equipment of the shopkeeper.
You wouldn't like to be without part of your b--basic equipment.
"No, it could be very embarrassing at my age."
It certainly could.
You could lose most of your basic equipment standing here!
I'll have to s--slacken that spring off.
"You keep saying that, but you never do."
"Well, these little p--pound notes, Granville, they've been swapped around and passed from hand to hand all their lives."
They've never known a stable home.
It's up to us to keep them snug and cosy now that they're here.
"No, this may not be a palace, Granville, but there's nowhere they'd be more appreciated."
"You may think I'm an old m--miser, Granville, and you're at liberty to say so."
Though it might get you a swift boot b--behind the bacon counter.
There we are.
Is that for me?
Oh!
Ta!
"You have to remember, Granville, that it is my heavy responsibility to train you to one day take over this entire empire."
"When I see you standing there with them big soft eyes and ice cream all down your front and round your mouth,"
What am I doing?
"The signal that the rushee looks bored in the conversation installed, and that you need me to come help you as fast as possible."
But it took you 30 seconds to answer Casey's signal.
"I think the girls are getting a little tired, and possibly wondering why it is we're practicing on a Friday night, when rush isn't until next year."
"We do these drills because practice makes perfect, if we wanna get this house back in shape, we need all the perfect we can get."
- Where are you going?
- I can't be here anymore.
This sorority has become like a job.
"Right now, I'm in college so, I don't have to have a job."
"This situation is only temporary and, this whole Greek crackdown will blow over eventually."
- Where's your ZBZ spirit?
"- I've been faking it, a lot."
"I know than loosing a sister brings up difficult emotions, but trust me,"
I am not some tyrant here to work you to death.
"Just because I'm a little older, a little wiser, it doesn't mean that I don't need some RR."
"ZBZs work hard, and we play hard."
Define play.
"Back at Polytech, we started a book club."
We could do the same thing here.
The Great Gatsby is one of my favorites.
We'd have to read it?
"It still resonates, Gatsby is like like the super rich Omega Chi wanna-be."
He threw really wild ravaged parties.
Who wouldn't wanna read about wild parties rather than have them?
Adieu mister social calendar of the greek system.
Never have in our line a newspaper to find something to do.
- Any good movies?
- I've seen 'em all.
Movies are all I do these days.
I'm starting to worry about pop corn **long?
**
How long you have to wait for Omega Chi to make a decision about you going back?
"I want him to have a nice, happy life."
I want him to do well at school and do well in life and get a career.
And work hard.
That's the main thing.
And have loads of determination in life to do what he wants to do.
And
Megan sees her family's future here in Lowestoft.
We do live here.
This town could change and develop better.
"Alone, it's not - us people in Lowestoft isn't enough."
We do need the help from politicians.
"What rescued Megan from homelessness was not politicians, it was people like"
Emma Ratzer.
She runs a local charity that was set up to help fishermen who had fallen on hard times.
"Now, it is helping youngsters like Megan, who had lost hope."
This is The Globe.
I walk past it on my way to work every day.
"I pass the young people on their way to school who are drinking their fizzy drinks and eating their Mars bar snacks, which are their breakfast."
I thought wouldn't The Globe make an excellent venue for breakfast clubs so people can have breakfast on their way to school.
We are working with fourth and fifth generation worklessness.
Four or five generations without work?
Yes.
That is a lot.
"It is, yes."
A lot of what we are trying to do is raise aspiration.
And get them to see there are other things they can do.
"A good example of one of the battles we have - we took some 15 and 16-year-olds into Norwich on the train, a 40-minute journey, and some of them had never been to Norwich."
It seems almost...
"In order to show a young person the future, you take him to Norwich."
"There is nothing wrong with that, it is a great city."
It is bizarre.
It is about getting people out of their environment and showing them that there is something else.
But you already knew that.
"They get close to the players, flirt with them; when you get the feeling a player wants more, you make sure it happens."
HOLMES:
"And the players themselves, they don't know the truth."
"And that way, they're not just more likely to stay, they're more likely to recommend Team ProFine to other eSport stars."
"Anezka told us Libena fell for Tendu, hard."
She was thinking about telling him the truth about herself.
Say she did.
Say it made him angry.
"He confronted you, threatened to expose you."
Your team could've been barred from competition.
Tendu had to go.
"Only, you didn't know where he was staying, so maybe you paid Owen ""O.G."" Tuchman a visit."
What?
!
"No, that..."
that's not what happened.
"Well, Anezka seems to think it's a quite likely sequence of events."
"All right, look, you are right about the girls, and you're right that Tendu found out."
"Only, he didn't threaten me, he came to me for help."
With what?
"The escort agency that we use, they're not good people."
Okay?
"They bring these girls into the country, then extort them for, like, tens of thousands of dollars in immigration fees."
They literally hold the girls' passports and take 90% of what they earn until their debts are paid.
"So, Tendu wanted to buy Libena's freedom."
He wanted to negotiate with human traffickers?
Yes.
"Then he tells me if they don't want to play ball, he knows enough about computers to track down the people behind the agency, and identify them to the police."
"And I told him, look, trying to deal with people like that is a bad idea."
And then to threaten them?
That's even worse.
"I don't, Mr. Scott."
It simply exists.
Artificial or a freak of nature.
The fact remains that life can exist in that area.
"Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much."
Apply a fine tuning on our sensors.
Locate any life-forms in that stable area.
"If we find any, it may not be our people."
Affirmative.
"But if the captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be."
We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect.
Shooting in the dark?
"Or stand by and do nothing, Mr. Scott."
"And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war galleys, and the hordes of Persia."
"Can't you imagine it, Captain?"
"The thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these banners."
Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly?
Captain... where could he possibly come from?
Who is this maniac?
"Better say, what is he?"
"I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable."
Not alive?
Not in the way we define life.
No trace.
Zero.
You mean... it shows he's dead?
"It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead."
"Notice the wood fire, Captain?"
"Burning steadily, ember bed glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all."
"Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present-day Earth without taking into account the time differential."
"Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all-knowledgeable."
He makes mistakes.
"Jack, you know what's happened to the force."
"Sorry, 'service'."
The Mulletts have inherited the earth.
"The villains are walking out of court with grins all over their faces, ready to sue any copper that breathed on them."
You don't get results without getting your hands dirty.
Now the rules say you're on a charge if you've got dirty fingernails.
"All right, save your long speeches for your memoirs."
What about the villians we can't touch?
"The ones having lunch with their stockbrokers when there's a murder, or an armed robbery, or a ton of coke going through the docks?"
"I got a lot of those people sent down, Jack."
"Our guv'nor thanked us for it, remember?"
The Politicians thanked us for it.
And the good citizens slept easier in their beds.
So some of the evidence wasn't kosher.
In that case the copper who set it up shouldn't complain when he finds himself on the slab.
I was doing what everybody wanted us to do.
Putting villains behind bars.
And don't tell me you've never moved a bit of evidence where it might do some good?
"All right,"
All right so I did bend the rules occasionally but I never broke them and threw all the bits away.
That Michael King?
"Come on, he was hardly a crime boss, was he?"
A killer.
"When he walked from that GBH, he made us look stupid."
He made you look stupid.
There was no need to fit him up for murder.
"What are they going to do to me, Jack?"
Stop inviting me to reunion dinners?
They might have to kick somebody out for the press and the do-gooders.
You'll do.
"Do you know, there's never a day goes by without a gaze out the window and wonder what I'm going to do with what's left."
The job was everything.
"Yeah, it's Gibbs."
Do you think she shot both of them?
We don't know.
"As I mentioned, I am serving as the secretary's public affairs officer, and he asked me to thank you for your help with all of this, and he wanted me to pass on a message that the Mayor was sorry that he missed your birthday last month."
"I, I don't know what to say."
There were complications with the second surgery.
Nothing more they can do.
VANCE:
An interesting day on the World Wide Web.
A second helping of the AUTEC file has been leaked.
Page is a table of contents listing all the ports analyzed in the file.
They're toying with us.
"First leak was Baylor, second one has got to be her, too."
So let's grab her.
Working on it.
"Work harder, Gibbs, I'm about to go down as the ass who took a fake shot in the chest for nothing."
"I think ""nothing"" would be stretching it, sir."
Where'd you get this?
Borrowed it from Wickes.
He took a good look at it right after Gibbs updated him about your condition.
"Well, that makes sense-- picture of the two of them together."
He also looked at it directly after he heard that Ridgeway was shot with a rare hunting rifle.
Can you think of any possible connection between that photo and a weapon of that type?
Picture was taken at his family's cabin.
We were on a hunting trip.
Are you gonna try to tell me that Wickes was implicating himself?
"Wickes didn't pull the trigger, but the rifle could have been his and so could the hire."
The plan was to monitor Phillip's communication after the mention of AUTEC.
"You did that, you came up with nothing."
"Sir, there is a good possibility that Wickes looking at this picture was a tell."
"I suggest that you press him further, search his house..."
No.
"Good evening, Lieutenant."
"Perry, come in."
"You don't mind, do you, Andy?"
Not at all.
"Come in, counselor."
I won't even ask who your client is.
"I was about to spring the locks on some luggage, but I'll bet a lawyer could think of a better way to get them open."
"I, uh, do happen to have some keys that might fit."
"Worth a try, anyway."
[lock unlatches]
"Well, what do you know?"
"Well, they're not here, either."
"I don't understand it, but as evidence of murder, they're not all that important."
Surely you don't think Merle could have murdered her aunt.
"As a matter of fact, Mr. Langley, from the information I've gotten so far, it seemed entirely possible."
"And this rather clinches it, don't you think?"
[women gasp]
"Of course, we'll have to establish this as the murder weapon, but I don't think there's much doubt of it."
Isn't that slip lovely?
Aunt Olivia would have a fit if she knew.
She never let me buy clothes like that.
The nature of the fatal wound indicated it had been inflicted by a sharp instrument of rather peculiar shape.
Of a peculiar shape.
"Doctor, I show you State's Exhibit 5, which was discovered in the bag of the defendant."
Do you recognize this?
I do.
It's commonly known as a dirk.
The blade exactly fit the wound.
Did you discover anything else about it which would establish it as the murder weapon?
Yes.
The blood stains were also tested in my presence and found to be the same type as that of the dead woman.
"Thank you, Doctor."
Wouldn't the devil try to trick you by also using a white light?
He is the master of deception.
You know what I don't get?
"If you're going to hell for doing all these bad things and the devil spends all his time trying to get you to do all those bad things, then wouldn't he treat you awesome when you got down there?"
"God damn it, Voo, I spent 12 years of catholic school wondering that exact same thing."
Wouldn't the devil be like:
"""There he is, that terrible son of a bitch."
"""You did a lot of bad shit up there."
"""I want to party with you."
I'm not gonna make you burn.
"I'm gonna make you a Margarita and a steak""?"
"Totally... the worse you are, the better you'd be treated."
What you don't want to do is barely make it into hell.
"Oh, yeah, you do not want to be the devil's least favorite."
"""Coveting?"
"""That's how your ass got down here?"
"""Everybody covets."
"""Get your ass back upstairs until you can come back with some real sins."""
"Shit, bear some false witness at least, you know?"
Adultery...
Work with me here.
"Well, well, well,"
Johnny Farrell returns to the scene of the crime.
"Hey, Monsignor Sullivan."
You praying for forgiveness for the 40 bucks you stole from the St. Vincent De Paul box for the poor?
"Come on, you never proved that."
October 1993.
I remember it 'cause the money went missing the same day the Sox lost the AL Championship to the damn Blue Jays.
"A Canadian team, John."
And who do I see waltzing out the side door right by the box?
"A lot of people had access to that box, and it barely locked."
Any kid could've jimmied his little hand in there.
"their best conscience is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown."
Dost thou say so?
"She did deceive her father, marrying you... and when she seemed to shake, and fear your looks..."
- She loved them most.
- And so she did.
"Why, go to, then!"
She that so young could give out such a seeming... to seal her father's eyes up close as oak he thought 'twas witchcraft.
But I am much to blame...
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you...
I am bound to thee for ever.
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
"- Not ajot, not ajot."
"- In faith, I fear it has."
I hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love.
My lord I do see you're moved.
I am to pray you... not to strain my speech to grosser issues... nor to larger reach than to suspicion.
- I will not.
"- Should you do so, my lord..."
My speech should fall into such vile success... as my thought aimed not at.
Cassio's my worthy friend.
"- My lord, I see you're moved."
"- No, not much moved."
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
Long live she so!
And long live you to think so!
"And yet, how nature erring from itself..."
"Ay, there's the point:"
"as, to be bold with you... not to enter into any marriage of her own clime, complexion, and degree... whereto we see in all things nature tends, Foh!"
"One may smell in such a will most rank, foul disproportion... thoughts unnatural."
"But, pardon me, I do not in position distinctly speak of her... thought I may fear her will, recoiling to her betterjudgement... may fall to match you with her country forms..."
- And happily repent.
"- Farewell, farewell."
She's not responsible for what's been happening!
Well then who is?
I believe another Wraith survived the crash.
An adult.
That's who you should be looking for.
"If she does not feed, how does she live?"
At first I fed her as you would any child and that seemed to suffice.
But then something began to change.
The food no longer gave her any sustenance.
There was a hunger growing in her that would not be satisfied.
I heard the stories of the other creature.
Of what it did to survive... and I was afraid that was what Ellia would become.
And so I... started to experiment.
I have extensive knowledge of the chemical properties of various... medicinal plants that grow in this forest.
Are you interested in science?
"I'm not sure that's what I would call this, but yes."
Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day and I wasn't sure that I could do anything for her.
"But... eventually,"
I came up with this.
A drug that allows the Wraith to survive without feeding?
- That's what he said.
- Is such a thing even possible?
We don't know enough about Wraith physiology to say for certain.
"Although I must admit, it's intriguing that this Dr Zaddik claims that this Wraith survived on normal food for a time."
Why?
"Well, if he's telling the truth, it might be the answer to a very puzzling question."
"Right now, our best guess is that the Wraith evolved from the Eratus Bug."
Like the one that attached itself to my neck a year ago?
- That's right.
- I hate those bugs.
"Trust me, I know."
We speculated that they evolved into the Wraith when they began to take on the characteristics of the humans they were feeding on.
"Excuse me, sir."
- Tronstad.
- Have you got a minute?
"Yes, what can I do for you?"
How sure are we?
How far down the line are they with the bomb?
Any new information I haven't got?
"Well, we're never sure."
"You know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr a sketch that we thought for some time showed a bomb, but which is most likely to have been for a reactor, as you thought."
"But if you have a reactor, you can make plutonium."
"If you have plutonium, you can make a bomb."
"Now, we don't know if Heisenberg did it to warn us, to frighten us, to help us or just to impress."
"And that's why we have to sink the shipment, because we don't know."
We do know that Heisenberg regards the heavy water as essential to his bomb project.
We're afraid.
That's the reality.
Morning.
- 39 barrels down.
- 18 dead.
- Minus four Germans.
- Most below deck.
"Third class, probably trapped in the dark, if they didn't get caught by the explosion."
"There was a man on deck who got crushed to death by train coaches, trying to get a lifeboat out."
Most went into the water without a life jacket and drowned.
"The only boat that was used was the one that was on starboard side, and that holds only eight."
"Well, head office are very pleased."
They consider heavy water operations finished.
"An example of precise warfare with the minimal amount of casualties, which has given us a huge advantage in our continuous battles."
That's Churchill.
He sends his congratulations.
"Congratulations, sir."
Sunshine?
"Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do now."
"Rae, let's put down that Jack started using heroin in late January, after the first meeting with Salazar was established."
"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Ryan, but that's not what happened."
Just trying to save us all some paperwork.
I'm okay with that.
I'm not.
I started using in December.
I've got nothing to hide.
"This office demands results, and that's what I provide:"
Results.
Fine.
Can I get back to work?
"Not quite yet, Jack."
"No, it's secure and we have it."
It will be as arranged.
He'll be here in an hour.
Just as long as we have enough time to leave the country before they let this virus out.
Please be seated.
"Five hours ago,"
"I went public with a statement that there was a domestic terror threat, but it had passed."
And now it appears that that was premature.
"Ladies and gentlemen, do we or do we not have a threat of this virus being released?"
"Sir,"
I'm afraid we can't answer that question with any kind of certainty.
"What can you tell me, Mr. Hammond?"
What few leads we have indicate that Michael Amador has the virus and is in Los Angeles.
"For what purpose, we can't say."
Then we have to prepare for defensive action here in Los Angeles.
"And for that matter, in all of our major cities."
"Mr. President, you know our position here at homeland security."
We think being forthright with the public and making such preparations in the open is the correct course.
"Again, we have to assess the downside of that course."
I need to find him.
"If you really want to suppress your cravings for blood,"
I might have the answer.
It's the prototype of a retrovirus I developed from the ashes of vampires.
I was hoping to create a vaccine for those humans who turned into vampires.
It takes a long time to produce.
This is the very last sample I have.
But the experiment was a failure.
I can't stop the retrovirus from attacking the human DNA along with the vampire virus.
It destroys everything in its path.
All my test subjects ended up turning to ash themselves.
"However, you, my boy, are different."
You're a hybrid.
"In your case, the retrovirus might suppress the cravings of your vampire half."
"Of course, I make no guarantees, but I think it's worth the risk."
"You may not turn to ash, but end up dying anyway."
You saved that woman's life.
Why did you do it?
What does it even matter?
"If you only want to survive long enough for revenge, killing vampires ought to do the trick."
Why waste time on her?
Why protect a human?
"Seeking human blood and wounding others, getting revenge on the Man with Four Fangs would be all right."
But is that what you really want?
"If you do not get revenge, what will you say to the humans you have harmed?"
Can you really stop at saying that you are different from the vampires?
This retrovirus could kill you.
"But if it works, and you survive, you'll have to decide how to use this second chance."
It's your call.
I'm in.
Here we go.
(SCREAMING)
"It's not artificial, but it's a device because you don't get tea houses in this kind of village."
I put it in to accommodate communication between them.
"They've got nothing else to do, but they are not used to having tea in a tea house."
They go home from work for their glass of tea.
Cinema imposes these devices on us.
"You can try to avoid them, but they persist."
"In some ways, it's a kind of cheating, for example, the tea house."
"I painted the walls myself, using original drawings as a model."
We didn't find anyone there to play the old woman.
Everyone was working.
She comes from a village near Kermanshah.
"In other villages, I had always found the villagers wanted to participate in the film."
"But here, they work so hard, they had no time or inclination to be filmed."
We had to go to a village near the large town of Kermanshah to find a woman for the role.
But she actually caused a lot of problems.
After two days she was fed up.
"She said: ""I don't want to act,"
"""let my daughter carry on, she wants to do it. """
It was very difficult to persuade her that she had to finish the film.
We couldn't replace her.
"Different events occur on different films, but they are not just personal anecdotes, they are linked to the local culture."
What?
"You have parents, don't you?"
Who served your father his tea?
"My mother, of course."
So why do you say that?
All women are waitresses.
They have three jobs.
"During the day, they work, they serve in the evening and all do the same 3rd job at night."
Except for your mother.
"When I gave them the dialogues,"
I didn't think they would get the meaning.
'Philip's increasingly marginal role in her life.
"'It was talked about often by friends and colleagues, 'none of whom ever had a relationship with Philip, 'but grew used to hearing about him much more than they had been lately."
'It had been months since Ashley felt any real connection to Philip.
'He began to drift away while applying the finishing touches to his new book 'and had never come back.
"'She tried her best to ignore the mounting signs, 'but the more often they were brought to her attention, 'the harder it became."
"'The most difficult part of which was her own increasing ambivalence 'regarding her role in Philip's life, or his in hers."
"'She wanted him to want her, 'and the slowly dawning realisation that he might not 'was enough to push her into emotionally unprecedented levels 'of doubt and misdirected anger.'"
ASHLEY:
"So it's cancelled, and you're suddenly leaving again?"
Looks like it.
"God, you'd do anything to get away from me."
"You see, it's remarks like that that tell me I'm doing the right thing."
Can we please talk?
OK.
Talk.
Kind of figured you would say something.
(CLICKS TONGUE) Nope.
"Actually, I do have something to say, and I imagine you'll not care to hear it, and it is this."
I'm not going to Ike's for just the week.
He invited me to stay for longer.
"- Wait, longer?"
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
"Honestly, I don't see myself returning till July or so."
"So, you're basically leaving me for the whole summer."
Not if you look at it like that.
- How am I supposed to look at it?
- Look at it like this.
"I was supposed to be gone most of June anyway, right?"
I don't see how this is any different.
"I can't breathe here, and you seem to resent my presence."
Thus I'm unable to work.
- Hi.
He specializes in corporate crime.
"I can imagine what you're going through, but we'll get you past this."
"Now, Walter told me a little bit, but why don't you come on in here and fill me in?"
"Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure what to tell you."
I don't even know what a grand jury is.
Am I going to be indicted?
Do I have to testify?
I don't know what indicted means.
"Okay, hold on."
We'll just take it from the beginning.
"A grand jury is just a jury, regular people."
"Usually older, retired people 'cause they're the only ones with time."
"[James] A jury to investigate, not judge."
Think of it as a fishing expedition.
- With a really wide net.
- But what are they fishing for?
"Have you seen anything irregular, bribes, kickbacks, extortion, safety violations?"
- And the things I share with you?
- Stay with me.
They're protected by attorneylclient privilege.
So tell us the truth and then we'll figure out what to do with it.
And you'll be there with me when I testify?
"- Unfortunately, no."
- You're kidding.
"Strange things, grand juries, kind of un-American, really, their proceedings are held in secret."
"You do not have the right to counsel, though what you say may be used against you if you're indicted."
"So, what should we know?"
I need to say something right here because I had to deal with this a long time ago.
"In the real world and, certainly, in the construction business, there is a difference between what's legal and what's ethical."
- Do you want to explain that?
"- Yeah, I do."
[crowd whooping]
It started like any classic love story.
We were on mushrooms.
And I don't think I'll ever do mushrooms here again.
New Orleans is spooky when you're sober.
"Like, it's scary enough."
"I've real estate signs that, in all caps, say,"
"""Haunted."""
"Like, you're very upfront about it."
"It's like, ""Yeah, this is a one-bedroom apartment, but you won't be alone."""
"So we were on mushrooms, and we were trying to make out in my hotel room."
Failed miserably.
I don't know if anyone else has tried to make out on psychedelics.
I had a hard time figuring out whose face belonged to who.
So we stopped.
"And in the morning, we discussed our experiences, and I said that I felt like the door was wide open in our room and there was a third presence, like a third person there."
"And he said the exact same thing, which means a pervert died in that hotel, and his unfinished business was to watch us hook up."
"And that terrifying realization actually brought us closer together, and that was essentially the beginning of our relationship."
"So I just want to find that ghost and be like, ""You can rest now."""
My boyfriend and I just had our two-year anniversary.
[cheering]
Thank you.
I think we'll give it another two years before we call it quits.
It's hard.
Relationships are hard.
And I know they take a lot of work to be successful and healthy.
"But I feel like I'm doing most of the work, because I'm fixing him."
"And I don't want to be one of these girlfriends that's like, ""I need to change my man."
"I need to fix him."""
"Because I love him the way he is, but... everything he does is wrong."
And I need to change him.
I like for people to take their shoes off when they enter my home.
I had a terrible burning sensation...
Not again.
"..and I realised, it wasn't cocaine, it was crystal meth."
In Ashford?
!
I know.
And which car park did you wake up in?
Tunbridge Wells.
LAUGHTER
"So, things are going up in your life."
LAUGHTER
"Now, Jack, tell me about your involvement with extreme sports, because I've known you a long time and you don't strike me as either sporty or extreme."
LAUGHTER Well.
"I've, um..."
I'm a terrible one for wanting to have a go at things.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I know I'm bursting with enthusiasm a lot of the time and people find that infectious about me."
"But I, for a long time, have been observing this thing on the beach, where people have kites and they go on surfboards."
It's called kitesurfing and I had to get involved.
I had to have a go.
"So, I paid for lessons and it's..."
"Well, if you were to take two really complicated hobbies and put them together, that's what you've got with kitesurfing, because I actually can't surf anyway and I hadn't really properly flown a kite, to be honest."
Do you not start on the sand with a board on wheels?
"No, you start in a park."
"Oh, do you?"
"You start in a park with a kite, which is really disappointing."
"So, we did that to begin with, and then you progress to the beach, and then you do it standing on a surfboard on the sand, and do that, and then you get the kite out again"
and see if you can hold the kite on the sand.
"And, by then, I was desperate just to get on with it and have a go."
"So, he said, ""Well, what we'll do is..."
"""The first thing is dragging."""
"And so, you get out into the sea when you're about up to here, then you get the kite going and you let the kite drag you through the water."
"If he killed Rafford, he's got nothing to lose."
"A ship this size, you can't hide forever."
It still doesn't explain why.
"Not just the murder, the malicious damage, the..."
It's not possible!
I'd better check just to be sure.
"For a moment, I thought Dortmunn might have taken this."
"If he had, everything that has happened would have made sense."
But it's here.
"It had to be, of course."
"It's impossible to open the safe without a molecular key and combination, and I'm the only one on the ship who has those."
"Well, what is it?"
"It's an energy refractor, a neutrotope."
What does it do?
I'll explain.
"I and my crew come from Destiny, way out here on the edge of the galaxy."
"Yes, I've heard of that It was colonised what, about a hundred years ago?"
That's right.
But you're still not members of the Federation?
"They've approached us, threatened, but we've resisted so far."
Ours is an agricultural economy.
We've a small fleet of mercantile ships to trade with our nearest neighbours.
"Our people live well, but simply."
At least they did.
What happened?
"Towards the end of the last growing season, just as the main crop was coming into maturity, reports came in that the plants were dying, wilting and dying."
It spread across both our continents with incredible speed.
We estimated that in under a year there would be no living vegetation left on the planet.
But did you isolate the cause?
It was a fungal disease.
"Identifying it was one thing, but destroying it it was resistant to everything"
"In under three months, half the planet was buried in a covering of slimy white fungus."
I'm sorry.
Does this have something to do with how it went when you told Donna about us?
What?
No.
I didn't even get a chance to tell her.
"Well, what does that mean, you didn't get the chance?"
"It means I went to tell her, but something came up."
What exactly came up?
What does it matter what came up?
"Well, I'm just wondering what was so important that you couldn't find the time to tell her the entire day."
"Well, if you really need to know, a murderer turns out to be working with Mike on a case he swore to me he wouldn't be working on."
I spent the entire day trying to fix it.
And I thought it was more important than telling Donna about my love life.
I'm sorry I asked.
"Look, I didn't mean to overreact."
"I've just had a hell of a day, and I'll tell her tomorrow, I promise."
"Harvey, you don't need to promise me anything."
"In fact, I'd like to stay out of it entirely, if you don't mind."
- Paula...
"- No, it's fine."
"Because, you know, I'm not the one that brought it up."
"And, frankly, I don't like you behaving as though"
I'm the one making you do this.
What's going on here?
What's going on here is you're rather keen on keeping our relationship a secret from Donna... when you clearly had no trouble telling Louis.
Are you worried that I have feelings for her?
Of course you have feelings for her.
You started having panic attacks after she left you.
We wouldn't even know each other if it weren't for those feelings.
- Then what are you saying?
- I don't know.
"Maybe you don't want to tell her because you like being the object of her attention and affection, and you're worried this will change that."
It's all the obvious stuff.
Blood was important in Philadelphia.
And I think Lou's blood had a yellow armband.
- Jewish?
- Yes.
I really think so.
"I think that was important, even though they might not even have known it was, maybe consciously, I felt it."
I felt it.
I felt it.
Frustration and failure are really the things that make you.
"Maybe he was made by being short and ugly and Jewish and having a bad voice and not wanting to be good with people, or whatever."
"Maybe he was made by that, because it made him go internal."
"So you can't just say,"
"""Oh, isn't it a shame he didn't build more buildings?"""
"""Isn't it a shame he wasn't this or that person?"""
We're made by those things.
"I think he had trouble, because he was a mystic, and he wouldn't be able to talk the lingo of the business world."
"You know, architecture is so passionless in the modern movement."
There was no sense of...
"I mean, it was all mechanical."
"And that's why the postmodern thing happened, because people couldn't handle it."
It was just so cold and formless.
"And Lou was kind of the breath of fresh air in that, I mean, in America."
And my first works came out of my reverence for him.
Good night.
"When Lou's ideas about architecture finally caught on, he had ten years left to live."
Maybe he knew time was running out.
"He never said no to a lecture invitation or a possible job, no matter how tired he was or how far he had to go."
"If they wanted him, he was there."
"One night when Lou came to visit, he made a little book with me:"
The Book of Crazy Boats.
"There was a boat made out of a spoon and one made out of a biscuit, and there was a sausage boat with toothpicks stuck in it to keep it upright in the water."
No?
"Well, I can't really blame her for not wanting to turn up here."
Merlin will just have to manage as best he can and Minx can fill in for the absentees.
"I won't be helping out, as it happens, no."
"I thought it might interest you to know that I, myself, will be joining the demonstration myself this afternoon when the show begins."
Yes.
I'll be protesting against the policies of the company that I manage.
"We have an escalation situation, Michelangelo."
An escalation situation.
We have demonstrators chanting and waving things in the air.
"We have a mob of young people, very young, crying in unison, ""To be or not to be,"" when I pass by."
"Now, I like to see young people interested in Mr William Shakespeare's verse, Michelangelo, but something don't smell right and it might just be you!"
"Come here, Michelangelo!"
"You have to take sides, brother, and I don't know what side you're on."
"See, when I was a kid, if we saw a cop, we started running, right?"
"We knew, in the eyes of the law, we were guilty of something."
Even if that something was just the sin of having a darker complexion.
"Then, one day, I made a decision."
I'd rather be the chaser than the chased.
"I made a career choice, brother."
"That's how I got the cuffs in my hands and not on my wrists, and in my hands is where they're gonna stay!"
"It is absolute mayhem out there, Michelangelo."
I have never seen such crowds.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
"And so young, the demographic."
He was right.
The boy was right.
So down to business.
How much do you want for it?
"The website, Mikey, the website."
He told me all about it.
These will be your new morphers.
"With these, and your new ranger keys, you will be able to unlock your super megaforce mode."
A mode even stronger than ultra mode?
[laughs] Incredible.
[Gosei] That's not all.
The figures that line this command center are actually keys to unlocking extraordinary new powers.
"By using them in your new morphers, you will gain access to legendary mode, where you can tap into the special powers of all the rangers that preceded you."
But it will challenge your strength every time you morph into a legendary power ranger.
"Nothing we ever do is easy, but we'll take the challenge."
Wow.
We can really use all these powers?
The aliens are in for a big surprise.
"Um, am I the only one who notices that my key is the wrong color?"
"Jake, there's a simple explanation for that."
[explosions] [screams] They almost hit the command center.
Go rangers.
"Put your new powers to use. [Damaras] Headridge's forces are making progress, sire, but we've lost some xborgs."
[grunts]
Shall I send more in?
Just do whatever it takes.
I want this entire planet wiped clean of humans.
You can't hide from your fate.
Nothing will save you.
[panting] [headridge] Seeing you cower just proves how good I am at my job.
No.
Mega blaster.
[battle cry] The rangers.
"At last, a real fight. [pink] We're outnumbered."
[blue] That's never stopped us before.
And it won't now.
Come and meet your doom.
We better go ultra mode.
"Good boy, good night."
Let me see.
Let me see.
Is not the leaf turned down where I left reading?
"Here it is, I think."
How ill this taper burns!
Ha!
Who comes here?
I think it is the weakness in my eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me.
Art thou any thing?
"Art thou some god, some angel... or some devil, that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare?"
- Speak to me what thou art.
"- Thy evil spirit, Brutus."
- Why com'st thou?
- Thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well; then I shall see thee again?
"Ay, at Philippi."
"Why, I will see thee at Philippi then."
"Now I have made my heart strong, thou vanishest..."
"I'll spirit, I would hold more words with thee."
Julius Caesar is a play about Roman history... just as the English history plays are about the history of England.
"But of course, the play ends as some of the English history plays do... in multiple deaths."
To that extent it is a tragic play.
"It isn't a single tragedy... it isn't a one man tragedy as one might say Macbeth is, or King Lear is... or Hamlet, but nevertheless... if one had to choose a single figure of the play as a tragic hero... it certainly wouldn't be Caesar."
Caesar is... the center of the play up until the end of Act III... but the figure whose story runs through the play... and whose death is the real emotional climax of the play is Brutus.
"So if this is a tragedy, it is not tragedy of Julius Caesar... it is of Marcus Brutus."
O conspiracy... seeks thou to hide thy dangers brow by night when the evils are most free.
O' then by day... when are they find the cabin dark enough to mask this monsterous visage.
Welcome to Stratford upon Avon... the hometown of William Shakespeare.
"It was in this small market town that Shakespeare was born... and it was here that he retired at the end of his life... to die, on St George's Day... a day that was coincidentally his own birthday."
You're going to have to remove the relays here and here.
That should disable the security protocols.
We can't initialise the engines without them.
What about the ship on the surface?
We might be able to salvage what we need.
Yeah.
Any word on how much longer he's planning to stay in orbit?
The repairs are moving slow.
I'd be the last to question the Captain's orders... but doesn't it seem a little odd that we're staying here... to save a nest of Xindi?
The Captain thinks it's the right thing to do.
"We may be at war, but these creatures need our help."
"Meanwhile, their big brothers are trying to destroy Earth."
Every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their weapon.
TRIP:
Look... there's a chance we'll run into more Insectoids when we reach the red giant.
Spending an extra day or two studying their tactical systems might be useful.
PHLOX:
Captain.
I've learned quite a bit about this fascinating fellow.
"Perhaps ""fellow"" is the wrong word, their species is genderless."
Then who made all those eggs?
They reproduce asexually.
Each adult appears capable of producing multiple egg sacs.
I wouldn't be surprised if every Insectoid vessel had its own hatchery.
I'd estimate their lifespan is no more than 12 Earth years.
This individual may be one of the elder members of the crew.
It was nearly 10 years old.
What about the hatchery?
When will the eggs mature?
"Without knowing more about their incubation cycle, it's impossible to say... but probably no more than a week, at most."
"Captain, if you don't mind my saying, you look as if you could use some rest."
We've got to get the repairs finished.
"I was a wuss when it came to hardcore living but I was very good observer and I kind of hung around with a lot of people who lived that kind of life and, you know, I'd sort of be the sensible one there, going, ""Oh""."
HE TUTS
"When my friends would be getting into fights, they'd more or less say, goodbye to me now, ""We're going to have a fight,"" or something,"
"""and you go off and stand over there and we'll collect you later."""
"More or less, like."
"And so you'd watch them fight and then, ""Have you finished, lads?"""
"Yeah, it was kind of like that."
"""We've had our fight now"
"""and we'll go home and we'll stop for chips."""
"You're off the drink, aren't you, Rob, completely?"
"Yeah, that's true."
How long has it been?
It's been over 12 years.
Wow!
Yeah.
Please!
This show has turned into Oprah all of a sudden.
"No, I think drinking is great,"
"I just know that when I do, there are real problems."
"This all titanium in here, where this is rebuilt."
Every limb I have is bionic because a little over 12 years ago
I drove a car into a building.
"A lot of times when I drive a car, it'll be like on a road or a street or, like, a boulevard, but I drove into the interior of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power"
through one of its walls and then I wound up in jail in a wheelchair with my limbs and...
Drive into the jail?
"I didn't, no, I was driven."
"When you do that, you qualify for a particular chauffeur service that brings you there."
Right.
You're escorted!
"Nobody else was involved in the accident, thank God, so I knew at that time it was time to graduate to this stuff right here."
"Did you think your friends were thinking,"
"""That was bound to happen to Rob one day""."
He doesn't have to pay taxes.
They won't hurt him.
"I think this is the reason why they took him, but we're stumped since none of us can read."
Here.
Did you think you could get away with interfering with government business?
Government business?
Tax is imposed by the law!
Collection is mandatory and just!
Do you contend that it is just to extract the blood and sweat of the people under all kinds outlandish pretexts?
What kind of law levies over 70% of the people's earnings?
How dare you!
It is said fair taxation is the essence of peaceful rule.
I demand that you stop this misrule and return the wrongfully collected funds to the people!
Give what belongs to the King to the people?
Now you malign His Majesty the King!
It must be in your blood to defy the government.
Very well.
I shall send you to Royal Justice Agency where you will be punished for breaking the law and maligning the King!
What are you going to do?
I must find out what happened.
I'm glad we caught you.
What brings you?
There's something I'd like to show you.
What does it say?
Tell us.
What does it say?
I have a friend.
He dries salt for a living.
He is a man of gentle soul who works hard and feels content with his life.
But he recently lost his father in an incident of brutality while protesting excessive levy imposed by the county magistrate.
He and his father's only crime is being poor and speaking up against injustice.
It is said that a governor is the father of the people.
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted.
I'd like to make one friend in this barracks.
Don't bother.
I don't like you.
I never did and I never will.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.
I wonder what they're trying to pull.
Where was Dunbar?
It sure drove the Krauts crazy looking for him.
They herded us out into the compound and put some extra guns on us and gave us the old picture check.
"You know, checking our dog tags and our pans against their index file."
But nobody knew where Dunbar was hidden.
"Nobody except Hoffy, and he wouldn't even tell us."
The Krauts searched under the barracks.
The roofs.
They even searched the bathroom in the kommandant's office but no Dunbar.
"They tried to smoke him out, throwing tear-gas into every barracks just in case he was hiding up in the rafters."
They made us stand for six hours out there until finally von Scherbach came out and gave us his ultimatum.
"If Dunbar didn't come out by next morning he'd tear down the whole lousy compound, stick by stick and if we'd sleep in the mud for the rest our lives, that was okay by him."
"He just couldn't figure how a guy could disappear from the compound and still be there, but Dunbar was there all right."
He sure was there.
"Now, let's have it understood."
This is gonna be a rough deal but we've got no choice.
One of us is gonna have to take Dunbar out of the camp tonight.
We'll draw one dog tag.
The guy who goes with it does the job.
It's rough because the Krauts are expecting a move like this and they've put on extra guards.
"Now, if anybody wants to withdraw, speak up."
Then we're all in on it.
Everybody but Joey and you-know-who.
All right.
Where's Richards?
He's waiting.
"All right, let's bring him in."
Send Darren in.
"Nina, I don't think you've met Darren Richards."
He joined us after you left.
"Hello, Darren."
Don't take it personally.
He doesn't talk much.
"Uh, something's not connecting up for me, Jack."
"You say that you weren't in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December."
That's six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one.
Am I missing something?
I was trying to pass myself off as a junkie.
I wanted to be prepared.
"What do you mean, ""prepared""?"
The Salazars lived their entire lives in the drug world.
"If I couldn't handle the narcotics that went with that territory, they'd have known I was a cop, and they'd have killed me."
I needed to be able to handle it.
"Yeah, that makes sense, but in January, when you were putting needles in your arm, you didn't have a meeting on the books with these guys-- it could have been a year, for all you knew."
What are you saying?
"I am trying to establish incontrovertible evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover-- if I submit what you just told me, it's not gonna hold up, Jack."
What do you want me to say?
!
"I did drugs to get in with these people, and I got in with them!"
"And no matter how difficult it's been, I don't use anymore."
"Look,"
"I'll write it up that way, and maybe it'll fly, but I just think you're gonna have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner."
That's suspicious.
"Rae, you know my history."
I've had a very difficult time since my wife passed away.
"If I'd told anyone that I was using drugs to develop a case, they would have misinterpreted, and I couldn't afford that risk."
And the skin is imported to Europe and Japan and the States to make handbags.
"So many of them are being killed, they're obviously at risk."
It's very humid.
And there is something bubbling.
"Wow, that looks fantastic!"
"'The whole of this region is on a major fault line, 'and has the most active volcanoes anywhere in the world."
"'Eruptions are frequent, 'albeit rarely as violent as the infamous Krakatoa, 'but even on this small island, 'there are some ominous evidences of all that subterranean activity.'"
I'm going to take off my clothes.
You devil.
I'm going to go butt naked... but with trunks.
"Oh, my God, it's weird, look at that."
"Oh, it is warm."
Oh!
That's fantastic.
You actually can't get down.
"You can feel it sort of pulling all around you, that's so amazing!"
"Oh, it's great.You also feel slightly like one of those Pompeii figures, caught in an attitude of..."
"Here comes the volcano.Actually, it's like being weightless."
Like being an astronaut.
Can you swim?
"No, if I do a one-legged side..."
"Oh, I feel very slippery."
"My goodness, they pull your trunks down..."
This weight of mud.
"'Muddy, but oh-so-thoroughly cleansed after our ad-hoc spa treatment, 'we head to the beach."
"'But at the liminal zone between the sea and land, 'we find a curious species which has cunningly adapted to this habitat.'"
"Look, more mud."
"Little creatures on it.Look at these, these are mudskippers - they're fish, can you believe?"
What?
!
"They actually come out of the water, and they've got fins like other fish, but they use their tails."
They curl their tails around and use them like springs and then leap.
Hank Williams.
"And he arrives kind of unannounced on the job and with these plans, these sketches showing how he wanted something."
"Then I said, ""Is this..."
"what are these, Mr. Kahn?"""
"He says, ""Well, this is how I want you to do that detailing."""
"And I tore 'em up and threw 'em in the trash can, and I says, ""Too late, sorry."
"We're too late."""
"You know, he'd get an idea, kind of like a wife, he'd get an idea and... it may have been a good idea yesterday, but it was too late today."
"We would spend hours deciding whether we were going to use a hex head cap nut screw or a Phillips head or a socket pit or whatever, you know?"
"You'd ask Lou a question, and you'd get a lecture."
You never would get an answer.
You'd get a dissertation on the philosophy behind the thought.
"He was just an artist, you know?"
And most artists don't have any discipline.
They just keep on going.
- Like the Energizer bunny.
- Yeah.
He just keeps beating that drum.
What was that?
"Just like the Energizer bunny, you know, on television."
He just keeps beating that drum till the battery runs out.
To have approval on a new element is... is a great feeling.
It's because it isn't just a copy of what has been thought to be what's necessary and what is accepted.
It... it feels as though you're an architect.
A work of art is not a living thing as...
that walks or runs;
"but the making of a life, that which gives you a reaction."
"To some, it is the wonder of man's fingers."
"To some, it is the wonder of the mind."
"To some, it is the wonder of technique."
"And to some, it is how real it is;"
to some how transcendent it is.
"We know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr a sketch   that we thought for some time showed a bomb, but which is most likely to have been a reactor, as you thought."
"But if you have a reactor you can make plutonium, if you have plutonium you can make a bomb."
"We do not know if Heisenberg did it to warn us, to frighten us, to help us, or   just to impress."
And that's why we have to sink the shipment.
Because we don't know.
We do know that Heisenberg regards heavy water as essential for his bomb project.
We're afraid.
That's the reality.
There's something wrong with the critical mass.
We calculated one ton of uranium.
From the beginning.
"The size of the core is approximately 1/10,000th of the atom itself."
The biggest part of the atom is empty space.
"Before they collide with the core, the neutrons move freely several centimeters."
- Millimeters.
- Several millimeters.
Even in a dense metal such as uranium.
We calculated to much uranium for a bomb to be possible.
What was our starting point?
A lump of uranium the size of a pea.
"Here, the neutrons surface   and just vanish without colliding with new cores."
"With a bigger lump of uranium, every neutron reaches a new core."
- And a chain reaction starts.
- That's correct.
Wrong.
"For a bomb, a 10 kg lump of uranium should suffice."
10 kilograms?
Then we have made the wrong calculations?
How could that happen?
Up...
Chin straight.
Come.
On the contrary.
War can be very isolating.
The Institute would provide women with a sense of community and purpose while their men are away.
- I understand that -
"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
Look.
What would Alison do without the WI?
I'll tell you.
She works all the hours God gives.
"Without the WI to get her out of the house once a month, her life would almost entirely consist of accounts and that dog."
The bushes are dripping with blackberries this year.
Hmm?
- I couldn't help noticing.
"You can see them, even in moonlight."
Are you all right?
What an absolutely brilliant man you are.
"In four days, Alison will commemorate the loss of her George in a North Atlantic convoy 23 years ago... his name carved for ever onto the village war memorial."
The very first fatality of the Great War was a merchant seaman.
"In all likelihood, the very first fatality of this war will be one too, sailing the same route for the same reason - to keep this nation supplied with food."
Which is why every pound of fruit we preserve as jam is a pound that won't need to be shipped here through treacherous waters.
"To that end, I've made a survey of the local area and put together this map of all the blackberry hedgerows in and around the village boundary."
Our aim must be to collect it all.
Frances...
- We never made jam under Joyce Cameron.
She thought it was too downmarket for her WI.
"By making it now, it would serve as a signal to all the women of Great Paxford who felt excluded by Joyce and her crowd."
It would be a line in the sand between the old Institute and the new.
A line in the sand made of jam!
There's miles of it.
- And very few of us.
We can't be daunted at the first hurdle.
Others will answer the call.
I was petrified.
Hugh Grant.
"He likes your mum, and I think she's keen on him."
She's not keen on him!
She's only keen on me!

From busking because you had to four and a half years ago in Manchester to busking for fun with Grace Jones at 4:00 in the morning last night.
What a strange and wonderful journey you've had.
It's a nice couple of bookends that you...
A way of putting it.
Proof that good things do happen to good people.
"We're going to talk to you and find out where you were, where you're at and where you're going in the next half hour."
"So it's been about four and a half years since you've released ""EP1""."
"Can you remember a time before you were ""Badly Drawn Boy"" as such."
It crosses my mind a lot that kind of question because I remember reading something Bob Dylan said in an interview recently that he cannot remember being not famous.
- Not famous.
This is someone who's been famous since the '60s and I was born in the '60s.
I can sort of relate to it even though it's only been four years.
"It's a nice way of putting it, the way Dylan said it."
It made me think.
I sort of feel like that myself.
I didn't know whether I felt right about that.
I've often thought and looked back when I held that first EP in my hand and remembered the feelings that surrounded that time.
- Simple pleasures.
- Yeah.
"Do you allow much time for yourself to reflect, to romanticize those moments before you had the pressures of being an established record selling artist?"
"I can sort of do it, because I'm still close to obviously my family, parents and my brother, who I used to work with before this happened."
"So whenever I see them I'll talk to them, which is quite regularly at least a few times a week."
DS Arnott?
No.
"Christ sake, Steve."
"Well, I feel this meeting's been remarkably successful and I'll be very happy to record, in writing, that it's been a healing process for all parties."
I'd also prefer it if you'd consider closing the matter of DS Arnott's sexual impropriety.
I don't intend to make a statement of evidence.
"The people that actually did the crime that I was imprisoned for, they're still out there."
"Superintendent, you uphold the integrity of the police service."
"If you held one iota of doubt about my conviction, no officer would be more troubled by that than you."
No officer would do more to right that wrong.
I plan to move on with my life.
"You won't move on, Steve, until you stop chasing me and you start chasing your real enemies."
"For Christ's sake, son, what was in that phone?"
!
"We've got to take that crap from her, sir?"
You lied in court!
You lied to your partner and you lied to me!
"I didn't lie to you, sir, I just don't think it's appropriate to discuss an officer's private life."
I don't quiz you on yours.
What do you mean by that?
- I'm a married man.
"- I know, sir."
"Anyway, it isn't private when it's bandied about in a court of law."
"What matters, sir, is whether I planted evidence."
Are there any forensic anomalies in respect of the money found at Denton's address?
No.
It matches the other bribe money.
Are the exhibit officer's records inaccurate or incomplete?
- That is NOT the issue!
- It's completely the issue.
I did not plant evidence.
If...
Don't worry about it.
Do you work here?
I work here part-time as a consultant.
Well...
They let me use this place to look up things when I need to.
"So, just what do you want to ask me?"
Well...
"If I may, I would like to ask about spiritual abilities."
I don't do things for people I am well acquainted with.
"If you want me to get rid of a spirit, I am going to have to say no."
That's not it.
I wanted to talked about beings from the other world.
I would like to know how to deal with things that don't have any substance or shape.
I believe in these things I cannot see.
I want to understand something about them.
That is what I really want.
"But, studying about these things by myself is just making everything more complicated."
That is why I want to hear the truth and theories about them... from someone that has actually seen them.
"For someone so young, you are way too into these things."
This is nothing that I can really talk about with you.
But...
It is not a bad thing that you are interested.
You can always listen to the stuff I talk about in the study groups here if it is good enough.
I would love to!
So...
"The advance of the populous as a whole has, in modern times, been moving back towards the primordial forest."
That is why they developed that means of survival.
Could you give a concrete example?
"For example, going to visit the so called kasumiba and dannaba..."
"Seeing Buddhist statues not usually shown to the public, and objects of worship at Shinto shrines."
The result will be that these places of worship will prosper like never before.
Sorry.
What's this about?
We're representing a class of prisoners suing Reform Corporation for abusive practices.
We're here to confirm that Frank Gallo came to see you seven years ago and admitted to being involved in a conspiracy.
"Yeah, he came to me offering to be an informant in exchange for protection from what was going on in Lambert."
And did you believe what he told you?
Of course I believed him.
"He was beaten up, and he'd been in the infirmary for two goddamn weeks."
"Well, if you believed him, why the hell didn't you pursue the case?"
I did pursue it.
"I ran it up the flagpole, and it came back down like a concrete block."
No one gives a shit about prisoners or the way they're treated.
"So, instead, he offered to inform on his fellow inmates, and then he used that to get himself transferred."
Exactly.
"Now, if you don't mind."
"Well, Danielle, in fact, I do mind."
"You see, I do give a shit about how prisoners are treated, which means you are gonna tell the court exactly what you just told us."
Did you not hear what I just said?
It came back down on me like a concrete block.
This is my career.
I...
I am not gonna go on record and jeopardize it.
"Well, then this is gonna go one of two ways."
"You give us your records, and we submit them quietly..."
Or we subpoena your records under the Freedom of Information Act and put you on the stand.
"And seeing as you're afraid of ruining your career,"
I suggest you go with option A.

You're a couple of little shits.
"Good, you're here."
"Listen, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about."
"- Harvey, it's gonna have to wait."
"- Donna, it's important."
Last week my daughter joined your Marcel's class.
I'd like to see him.
"My daughter keeps saying how kind and agreeable he is, that they have made friends and he invited her to the cinema..."
"He showed her Nitra, just as a friend, nothing special..."
That does surprise me!
"She's glad someone is taking care of her, I think it was a friendly gesture, as one classmate to another..."
"That's nice, but a little surprising."
"At that age it's usually girls who make friends, I'm surprised that Marcel... I've never heard..."
"He's very shy, he keeps his distance from girls."
Our Katka isn't at all shy and she talks in a friendly way about him.
"I just wanted to say, we are going abroad for two years, and for that time we are leaving her with her grandparents."
"But yesterday grandma was worried, because their form was having a party, and our Katka came home around eleven."
"Grandma was anxious, so I wanted to know, whether Marcel came at that time, or the whole form so late, whether they had permission, or... lf you're home late from the cinema, do your parents make a fuss?"
"I don't go to the cinema, but when I stayed at that party... mum asked where l'd been, whether I wasn't drunk and..."
"My friend once came home late from the cinema, her parents kicked up a fuss, she wasn't allowed out for two weeks."
She was confined to the house.
They made such scenes.
I've got an aunt like that.
"She acts as if she's terribly moral, but she tells us, I saw that girl with that boy..."
but she wasn't doing anything.
- What's wrong with that?
- l don't know.
"Our parents want us to stay children, and they just don't realise, we're already fifteen."
I'm almost sixteen.
He doesn't like dancing... I asked him what he did and he said he danced.
What did you dance?
He told me some dance...
Something that sounded like ?
vejk...
Not ?
"vejk, shake..."
"Then he showed me it, like this..."
And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!
"Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the northern water tribe."
"Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be."
Thank you all for coming to the finale
Hero of the South.
"You know, when I first started this project, there were a lot of naysayers out there."
"""You can't make pictures move,"" they said."
"""You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star,"" they said."
"""You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak,"" they said."
"Well, they're wrong."
"Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices."
And you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say.
They speak of the injustice that's happening in the Southern water tribe right now.
My hope is that their words and this epic mover will inspire a real-life hero to rise up and help.
Thank you again.
Enjoy the show.
"When last we left our hero, be was captured by the evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird."
"Amazingly, with the power of his whistling,"
Nuktuk escaped...
And decided to seek out counsel.
"Thank you, wise sage."
I will travel to Republic City and seek help.
Have a seat.
I'm just working on a cure for the common cold.
No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles.
"Mr. President, there's something more important than the sniffles right now."
I need your help to stop the evil Unalaq.
"Did you say ""help""?"
"If there is one thing I love doing, it's helping people."
"The seal line seemed a bit far-fetched, but the portrayal of this president is right on the money."
I think this is your best mover yet.
I just wish Mako was here to see it.
"""why made clear tome was that there's nothing else that can do here."
The rhino Claytor and Rachlow are searching for is an adult female named Zola.
"Even though she was dehorned, she was shot and badly wounded by poachers."
"In the vast 5000 square mile park, the only way to locate individual animals is from the air."
"Even then, it's no easy matter."
We're starting to get a signal.
Okay
"Once we get a little bit closer, we can listen out of both wings... and we wanna balance the volume that comes in on the two wings and that'll keep us going right towards it..."
Okey
"Geez, it's hard to see through this bush, isn't it?"
"Okay, straight..."
Real close real close directly under us.
Nothing under us on the left.
It's quite possible that her collar has come off.
It's come off several of the other animals.
So what we'll need to do is just come in on foot and find the collar or find the animal.
"But, you know, now we know the area."
"With the help of expert trackers, the search for Zola continues on foot."
Dr. Michael Kock is the veterinarian for Zimbabwe's national park.
"Once they find the rhino,"
Dr. Kock will shoot her with a tranquilizer dart so he can treat her gunshot wounds.
I need...
The hole is swollen here.
That's from a gunshot there?
"What I need is, I need an eye cover"
My shirt?
She looks good.
You can see she's done some wearing here around the edges.
"If Zola had died, the poachers would probably have cut off what was left of her horn to sell."
"Still, dehorning does appear to reduce poaching overall."
It's easy to want to take an emotional stance to conserving these animals.
"And if you take that stance, dehorning is hard to justify."
How to find the road?
The road and childhood
"I don't know, there are two kinds of roads."
One belongs to childhood.
"If we believe that a part of us is formed during our childhood, my definition of that road is not a great thoroughfare, it's not a motorway."
"That's fine for today, but, for me, the road is still the road of my childhood."
I never went on a motorway when I was a child.
Roads were like this one.
"It's fairly easy to appreciate a ""raison d'être"" for these roads."
"You can tell, people were tired, they couldn't climb the steep inclines, so they walked in zigzags."
The first one to do it lays down an invisible trail for those who follow.
Like someone walking through snow.
Others follow.
It becomes a real composition.
"Man's path finding, Man making his way without today's technological know-how."
The road and society
"The straight road, of course, has a simpler meaning."
The straightest road is the quickest one.
"But mazes and bends seem to me to represent the essence of our movement, as Orientals, third world people, as if the only way forward is by zigzags."
"Either it's our natural way of walking, be it in town or country, or we just don't know how to go straight."
"It's as if, on our way to our goal, zigzags make us feel safe."
Rounding bends makes us feel safe.
"So, the straight road, so strongly recommended in our poetry and philosophy doesn't seem to work in reality."
"""Drive my friends to the house""."
- Did he tell you why we're here?
- Yes.
But don't tell anyone.
- O.K.
- Well done.
"If they ask you, say we're looking for treasure."
Good idea.
"If anyone asks, we're just treasure hunting."
So do we know any more about the victim?
This is just what we were able to dig up online.
"Still don't know where the attack took place, or if he's alive or dead."
"We do know that ""O.G."" is a pseudonym, and that he's good at keeping his real name private."
"The company that hosts his live stream does all their business with him through a DBA, so we subpoenaed the IRS to pull ownership records, but they're taking their time, as usual."
Mm.
Are you sure he was in New York?
He said he was.
He was supposed to appear at a tournament this weekend at the Javits Center.
"If you want the latest, you should join the captain."
He's about to get a briefing.
"From who, the computer crime squad?"
His niece.
He live-streams pretty much every day.
"I mean, he covers a bunch of different games, but I mostly watch the Skystrike Titans ones."
And he makes a living at this?
"Well, people donate money if they like the stream."
"Plus, he has sponsors."
He says he makes even more doing this than he did when he was a pro gamer.
A professional video game player.
"It's a big thing, though, Uncle Tommy."
"I mean, these games make, like, billions of dollars."
There are hundreds of millions of players all over the world.
"There are corporate-sponsored teams, tournaments with million-dollar prizes."
"They call it ""eSports,"" right?"
O.G. was a pro-- one of the first.
But it's hard for older players to stay on top.
"You know, their reflexes slow down, they get this thing with their thumbs where it locks from doing the same motion over and over and over."
Stenosing tenosynovitis.
It's a repetitive stress injury.
"That's what O.G. got, so he switched from playing tournaments to streaming."
"He also worked as a scout and an agent, so he would find the best new players and then help them negotiate their deals with the corporate teams."
Look at you.
"So when she starts heading towards the sea, is she going towards the sound of the sea or the lights?"
"She's actually going to follow the slope of the beach, possibly somewhat the sound of the waves."
She's going really quickly now.
Look at the speed!
She can smell it.
She's so happy to be back.
"Well done, mother."
Good job done.Well done.
CLAPPING
"Some of the great scenes in nature - the power of maternity and the power of instinct and the fitness for purpose, all come together in the turtle - almost like no other animal."
"That fitness of purpose, hundreds of millions of years."
"Are there still lots of mysteries surrounding sea turtles, still a lot of unanswered questions?"
Absolutely.
"We know what happens to them when they go into the sea, we understand a lot about this magnetic orientation and..."
But how do they make it back?
"You stop and think about that and you go,"
"""Well, who told them they should come back here?"""
"Sure, it's natural and there's a homing instinct..."
"How is that homing instict derived, how do they even do it?"
That was fantastic.
That was one of the great evenings of my life.
I get to do this on a daily basis!
"'The hatchery is half in shade, half in sun, 'as the slight temperature difference determines the sex 'of the animal. 2 degrees is all it takes to change a male to a female."
'If only our lives were that easy!
'
"Actually, if the nest is quite warm, you'll get a greater number of females."
So have you got one that's due?
"Well, if we just wander up and down here and just see what there is, there could be some."
This one looks...
That one looks like it came out.
Look - here you go.
"Of course, if anyone had the motive to bump her off, it'd be you."
I'm thinking crayfish.
"And so it transpires that the simplest and most effective way of measuring the value of a human life, any human life, is whether anyone misses you when you're gone."
"I was only, like, seven or eight when she took off."
"Yeah, but you must be able to remember stuff about her, right?"
The stuff you used to do together.
Or her favourite thing to cook?
No.
Nothing.
"At the very least, we all like to think, surely, that someone will grieve for us when we're gone."
"I think what Arlo is trying to say is that if you could focus on your Mum for a minute, get a clear picture of her in your mind, then you might actually start to feel something."
Why?
Because she's your mother.
"Yeah, and if you don't deal with grief properly then..."
"And trust us, it'll come out in all sorts of weird different ways."
"And you can end up suddenly living here, for example, because your Dad was in the denial stage and made a very rash decision."
I'm not in denial.
"It's just like, for me she's been dead a long, long time."
"If you guys want to get all choked up about it, go for it."
But I'm over it.
Mind you...
"There's gotta be some upsides to losing your mother, right?"
"Like, did people give you money and stuff?"
"No, I don't know, on the Kubler-Ross grief front, she hasn't even made it onto the scale."
Except maybe grief times ten.
She's certainly mystery.
"No, she's a heartless, soulless cow."
"Whoa, everyone has their own process."
Right?
"I mean, you didn't talk to anyone for two days after Mum died."
"Yeah, so?"
At least I didn't burst into tears every time I saw a photo of her or even when someone mentioned her name.
You sound like Fireman Sam.
"""Great fires of London."""
"""Naughty Norman Price."""
"The nurse took one look at it, it was quite swollen and very, very shiny."
You're going to have them until you die.
Can you tell me about creamed spinach?
What's your relationship with creamed spinach?
I told a ridiculous lie for no reason.
"Most lies benefit someone... and it's one of those things, my ex-boyfriend's parents came round for dinner"
"- I'm still very good friends with him, and I was very honest and I said, ""Oh, no, I've just bought all this"
"""from Marks', I'm going to put it all in the oven""."
"I'm not a liar, normally!"
"And they were like, ""Oh, all right""."
"And then as I served it up, everything I served up, my ex-boyfriend's mum said, ""Oh, did you make this yourself?"""
"And I said, ""No, no, I didn't""."
"And then I served another thing up, she said, ""Did you make the carrots?"
"This is lovely"", and I went, ""No, it's still Marks'."
"""Everything is still..."
"It's all from Marks'""."
"And the last thing I served up was creamed spinach and she went,"
"""This is delicious, did you make this?"""
"And it wound me up so much and I don't know why I said, ""No,"
"""my flatmate made it"", which doesn't benefit me, doesn't make me look better, it's just sort of saying, ""I know someone who cooks""."
"And she was like, ""Oh, that's lovely""."
My flatmate wasn't in and she was my best friend.
"So we have this dinner, all the while I'm going to the kitchen, texting my best friend and my flatmate going, ""Please call me,"
"""don't come back yet, you need to know how to cook creamed spinach""."
"""Go learn how to cook it""."
"And then she doesn't text back, she doesn't call me, and then I hear the keys in the door and genuinely, I get like perve-lip, you know when you sweat so much..."
"I was terrified, she came in and was like, ""Hey""."
"I was like, ""Hey, how you doing?"" and she didn't even make eye contact with me, and she was like, ""Hello, hello."""
"And it was about five minutes, all of, like, talking like this and then my ex-boyfriend's mum went,"
"It was almost impossible, a building for a country like ours."
"In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields."
"And since we invited him here, he felt that he has got a responsibility."
He wanted to be Moses here.
He gave us democracy.
He is not a political man.
"But in disguise, he has given us the institution for democracy from where we can rise."
And that weight is so relevant.
He didn't care for how much money this country has or whether he will able to ever... ever finish this building.
"But somehow he has been able to do it, build it here."
"And this is the largest project he has, got, in here, the poorest country in the world."
So I think...
- It cost him his life.
- Yeah.
He paid.
"He paid his life for this, and that is why he is great, and we'll remember him."
But he was also human.
"Now, his failure to satisfy the family life is an inevitable association of great people, but I think his son will understand this and will have no sense of grudge or a sense of being neglected, I think."
"He cared in a very different manner, but it takes a lot of time to understand that."
"In social aspect of his life, he was just like a child."
He was not at all matured.
He would not say no to anything.
And that is why we got this building today.
"I have no other way to really understand him, but I think he has given us this building, and..."
We feel all the time for him.
That's why he has given love for us.
He could not probably give the right kind of love for you.
"But for us, he's given the people the right kind of love."
"That is important, and you have to understand that."
He had an enormous amount of love.
He loved everybody.
"To love everybody, he sometimes did not see the very closest ones."
Why didn't you tell me about your association with Spencer?
I told you we'd met.
You told me you'd wandered into one of his meetings.
You didn't tell me you then went and had dinner with him.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Principal suspect in a murder inquiry-- of course it was relevant.
He didn't commit the murder.
"Well, we didn't know that then."
"In your notes about him, there's no mention of his arrest for embezzlement."
"Was that irrelevant, too?"
He was acquitted.
That's by the way.
"But more than this, more even than your apology to him in front of me, and something that I take to be a personal betrayal, is that you talked to him about me."
"He knew I had a son in the raf, and he could have only got that from you, isn't that right?"
"I did speak to him, yes."
And I'm sorry if I betrayed any confidences.
But I never said anything lacking in respect.
Speaking to him at all was a lack of respect and a lack of judgment.
I'm astonished you can't see beyond the front of these people.
Do you really believe what these people--Spencer and the Friday club--have to say?
No!
"You don't have any idea what's it's been like since Norway, how I feel."
"I'm not asking for any special favors, and I--I don't want your sympathy."
"But I don't understand why it happened, and I don't understand what it was for."
At least Spencer made me feel like he was on my side and that I'm not to blame for it all.
He had a reason.
"There was a reason, milner."
What do you mean?
"I don't agree with his views, but guy Spencer is a good man."
"Milner, I'm sorry to have to disillusion you, but..."
Is this the book he lent you?

Once in a while a car blew up spontaneously.

I wasnt meant to do that.

Sisters brethren.
The mayor of the city of New York the Honorable John Pappas.
"Thank you, Reverend."
I was warned not to come here.
I was warned.
"They warned me ""Don't stand behind that coffin."""
But why should I heed such a warning when a heartbeat is silent and a child lies dead?
"""Don't stand behind this coffin."""
That boy was as pure and as innocent as the driven snow.
But I must stand here because I have not given you what you should have.
"Until we can walk abroad and recreate ourselves until we can stroll along the streets like boulevards congregate in parks free from fear our families mingling our children laughing, our hearts joined until that day, we have no city."
You can label me a failure until that day.
The first and perhaps only great mayor was Greek.
"He was Pericles of Athens and he lived some 2,500 years ago and he said ""All things good of this earth flow into the city because of the city's greatness."""
Well we were great once.
Can we not be great again?
I put that question to James Bone and there's only silence.
Yet could not something pass from this sweet youth to me?
Could he not empower me to find in myself the strength to have the knowledge to summon up the courage to accomplish this seemingly insurmountable task of making a city livable?
Just livable?
There was a palace that was a city.
It was a palace.
It was a palace and it can be a palace again.
"A palace in which there is no king, or queen or dukes, or earls, or princes, but subjects all."
Subjects beholden to each other to make a better place to live.
Is that too much to ask?
Are we asking too much from you?
Is it beyond our reach?
Because if it is then we are nothing but sheep being herded to the final slaughterhouse.
"And he does that for the most part, but sometimes he forgets."
And I have wood floors and a big rug in the living room.
"And we were about to leave the house, and he goes, ""Babe, I have my shoes on, but don't worry;"
"I'm standing on the rug."""
"And I was like, what logic are we working with?"
"When he saw the wood floors, did he see lava?"
"And I explained to him, like, ""No, babe."
"""I don't want people to bring their shoes into my home"
"""because I don't want them to track dirt in."
"That gives me more to clean up."""
And he looked at me like I was explaining new math.
Just never occurred to him.
"And I also can't tell if I'm fixing him for me or for his next girlfriend, because if we break up and he starts dating somebody else, he's gonna take his shoes off at the door."
"And she's gonna be like, ""He's so clean."
"He's so conscientious."""
"No, bitch, that was me."
I did that.
"If you feel like you're currently dating Mr. Perfect and he does everything right, you should thank all the exes who came before you for all the hard work they put in."
"Anything that you see a man do that's considerate, he's doing it because, at one point in time, he made a mistake, and then some woman yelled at him."
"And if you're not laughing, it's because you're currently being yelled at."
And you're welcome.
"We already did the meet-the-parents thing, which I was nervous about, because I never introduced a significant other to my parents before."
"And I think they were just happy that I brought somebody home, because I didn't start dating anybody till I was 23, and I didn't bring my boyfriend home till years after that."
So my mom's request for a person got broader and broader as the years went by.
"At first, she was like,"
"""I want you to bring home a God-fearing man."""
"And then years went by, and I didn't bring anyone home."
"And she goes, ""I want you to bring home a man."""
"And then years went by, and she goes,"
"""I want you to bring home..."
a woman?
"""It's cool."
"He arranged for a chaplain in Buchan to say masses for his brother Neil, dead since 1 306, and made grants to Dunfermline Abbey, where his wife lay buried."
"The Bruce and his advisers judged the time was ripe to ask for something that every European monarchy of status possessed - an ampulla - a bottl e of sacred oil, blessed by the Pope himself."
Oil from such bottles was used to anoint kings at their coronations.
"Any attempt to conquer the lands of a king who, by virtue of this oil, had been anointed by God, was a mortal sin."
The English kings had an ampulla.
The French did too.
"But the Scottish kings didn't, and they wanted one."
It was more than any mere status symbol.
It was a bottle full of independence from the English King.
His illness grew worse.
"""The King is dying,"" people said."
Nobody knew what he was dying of.
But this time it was true.
"He had just three months to live, but he went on pilgrimage, struggled down the south-west coast of Scotland to the shrine of St Ninian in Whithorn Cathedral."
"Too sick to ride, the warrior King was carried on a litter."
The journey took a month.
"When he arrived, Robert the Bruce, mortally ill and on the edge of the abyss, did penance."
He fasted and did penance for five days.
"After all, the Church had got him his crown."
Surely now God would take him back.
God forgive me.
I have spilt the blood of many innocent men...
"On his return, he gathered his earls around him and he spoke to them."
"""My day is far gone,"" he said."
"""I thank God for giving me time to repent in this life."
"""Because of me and my wars, much blood has been spilt."
"""Many innocent men have died."
"""So I take this sickness and pain as proper penance for my sins."""
"And he let it be known that after his death, he wanted his heart to be removed and taken on crusade."
"Robert knew he would never live to go himself, but the Scots had been promising the Pope a crusade since 1 320."
Robert died on 7th June 1 329.
He was 55 years old.
And I like them all.
But you feel the warmest affection for Miss Hopkins?
Yeah.
"Well, I think you need to tell us"
"Um, it's mattered a great deal, and so when we had our... when we sort of had a bit of a frosty period, it was quite sort of..."
"it was quite, you know... it was quite painful, really."
"Um, but we've managed to sort of find our friendship again"
"Would you be able to keep your friendship with her if she was with someone else, do you think?"
"I would think so, yeah."
There's no reason why not.
"Yeah, absolutely."
I'm not going to hold grudges or anything.
"She's a cracking lass, you know, and if she's... if she wants someone else, then, you know, then I'd go, ""hey ho,"" and just, um, carry on being friends."
"And the other day at dinner she was sort of sitting there, she kind of gave me a... gave me a wink across the table and it was like, oh, that sort of..."

Sad.
"Oh, have it washed and sent round to my tent."

I just feel really sorry for him.
"He's such a lovely bloke, and he can't have Miss Hopkins, can he?"
Mr. Foxsmith.
Do come and join us.
Sit in the electric chair.
"What we're trying to find out here, from everybody, not just you, is if there's somebody here that you really would like us if we possibly can, to sort of push in your direction?"
"Well, yes... yourself."
"Oh, that's so sweet, but... what can we do?"
It's not practical.
"Then... it seems that, uh... um, the conversation is really over."
"As I would like to get out of here with my integrity, there's very little else to say."
Are there any of the girls that you think would make your life bearable?
I wouldn't consider that because I wouldn't do a second best.
All of the ladies here are very attractive in their own right.
"If I can't find six weeks in the next year to make a record, I'm not doing my job well."
"I'd like to be the kind of artist that, on average, puts out a record a year for the time I'm considered an artist, because I think otherwise it's lazy."
"So by the end of this year, if I manage to finish this one and get it out by September it'll be three albums out, and roughly I'll be on track for that average."
Which I think is only fair to the fans and fair to me.
He's knocked that one out of the park.
His average has gone up.
That's four albums in four years and each one a bona fide hit.
"Advice, Damon, for us all to live our lives."
I'd hate to think I'm capable of giving advice of any worth because I'm in the middle of learning myself and trying to understand what it is to be doing this job that I do.
"I get asked questions by a lot of young bands, asking how to get into the business."
"I really have never got the answer, I just say:"

"If it's part of your life."""
"""If there's going to be longevity to it, you'll just do it."""
"""There really isn't a way of telling you how."
"You'll do it because I had to."""
If I became the kind of artist that sold a huge amount of records then that would be the time where I'd write something so crazy I'd make people wonder why they got into me in...
I'd want to do that.
"You're on the right path with this power ballad, mate."

"Well, gentlemen, as long as you're so dead-set against selling to mr."
"Drew, the firm of fisk and boyd is ready to make you a bona-fide offer for your railroad this morning."
Spot cash or you'll get securities-bonds.
Bonds are as good as cash if they're good bonds.
"They're not confederate bonds, are they?"
Ha ha ha!
"Well, that would certainly be a good joke on us."
"Oh, no."
We're not questioning your financial status.
But we're not selling to anyone.
We're in the railroad business to stay.
"Our firm intends going into the transportation business, too."
"If we could afford your railroad, we were going to build a line of boats connecting it with new york."
"Figuring on bucking drew, eh?"
"Gentlemen, you run a good railroad."
"Drew runs bad boats, but he makes all the money."
There's no argument about it.
He's got you over a barrel with your pockets turned inside out.
"As long as these gentlemen like their cards and have all the partners they want, we'd be better off playing poker with mr."
Drew.
What makes you think that he'd sell to you if he won't to us?
I got an idea i can make drew sell.
"What is your idea, mr."
"You know, an unsinkable ship."
"Sorry, did you say unthinkable ship or an unsinkable ship?"
I used to live in a share house and mine just wouldn't flush.
"Mine would do the thing where they would go down the pipe and you'd be like, ""Well, that's good"""

"So I was working in Australia and some sort of bacterial infection swept through the hotel, but I got it worse than everyone and I was on the loo for about three days, but then about every six hours, I would vomit as well"

"In that moment, you have to make this decision which..."
Cos the sink and the bathroom are too far away.
You have to decide which of these would I like to clean up less and obviously hedged my bets and tried to send it down the proverbial gap.
there is a small gap that exists there and...
"So we're sitting there, having failed with that, and it's quite a posh hotel and there's a phone beside the loo and my mother likes to ring me and just tell me how lucky I am"
and how well everything's going and she rings and tells me how lucky I am as I'm looking down at my own barf-covered unit.
I'm out.
Sorry.
That was awesome.
Feep!

"The source of the film is a book called About a Boy by Nick Hornby, which came out in England about seven years ago."
"It was a huge hit there, and did very well here."
"Nick Hornby also wrote ""High Fidelity"" and, most recently, ""How to be Good""."
"He kind of addresses man's fate  especially a 30-something man's fate, in the modern world."
I've always loved Nick Hornby.
"He gets London life so right  and is so funny about it, particularly male, bachelor, single London life  which I know extremely well."
"So, I thought, ""This is right up my alley."" On top of that it's actually quite moving, and I've never done moving before."

"Nobody was forcing them, but life was threatening them."
"They didn't have much time before the winter, they were like ants, stocking up."
No time to stop and talk.
"Their time was limited, as it says in the dialogue."
"They spend the winter months around the stove, then go back to work."
It was the work season during filming.
I put people there for the critics and people who would see the film.
"In fact, I never saw anyone sitting down in the village."
I thought people would say I was lazy or couldn't afford the extras!
"I begged them to sit still one minute, it wasn't easy for a second take."
Nobody wanted to keep still.
"In fact, we do reconstitute,"
Cinema limits us by imposing the devices of the medium.

They were all working.
We couldn't force them to take part in the film.

I want to know why Sean doesn't go camping any more.
"Now we're in the woods and you've got an erection and you and Brian May are freeing the badgers, here's a man who should not go camping with his co-workers."
"Those are good enough reasons right there not to go camping, but the reason why I've learned never go camping with a co-worker..."
"I was managing a magazine and this woman who was a graphic artist, cutest girl...."
"She's like 5 foot 2, black woman with dreadlocks."
"She was married to a 6 foot 5, red headed, bearded gentleman and these guys say, ""Hey, do you want to come camping with us?"""
"I'm like, ""All right, that sounds like fun."""
"So I go home and ask my wife and she's like, ""Sure, I'm up for that."""
So we go camping.
"It's a five-hour drive from Tucson, up into the mountains."
We go to this lake.
"We get there late at night, we camp, we have a good time, but at the end of the camping trip, because we'd driven in at night, we didn't see what was out there,"

But this really belongs to you.
You'll find a solution.
"I gave you the '25, by the way."

It's an honor to say that I know you.
Don't make yourself any more miserable than you need to be.
Leave that to the women you love.
That's what they're pretty much there for.
In my experience.
I believe that I'll need to return home to the city at some point.
"It's highly likely that I'll realize I made a huge error, at which point I might try to return to this place to see if you'd ever still care about me."
I'm fairly certain that what I just said is exactly what's gonna happen.
I can't believe you still think that's your decision to make.
Just trying stuff out to see what the right thing to do is.
Thank you.
He didn't want anything in his buildings to look like he hadn't anticipated them.
"So when something was going to happen, instead of trying to suppress it, he made more of it."
"And that's a way of thinking about things, you know,"
"- not just architecture, about anything."
- Sure.
"Any adversity, any difficulty."
"Instead of trying to cover it up, you pull it out and express it, and then you own it."
"And, I mean, you might say... it's probably a loose fit, but it had to do with his own physical imperfection"
- that...
"- His face, you mean?"
"Yeah, that the scars on a building that are produced by the way it's made should be revealed."
I think he really believed that.
It all had to do with revealing the process of what it was about.
And he probably learned to think about himself that way.
"I've never said the before, and it may be bullshit, but it's an interesting thing to think of."
"You know, you can't be stupid all your life."
You got to be smart too.
"We used to use the expression, you know, in the college... when I went to college."
"When we couldn't solve a damn problem, you know, because it was so difficult and... or you didn't study for the examination you took that morning, you know, we always said, ""I wish we were smart"
"instead of good-looking."""
That was the expression we used.
He was an incredible man who we all supported and forgave for a lot of things because of what he was doing.
What kinds of things did you have to forgive him for?
"Oh, I once... on very short notice he came to me and asked me to build a model of a project while he was out of town."
"And I went in, and I spent two or three days working on it."
I finally finished it.
"I went to bed at about midnight, and he came in from wherever he was."
"He may have been in India, I don't know."
"And he came to the office about 3:00 in the morning, called me at home."
"""Jack, this is Lou."
"That model you built is a piece of shit."" Bang."
What do you say?
It's these trees that create the greatest forest on our planet.
This is the Taiga.
It encircles the globe and contains one third of all the trees on earth.
"As winter deepens, frigid air from the Arctic meets warm, moist air from the south, producing particularly heavy snows."
"For the big animals of the forest, there's no way of hiding from the winter."
"But size, for the Bison of Northern Canada, is, in fact, their salvation."
Big bodies lose less heat and can carry more insulation.
That may be why these bison are the largest land animals in North America.
And only a large predator can tackle them.
"Wolves hunt better in packs, but there are only two of them here and the prey they pursue are giants."
A vast Arctic wilderness stretches all around.
"In it somewhere, there are bison."
"These deep tracks in the snow are easy to follow, but which way were the bison going?"
They have detected a scent.
The hunt is on.
Running in the bison's tracks is easy.
The snow here is compressed and firm.
"At this rate, the wolves will soon catch up."
They attempt a shortcut.
"The giant bison can plough on through virgin snow, but for the wolves, deep snow is a hindrance, and now they're losing ground."
The hunters rejoin the bison's tracks and the contest is on again.
The bison are the only prey here in winter.
"The wolves have no option, they must tackle them."
But bison are ten times their size.
"In winter, the line between life and death is so narrow that for a wolf, even a small injury could be fatal."
It's crucial they select the right target.
This one is very big.
Good decision.
"This is smaller, a yearling."
"Even though it's young, it's none the less heavier than both wolves combined and it is extremely powerful."
The male wolf backs off.
Perhaps he's frightened of injury.
A black bear.
And this one's hungry.
"He'll spend eight hours a day flipping rocks, looking for ants."
It might not seem much to keep a bear going.
He's not on his own up here.
A Japanese macaque is also looking for a meal.
But for these dextrous monkeys there are alternatives.
"These miniature trees, pruned by the elements, are covered in pine nuts."
Full of fat and easy to reach.
"But despite these rich pickings,"
Honshu's macaques have learned that there are even easier ways to make a living.
"But to reach it, they have to venture off the mountain peaks... ..and that will bring them into contact with people."
"No matter how wild it seems, there's nowhere in Honshu where the paths of people and animals don't cross."
"This crowd of macaques is on a mission, all heading down the mountain to the same place."
"In among the rocks, there's a pool heated by volcanic springs."
"The temperature of a warm bath, it's just the thing in the chilly mountain air."
This was once a spa for the exclusive use of humans.
"Back in the '60s, one young macaque discovered the hot tub, and liked the warmth."
"News spread, and now they've claimed it as their own."
"It's so popular, there can be hundreds of macaques here every day."
And thousands of adoring tourists venture into the mountains to see them.
These are some of the most photographed animals on Earth.
But they are not just here for a bath.
They're onto a very good thing.
Each macaque has its favourite way of retrieving the treats.
You can try holding your breath and stuffing as much into your mouth as you can.
"But if you don't like getting your hair wet, there's a daintier technique."
One for the more refined.
"At the end of the day, when the tourists have gone home, they make their way back to the mountain forest."
"But this is still a wild place, full of dangers for a young macaque."
It's no place for a swimming lesson.
There are no gentle streams here.
It's not something I was yearning to do.
"As you pointed out, I was yearning to go on with my own work."
It came as a mixed blessing.
"There must've been some pressure following ""Bewilderbeast""."
This gives you a chance to work on someone else's project.
Be creative but not necessarily under the name Badly Drawn Boy as such.
"There is a really nice feeling to doing that collaboration where you can really sort of let yourself go a little bit more than normal, where you're trying to express yourself."
I think that's why it's such a pressured thing when you're making your own record.
'Cause you are trying to explicitly express who you are.
"Or I am, anyway, because that's what I do with my music."
It really is intrinsic to my life.
It's not a side issue.
It's not another world.
It's actually part and parcel of the world.
- The truth.
"- So, it's very scary to do that and know that people are going to listen and understand a bit more about you and you'll never meet them, probably."
"The more you do the better it seems to get, the easier it seems to get."
It's like anything else.
It's sort of like practice makes perfect.
I think by doing this film soundtrack it's been a brilliant period of time where I'm far less precious than I ever have been about what I'm doing.
I feel it's a much better period of time in life and in music than it was when the first album came out.
"Did the impending arrival of your new baby boy affect your writing ""About A Boy""?"
"I know that seems a cheesy and corny question but it presents itself, so I'll ask it."
"It is very cheesy and corny, but nonetheless worthwhile."
It's very difficult to understand whether I'm affected.
I mean kids are obviously now a huge part of my life.
Edie's like 16 months old and she's just adorable.
"It's like I can't believe she's mine, as it were."
Everybody that meets her...
She just touches everybody's heart.
She's a brilliant little girl.
"She's a crazy, crackers, beautiful little thing."
"I like any strong story set in Britain, really."
"I find, the older I get, the more I want to work here  for all kinds of reasons."
I thought it offered the possibility  of breaking my mold a little bit.
"I'd just done it, to a certain extent, in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" in one way, going bastard  and in this, I thought to go shallow and trendy would be novel for me."
He is very focused and very serious about what he does.
"He's a very committed, serious actor and he has great chemistry with women."
He was wonderful to play opposite.
"He's constantly honing how he's going to deliver lines and rewriting stuff as well, so that it is perfect  and, kind of, just right."
"It's a habit I've developed always, really it's got worse over the last few films which is, to just try new stuff when the camera's rolling."
"It's really through an inadequacy of mine as an actor, which is  that I'm fine in rehearsal saying the lines as written."
It feels quite fresh and spontaneous.
"As soon as the camera turns, it always comes out, for me, rather stale."
It's just part of trying to reinvent it.
Sort of making it up again as you go along.
"Hugh was good to work with, actually."
Yeah.
"He was hard to keep up with sometimes, especially at first, because he improvises."
"Suddenly, he'll add a bit to the scene, or change stuff around."
That's quite hard sometimes but you get used to it.
"I think I learned quite a lot of that, over the three months."
"For us, for me at least, it gets a little boring unless there's a bit of improvisation."
"We like to get what's in the script but then, we like to go up to an actor and say, ""Why don't you try this?"""
"""Try an improvisation in this direction."""
One cool thing about Nicholas is he was totally game for it.
"Even when we were auditioning him  if we went off the book, he would respond as the character."
That's a huge help.
- I think you look cool.
- Yeah.
"That's it, you got the walk."
That's really cool.
Brilliant.
High five.
Because I'd been drinking.
What's your problem now?
I didn't understand you.
"We're trying you for murder, for a capital offense."
"So far, no one has had much success in getting your attention."
"Well, I've been in jail."
You've been in jail?
What has that got to do with your lackadaisical response... to the questions of the court?
I'm a little bored.
What Prosecutor Stoll is trying to apprise you of is that... we're trying to decide whether or not... you're guilty of a crime for which you should be hung.
You're gonna do what you have to do.
Do you object to the assertion of Marshal Belle... that you killed Jimmy Nolt?
That was your reply in the transcribed conversation.
Mr. Horn?
Did anybody see me kill that kid?
"There were not, and you know it, any witnesses."
I think what the prosecutor is trying to say to you is that... we would keenly like to have you reply specifically... to the accusation that you killed this boy.
You want me to say whether I did or I didn't do it?
"In effect, yes... although a plea of innocence has been entered."
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
"Now, whether you or Stoll... or that sold-out, son-of-a-bitching marshal Joe Belle... want to see me guilty, you go right ahead."
But I'm not going to give you any more satisfaction than I have to.
Whether you shoot me or hang me... or take my rifle or my horse... one reason is as good as another.
"And I believe that, I do."
That's my last word on this matter.
I want order in this court.
"In the interest of a fair trial, I'm going to suggest... there's something about our proceedings which seem to elude Mr. Horn here."
"But forgiving, I'm going to suggest... that his life in the lawless parts of our country... have left him entirely unfamiliar with the processes of the law."
And I strongly suggest... that someone who is interested in his welfare... educate him in our ways.
I'm not sure it is necessary to point out... that it is his life which is in question here.
It's cold in the night.
"I've been kind of down on my luck lately, and I want to try to revive it."
Didn't you once fall asleep during a gig or something?
Is that true?
"Yeah, that is absolutely true."
I might be asleep now.
"No, I did."
I genuinely...
"I was in Belfast, you would know the club, the Empire in Belfast."
You know it as well.
Paddy Kielty's place.
"Yeah, and it was a fantastic club in its day and really raucous, really, really lively and I remember, I had been up all night the night before and I was exhausted and I was on stage"
in front of a big crowd of people and I sort of drifted off and I remember hearing...
You drifted off?
"Yes, I did and I heard somebody in what I thought was a distant room... ..doing my material, word for word, doing it really well, better than I could do it."
"You were thinking, ""That guy's good."""
"And I sort of went towards that room and I was going, ""Who is this?"
"""Why are they doing my stuff?"""
"As I got closer, I realised it was actually me and that I was on stage doing it."
"It was sort of like an out-of-body experience and I remember just going,"
"I'd better wake up now and you know, address the situation,"
"And I kind of woke up then and I didn't know where I was in the set at that stage, I'd completely lost my way but the audience didn't seem to mind that much."
"They didn't know really, I didn't tell them either, you know, so then I was going on to Derry the next day, the city of Derry, so you'd do the two gigs together, Belfast and then Derry."
And then Galway and then Cork.
"Yes, that's right, it was a little loop of Ireland."
I did that with Barry.
Yeah.
"Friend of Ardal's, he's an Irish comedian, he's very funny."
He's funnier than Ardal but he was booked.
"So we went to Derry the next day, cos I was so shocked by this happening that I rang ahead - cos you used to stay in this lovely little place..."
"""Can I have a bed on stage, please?"""
"There's this lovely little BB in Derry we used to stay in and so I rang ahead to see, would the room be ready and could I have a little nap before the next gig so this wouldn't happen again."
"So I went along there and when I got there, there was a hot water bottle in my bed and I tried to go to sleep and the next thing, the man who owns the BB came into my room and he closed the curtains and then he tucked me in."
"I'd never experienced anything like that before, anywhere in any hostelry."

"There was molecular powders,"
"Xanthan gum, tapioca maltodextrin, sodium alginate..."
Pretty much everything you need to make awesome risotto.
"(Scott) Risotto, it doesn't have to be fancy."
"You can't really use cayenne and a blast of this or a blast of that, you know, to really mask some of the subtle errors that you might be making."
Some kind of shellfish.
Either clams or scallops or mussels or shrimp.
Everyone else can see what's in the pantry.
I can only really cook with ingredients I know about.
Innovation is going to be a big challenge for me.
Wow.
"Some half-full baskets. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Some full baskets.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you were out there&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;right now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what kind of risotto would you be doing? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Something super simple.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One ingredient.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;all the way through,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the onions when they go in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to toast the rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;add the wine,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;burn the alcohol out,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more salt, make sure&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;your stock is seasoned.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I mean, there's a lot of balance here."
Mm-hmm.
You cannot rush a risotto.
"Okay, Frank, how's your rice coming?"
"So far, so good."
What would your family think if you get sent home on a risotto?
My dad would definitely break my balls.
Dave Mack.
"Yes, sir."
Flavor.
What are you doing?
"I got some white wine, butter."
I got the morels.
I know those have a nice flavor to 'em.
- Good luck.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Felix, how you feel up there?"
Good.
Hi.
Boon
"Pick for me from your hair, a quaff"
That coats me
My whole poem and words aren't sufficient for you
Your depiction needs special language
Spun from my blood
With my last call from my mouth
With my dream paste
Guarded with my pall
And the dialect of your depiction
Come out in one word
"O girl, gypsy girl"
Put your wound over me like tattoo or Henna
Fall over me as tidings
Blessed from heaven
"If death came to me,"
I swear I wouldn't hide
"Because I gained from life everything I want a quaff, a song , and a bead against envy,,"" (audience clapping)"
"At the end,"
"I want to tell that women,"
I really miss you
It was my mother's death that stopped me from traveling
I miss her very much
I failed to write something about you.
Thanks
So Ghost Ship.
Now Ghost Ship is a movie that gets better with every subsequent viewing and one thing about a Val Lewton film is it's generally very short.
"So you could watch this thing a couple times in a day, and start to really unpack its poetry."
"The sur, surface story of the film is quite simple."
"You have a young officer who comes on board a boat, finds that the senior officer is crazy."
"The senior officer tries to kill the young officer, and the senior officer dies instead."
"In fact, it's a story that's so thin, Frank Borzage might like it."

I really enjoyed to be Support Leader.
It was great to have responsibility of taking care of Year 7s and be as a leader.
I loved it.
[Mitt Romney]
I'm not gonna let this battle be dictated by facts
I'm rich!
I've got fat stacks and super PACs
We all know what went down in that 2008 election
You're a decent politician with a winning complexion
"You're all Barack and no bite, been no change and we're all still hoping"
"That you'll shut your mouth, but like Guantanamo Bay they're both open"
"You're from the windy city, where you're looking pretty with your blowhards"
"But come January, you'll be left evicted and with no job"
Raw rhymes stronger than my jawline when I spit a phrase
Knocking you harder than front doors in my old mission days
"You see this silver spoon, this dug Mass out of debt"
It took you four years to drop unemployment down below 8%
You feel that Barry?
"You're old news, everyone's having doubts"
And your rhymes are as weak as this economy that you've done nothing about
Call me a vicious business man cause Romney's stealing this race
"I'll go Bain Capital on your donkey ass, restructure your face!"
[Barack Obama]
"They say your father was a great man, you must be what's left"
"Need to stop hatin' on gays, let 'em teach you how to dress"
"You've got the momma jeans, and a Mister Fantastic face"
So rich and white it's like I'm running against a cheesecake!
Republicans need a puppet and you fit
"Got their hands so far up your rear, call you Mitt!"
"I'm the head of state, you're like a head of cabbage"
'Bout to get smacked by my stimulus package
2 - with 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 zeros to the right.
Definitely significant because there is a decimal point in the number.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.
9 total significant figures here.
"And finally, the number here."
Zeros to the left of significant digits are never significant.
"Zeros to the right - these three will be significant because of that decimal point, which means that there is a total of six significant digits in this number."
"So to quickly review our three main cases - zero sandwiched between non-zero significant digits - always significant. zeros to the left, or coming before non-zero digits - never significant. and if zeros come to the right of non-zero significant digits, they're only significant if there's a decimal place in the answer."
So - now I hope all this is crystal clear.
I hope you're really comfortable with it.
So now we'll go on to the next videos.
"We'll talk about how to multiply, divide, subtract and add numbers that have zeros and significant figures."
"Hello, my name is Ruben"

You mean they couldn't go through a normal 45-minute class...
"Yes, because they easily got tired."
Did those health problems in children sometimes lead the families to leave the area?
"Yes, the educated class was the first to escape."
"The families that remained were either farmers, families with disabled members, or families with many children."
"In other words, families who couldn't sustain themselves in other places."
You've also been to Fukushima and measured radiation level there.
So you've seen both:
Chernobyl and Fukushima.
What do you think when you compare the two?
Radiation level in Fukushima is way too high.
It's crazy...
That's what everyone involved in Chernobyl is saying.
"So-called ""hot spots"" in Kanto region is like the radiation level in Belarus."
"In Chernobyl, people are not allowed to live in the area with more than 1 microsievert [per hour]."
"April 23, 1994 Belarus No-Entry Zone (30km from the plant) 0.232 microsievert"
"On the other hand, many people are allowed to live in such dangerous areas as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, Nihonmatsu City, and Date City in Fukushima Prefecture."
"June 11, 2011 Fukushima Municipal Moriai Elementary School (school yard) 1.383 microsievert"
I can't believe it.
I don't WANT to believe it.
I can't understand that people are treated in such an inhumane way in my own country.
"But sadly that's how it is, and the provisional radiation exposure limit of 20 millisievert/yr for school yards hasn't been retracted yet."
"Well, they say they'll make efforts to lower the actual exposure level to as close to 1 millisievert as possible, but the regulation itself hasn't been retracted."
"And children are still playing cheerfully in cities with very high radiation, such as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, and Nihonmatsu City."
"Based on your experience with the Chernobyl children, what do you think should be done now?"
Children must be evacuated immediately.
"Adults might not be able to get out due to financial reasons, but that has nothing to do with children."
"Evacuate them in units of classes, for example."
At least for a month.
"Or, considering the level of radiation there, they shouldn't return for a while."
Otherwise they would have to face really serious consequences.
The government of Belarus eventually took the responsibility to establish programs to separate children from radiation.
She has long proclaimed her innocence.
"On Thursday, FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford spoke at a press conference announcing Shakur's placement on the Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"He refers to Shakur as Joanne Chesimard, her original name:"
AARON FORD:
"Openly and freely in Cuba, she continues to maintain and promote her terrorist ideology."
She provides anti-U.S. government speeches espousing the Black Liberation Army message of revolution and terrorism.
"No person, no matter what his or her political or moral convictions are, is above the law."
"Joanne Chesimard is a domestic terrorist who murdered a law enforcement officer, execution-style."
AMY GOODMAN:
That's FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford.
"In a moment, we'll be joined by two guests: the scholar and activist Angela Davis, who faced her own murder trial decades ago, and Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney for some 40 years."
But first we turn to Assata Shakur in her own words.
"In 1998, Democracy Now! aired her reading an open letter to Pope John Paul II during his trip to Cuba."
She wrote the message after New Jersey state troopers sent the pope a letter asking him to call for her extradition.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
*My name is Assata Shakur and I was born and raised in the United States.*
*I am a descendant of Africans who were kidnapped and brought to the Americas as slaves. *
*I spent my early childhood in the racist segregated South. *
"*I later moved to the northern part of the country, *"
*where I realized that Black people were equally victimized by racism and oppression.*
"*I grew up and became a political activist, *"
"*participating in student struggles, the anti-war movement, *"
"*and, most of all, in the movement for the liberation of African Americans in the United States. *"
"*I later joined the Black Panther Party, an organization that was targeted by the COlNTELPRO program, *"
*a program that was set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBl) *
"*to eliminate all political opposition to the U.S. government's policies, *"
"*to destroy the Black Liberation Movement in the United States, *"
*to discredit activists and to eliminate potential leaders.*
"*Under the COlNTELPRO program, *"
"*many political activists were harassed, imprisoned, murdered or otherwise neutralized. *"
"*As a result of being targeted by COlNTELPRO, I like many other young people, *"
"*were faced with the threat of prison, underground, exile, or death. *"
"I think first and foremost that you can explain to people the only thing that counts in life is to develop yourself in the good sence, being a good person ... and then learn that being with other people also means imply giving up things"
"We owe it to others to take care of them, and it is a very but that is very difficult for people to learn even if it, in fact is pure logic"
Martin:
But isn't that very greek?
Ole:
"It is very Greek and very Christian, and the Christianity is good"
Martin:
Then it is very Greek beeing so very good ..
Ole:
"You could say so, yes ... and not only Greek / Catholic"
We must help to build a society that is not just about claiming a lot of stuff for ourselves but a society where we help and support others and not because we thereby help and support ourselves
One becomes wiser beeing a decent person
I try as good as I can to explain that to people although I wonder why it should be necessary
"One also have to try to take your own medicine which is the worst of it all, but I'm working on it"
Martin:
"But perhaps the paradox of this project is that if you have to be really really good to yourself, there is some who interprets it as ""not caring about others"""
Ole:
"No, I do not think that, that is the way to take care of yourself..."
The Greeks had a slogan saying
"""εαυτό τους"" meaning ""look after themselves"""
"In latin it is ""cura de se"".. um.. but does not involve any form of selfishness"
Martin:
But there ought not be a difference in taking care of yourself and take care of other
It should be able to go well together
Ole:
"It should be, because we are the others hostage and we only exist because the others have been there to begin with"
Martin:
"But then, why does it not work?"
Ole:
I think this has much to do with not prioritizing the right way in our upbringing and our education
Take private schools..
Earlyer they were there for those students who didn't do so well in the public schools
In 1985 the church have closed as the roof has collapsed.
It rained and snowed into the building
It was hardly any ... left on the walls
The benches ereased as they were all ... eaten and totally rotten
Humidity was nearly constatly above 90%
And the consequences was mold and decay.
Whoever the community refused to throw in the towel.
Together with ... supporters and craftsman from the region
Reconstruction begun in 1996 and was also supported by DRYMAT.
This has deffinetly helped to reduce humidity enormusly not only in the room air but also in the walls.
It is checked continously the humidity value being determined and we were quite amazed to see such an effect
You know we have already tried all kind of methods.
"We have drilled holes, put injections into the walls, and kept renewing the ..."
And at that time the water really run down the walls in ...
Everything we did was useless
So this is the only method which has really been helpfull for us.
And it is persievable.
Visitors who come into our church often say that the air has improved considerably.
Finally the church where JSB got married could be preserved thanks to the supporters who spent countless hours working here after work and the weekends.
Thanks to the many donations made by ... supporters from all over the world
And thanks to DRYMAT.

The semantics of relational logic is not by itself to tell us which terms are equal and which are not.
"In fact, it's possible for every term to refer to a distinct object in the real world and it's possible for every term to refer to the same object."
"Well, the semantics relational logic does not constrain your quality relation."
The idea of coreferentiality does.
"For example, it's not possible for us to believe a=b and b=c and at the same time, not believe a=c."
We can capture these constraints through axioms.
"July 23, Stiles spent the day writing diplomas onto parchment."
[laughs]
"'Yeah, I know this is a little taxing."
I've still got students and they still have to graduate so
I'm going to write out their diplomas'--which I think is really kind of striking.
Okay.
Let's turn back for a minute to look at precisely what happened as the British invaded New Haven.
"Apparently, they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of Washington's troops away from White Plains,"
"New York, where I guess they were, and that was I guess a strong position to hold, so the British thought well, if they attack the Connecticut shore, they'll entice Washington to send some of his troops to"
Connecticut and that way maybe they can defeat them on both fronts.
"And New Haven ends up being the first target in this plan, so on July 5 the British debark in New Haven Harbor."
They had about two thousand soldiers.
One part of the troops was going to enter New Haven from
East Haven and the other part was going to enter from West
Haven.
"Stiles wrote in his diary, ""Perhaps one-third of the adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to meet them."
"A quarter removed out of town doing nothing, the rest remained unmoved, partly Tories, partly timid Whigs,"" and then he adds that some of the Tories armed themselves and then went out to fight with the"
British.
"That's a great example of how our--I think our impulse is to say, 'Well, the people were united in unity against the"
British.'
"It's like--well, no."
The entire town wasn't a big lump--a big lump of rebels.
"It was people with different ideas, and you just--Stiles in that one little sentence--"
"He has people going to fight with the British, people going to fight against the British."
"He has people sort of not knowing what to do and kind of just staying in town and then people not wanting to do anything, just wanted to get themselves out of there-- all sort of happening at the same time."
"People are making decisions, some pretty dramatic decisions, and they're having to make them spur of the moment, and you can see them in a lot of cases here taking a side, taking a formal side in a way that could have pretty dire consequences."
"Yale immediately was dismissed, and some students immediately ran for home."
"Supposedly, according to a diary, one student, a sophomore, instead of going home decided to go to a nearby town and read Blackstone's"
Commentaries.
Why that made sense I don't know.
"'What, the British are coming?"
I think I'll go to Fairfield and read Blackstone now.'
Ole:
"I think thats true and in many ways thay actually realized an ideal life in relation to the cultural and there have been lots of them who have been talented musicians, I can promise you and painters ... christ what is this all about, right? and they didn't have to be professional cause to be proffesional's a compulsion right?"
"If you have enough money, you can always grow it as an amateur, in German called ""Lieb haber"" someone who does something because he enjoys it"
Martin:
"""Amo"" does mean ""I love"""
Ole:
Yes thats true
Martin:
"So if I have to pick up on your totalitarian leadership of the world, if we are to achieve it all before the crisis ..."
We need small units and within the small units we could make a cultural revival we could institutionalize one in any case and then hope that rises a culture in light of the disaster which might also be repentance and then the music very well could play a larger role in the formation project but also as quality of life
Ole:
"Yes, Community Project"
Martin:
Community Project yes.
What else could be included?
Ole:
"Also painting, I think."
Children are phenomenal painters .. many of them have a sense of color that is ever so good
Arts's a way where people generally don't have to harm each other when unfolding
And I think limited sports can be too when it doesn't mean that you have to be wonderful
Martin:
"There's also some sports that potentially could be artistic but thats still about who can make the most twists in the air and jump highest and things like that, right?"
"So that has also been taken out of the artistic of those who potentially had it, perhaps?"
Ole:
"I remember that long ago I read, that in Brazil were a tribe they played out on the criterion that it was important to get the other team to win"
It can of course be a good sport but I like that way of thinking
Martin:
So the competition culture does not benefit anything at the moment?
Ole:
"No, I do not think it has benefited anyone anything ever"
Martin:
But you could say that this Greek way of compeeding to the arts might have helped them become so good? or helped them become so good in so little time.. thats what some thinks..
Okay.
"So the war is a real presence, even on the college campus: drilling students, fighting men, guns stored in the Yale library, people having a hard time getting food and supplies."
1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year of violence in New Haven; that is the year when the
British invaded New Haven.
"And Ezra Stiles, who was President of Yale at the time, noted in his diary the events as they unfolded-- and again, it's really interesting to see his diary entries."
"He later wrote another account that had full sentences, but to me what was more interesting-- and I'll read some of them here--were some of his diary entries because they're really immediate, and he's kind of recording his reaction to events as they're happening."
"So on July 4,1779, he says he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been seen near"
"Bridgeport, and supposedly rumor said it was heading to New Haven."
"So again, being the responsible president of Yale, he asks for militia to be sent."
"In case this is actually true, they're going to need some real soldiers, but he writes in his diary:"
"""Would not believe the enemy intended landing."""
Okay.
He hears the rumor and he takes action but he actually literally cannot believe that the British are actually going to get off the ships and attack.
That can't be real; can't be really happening.
"The next day, July 5, Stiles, using a telescope, says that he ""saw the ships distinctly from the steeple of College Chapel"" and, he continues,"
"""Began to remove all property...."
Militia meeting.
Tories calm.
"With telescope from the tower or steeple clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after sunrise."""
"He sees the smaller boats going off of these ships, with soldiers, to land on the shore."
"""Immediately, I sent off College records and papers ... and a bag of my own things,"" sent his family away."
"The next day, July 6, Stiles writes:"
"""Enemy paraded."
"Sailors came on shore and took their turn at plunder."""
"I'm going to continue a couple days here and then go back to the actual invasion, just because the series of things he writes here are interesting and they become weirdly personal, which again reminds me that this is a real person's experience."
He says:
"July 7,11 o'clock p.m., ""enemy landed and burnt Fairfield."""
"July 8, ""Removing my furniture""-- (he's now moving his furniture out of Yale) --"
"""Removing my furniture broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer which I have had since 1762."""
[laughter]
"I was like: oh, okay, I feel sorry you're moving your furniture and he broke his thermometer."
"July 12, ""the whole town moving,"" and then July 23 this little, tiny reminder that Yale is still an institution that exists."
"Now in the interest of time, I'm going to leap to 1777, because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding throughout the northern states and some people then began to conclude that actually staying in New Haven and studying at Yale might be just too dangerous for Yale students-- because New Haven was an exposed port, which we're going to see in about five minutes."
It is an exposed port.
So the Yale authorities sent students out to different towns.
They didn't close Yale.
"They just said, 'Okay."
We're going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be safer than they are in New Haven.'
"So freshmen went to Farmington, sophomores and juniors went to"
"Glastonbury, and seniors went to Wethersfield."
I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like
"logical places, but you and your class were sent to a random place to continue your studies."
"On their way out, Yale officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings from troops--"
"American or British--troops, and some library books were moved inland to protect them in case troops came to New Haven."
"So again, people are feeling there's a potential real threat here."
"Yale eventually did come back into session in New Haven, not without serious problems--and again you're going to see the playing out here of something I've talked about before."
I've talked before about the problems of supplying the army.
It was hard to get food.
People weren't sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.
"Apparently, they--it was really hard for people to get food and supplies into Yale too, that people just weren't--whatever sources of supplies had been serving Yale in the past were no longer doing that in a time of war."
"So in 1778, Yale sent out the following notice to parents of"
Yale students.
"September 30,1778:"
"""The steward of Yale"
College hereby requests the Parents and Guardians of the
"Students to assist in furnishing a supply of Provisions""-- okay, 'parents, would you please send food?"
[laughs]
"We don't have a lot; we really need it'--'""without which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist the Scholars the ensuing winter."
A generous and full Price shall be allowed and paid either in
"Money, or their Son's Quarter Bills, shall be most agreeable."""
Okay.
'Please send us food.
"We don't have any, and if you do we'll either pay you or we won't charge you tuition for your son so please give us food'-- which again--Can you imagine being the parent who gets the sorry, there's no food for your son; [laughter] send some now?"
"While you're sending the homespun clothes, send the food too."
The College of Arts and Sciences attracts faculty from around America and the world.
"Individually, they bring many unique and fresh perspectives, but they all share something in common: a love for Alaska and a passion to teach and inspire."
Steven Johnson:
"You know, we get obsessed with things and we pursue them rabidly and that's a good thing when it comes to knowledge, and discovery and teaching."
"That's good, and that's what you want."
Dr. Jocelyn Krebs:
Undergraduate research is a great opportunity that students have at UAA.
"It can be very challenging to do, especially at large schools, and we create a lot of opportunities here and it's really essential for students that want to go on to medical school, go on to graduate school. and really for anyone that wants to be able to think critically about the world"
Chris Barnett:
"You know, I get to be here in the setting of Alaska and still be able to do the biomedical research"
I previously didn't think was available.
I think it's the best of both worlds for me.
Steven Johnson:
"We have grown as a university in just ways, that other, older institutions couldn't even comprehend."
We have created an environment where students can thrive.
Hillary Jochens:
The attention that I get from faculty and small class sizes and the research opportunities have been remarkable.
Steven Johnson:
The students that we are turning out are extraordinarily good students.

I want to go back to that moment when Mitt Romney made his entrance on Thursday night.
"He walked down the aisle of the Republican convention, and as he was passing the New York delegation, he shook the hand of the state Republican Party chair, Ed Cox, and then he shook hands with David Koch, actually put his hand on his shoulder, pointed at him, and then shook his hand."
"While [Democracy Now!] was there on the floor, we captured the handshake on video."
"The pool feed that went out, that the networks broadcast, cut away just before the handshake, showing two enthusiastic young women supporters, and then an overhead shot of the convention center."
Then the shot comes back to Romney further down the aisle. shaking hands as he ascended the stage.
And we show that split screen.
"For our radio listeners, you can go to democracynow.org."
"I think it's an interesting metaphor for the money behind the scenes, not highlighted even by the media."
Medea?
[Medea Benjamin]
"Well I think in the last--past conventions, you'd see it more overtly: they'd be giving out the bags, would have the corporate logos on them, and it would be so easy to know who is [sic] the sponsors."
To comfort them told him this:
"""The Ministry that our Lord God will reward, isn't so much the visible fruit of Pastoral Ministry, teaching, or for evangelisation but the Messenger will be faithful to God who will be rewarded """
"The Lord God takes care of the people, because it is a sovereign God and faithful, and then takes care of his slaves."
"We're the remains clinging to the truth and walk humbly before Christ, for our financial support, the Lord God will take care."
The truth is this: the Lord is not indebted to those who serve him humbly based in truth.
God does not need anything to these people: it simply takes care of them!
Our family lived so for almost 10 years.
"Then you have nothing to fear, because since we donated to the Ministry, you can be sure that the Lord God knows that the name and honor of God are involved and will not allow its name suffers from delusions or stains."
He will worry that you have the support and care you need.
"Because God is his name and zeloso honor, so you a privilege to serve the Lord God."
"And this we already know in this life, that we receive 100 times more whatever"
"We have left behind, but the best of all this, and in the life to come, we will be with him for eternity."
"These brothers working in harsh and difficult conditions must remember what most matter: in the day when God will call us,"
What will count in the end is right if there was this sense of submission and faithfulness to the Gospel message.
"If these are true brothers and are seeking the help and God's presence in their Ministry, as well as the word says, urging and invoking (with a spirit Bereano) people to repentance, these people will be blessed, and should rejoice because it is just that what the Lord wants from them."
"Be faithful, you who serve the Lord."
"When their aim is the glory of God, the good of the Church and the salvation of sinners, this can draw various consequences: can first define the implementation of Ministry."
You can find a face with others who don't have the same motivation and can be tricky.
But we must remember that it is more important to be approved by God that by men.
It is important to be like God rather than men.
"Be faithful, and God will bless you for eternity."
Serving God is the most spectacular thing of this world.
"If your leader is God, your benefits and your retirement will be from another world!"
Worth it!

My pleasure.
"And I apologize for calling in a few minutes late, and I apologize to the speaker who I interrupted as a result."
"From what I caught at the very end it seemed interesting, so I'll let you all get back to that."
Brad:
We'll get right back to that.
"Thank you, Steve, and have a good rest of the day."
Steve: you too.
Thanks Brad.
Brad: before returning to Mark Schmeissing I just want to take care of a couple housekeeping matters.
I understand from questions that have come in that some folks in the audience have had difficulties with the audio portion.
"And some folks have been saying, ""When will the recorded webinar be made available?"" Before we go off the air here today and we complete the discussion of CSBG we will tell our"
listeners when the recorded webinar will be available.
"Someone else also wrote in, Mr. Todd Richardson, for the lobbying and advocacy work that we're going to be doing for the member request letters that"
"Senator Reed's legislative director referred to earlier, will we be sending out talking points for those of us making the calls?"
Answer:
"Yes, definitely, Todd, we will be doing that."
As soon as we get the letters from Senators Reed and Collins we will be sending those talking points out to everybody who is on this webinar and everyone who is part of our network.
"So we will be coming back to more questions that have come in, but what I'd like to do at this point, just to alert Mark Schmeissing, you do have a number of questions, Mark."
"So let's come back and complete your regular presentation, and then let's get right into the questions for the remaining 30 minutes of this webinar."
Mark:
That sounds great.
Thanks Brad.
So I'm just going to finish up with the overview of ROMA Next
Generation Grant.
We've talked through what we are doing in that process.
"If we go to the next slide, you'll see a diagram developed by the urban institute."
This figure is supposed to show how the three different training and technical assistance efforts are fitting together.
"In the center you'll see those core organizational standards that mainly speak to organizational capacity (things like leadership and governance and community engagement, human resource management, financial operations)."
Those are the things that are being developed through the Organizational Standards Center of Excellence.
Around that you'll see ROMA 2.0 which is another way that the ROMA Next Generation Center of
Excellence is referred to.
That ROMA cycle is the ongoing community action system that's framing our specific and special mandates to address the causes and traditions of poverty.
Shit!!
"Well done, with your stupid make-up!"
"Ah, well done, really, well done!"
"Hey, don't start!"
"See what you've done, you?"
"Oh, look at that now!"
"I've got you, you've got me, by the beard; the first one of us to laugh will get a slap"
Are you crazy?
I didn't laugh
Yes you did!
But I haven't done anyhting
Dishonesty!
"What's wrong with you, are you insane?"
"What, you got some complaints?"
"But that's almost a punch in the face, not just a slap!"
"Ah but that's normal, if you laugh hard you get a huge slap"
What?
I get a huge slap?
I get a huge slap?
"After World War II with most of Europe in ruins, tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States."
It was clear that the next global superpower required the ability to both launch and successfully defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles.
"In North America, the most vulnerable point of attack was over the North Pole."
"So in 1958, a joint effort between United States and Canada was established, known as NORAD, or North American Aerospace Defence Command."
An important line of defence was the semi-automatic ground environment.
It was an automated system of over 100 long distance radars scattered across North America.
They were connected to computerized radar stations that transmitted tracking data using telephone lines or radio waves.
"All of this radar information was fed into a primary warning center, buried a mile deep inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado."
This application of machine to machine communication allowed operators to make split-second decisions using information transmitted and processed automatically by computers.
"This idea of being ""online"" was quickly adapted and advanced by universities in the following years, as they understood the potential of computer networking."
"The thing that makes the computer communication network special is that it puts the workers, that is the team members who're geographically distributed in touch, not only with one another, but with the information base with which they worked all the time, and this is obviously going to make a tremendous difference in how we plan, organize, and execute almost everything of any intellectual consequence."
"If we get into a mode in which everything is handled electronically, and your only identification is some little plastic thing you stick into the machinery, that I can imagine that they want to get that settled up with your bank account just right now, and put it through all the checks, and that would require a network."
Money transfers were just one of a growing number of applications which required encryption to remain secure.
Faraday
T. Townsend Brown and others
Have had technologies that would liberate the world from the slavery of our current
Macroeconomic system.
We were impressed when we came upon Dr. Greer and his brilliant team.
They'd been working on groundbreaking ideas over the past decade and pushing a truth that not many people either know about or are scared to discuss.
So we thought to ourselves
This is a right topic to  document and expose in a film.
After contacting Dr. Greer we found out he had bigger and better plans.
This is a film that is the culmination of 22 years of research and discovery and journey in Space and time and consciousness  and it's going to be the most significant release of information on the UFO subject and new Energy that has ever occured.
The documentary film is just the tip of the iceberg but it's a crucial step toward moving forward in finding new technology and lifting the veil of secrecy blinding the masses.
There's a lot of talk about 2012
Well this is the year for this to happen.
But it isn't about the end of the world
It's about the end of an old and corrupt order in the world
And the beginning of an entirely new civilization on Earth and that civilization on earth will be one that has free energy abundance social justice and Interplanetary capabilities.
We need all of your support
The main corporate media will not cover this story
"Not even place it at NPR, PBS or BBC."
This is why we the people are going to make this film
The internet is our home.
"Each person is going to co-produce this with us, it'll be funded by all of us together"
It'll be distributed by all of us together.
"We want to have a thousand screenings, events and premiers"
But this is an undertaking that requires a large group of people.
So please spread the word
I hope you will help us
I hope you will join us
I hope you will network this information of this campaign to raise the funds for this film to everyone on your email list every organization you know
Because the time frankly is short.
Everyone on earth knows that we cannot live with  7 billion people burning oil and gas and coal.
Most of the public know that we are not alone and that the UFOs are real more than half the public know this.
"But with attacking two chemicals, so, being a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, we can sometimes see benefit and therapeutic outcomes."
So you have to balance this spectrum.
"So, the first group we're going to talk about is the SNRls, which is the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors."
So this is a reuptake pump inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine.
"So we're not only going to prevent serotonin from being sucked back up by the brain, and not be able to be used, but we're going to increase norepinephrine in the same manner."
"The first SNRI is Venlafaxine, and this is"
Effexor and Effexor XR.
"This is dosed twice a day, anywhere from 75-300mg total."
Your mechanism of action is as a SNRl.
We have a couple different indications.
"How this drug needs to be managed is, we need to go slow in terms of initiation."
We need a slow titration because of the side effect profile.
"Again, this medication is a very effective medication to be used, but it needs to be titrated slowly, because there are a lot of side effects."
So it's very difficult to get patients on and off of this medication.
The nausea and diarrhea is very severe.
"This situation, you actually want to use the extended release preparation, because there are"
less side effects associated with the extended release.
"Similar side effects to the SSRls: headaches, sexual side effects, the increase in anxiety, and insomnia."
"We do see an increase in blood pressure, especially as we get to the higher doses of the medicine, and it's usually isolated systolic increase."
"So you have to use this with caution in certain patient populations, potentially."
"And again, use that long-acting formulation to avoid side effects."
"Interestingly enough, with this medication, you need to be at the higher end of the dosing spectrum to get that double-action effect."
"At the lower end, in initiation of the medication, up until about 150mg, you're really only getting action as an SSRl, so as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
You're not hitting both neurotransmitters until the higher level dosing.
"Again, I mentioned this medication needs to be titrated slowly: there's a significant withdrawal, again, with the medicine, so, like I said, it's very hard to get on and off of, but it's a very effective medication in treatment."
The next SNRI is one of our newest antidepressants:
"Duloxetine, or Cymbalta."
"Anywhere from 20-60mg a day, and, again, an SNRl."
The main difference with this is that patients get the dual action right away.
"Versus Venlafaxine, it took to get to the higher dosing spectrum."
This we get right away.
"Nausea, insomnia, and headache are the most reported side effects."
It's a  in German or Northern Germany where there is a wreath of greenery and then typically four candles set in a square fashion around this circular wreath.
And it would sit on the table.
"And so she wanted to make them go sideways, she was drawing a fold out drawing of the wreath and its four candles as her first drawing."
"Um, as an adult."
"So my suggestion to you is, don't think that it is necessary to start at some peculiar place which they must have, like three-dimensional objects, then move to representations of those, like a sculpture, then slip away another dimension and go to ."
Then slip away another dimension and go to two dimensions.
No - just drop them in the deep end and say please draw.
And you'll find they will do lines for surface edges without asking you what can a line stand for. and _.
"And they will start learning shapes that are relevant and they will start using spacial systems that are like sighted children, and then they will themselves mature as they themselves evaluate their own drawings."
"By the way, the box that I was asking her to draw was exactly a _ matte the box that you could fold up and put in my pocket, complicated enough that it would be a challenge for anybody and so it was a nice sort of task: draw a cube, draw a table, draw a glass, draw a hand, draw _ box."
These are examples of things that you can offer people as targets and they will draw them and they will criticize their own drawings and be satisfied with some parts and then drive themselves into more sophisticated drawings.
"Okay, is that enough?"
Constance:
"Okay, I know that there is other questions."
Dr. Kennedy:
"I am happy to stay, love talking about this, love to know your experiences."
Constance:
"Clearly, again another very passionate person with lots of information."
So Dr. Kennedy will be at the back and thank you
Dr. Kennedy:
My pleasure.

"My favourite Prime Minister is this man right here, Winston Churchill,"
"He was an incredible leader for our country, and indeed the whole free world at the most impossibly difficult time."
"Just a few yards away from here is the Cabinet Room, and Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister sat in that Cabinet Room, and decided, with his colleagues, to fight on against Nazi Germany and Hilter, even after France had fallen."
"That was a heroic decision, a right decision, and actually meant the world was saved from Nazi tyranny."
"It was the most important moment in British history, and I think it's because of his courage and guts that we made the right call."
NEWS READER:
"""Behind Winston Churchill we stand united as never before in history."""
"Well, obviously, he came to office in 1940, at a desperately difficult time; France was about to fall, the war was going extraordinarily badly from Britain's point of view, Hitler was rampant across Europe."
"It looked like the end for the free world, the end for Britain, and the end for"
Churchill too.
It's where they combine all of the things that they've learned through this class and doing it for a large cooking group.
"At first they're scared, but generally by the end, and it's all done they're really happy with their results."
"They felt like they've made a good product, they've pleased the people that they have been producing their meal for and they've had fun."
I liked it where it combined everything that they could do in their class and give them some practical experience in what they've learned.

How to Study for an Online Course
"To be successful in any course, you will need to develop good study habits."
"Much like face-to-face courses, one aspect related to studying for an online course is your study environment."
As you discovered earlier in the module each person has their own learning style.
Your learning style should be taken into consideration when selecting your study environment.
"Some individuals need a very quiet place to study to be able to concentrate; others need music, or other sound, in the background."
"Contrary to some people's belief, studying with the TV on is not usually effective."
"Also, your learning style will help you decide if you should study by yourself or in a study group."
"Choose the location where you study carefully, taking into mind that it needs to have good lighting, be at a comfortable temperature, and be free from distractions."
"To study successfully, you must manage your time effectively."
"Make sure to schedule adequate time over the course of the week to watch lecture videos, read course materials, work o"

"Dear citizens, dear friends, it has been 25 years!"
I was asked why the sudden hype this year when you guys had all along been keeping a low profile.
"Not so! we had on several occasions in the past, marked the event in different ways."
"This year is a special year, we are very happy to see so many of you attending."
It's 25 years passed.
"In 1987, 16 citizens were arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in the first round with 6 more in the second."
"Two more were added in the following year, which makes the total 24, of whom many are still nursing the wounds or have not been able to forget that sudden twist of fate."
Those arrested had different encounters.
"""Beyond the Blue Gate"", a book written by lawyer Teo Soh Lung, has given a more detailed accounts of life in prison."
"Her account was interspersed with sometimes high-handed treatment, sometimes hilarious moments."
Other detainees have also reminisced about their prison ordeals.
"As far as I am concerned, I started off not knowing what the ISD (Internal Security Department) officers wanted from me."
Basically we're getting a lot of donations.
And with those donations we're using to buy supplies and food for everyone.

And that's our donation area over there.
"The importance of having a strong media presence is unquestioinable, i mean, we need to have very powerful, positive media representation."

Then we've got to do it and create it ourselves.
"We're not allowed to erect any structures here in the plaza, so we're not allowed to put up any tents, we're not allowed to hang anything from the trees,"

"""Look, i have a camera, I'm ready to film."""
"We send them out to go film a workshop, or a march or a protest, whatever, and then they come back and we have an ingest department, where they ingest the footage, transcode it, whatever needs to be done,"
"And then give it to an editor, who either edits here, or in an off-campus location to bring it back to upload."

"It's a stressfull environment, you're always going to have people kind of itching for some kind of confrontation, and this is anti-confrontational."
"This really can do a lot for people, you know?"

"So student Lisa asks, what would be different in world where almost everyone was programming"
literate.
So this is the core question and obviously
I feel that it would be great to have such a world thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to take this class and hope youÃ¢ÂÂil encourage any non programming literate people that you know to take the next version in this class starting in April.
"There are lots of things that understanding programming even at just a basic level and I think many of you are beyond the basic level now if youÃ¢ÂÂve made it this far in CS101, but in terms of the things that you interact with and the things that you see in the world, almost all of them are controlled by programs these days and people who understand programming can relate to those things and have better way than people who donÃ¢ÂÂt."
"And some of this can be sort of fairly obvious things when you interact with a website and you can tell, well theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some bugging it because the programmer didnÃ¢ÂÂt think of that both branches of the NlFT test and if you are a programmer or you at least understand about programming that you maybe have a better sense of what is going on but you also can get a lot more familiar by it because you know well this is something any programmer who knows what they are doing should have test before and understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on and itÃ¢ÂÂs really annoying that you have to deal with their mistake."
Other things you probably have a better understanding of how complicated it is and how hard it is to get things right that you might be a
"little more forgiving when things break and have better ideas about well this is probably why itÃ¢ÂÂs breaking, letÃ¢ÂÂs try to use this tool or use this product in some slightly different way."
So thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the reasons.
The other reason I think is there are lots of things that people encounter every day that if you know a little bit about programming instead of doing a lot of tedious work as a human you can find a way to automate that and save yourself a lot ofÃ¢ÂÂ¦
There is a good example of this right here in our office.
"So when recording these video we generate hundreds every week to get the classes out for all these courses and they are all named kind of default things by the video camera and video X, X,"
It also does not compensate for your contribution as writer to different articles.
It is open.
Anyone can write and edit and debate.
And this dynamic changes both the number of articles and details of many articles very.
Dynamically.
"Sometimes as soon as announcement is made in the public or event happens within a minute or sometimes right at the same time as that event unfolds, it is updated."
It's interactive.
"There's talk page, there's history page, you can interact with the other contributors or the editors."
And it is extensively linked.
"In fact, when you Google search certain kind of our keywords, Wikipedia articles are popped up."
And then you can look at each Wiki article.
There are many hyperlinks embedded in the text and a many footnotes at the bottom.
"So, the Wiki articles themselves also form."
A very large and substantially linked network.
There are perhaps more links per node than then the general web space and there are many such nodes.
"With in a decade since founding Wikipedia has already has 4,000,000 english articles and all together 27,000,000 articles in many different languages."
"So, by all accounts, wikipedia has been very successful."
"It is not, however, the first attempt to build an encyclopedia online, not even the first attempt to build it based on free open dynamic interactions."
So there must be something that they did right and better than the previous attempts.
We'll be looking at those momentarily.
"At the same time, we also recognize there are limitations."
"For example, there are misinformations."
"Some information on Wiki's are just rang, wrong, especially in articles with a very small audience."
"But what is important is that we can provide our effective, self-correcting mechanism."
Usually the misinformation on Rose and
Lily popular weekend articles are very effectively corrected by the community of contributors.
"There are also just mistakes, honest mistakes."
"But then again, everybody can edit an article."
"An edit can stay there as long as no other contributors can present a better, stronger case otherwise."
Then there are also missing information.
No encyclopedia can include all the information you want.
Different people also have different definitions of what constitute an encyclopedic kind of article.

"I told her, I said, ""You've got to stop this."
"You're going to have a wreck if you continue to do this."""
"But, her mentality was it wasn't gonna happen to her, because she looked me right in the eye and said, ""Dad, no I'm not."""

"The best time to cry is at night when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help,"
"Hello, everyone."
"I'm Amanda D'Annucci and I'm going  to be talking to you about storytelling, conflict resolution,  psychology and neuroscience."
"Did you know that  by telling someone a story, instead of spewing out  a mouthful of data, that you can engage a much larger  portion of their brain?"
The art of storytelling has psychological  and neurological basis that scientifically explains the natural human predilection for narrative.
"A vast portion of a person's brain is activated during the listening to, and telling of a story"
"For instance, the amygdala hippocampus system, which is responsible  for preliminary encoding of episodic and autobiographic memories is engaged; the left perisylvian region where language is created is engaged; and also, it has been proven  that the same sections of the brain lights up when the storyteller or the respective listener interacts."
"Quite simply, narrative engages the entire human brain, the entire human experience."
"If a string of word can affect a person in such a profound way, how powerful can the art of story be?"
"Stories can heal, stories can teach, stories can inspire, stories can enlighten stories can resolve."
"For my master thesis here at Gallatin,"
I'm exploring the power of story and relation to conflict resolution  and peace making.
Story is an influential tool which  can mold the most obstinate of minds by means of appealing  to an individual's pathos.
"By using story as a communication tool, a pessimist understanding can be  made into a relatable situation."
There's an ample evidence of storytelling  in a multitude of cultures around mankind.
"But he showed incredible bravery, incredible courage at bringing the nation together, forging a courageous spirit, taking on Hitler, and eventually winning."
"So it was a very difficult time for Britain, a time when you needed the best possible leader, the most courageous possible leader to come forward, and in Winston Churchill we were incredibly fortunate to have that man."

Steven:
"When historians talk about late 19th-century Paris, they often talk about a culture of display, and this is a painting that is all about that."
Beth:
"We're looking at Mary Cassatt's painting,"
"Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge, and this is, perhaps, Mary Cassatt's sister pictured in the Paris opera house."
"She's sitting in a private booth, and we can see behind her a mirror, which reflects all the other private booths in the opera house."
Steven:
"So the Paris opera house, situated at the intersection of the Grand Boulevards, is a building which is a kind of jewel itself, but that also puts its occupants on display."
"In other words, the stage of the opera house is not simply where the ballet takes place, but the stage is also the audience."
Beth:
"The architecture of the Paris opera house enabled seeing and being seen, and afforded numerous opportunities in small, little balconies and spaces where one could glimpse the fashionable elite of Paris, and we certainly feel that we're looking at one of the members of that elite in this painting by Mary Cassatt."
Steven:
What you said is exactly right.
Look at the composition.
Mary Cassatt must have been turned away from the stage
"looking into the box towards her sister, and Lydia is, in turn, looking back out towards the audience, and so we're seeing Lydia the way that the audience would have seen her, had they glanced into this box."
She is this object of display within this jewel box.
Beth:
"But Cassatt doesn't paint herself reflected in the mirror, where she must have been as she looked at Lydia and painted her."
"But, in unison, we are celebrating the life of my Dad."
"My first friend, the best man at my wedding, and an individual that set the bar when describing a true ""family man."""
"Being a simple person, it didn't take much to please our Dad"
"After he served 8 years in the U.S. Navy,"
"Dad often wore a hat in public, with an image and the name of battleship on which he served."
"Should someone recognize him as a veteran and thank him for serving,"
Dad would beam with pride.
"The word ""handy"" and our dad, were never used in the same sentence."
"His most exhaustive chore, just might've been re-setting his dozens of clocks, in the spring and fall."
"Yet, incredibly until about the last year of his life, he maintained his tropical fish tanks with meticulous care."
Dad loved to make people laugh.
"Through his timeless and - often repeated - stories, to his quick-witted comments, to his juvenile behavior, intended solely to draw belly laughs from his grandchildren and great-grandchildren that he adored."
Many of you here today experienced those fun-loving times with us while in our Dad's presence.
"And at this point I would be remiss to not formally thank so many people as we close this chapter of our lives that included Dad in our physical presence but, with your help we will continue to re-live so many wonderful memories until the day we are called, and that the faith we hold that our Dad nurtured, we will see him and the other loved ones we lost once again."
"We thank you - his sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters-in-law."
"Nieces, nephews, cousins, former co-workers, family friends, neighbors for all of your comforting words and support."
"Your visits, the food you have prepared for our family."
"We're grateful to have you in our lives, and have you be a part of our Dad's."
"I'd also like to thank Father Steve, for leading our service."
"Outside of perhaps a certain individual who resides at the Vatican,"
I know my dad would prefer no one else presiding here today.
To my sisters...
"Chris, Theresa, Karen and Donna."
Each of you and your own unique ways brought so much happiness into dad's life.
Chris your selfless love and cheery disposition engulfed Dad.
You always made the time for what ever was needed without complaint.
I'm convinced that no one in this world has a bigger heart than you.
"Theresa,"
"My sister with a tough exterior, originating, perhaps, from her delivery by dad in a bar."
"But someone who displays a soft spot at the moments of her choice that is welcome by those, like my parents, on the receiving end."
"On many occasions, even during your own life's challenges"
"Mom and Dad would share stories with me of your visit or phone call and rave how your carefree attitude and laughed would bring cheer to them when, at certain moments, the roles should have been reversed."
"I was teaching in Oakland, most recently, Oakland California, for the past three years at progressive school where the organization Mindful Schools started."
So I was in a really wonderful space  to be sharing the practice.
"And before that, I taught  at an international school in India where we had actually a group of educators that met weekly to share the practice."
"And in India I had this unique experience  of being an expat but obviously looking very Indian,  having an Indian name, and having Indian heritage but being the only teacher in the school that was of Indian heritage  but that was an American."
"And I had one student,  who was an adorable, sweet little boy."
I was running an academic program  and in the process of hiring an assistant.
"When I shared with this student  that I was hiring an assistant, this boy said, ""Is it going to be an Indian person?"""
"At that moment, I could just feel so much pain inside myself and really touching the face of having  felt discriminated against growing up and feeling like an outsider."
"Before the practice,  I probably would have said to him,"
"""That is unacceptable,  you can't say that""."
I would have reacted.
"But because of the practice,"
"I went to my breath,  I recognised what was coming up, and I was able to respond, not react."
"And asked him, ""Why would you not want to hire someone who's Indian?"
"Talk to me about that."""
I realized he didn't want to come to India but was there because of his father's job and he had difficulty  understanding the accents and it was nothing about me  being Indian.
"But here I am, immediately  going to that place."
I share that story because  it was really powerful moment for me where the practice made me realize... it helped me really develop compassion and understanding in myself  and not react.
Really look at my student  as another human being and not sort of teacher-student  relationship.
"I think sometimes mindfulness can be sold  like a gimmick, as stress reduction, increasing focus, increasing attention."
"But this path that we are on,  when you are practicing mindfulness it is about awakening,  it is about liberation, it is about dissolving those identities of teacher and student, really developing authentic relationship."
"At that moment, when I had  that interaction with this boy in my class"
I realized the power of the practice.
"When I share the practice with my students I do a lot of things with them, most recently teaching middle school,  I start every class by inviting the bell."
"Two things I can offer from what I learned with sharing the practice is to always frame it as an invitation, especially with young people."
I've never been dogmatic about it  but always frame it as an invitation.
Authenticity is so key.
"When you are being authentic, the kids are more up to really be present, to being engaged and be available."
"So, I'll start the class saying,"
"""Okay, our bodies are here  but where are our minds?"
"Our minds could still be at Math,  our minds could still be at lunch."
"Let's take a moment, invite the bell and come back to ourselves so we can be here."""
You adjust.
And you just settle from I'd like him to graduate from college to I hope he graduates from high school.
"And then you change from well, I hope he graduates from high school to I hope he makes it."
You've seen kids that are in jail one day and the next year they're in college and doing great.
So he still has a shot at it.
I'm not saying it's all over for him.
You can't give up hope.
That's about all you do have is hope.
"Hope is what has motivated each of these families to share their stories tonight, hope that we can all learn from their experiences and realize that no child with learning problems has to become a lost child."
"It's a lesson that's been a long time coming, including to families like mine, that with the right diagnosis, the proper management, and lots of hard work and ongoing support, none of our children is beyond rescue."
There really are so many different ways to solve this problem called life.
"I mean, there really are."
"And if you look at successful people, nine times out of ten they will tell you of stories of tremendous struggle."
"If you've got a different kind of brain, and I submit the most interesting people do, that's great."
"And as you're remediating all this stuff and learning how to be on time and all this stuff that you got to learn how to do, never lose sight of those strengths, those talents, because that is what is going to take you to great places."

"The significance of Assata Shakur being put on the FBl's terrorists list, the first woman ever to be added to the most wanted list?"
LENNOX HlNDS:
"My view on this is that this is a disingenuous act on the part of, driven by the state of New Jersey and particularly the state police."
"As you know, for decades, the state police have wanted and demanded that the Cuban government extradite Assata Shakur to the United States."
There is no extradition policy between Cuba and the United States.
"Just to deal with this in context, the Cuban government, pursuant to international law— that is, particularly the refugee convention— have granted Assata Shakur political asylum."
"Now, what is the basis for that?"
"It is if an individual has a well-grounded fear that if they return to the country from which they left, they would either be persecuted or prosecuted based upon their political beliefs or/and their race or religion."
"Now, this is not a new concept."
"There have been numerous individuals who have left the United States and went to foreign countries, allies of the United States, where those countries have refused to extradite them."
"France, for example, in the 1970s, there were Black Panthers who hijacked planes and went to France."
"Now, both France and the United States have extradition treaties."
"Not only that, France signed the 1963 Tokyo Convention, the 1970 Hague Convention and the 1973 Montreal Convention, with the United States."
"All of these are international agreements that require countries, host countries, that are holding individuals—who have hijacked planes—to extradite them or try them."
"France, after conducting their own independent review of these Black Panthers, refused to extradite them to the United States based upon France's assessment that if they would be returned, they would be subject to political and racial repression."
"So, I say that the Cubans"" position is well grounded in international law."
"Now, why today is Assata Shakur now being branded a terrorist?"
"If we look at the definition of terrorism, what is it?"
It is the use or the threat of use of force against a civilian population to achieve political ends.
What happened in the case of Assata Shakur?
"You have heard, in her own words, this woman was a political activist."
She was targeted by whom?
J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in a program that was called COlNTELPRO.
That program was unveiled by whom?
"Frank Church, Senator Frank Church, in the 1970s."
He chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"That committee determined that the FBI was using both legal, but mostly illegal, methods—to do what?"
"In the FBl's own words, they wanted to discredit, to stop the rise of a black messiah— that was the fear of the FBl— so that there would not be a Mau Mau, in their words, uprising in the United States."
"And they were, of course, referring to the liberation movement that occurred in Kenya, Africa."
"Now, the FBI carried out a campaign targeting not only the Black Panther Party."
They targeted SCLC.
They targeted Martin Luther King.
"We'll talk about one later on that is, does have weight gain."
"But Paroxetine, of the SSRls, is probably your highest risk adding maybe about five pounds, to ten pounds."
"Sertraline, or Zoloft, is used at a dose anywhere from 50-200mg."
"Again, various indications."
"Some of the unique aspects of this are it can be a little more activating; we have some actual slight dopamine activity, so that can give a little bit of activation."
Dopamine often functions very similarly to norepinephrine.
"It can be helpful in an actual atypical depression, which we're not really focusing on during this talk, but those patients, that subset, that sleep more and eat more."
"We do see quite a bit of diarrhea and sweating with this clinically, so you have to be careful with initiation too, with patients."
"And then, again, you have to taper this medication."
"Pretty much every antidepressant, except for Prozac or Fluoxetine, you have to taper."
"Fluoxetine, with that long half-life, tapers itself."
"Citalopram, or Celexa, is actually, when looking at the pictures, probably the clean SSRI that we think of."
All it really touches is Serotonin.
"There's a little, little bit of antihistamine activity, so sedation is about 50/50 with this drug."
So half the patients say if they take it in the morning they're tired in the afternoon.
"Half of them, it doesn't make any difference."
"If they're taking the medicine in the morning, and really tired in the afternoon, they can switch it, potentially, to bedtime to help with that."
There's really no drug interactions.
"There's an advantage in the elderly with this, because it's a very clean, useful drug."
It does have two sides to it: it's broken down.
And so it has an inactive side in terms of when the liver metabolizes it.
And that becomes important because it leads into the next drug we're going to talk about.
"So, we're going to kind of transition into Citalopram to Escitalopram."
"And you see, Citalopram on the top has R and S enantiomers."
"And the liver metabolizes this drug into two components: an ""R"" enantiomer - which basically, think about this, is the liver makes active and inactive drug."
And the active drug is something called Escitalopram or Lexapro.
And so these two are really what we often refer to as cousins.
They're very similar medications.
"So, when looking at Escitalopram versus Citalopram, again, you see a little bit different dosage with the Lexapro in that we can kind of get a little bit lower dosage because, you see, it's about 100 times more potent than Citalopram."
"Meaning that it's not necessarily more effective; it's just occupying all receptors with active drugs, versus some receptors with inactive drug."
Some of the studies suggest that 10mg of Lexapro is about equivalent to 20-40mg of Citalopram.
"This can be an insurance issue, though."

I don't want to pay.
These highways have already been paid for.
"If you get to a toll station and you say, ""I don't want to pay"" they have to let you pass."
"On May 1st, at 12 PM, get to a toll booth and say:"
#IDontWantToPay
- Not paying a toll is NOT a crime.
- Highway personelle do NOT have the right to ask for ID.
- A red or green toll booth light is NOT an official transit symbol.
- Holding you at the toll booth for not wanting to pay is illegal holding and you can report it to the police.

Ulnar collateral ligament testing of the thumb is performed to evaluate for instability found on a gamekeeper's or skier's thumb.
"After stabilizing the first metacarpal, a valgus stress is applied to the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint."
Laxity indicates a partial or complete ulnar collateral ligament tear.
This is the cutter section of the panel.
The top button labeledÂ CutterÂ opens up the cutter dialog.
"This dialog lets you choose which cutter manufacturer you are using, and which model your cutter is."
"The lower button â gives information about the vinyl size of the cutter, if the machine and the communication method support it."
Here you can find the maximum vinyl-size.
"Consequently, in order to set a larger tile-size, you set a larger vinyl-size."
"My name is Marvin Meyer, I am the Chair of the Department of Religious studies and the Griset Professor of Religious Studies at Chapman University."
"I came to Chapman a long time ago, as a matter of fact, just over 25 years ago so it must have been then, 1985 that I came here as a younger assistant professor of Religious Studies."
"Well, I came here to Chapman because there was a job, and to be honest about it, sometimes it's difficult to find a job in this profession."
There aren't a lot of jobs available.
"And I've never been unemployed, I've always had a job, but there was a job here, but I also came to this particular job, I did have some other possibilities, but I came to this job because I knew something about Chapman."
"I had been on the campus before, I had known some of the professors here."
"In fact, my predecessor was a friend of mine and Fred Francis was his name."
"I came to visit him here, and then I also am a singer and I sang with Bill Hall in the William Hall Corral for a number of years we would rehearse upon occasion on the campus and so I came to campus to the music building and I thought it was a pretty nice campus and when there was an opening I decided to go for it and I went for it, and here I am."
"Well, when I came here back in the 1980s the entire campus of Chapman College at that time, it was smaller and it was quieter, and the department of religion, as it was called at that time, was a much smaller department."

"If we treat an encryption function--as the one in GSM--as something that takes a message, produces an encrypted message, and it consumes a key to perform that."
There are different ways in which you can make this resistant against time-memory trails.
Three different mitigations.
"First, you can make the message unpredictable."
Sounds obvious.
Why would you encrypt something predictable?
"But a lot of systems do just encrypt a whole stream of data, some of which is encrypted."
Something is worth protecting.
GSM mixes the two.
[Dave]
All of these attacks you know some--because of the GSM protocol-- there are some messages that are very easy to guess. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [Carson]
Exactly.
[Dave]
And you know what they are and can you those in this attack.
"To exchange a text message, for instance, between the base station and your phone, somewhere between 20 and 40 messages are exchanged, only one of which has the actual text message content."
Another one may have some unpredictable set of information.
All the rest is just management information--encrypted though-- and that management information is usually--
[Dave]
Does it make sense as one solution to not encrypt the management information.
[Carson]
"Clear, yeah."
There's a standard extension that suggests exactly that.
But basically the whole ecosystem would have to change to accommodate for that.
"Currently, it's just the encryption is switched on at some point and everything thereafter is encrypted, be it predictable or not."
"There are measures, though, to make predictable messages more randomized to create some wiggle room for how you send a message."
"That's currently being deployed--not in all networks, though."
I've not seen--one of the two American networks I don't think has it.
You need to know the base station is understanding if you change the protocol like that.
"The base station would have to change to go all the way of making all messages unpredictable, but even changing the base station controllers, bigger installations that control dozens of base stations that control dozens of base stations would do the job, and those are usually software updateable, because they have to accommodate for usually faster connections all the time."
"That's counter to justice,"
"I mean, that's counter to common sense!"
"Apparently Judge Deana McDonald isn't aware of the thing called the internet, where names like Will Frey and Austin Zehnder can be spread very very quickly."
"I would call the judge and defense attorneys behind these actions disgusting, but that wouldn't be an appropriate enough word."
So I'll use these words:
WlLL FREY AND AUSTlN ZEHNDER.
"Look, bottom line, in a world where half of rape victims don't say a word, we have a justice system that's encouraging girls to keep their mouth shut, at least one specific girl."
That's completely counter to what we need to have happen in this country.

Tree rings are rich with history and can reveal the exact age and geographic origin of a tree trunk or a piece of wood.
"The scientific analysis of tree ring patterns is known as dendrochronology, and was used to learn more about the cabinet's wood."
Only certain types of wood can be analyzed with dendrochronology.
"In the case of the cabinet, the oak interior was most suitable."
"But the end grain of these oak panels, where the tree pattern is visible, was inaccessible."
"So to examine the hidden tree ring pattern of the interior, an innovative method of x-raying was devised."
"To begin, parts of the cabinet were carefully disassembled, transferred to the museum's x-ray laboratory and placed on a rotating table."
"For dendrochronology to be effective, the rings must be measured very accurately."
"Once the tree rings were perfectly aligned, the image was recorded on x-ray film."
"The tree rings were measured from this high resolution image and these results, along with many other samples, were analyzed by a dendrochronologist, who compared the tree ring measurements to weather patterns in different regions, going back in history."
"The dendrochronologist concluded that these oak panels came from a tree that grew in the region of Burgundy, in eastern France, and was cut down in 1574, six years before the cabinet was made."
Even the cabinet's smallest details had much to reveal about its origins.
"The middle drawer is lined with a silk and linen fabric, which is held in place by rose head tacks."
Scientific analysis could tell us whether these tacks are from the 16th century or are later reproductions.
"A loose, broken tack discovered inside the cabinet was prepared for analysis."
It was embedded in liquid resin that was hardened under blue light.
And then you only have one kid.
"If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now."
"Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans."
"Like, here is a graph of cow population."
And here is a graph of elephant population.
"Elephants, if you had just inserted yourselves in the human life like cows did you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies conspiring against the humans."
"And then you could have risen up and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant world, and elephant cars, and elephant planes."
"It would've been so great, but no...you gotta be pregnant for 22 months and just have one kid."
So annoying!
"Best wishes, John Green."
But back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred.
"Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records."
But they love to make guesses.
"Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture even though it was more work, or abundance gave people more leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility rite - or as some historians have argued - people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol."
"Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying:"
"""A wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise, old savage"""
"Off-topic: but in will know in the coming weeks, that the definitions of ""savage"" tends to be ""not me""."
"Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more."
"Like, early hunter/gatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted."
"And when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it."
Unless it is this food.
Then you want to do less of it.
I kind of wanna to spit it out.
That's much better.
"So, early farmers who would find the most successful forms of wheat and plant them, and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like,"
"""You know what would be awesome?"
"More food!"""
"Like, on this topic we have evidence that more than 13,000 years ago humans in Southern Greece were domesticating snails"
"In the Franchthi Cave there is a huge pile of snail shells, most of them are larger than current snail, suggesting that people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious."
"Snails make excellent domesticated food, by the way, because A, surprisingly nutritious, and B, they are easy to carry since they came in their own suitcases."
"And C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters."
That's not really a revolution.
"Well, let me read the FBI press release, and you can respond to how they describe it."
"And we want to bring Angela Davis in, as well."
"This was their press release yesterday describing the May 2nd, 1973, shooting."
"They said, ""*On May 2, 1973, Chesimard and a pair of accomplices *"
*were stopped by two troopers for a motor vehicle violation on the New Jersey Turnpike. *
"*At the time, Chesimard—a member of the violent revolutionary activist organization known as the Black Liberation Army—*"
"*was wanted for her involvement in several felonies, including bank robbery.*"
*Chesimard and her accomplices opened fire on the troopers. *
"*One officer was wounded, his partner—Trooper Foerster—was shot and killed at point-blank range. *"
*One of Chesimard's accomplices was killed in the shoot-out and the other was arrested and remains in jail.*
"*Chesimard fled but was apprehended.*"""
That's their statement yesterday.
LH:
Right.
"Also in their statement that I read, the superintendent of state police claimed that Assata Shakur took the Officer Foerster's weapon and shot him while he was on the ground."
There is not one scintilla of evidence at the trial attesting to that.
"In fact, as I was saying before, she was incapable of lifting her hands, much less firing a weapon."
"Now, you asked what is the reason for this allegation at this time."
"We have to remember that 10 years ago,  a little over 10 years ago, the then-governor of the state of New Jersey, former Governor Christie Todd Whitman, she had issued and posted a $1 million bounty for Assata Shakur."
Today it has been doubled.
"But we believe that putting Ms. Chesimard, putting Assata Shakur on the FBl's 10 most wanted list is designed to inflame the public and to characterize her as a terrorist, when none of the acts alleged relates to terrorism."
"In fact, of all of the charges that have been leveled against her in New York, case after case, she was acquitted, or the charges were dismissed."
There was insufficient evidence to support any of the charges.
AG:
"Well, let's just—in 1971, armed robbery case was dismissed; 1971, she was acquitted of bank robbery; 1972, hung jury; 1972, kidnap of drug dealer, acquitted; and then several other cases dismissed."
"Angela Davis, you're in Chicago right now to give a major address tonight at the University of Chicago."
"Can you talk about this news of Joanne Chesimard, Assata Shakur, being—now being put on the top 10 wanted terrorists list, the first woman ever to be put on this list?"
ANGELA DAVlS:
"Well, first of all, it was a major shock to hear that Assata Shakur has become the first woman to be added to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list and then to learn that they're adding another million dollars to the reward, the bounty really."
It seems to me that this act incorporates or reflects the very logic of terrorism.
I can't help but think that it's designed to frighten people who are involved in struggles today.
"Forty years ago seems as if it were a long time ago, four decades; however, in the 21st century, at the beginning of the 21st century, we're still fighting around the very same issues— police violence, healthcare, education, people in prison, and so forth."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
You're saying that having no spaces between words wasn't bad?
PETER NORVlG:
Yeah that uh
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Well let me correct one thing.
It wasn't Maryanne Wolfe who said that.
It was actually me.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay
NlCHOLAS CARR:
So don't blame her if that was ridiculous.
PETER NORVlG:
Excuse us Maryanne.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"But she did say that she worries that the kind of intensive decision making and problem solving that now goes along with reading in a hypertext multimedia environment, could return us more to our decoding method of reading and steal away our ability to make deep interpretations of text."
"But, no, I think actually that's incorrect about having no spaces between words."
"I mean, and this is going to get a little esoteric, but up til a thousand years ago there were no spaces between words and also there was no silent reading."
And the reason there was not silent reading is because it was really hard to figure out where one word ended and one began so you had to read it out loud and it was only after.
"So I think it was a very cognitive stress, cognitively intense process and it was only after you had spaces that you saw the emergence of silent reading and the kind of personal reading and deep reading that went along with it."
"So I thing that shows us that if you return a lot of cognitive juggling to the act of reading and whether it is just your frontal cortex flashing a little to click a link or whether you have ads running down the side of a column or all sorts of other things, you are kind of overloading our short term memory, which has a very small capacity, and you're making it much harder to comprehend the reading, understand it at a deep level and make all the interpretive leaps and jumps, give interpretive reading its richness."
PETER NORVlG:
So you're saying the Chinese and Japanese people can't do deep reading?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
I think they can.
"You're talking there about a completely different alphabet, and it is true actually that studies show that it is more cognitively intense simply because of the huge number of letters, so reading is different in those languages, the act of reading is cognitively different in those readings, with those languages than it is with English."
And there's even differences between like English and Italian because of the way the words either match up with the way you pronounce them or not.
"So all, even small changes in language or the way words are presented does have cognitive implications."
PETER NORVlG:
So I guess that is one of the things that always struck me.
"To write the book, I think you do an excellent job talking about the plasticity of mind to say that this theory that we are born with what we have and that is it, is not proven to be true that we do change all the time, that the technologies we deal with change us that our experiences change us and our mind is always growing and altering."
"But some of the places it seems, like it's just too much kind of scare quotes."
"Now for all but the longest wavelengths, a radio telescope is just a dish, much like the main mirror of an optical telescope."
"But because radio waves are so much longer than visible light-waves, the surface of the dish doesn't have to be nearly as smooth as the surface of a mirror."
And that's the reason why it's so much easier to build a large radio telescope than it is to build a large optical telescope.
"Also, at radio wavelengths, it is much easier to do interferometry."
"That is, to increase the level of detail that can be seen by combining the light from two separate telescopes, as if they were part of a single, giant dish."
"The Very Large Array in New Mexico, for example, consists of 27 separate antennas, each measuring 25 metres across."
"Now each antenna can be moved around individually, and in its most extended configuration the virtual dish mimicked by the array measures 36 kilometres across."
So what does the Universe look like in the radio?
"Well, for a start our Sun shines very brightly at radio wavelengths."
So does the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
But there's more.
Pulsars are very dense stellar corpses that emit radio waves only into a very narrow beam.
"In addition, they rotate at speeds of up to several hundred revolutions per second."
"So in effect, a pulsar looks like a rotating radio lighthouse."
And what we see from them is a very regular and fast sequence of very short radio pulses.
Hence the name.
The radio source known as Cassiopeia A is in fact the remnant of a supernova that exploded in 17th century.
"Centaurus A, Cygnus A and Virgo A are all giant galaxies that pour out huge amount of radio waves."
Each galaxy is powered by a massive black hole at its centre.
Some of these radio galaxies and quasars are so powerful that their signals can still be detected from a distance of 10 billion light-years.
"And then there's the faint, relatively short-wavelength radio hiss that fills the entire Universe."
This is known as the cosmic microwave background and it is the echo of the Big Bang.
The very afterglow of the hot beginnings of the Universe.
Each and every part of the spectrum has its own story to tell.
"At millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths, astronomers study the formation of galaxies in the early Universe and the origin of stars and planets in our own Milky Way."
But most of this radiation is blocked by water vapour in our atmosphere.
"To observe it, you need to go high and dry."
"To Llano de Chajnantor, for example."
"At five kilometres above sea level, this surrealistic plateau in northern Chile is the construction site of ALMA: the Atacama Large Millimetre Array."
"When completed in 2014, ALMA will be the largest astronomical observatory ever built."
"64 antennas, each weighing 100 tonnes, will work in unison."
"Giant trucks will spread them out over an area as large as London to increase the detail of the image, or bring them close together to provide a wider view."

Research is an essential part of education.
Students are expected to cite articles from scholarly journals when they write research papers.
You probably use journal articles in your own work.
You've probably also encountered journal articles that you wanted to read but couldn't get access to.
Why is that?
"Well, let's take a look at how scholarly journals are published today."
Professor A does some research and writes an article about it for free.
He wants to publish it so he submits it to a journal in his field.
The journal likes his article so asks Professor B and C to peer review it.
"The professors read it, evaluate it and send it back for free."
"The journal sends Professor A the changes that need to be made, if any, and Professor A sends them the final version of his article at no cost to the journal."
The publisher then puts Professor A's article with a bunch of other articles and formats them all together and charges people for access.
How much does it cost to a campus library to buy a subscription to the journal?
It depends...
"If it is a journal of Econometrics, a year subscription costs as much as two thousand one hundred and fifty-five dollars if it is the journal of Geophysical Research, it costs five thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars. if it is the journal of Brain Research, it's twenty-one thousand seven hundred forty-four dollars. not all scholarly journals cost this much but when many of the key resources for students and faculty cost an arm and a leg, not even the best funded universities and libraries can afford them all."
So librarians buy what they can afford and students and the professors just have to hope they're not missing something important.
But it doesn't have to be this way
There is an alternative to the closed subscription-based scholarly publishing model:
Open Access
"Open Access is free, unrestricted online access to scholarly works."
"Open Access journals use advertising sponsorship, author fees and other sources of revenue to support the cost of publication, keeping the access free to the user."
Authors can choose to publish their articles in one over forty-two hundred peer-reviewed Open Access Journals or they can put a copy of work published elsewhere in an online repository.
Open Access lets anyone read the latest research.
"It helps scholars stay up-to-date on each other's work... it enables computers to sift text mining and mashups, which help uncover trends that no-one would have suspected it gives authors more visibility and impact... and makes scholar work a lot easier."
Open Access brings curious minds and the world's knowledge together.
Isn't that what academia is fundamentally about?
"Free, unrestricted, online access"
Open Access
"Also, we saw the invention of computer gaming, and the computer game authors pretty quickly realized that having READ statements didn't work for most games, that you wanted a different way of organizing the program so that it could be more responsive."
"But the mainstream didn't see much of this until, say, 1984, when the Macintosh came out."
"The Macintosh was the first mainstream product that got in front of mainstream programmers with this radically new idea of how to do interactive programs, which was not based on READ but on event loops; a radically different way of writing programs."
Were the programmers happy to have this new model?
"No, they were quite unhappy."
You have to write programs inside out!
Waa.
"Nobody can do that, it's too hard."
It's just not the way God intended us to write programs.
We should go back to the command line as he intended.
"So Apple had to work really hard to try to convince programmers no, really, it's OK, you can be successful writing in this model."
"They released a program called Mac App, which was a template of a Pascal program that already came with an event loop built into it with prototypes for setting up menus and things like that, so all you had to do was hook your logic into it."
"That was just too hard, it was rejected."
"It looked like Macintosh was not going to be the big success that it turned out to be, except for one thing:"
HyperCard.
"Bill Atkinson had this little multilayer paint program with a silly little scripting language in it, and suddenly everything took off because non-programmers could be incredibly productive with HyperCard."
"They could get a stack -- that's what they called programs at that time -- and they could open it up and look at the scripts inside of it and fiddle with them, and make wonderful things happen."
"In fact, there were thousands of stacks running around the world, most of them being written by people who had no business programming, just because it was fun and easy."
"After that the professionals kind of went oh, OK, I guess it's not that hard, we could probably do that."
Then we saw an explosion of programs for Macintosh and Windows when a new generation of programmers were finally able to work with the event loop.
HyperCard worked because it was all about events.
You didn't have to build an event
"loop; it was built in, it just worked."
All you had to write were the event handlers.
"A program -- again, a stack -- was just a collection of event handlers attached to things"
like cards and buttons and fields.
And the events could bubble up — that's how it did delegation.
"It called it inheritance, but it really wasn't inheritance."
It had events
"like on mouseUp and on keyDown, on cardEnter, which would be equivalent, say, to on load today."
"And on idle, which got fired whenever the event queue was empty."
I don't think they knew what people were going to use that for.
And this machine lowers this building over the canal.
"And the water evaporates by the sun and condenses on the inside, and you get drinking water, desalinization, without expenditure of energy, using the sun."
"After we have filled this with salt water, it's for irrigation and flood control."
So all this water is directed towards water storage basins so you don't have flooding.
"Mr. Fresco sees a future where computer systems will monitor the world's environment and provide timely, accurate information on events that needs our immediate attention."
This represents the government of the future.
It would be cybernated.
"That means that computers will monitor farm production, harvest the crop, plant the seeds and maintain their packaging and everything else."
Whereas these various image screens will give you an image of any part of the Earth.
This represents a hurricane.
So you can see on these screens any area on Earth.
From 3000 miles out in space you can photograph plant diseases.
They show up as red.
"If you photograph the Amazon jungle, you will see a dark red area, which means those plants are ill or sick."
And so you can maintain with the satellite as the Earth rotates under the satellite.
You will be able to show people everything on Earth and every airplane in the air and every ship at sea.
"When you ask the computer, how many planes are there in the air at this instant?"
It will tell you exactly.
"It will tell you 10,408, 9, 10."
And you would be in touch with every area of the Earth by these screens.
There is no government in the future
The government is maintained electronically.
"But it is programmed to monitor food transportation, monitor the Earth, hurricanes, tsunamis, and tell people warning them of any problems."
So everyone will have this which gives them information about the Earth until we learn to control the tsunamis and the weather which i believe man will eventually be able to do.
"Man will eventually be able to control hurricanes, the weather and most disasters."
"Supreme Master Ching Hai has also spoken about the potential for wondrous technology to be available on our planet in the future, as in this excerpt from a July 2008 videoconference with Supreme Master Television staff in Los Angeles, California, USA."
"The technology that we are having right now is nothing, nothing compared to what we will have if all the population of the planet turn to a loving kind compassionate vegetarian diet."
"Then you will see all kind of inventions that we have never imagined before, will surface."
"And all people will live in peace and love, even if they don't pray for it."
It will come.
"Our sincere thanks Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows, for taking time to introduce The Venus Project and its underlying philosophy to us."
May a sustainable planet with everyone's needs met soon be a reality.
We hope for better biomarkers.
"Again, heterozygote advantage does not seem to exist for Alzheimer's so we'll leave that go until we get to depression and let's look now at therapeutic approaches."
"Suppose a person is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's, what can be done?"
"Well the molecules that are in the clinic now, and that are the molecules of choice, are the"
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors because neurons that make acetylcholine.
Are among the first to die in Alzheimer's disease.
They're in the basal forebrain.
"And therefore, if one can prolong the life of acetylcholine by inhibiting its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase."
One has more acetylcholine.
"And the lack, relative lack of cholinergic neurons does not matter much. the three that are on the market are."
Somewhat effective.
"Interestingly enough, galantamine, may also be, a positive, allosteric modulator, of alpha four beta two receptors, so that, it could be acting, both, by preventing the breakdown, of acetylcholine, and by enhancing its action."
"Also on the market is one NMDA inhibitor, called Memantine, and the thinking here is that."
Excessive activity at NMDA receptors may be excitotoxic.
"And so, it may be possible to slow down the time course of Alzheimer's using Mementine."
"For both of these types of medications, the slowing down is statistically significant. but."
We need very much better drugs.
"So, because we've talked about that the various Secretase sites in beta APP, you can appreciate that."
Beta-secretase inhibitors would also be useful if one could develop them with no side effects and specific action.
There have been other drugs with unknown mechanisms that failed for Alzheimer's trials.
Gamma secretase inhibitors might also be useful.
The one that got the furthest along in clinical trials also failed.
One could think about targeting the protease complex with notch-sparing gamma secretase inhibitors.
Remember the.
"Probable natural function of gamma secretase is to, protealize Notch."
So you'd need to develop a gamma secretase inhibitor which allows Notch proteolysis to go ahead.
But blocks cleavage of the APP.
"And, other gamma secretase drugs."
"Modulators that shift the proportion of a beta peptides, in favor of shorter, less harmful, peptides. have been conceived, but not brought to the clinic."
"And then there's the topic of antibodies against a, beta APP, or, A-Beta."
And the three that had been tried so far in clinical trials are listed here.
The have been largely unsuccessful.
"If you look at the figures, they're all coming down."
So I don't know where the hell they got that from.
"I was going to go into the Media Freedom Committee's campaign to open the Family Courts, which ended up being absolutely useless, because they can get into the Family Court..."
"You can get into the Family Court as a journalist now, but you can't report any names or any identifying factors, so nobody goes, and the only coverage you get is the documentary, or in-depth, sort of coverage."
"So if they got a little bit more out of the courts,"
"I'm just not sure that it's going to make much difference; however, I don't know, that's just a speculation."
"Okay, I'm running out of time."
"I'm going to put this up on my blog, so if you want to read it all, that's fine, and I'll skip over..."
"The final point, I think, is the way that the media approaches ethical issues generally."
"It tends to be utilitarian, the greatest happiness to the greatest number."
They tend to forget the rider to that is you shouldn't be doing any harm to people.
And I was reminded of how all this works when I went back into the Sunday Star Times newsroom for six months a couple of years ago.
I hadn't written in anger for about 20 years;
I thought it was time to go back.
"And I just realised, after 20 years of teaching ethics in the classroom, how easy it is to resolve ethical issues in the classroom compared to a stress situation, such as the one that Jonathan works in, where you've got one of the most highly competitive markets, as the Sunday's, and all of my high moral ground occupation disappeared almost instantly, and I was urging people to do things that were possibly questionable."
I have seen what happens when you do...
You can get a strange situation with some stories.
"We had a case, when I was in Taranaki, of a very prominent family."
Their son committed suicide in Sydney.
He was a prominent rugby player.
"And because it happened in Australia, of course, they weren't covered by the same rules."
"The NZ Herald got into this in an incredibly insensitive and speculative way, and the family felt very battered and resentful."
"The local newspaper treated it with real sensitivity, didn't back off the story, it was on the front page, reported that death was self-inflicted, and the family was very grateful."
And I used that case when I was in Taranaki.
"We brought in that reporter and the uncle, the spokesman for the family, to talk to us, so our students could see what the impacts of that were."
"So I have to speculate, if we liberalise the regime, as the media want, it's a safe bet that someone is going to push the rules to the limit, in the name of media freedom and utilitarianism, and it'll just be bad luck for any individuals caught up in the gears."
Thank you.

SARAH LEE:
"Thank you, Jim."
"I've been looking forward with somewhat anticipation wondering what Jim was going to talk about today, but it's been fantastic."
I've taken a few points from that myself.
"People get off of gluten and they say, you know, remarkably, I feel better."
There's nothing wrong with following a gluten-free diet if you don't have Celiac disease.
"If you suspect you have Celiac disease, it's a good idea to get tested and have a confirmation of your diagnosis."
Many people find that they lose weight when they go on a gluten-free diet.
"If you've been consuming hundreds of extra calories from breads and pastas and rices, it makes sense that when you cut those foods out of your diet, you're going to"
lose weight.
"If you're interested in learning more about Celiac disease, I recommend you check out some of these resources."
"The Gluten-fFree Diet book, by Shelley Case, is a great resource."
"Shelley is a Canadian dietitian, who, herself, has Celiac disease."
"A number of the different foundations, like the Celiac Sprue Association, and the"
"Celiac Disease Foundation, can also provide you with valuable information. ."

"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On August 1, 2007, the eye 35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 45."
Newspaper articles followed asking questions why did the bridge collapse.
And the experts pointed to structural deficiencies such as corroded bearings or faulty-- fatigue cracks in the steel around the bridges joints.
"But for the victims and their families, the important question was not why did the bridge collapse, but why did the bridge collapsed at the exact moment when I was on it."
"Ann was on the bridge because she was on a cell phone with her friend, so she missed her exit."
Otherwise she wouldn't have been on the bridge when it collapsed.
"On the other hand, Jim was not on the bridge because he happened to meet a friend and stopped to chat, or he would have been on the bridge."
The questions the bridge victims asked are just like the questions of the Zande in the Central African Republic.
"Just the same questions when misfortune strikes them, they're not interested in why did the bridge collapse, but rather why did the bridge collapsed at the precise moment when I was on it."
But the Zande have a different kind of answer.
"It's not God, it's not karma, not coincidence, not God's will, but witchcraft."
The main point I was making today is that witchcraft gets a bad rap.
"It's seen as backwards, superstitious, barbaric, and pictures like this one, of a Zande witchcraft-- witch doctor, which I took, don't help."
But witchcraft among the Zande is not an irrational belief system from the heart of darkness.
"It does nothing more or nothing less than other belief systems do, including world religions."
"They all explain why things happen, especially bad things."
"They do so in a way that allows intervention, especially medical intervention, and it allows to blame someone else or something else for our misfortune."
I'll be making a plea today for cultural relativism.
"Deep down, one person's witchcraft is another person's Christianity."
"The Zande live where the three countries of South Sudan, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet."
"Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener."
Which he did -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
"There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,"
Leicestershire and Somerset.
"And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan."
"And the head of the council said,"
"""If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."""
"As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging."
"In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this."
And we see it all over the place as well now.
"But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions."
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
Because I think stories are vital here.
"And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here."
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
"Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company."
"And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden."
"Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States."
"So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?"
"Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil."
"I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky."
"But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point."
"Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable."
"And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
"First of all, I'm not that great."
I'm just a chemist.
"I'm the person who knows about materials, but I don't know so much."
And I am pretty mediocre.
"For example, I don't do any sports, or I cannot dance,"
"Threw all of that type A energy into having kids, and we had four kids in just over five years."
(Laughter)
"And I was busy nuking those Dino Nuggets, (Laughter) serving flourescent mac and cheese, and blue yogurt."
I didn't want anybody telling me what to feed my kids;
I didn't want anybody telling me what to eat.
"And then one morning, five years ago, over breakfast, everything changed, and our youngest child had an allergic reaction."
I was so clueless.
"As I raced her to the pediatrician's office, she said, ""Robyn, what did you feed the kids for breakfast?"""
"And I said, ""Well, tubes of blue yogurt,"
"L'Eggo my Eggo waffles, and scrambled eggs."""
"And she said, ""Well, those are three of the top eight allergens,"" and she starts rattling off these statistics about food allergies."
"And I had totally rolled my eyes at the whole thing, and I thought, ""Since when?"" because I hadn't known anybody with a food allergy when I was a kid, and I didn't understand why all of the sudden a PB&amp;amp;J and a carton of milk were loaded weapons on a lunch room table."
"So as I got everything under control and I got the kids back down, and everybody was down for a nap that day, every analytical gene in my body went off, and I wanted to see the data."
And that morning I learned that from 1997 until 2002 there'd been a doubling of the peanut allergy.
I learned that one out of 17 kids under the age of three then had a food allergy.
"I learned that one in three American kids now has allergies, autism,"
"ADHD, or asthma."
"And I later went on to learn, according to the CDC, there'd been a 265 percent increase in the rate of hospitalizations related to food allergies."
That was people checked in to the ER - big kids and little ones.
That wasn't somebody making it up.
"And as I learned that a food allergy is when your body sees food as foreign, and launches an inflammatory response to drive out that foreign invader, it just begged the question, is there something foreign in our food that wasn't there when we were kids?"
I don't think anything really could have prepared me for the answer that I found.
"Because as I dug into the data, I learned that in 1994, in order to drive profitability for the food industry, scientists genetically engineered an E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone to help a cow make more milk."
"The analyst in me - it made perfect sense: you drive profitability for the dairy industry, there's the argument you can lower the cost of milk, who can stand in front of that?"
"But at the same time, I kept coming back to the fact we were genetically engineering E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone that we were injecting into our dairy cows."
And we were the only developed country in the world that did it.
"Canada, the UK, all 27 countries in Europe,"
"Australia, New Zealand, Japan - they all said, ""This has never been proven safe."""
"The product label for the product said that it caused fertility problems, reproductive problems, mastitis, ovarian cysts."
"It resulted in an increased antibiotic use in animals, and so for that reason, these countries never allowed it."
"And yet, we did."
"And then studies started to come out showing that it elevated hormone levels that were linked to breast, prostate, and colon cancer."
Steven:
So this is a painting that really does show the opulence of imperial France.
The moment that's being represented is clearly intermission.
The chandelier has been lowered into the space of the audience.
"The lights are up, and so the audience's gaze has shifted from the stage to themselves."
Beth:
"So Cassatt's family, although it was very wealthy, actually her father refused to support her desire to be an artist, and although he paid for her basic living expenses, refused to support her art supplies and her studio where she painted."
Steven:
"This, despite real support from the leading artists of the day."
"She was a close friend of Degas, who had enormous respect for her ability, and she was an extraordinary painter, in every way a peer of the great impressionist painters in Paris."
Beth:
This painting displays a virtuoso technique.
"Mary Cassatt gained her knowledge of painting from a variety of sources, but it was difficult because she was a woman."
Steven:
"Her first formal classes were at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art, but women were not allowed to study from the nude, even from within the context of art school."
Beth:
"And like many artists of her generation, they moved to Paris where there was a little bit more freedom for women who were aspiring artists."
"Although she couldn't enter the Ăcole des Beaux-Arts because she was a woman, she did enter the private studio of several accomplished artists and studied with them."
Steven:
"But the world was still a restrictive one for her, even in Paris, and she was not, for instance, able to spend time with her friends like Degas at the cafes."
"We see that, actually, reflected in her subject matter, which tends to be domestic, or perhaps a night out at the opera."
Beth:
"It's difficult, I think, to remember those restrictions for women when we look at this painting because there's an extraordinary sense of freedom about the woman who's depicted here."
She's leaning back on her right elbow.
"There's a strong diagonal that has a sense of informality and movement, real self-confidence"
Steven:
"The woman with a pearl necklace, perhaps Lydia seems so much her own agent in the world, and it really does remind us of the tensions that existed at the end of the 19th century, as women were really entering into the public space."
"You know that the tension between public and private is played out, not only in terms of the subject matter, not only the fact that they're in a kind of semi-private space within this booth in the public space of the opera house, but also in the contrast between light and shadow that plays across Lydia's body."
Look at the way the light picks up only the side of her face.
The front of her face is in shadow.
"Not only is it rather brave on Cassatt's part, but it also speaks to the representation of bourgeois culture, this notion of privacy and its importance, even as one views the stage with others."
Beth:
Pressures for reform come from all sorts of directions and it is constant; why should not it be?
"As this country changes over the years, so what people expect from their Parliament is changing."
We had a massive controversy a hundred years ago about whether women should be given the right to vote and whether they should be in Parliament.
Of course in recent years we had a woman
"Prime Minister in Margaret Thatcher, so that was a dramatic change, as have been the number of women Members of Parliament in the House of Commons."
"More recently there have been similar pressures saying that Britain now is of course a country of many ethnic groups, many people of different cultural ethnic-social backgrounds."
Perhaps Parliament needs to be more representative of that diversity?
And we have seen that in all political parties now.
"When you look at both sides of the Chamber, you will see that the people who are sitting there reflect the diversity of the country."
Not perhaps entirely to the level required but huge progress has been made in recent years in that direction.
Pressures for reform of Parliament and its procedures come from many quarters.
They come from Parliament itself.
I can remember well the days when I was a young backbencher myself and there was a very considerable move for select committees.
"Now, select committees are hugely important."
"Committees go into the development and the wherewithal as to what is happening in various government departments. They are very important,"
But there was a great deal of contention. There were groups that did not want to go that far but we won through and we have now the select committees.
So there is change that is made there that comes from Parliament itself.
"It comes from Parliament itself too when we want to restrict the number of constituencies there are, thereby restricting the number of Members of Parliament."
"It comes also from outside, from outside bodies, from non-governmental organisations, from business and from industry."
We are by no means perfect.
We have warts and all.
"But change is constant, it is constantly there and we examine it from whatever quarter it comes from."
"The Parliamentary system in the United Kingdom is a work in progress, requiring regular scrutiny."
We are constantly looking to improve; building on the positive and learning from negative experiences.
"I think the strengths of UK Parliamentary system, and I would almost answer this in the same breath as what are the weaknesses, the real answer is that the system is as effective as its Members want to make it."
I think its strengths are that it is willing to change.
It is willing to look at itself and say that these things are not good enough.
We must make some improvements.
We must make progress.
I hope you have enjoyed this production and that it has offered an insight into the way in which the United Kingdom Parliament operates.
We all look forward to working together with you in the future as friends and colleagues.
"August, 1984."
"I also forgot to mention that it's, I use photography stands that usually hold lights."
"They are about $15 bucks on Amazon.com, but you can go as simple as getting a bucket and putting a stick inside of it and put in cement, or sand, or something like that, get dowel rods."
"So, the camera itself,"
I use a Canon T4i [corrected from video]
"It's a great camera, high quality, that's the one I've been using probably for the past two months."
"I also before that had a lower expensive, the Canon I am using now is about $800."
"The next I had was a traditional video camera, consumer grade video camera."
"That ran about $400, and it was a Canon, I think it's the"
HF 200.
"If that's not it, I'll put it in the space below."
"I would also suggest that if you can't get those, get a cameral like the Kodak, I think it's called the 8zi, or the z8i, I think it is."
That camera has an external microphone jack.
You have to get a camera with an external microphone jack.
"If you don't, it's going to, it's going to sound like you are in a cave, so you get the crisp quality because this camera has a microphone jack, so if you need a low cost camera, it's the Kodak, again z8i, I believe it is, has an external microphone jack."
"Now, on the settings you may say, ""Well, ok, what about these things?"" You see I purposely am leaving this ugly stuff on the side here."
"Basically, when you go into you whatever video editing software you have, you just, that's it."
"You just crop out the sides, you put a white background, and voila, you have a perfectly professional infinite, white background, so thanks again everybody If you're not, if you didn't download my free e-book, go to the side, it's on How To"
"Create a Video That Persuades Customers To Take Action, to buy a product, click a button, whatever it might be, so go to the side, put in your information, and I will send you that e-book."

Stopping for a second
"What if it's true, as Kevin Phillips recently stated in an article in Harpers"", that ""Ever since the 1960s, Washington has gulled its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics, the vital instruments with which the vigor and muscle of the American economy are measured?"""
"What if it turned out that our individual, corporate, and government decision-making was based on deeply misleading, if not provably false, data?"
"That's what we're going to take a look at here, by examining the ways that inflation and"
"Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, are measured."
"As you now know, inflation is a matter of active policy."
Too little and our current banking system risks failure.
"Too much and the majority of people noticeably lose their savings, which makes them politically restive."
"So keeping inflation at a ""goldilocks"" temperature"
- not too hot and not too cold - is the name of the game.
Inflation has two components.
The first is the simple pressure on prices due to too much money floating around.
"So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator,"
"like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness."
It warms up for longer than it cools.
"This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect."
Remember this fact for later!
"In the winter, the opposite happens."
"There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect."
"The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases."
"So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14."
"In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets."
"OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it!"
"Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle."
"If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice?"
But it's the North Pole.
There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground.
"So, what's going on?"
"The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset."
"But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere."
"This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time."
Remember those increased summer time daylight hours?
And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky.
"So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less."
"Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun."
"Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for."
It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight.
"So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you."
In Digital Video Production we learn the process of creating a short film.
"We begin with the story, coming up with an idea that will be both narratively interesting and practical for us to shoot."
"We learn the basics of camera, sound and lighting techniques, combining classroom training with hands-on experience with the equipment and software provided by the Digital Arts Initiative."
"Professor Kolbe brings an incredible amount of knowledge, having worked in ""The Industry"" for many years."
"We study composition, movement, pacing and directing through critiquing our own work and analyzing popular movies and TV shows."
During this whole process we are planning and story-boarding our own short films.
"Instead, she was sent to Harvard to work for Lieutenant"
"Commander Howard Aiken on the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, the Mark 1."
"The first thing she did there was essentially take the machine apart and figure out how it worked, because there was no documentation on what you needed to know in order to program the thing, so she had to figure it out."
"She figured it out really well and then taught other people how to program the machine, and spent the duration generating numbers for solving hard problems, and ship design, and weapons design, all driven by the need to get the country quickly to the end of hostility so we could bring everybody home."
"When the war was finished she ended up going to a computer manufacturing company, one of the world's first computer manufacturing companies, to work on the UNlVAC."
She quickly figured out something that everybody else had missed.
"The thinking was, these machines were ridiculously expensive and human life is very cheap, so it shouldn't be at all difficult to find enough people to write the programs for these machines."
"She realized there were not enough people who are defective in the way that all of us are, that could make a business out of selling"
UNlVACs.
They just weren't going to be able to make enough software at the rate they were making software at that time.
"So she thought, we need to figure out a way to get smarter about developing software."
She wrote a program which she called A-0.
"Just as an indication of how far ahead she was as a programmer, she didn't called it A-1."
"OK, that's an important clue."
[laughter]
A-0 was the first compiler.
The reason we call compilers compilers is because of Grace; she did this first.
"What she did was she thought, subroutines are going to be the unit of code we use, so we need to figure out a way to make it easier to use subroutines."
"She put a big collection of subroutines onto a tape and gave each of the subroutines a number, similar to a library book call number."
"It looked a lot like the library call system; all the trig functions started with T, for example."
"Your program would be a list of subroutines, and A-0 would scan through that tape and compile a program based on all of those things, compiling in the same sense as compiling a bibliography, which is why we call it that."
"Ever wonder why we call a function, or call a subroutine?"
"Why is that called, because it's nothing like a phone call?"
"It came from this, the library metaphor, because she was an academic."
"She had two kinds of subroutines: open subroutines, which just get inserted into the program in place."
"Today we'd call that an include, or an inline."
"And she had closed subroutines, which today we call functions."
"There'll only be one occurrence of those, and some extra overhead in getting to it and back again."
"In modern terms, A-0 doesn't look much like a compiler."
It looks more like a linker.
"But this was the first, and everything else grew from that."
"When she finished A-0 she gave it to her team and they built A-1, and tested that, and learned more, and then built A-2."
I think it would in fact be right to ask people within military or in government institutions for particular documents.
"I mean, I don't see any particular problem with that."
"In terms of knowing where things come from and how they're obtained, we're specialized in not knowing."
It's very difficult to deal with major state intelligence agencies.
"And over time, it is in fact, it would be impossible for us to keep secret information, over say the course of ten years, from the Chinese Public Security Bureau, the SVR in Russia, and from the National Security Agency."
It would just not be possible.
So we don't try to do that.
What we try to do is never collect information about sources in the first place.
"So, because we don't know who they are, we don't know how they get the material."
"And we don't ask them to go in and break in so in terms of US jurisprudence, there's not an issue for us."
"In terms of Swedish jurisprudence, that would also be the case because that has a higher standard."
David please.
"David Isaksson, editor at Global Reporting."
I guess there's some parallel between what you're doing to the reporting by Seymour Hersh in the 70s film from the Viet Nam War. actually on the My Lai Massacre.
"His reporting was not done in the field, he did interviews with people, I mean, the technology was different."
And you showed us the embedded reporter who was more concerned with taking a shower than what was actually the reality in the country.
"My question to you is do you see from your reporting and the effect it has had and how it's been so well spread that other media might reconsider how they report from war, that they will put more focus on investigative reporting and less on sending reporters out as embedded reporters?"
"Second question, the news you've spread all over the world and the media is picking up, do you see any increase in your income?"
You need income to continue with your investigative reporting?
Do people also take part in financing your work?
I'll answer the last question first because it's a very important one.
The funding for our organization has come from the people involved directly.
"Up until January this year, it came from me and others who are directly involved, totally committed into spending both their time and money."
"But as we grew, and as the demands grew, for example the bandwidth for the"
"Collateral Murder video was worth $600,000."
"Fortunately, we were able to gain subsidies for that from Google."
"But, it can be expensive to run such a large, such a popular operation."
But since January we have called upon the general public to assist us.
"And we have raised some million dollars, which is not a lot when considering the demands that we have, but it is completely independent."
"It is not from a foundation, it is from people like the people in this room, it is from moms and dads from all over the world."
And that is giving us an unparalleled degree of independence in what we can publish.
"We have tried to get foundation funding during that period, and in fact we were rated first out of 3,000 applications to the Knight Foundation, which hands out about a hundred and something million dollars per year in the United States."
Has anyone done some?
"I don't know if anyone's ever done Psilocybin and Oxytocin, it's a very difficult assay, Oxytocin though which is why I'm reluctant to say anything about what the results are with the MDMA."
Some people it goes up a lot but it is very unreliable.
(Mic) I was just wondering what you think about Salvinorin A which has some overlap in the phenomenology with the serotonergic agonist but does not effect Serotonin receptors in any way.
"No, I think it is a really interesting question and I think it would be fascinating to study that drug too."
"Similarly Ketamine, there are some studies with Ketamine."
Functionally utterly different but one thing there is some convergence in terms of uncoupling the Anterior Singulate from Posterior Singulate.
"Salvinorin would be a great experiment to do, we were wondering about doing that if we can get the compound and be allowed to use it legally."
"(Mic) Hi, thank you for your talk, both you and Robin were real interesting."
I have two questions.
"One of them is, in your Psilocybin study were your subjects Psilocybin naive?"
"No, they're all Psilocybin experienced, we wouldn't be allowed to give it to naive subjects."
(Mic) OK.
My other question is it appears that the resting state scans of Psilocybin may give you different results if you're looking at Psilocybin assisted psychotherapy.
Can you comment on that?
Was there something that I missed at the meeting then?
"(Mic) Oh no, I was just curious if you think that you may get different results from the brain scans."
"I suppose the simplest, the current thinking is this, is that in depression you'll have the DMN will be over-connected and that will relate to the degree of negative rumination that patients have and that you will uncouple that and that will stay uncoupled and we do have funding to do the scanning as well as the clinical trial in depression so we'll look at that and see if we can show that there is an enduring effect."
(Mic) Is there any reason to expect you would get a different result if it was Psilocybin in the context of Psychotherapy?
"I hope not, one would hope that psychotherapy would improve the response but one doesn't know and of course I don't think we actually know whether the sensitivity to Psilocybin will be different in people with depression you could argue it both ways so in fact in the depression study we're going to use a low dose first just in case but if anyone here's got experience of using Psilocybin in depressed people and can reassure us that they're not super-sensitive"
let us know.
(Offscreen) Thank you.
Thank you Professor Nutt.
(Offscreen) Please help me thank Professor David Nutt (applause)
We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies.
Like fools we clung to the old hatreds and fought as we had for generations until the day the sky rained fire and a new enemy came upon us.
"We stand now upon the brink of destruction, for the Reign of Chaos has come at last."
A man carries big bags of candy... ...for his big candy pile.
But this man and his dog have no candy.
See?
This lady knows where the sweet shop is.
A plan is formed.
"Sometimes I'm tempted to believe that I'm wasting my time, but when meeting people that we have prepared and helped, and I see that they have become men and women of God, well, then everything makes sense."
There is always someone who occasionally emerges and gives me the dumb.
"It will never fail, struggles and moments of sadness."
But it's also true that I will never miss the moments of joy.
"Q: what message do you want to let young people who are considering the missionary field but they think that the ideal of a successful Ministry to get important backers, convert the masses, become famous and write about themselves?"
A:
That they are wrong.
"Must give up their ambitions, to build an empire, because with or without their God's work will continue."
"Many men have already fallen because of pride, which is Satan's syndrome."
"The madness of wanting to do things without God, is terrible: when you decide to do things in the manner your usurping the name of Christ, is a desecration."
"Therefore, so that Christ may be in you, as saying Moody ""the extent of the Kingdom is in anything considered""."
"It's hard to explain it, because if you have a vocation, what you do will be different from what you expected."
"You have to take inesperati, and places that message that Christ gave to Peter is critical, ""Verily, verily I say unto you, that when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you grow old, stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and lead you where you wouldn't want '."
"""(John 21:18)"
"In short, the Ministry is this: you must only obey God, and then comes what must happen."
"Look, I can't tell who has not suffered, because this knowledge gained at the age of 28 years, it was only after many hardships and struggles."
"But for the grace of God, I can say: you die to yourself."
"Not be neither hypocrite, fake, and not think that get famous can impress God."
"You might also look like pitiful, when in truth you're poor, blind, naked and miserable."
A true man of God believed to give rather than receive.
"When his heart is determined to conquer a Kingdom for himself, is already a victim of Satan."
"A message that I can leave it: love others more than yourself, otherwise you will be useless."
Success.
"All of us worry with this: we want to get famous, let us know,"
"We claim that others devote biographies, to let us know on the other side of the ocean."
Those who want to get into a Ministry not to become famous in the world knowing that he will be any?
Those who prefer that the Ministry is occupied by people not interested in becoming idols?
Christ wish!
"There are men in Brazil and around the world to reflect the glory of God, willingly chosen will sacrifice fame!"
People who are the true Gospel witness without giving any attention to themselves.
"My message to those who are Christians but not famous, and who want to enter the Ministry, and that they are attracted by the fame and popularity, is: look to Scripture, and considered the example of Christ."
"Follow the Apostles as an example, as their not promoted themselves in order to magnify Christ."
Sorry.
"As Baby Boomers start to enter social security age, claiming strategies have been a popular topic."
"The decision can, can be both emotional and rational."
"The emotional decision is about getting your money now, so you can retire."
"The rational decision is whether you should, will you need insurance payments down the line or not."
"If you're worried about the amount of money, you will have at retirement, you should wait."
"If not, you should direct your decision toward the best chance of getting the largest total amount."
There are calculators available for this.
Many financial planners actually specialize in this strategy.
"As an eligible person can start ret, start their benefits as early as, as an, an eligible person, I'm sorry, can start the benefits as early as age 62 years of age."
"However, the benefit will permanately be reduced by the formula indicated above."
"For early Baby Boomers, starting benefits at age 62, will reduce their benefit by 20%."
For later Baby Boomers the benefits will reduce by 25%.
Delaying retirment by a full year.
"By a year, full, I'm sorry."
"Delaying retirement by a year beyond full retirement age, increases the benefit by 8% each year up to age 70."
This is a straight 8% increase for each year.
And is not a compounded benefit of 8%.
All of these increases and decreases are figured on a monthly basis.
From[unknown] point of view it does not matter when you take your benefits.
"The deduction is calculated as such that the break point, point, the break even point for various choices is approximately average life expectancy."
"Choosing an early, choosing early or choosing late does not matter to the system it only matters to the individual."
Here's a good time to be reminded that
Social Security is an insurance against poverty at an old age.
If you are lucky enough to live to a very old age it may be the only thing left for you.
"Thus, taking benefits early is a risky choice when considering the rate at which longevity is increasing."
"As a nod to the homemaker, so prevalent in the early years of social security nonworking spouses or spouses with low, significantly lower wage bases than higher earning spouses."
Can receive up to 50% of the higher earning spouse's benefit.
The spouse's total benefit is a combination of the lower earning spouse's own benefit and the spousal benefit to make up the difference.
"However, the higher earning spouse must have to filed, must have filed for, I am sorry the higher earning spouse must have filed for benefits in order for the spouse to receive a spousal benefit."
And if the lower earning spouse is less than his or her retirement age.
Full retirement age.
"We've done sessions in California, in New York, in Chicago, in Boston..."
I've been to Montreal once before... our partners Savoir-faire Linux was there...
"We've been doing sessions across Europe, the UK, Germany,"
"Norway (where CFEnfgine is based originally),"
"France Italy, Spain, Switzerland..."
We've been all over the world !
"The next one is gonna be in Montreal with you guys from Savoir-faire Linux, that's gonna be in September."
We've tried to tailor the course to adapt different types of public.
First half day is actually a generic introduction.
"It is a non technical morning where we cover why you'd want to do automation -- how it works, basically."
We compare the various automation tools available around there at the moment.
So that can be useful for less technical people maybe
-- Managers or ClOs -- to attend to get a feeling for what the tool can do.
We do accept attendees for that just half day.
After that we dive into CFEngine fundamentals.
"So we have one-and-a-half days of understanding how CFEngine works, how you set up a server, how you set up a client how you can edit configurations files, copy them, run processes, install packages"
-- all the basics sysadmin features used in CFEngine.
"One by one, we've got the theoretical presentations but also a lot of practical hands-on."
I really believe that the best way to learn what CFEngine is but probably most technical things is to practice to do it yourself with someone experienced seating next to you to help.
"And then the third day is what I call the advanced class, the industrialization course. and we're basically putting together all the building blocks that we learned the first two days so that you make useful solutions."
To benefit from the course altogether you need a system administration background because when you automate things system administration comes up.
So you need to know about them before you automate them.
You don't need to be a super senior hot guy
"-- just if you understand the basics of Linux or Unix system administration how to run services, install packages, edit config files, you'll be fine."
The third day actually continues on from the second day so anyone following the first two days can follow the third day as well -- no problem.
"People who already have some CFEngine knowledge and wanna come along for the third day, that's fine too."
-- Goodbye Jonathan !
-- Goodbye and thank you very much !
Not all the content that is used in a given resource is of the author's own creation.
"Respecting the copyright of those who we borrow and build from is an essential component of the dScribe process, and in strengthening the culture of sharing."
"As you go about assessing the resources, OERca keeps track of the decisions you make in clearing content, and allows you to escalate difficult questions to Open.Michigan team members through recommending an action."
This video will give a brief explanation for each of the six recommended actions and the six final actions that can be selected.
Any escape into the future or the past is examined with the likely resistance on the ongoing encounters.
"A modern man has alienated, given up so much of his potential but his ability to cope with his existence becomes badly impoverished."
My aim is this:
"the patient should recover his lost potential, he should think it great the conflicting collarities, understand the difference between in pain, especially the pain of verbal games, on the one hand, and have genuine authentic confident behavior on the other."
"The civil war of inner conflicts weakens the deficiency of the conflict of the patient, that every bit of integration and strength."
"Now, in the safe emergency of the therapeutic situation,"
"I repeat, in the safe emergency of the therapeutic situation, the patient begins to take risks."
"He does transform energies from manipulating the environment for support into developing greater and greater self support, but he relies on his own resources."
This process is called Maturation.
"Once the patient has learned to stand on his own feet emotionally, intellectually, and economically this need for therapy will collapse."
He will wake up from the nightmare of his existence.
"The basic technique is this, not to explain to things the patient, but to provide the patient with opportunities to understand and to discover himself."
For this purpose I manipulate and frustrate the patient in such a way that he is confronting himself.
In this process he identifies with his lost potential.
"For instance, through assimilating his projections by acting out."
By acting out the irritating parts of himself.
"Principally, I consider any interpretation to be a therapeutic mistake as this would imply the therapist understands the patient better, than the patient himself."
"Takes a view from the patient himself of discovering himself, by himself, and prevents him from finding out his own values and stuff."
"On the other hand, I disregard most of the content of what the patient says and concentrate most on the non-verbal level as this is the only one which is less subject to self deception."
"And its verbal, pseudo self expression, on the non-verbal level the revelant"
Gestalt will always emerge and can dealt with in the here and now.
We are going to interview for half and hour.
Right away I'm scared.
"You say you're scared, but you're smiling."
I don't understand how one can be scared and smile at the same time.
And I'm also suspicious of you.
I think you understand very well.
I think you know that... ...when I get scared I laugh or I kid to cover up.
Uh-huh.
Do you have stage fright?
"Uh, I don't know."
I'm mostly aware of you.
little nervous about all of this sort of popular sentiment and crowd action.
And I even had--let me find my favorite arrogant aristocratic quote.
Okay.
So I even found random arrogant elite guy quote in 1774 who observed with true disdain:
"""The mob begin to think and reason."""
"This is Gouverneur Morris, who actually has a really great sense of humor but also he's really kind of aristocratically disdainful."
"And he says he believes ""with fear and trembling that if the disputes with Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all possible dominions."
"We shall be under the domination of a riotous mob."""
Okay.
"So Gouverneur Morris is an extreme example of some sort of elite concern about what the Revolution means, what does it mean that people are rising up."
So that was going to be today's lecture.
That was my plan.
"But when I started thinking about the lecture and thinking about just preparing it and tweaking it, and again I had last thought about it back in December-- and you know, when you make a syilabus for a course you think about the course, you outline it, you think it's all going to go well, and then you get halfway through the course and sometimes different things seem exciting to you or you suddenly get a gut feeling that: 'wow, I was going to have a really abstract discussion today, and I don't want to have an abstract discussion."
[laughs]
I want us to be grounded in the actual Revolution.'
"All of those things happened to me when I was thinking about today's lecture, and I decided at the absolute"
last minute I wasn't going to give that lecture-- at literally the absolute last minute.
Today--This morning for me was like a reality show called
"""The Lecture"" and I was like:"
"'Freeman, three hours--research and write a new lecture.'"
So I was sort of frantically at my desk.
"So not only did I research and write a new lecture, but it's based entirely on primary research."
"So I mean--I really researched, you'll hear, and I'm going to explain in a moment what I'm actually going to be lecturing on, which is related to what I'm supposed to be lecturing on."
"But basically I just came up with something that to me felt more interesting, more immediate, that's going to show some of the same things I would have been talking about in my big, broad, general way with my"
"leadership and citizenship lecture, but instead I'm actually going to base it on real people in a real place, sort of really showing you as the Revolution's unfolding what happens to people in this place and how do events and ideas affect them."
"So when I said I hope I have a minute or two at the end-- given that I literally was printing this out as I was grabbing my coat to run here, hopefully this is all going to work and the lecture will go swimmingly."
This is true confessions.
Right?
"I should never get up in front of you and say,"
"""Maybe my lecture will die."""
[laughter]
Okay.
"Is it finished?"""
Something made the whole thing actually plausible somehow.
We got away with it.
I remember coming offstage and being like:
"""I think that actually went alright."""

Prof:
"Okay everybody, let's start in."
"Today I want to talk about green building and the opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building, and also the energy implications of green building standards."
"And I'd like to also address the history by having you think about the way that these standards have evolved over time, particularly the evolution of certification programs."
"So the idea of certification, I want you to think about it quite broadly at the outset."
Because it basically implies that certain standards are being applied to something.
"It might be a product, it could be a service."
"It could be a neighborhood, a city."
"So that the idea that there is an expert group that would review something, whether or not it's your academic preparation and performance, or whether or not it's a building's performance, and then certify it, give it a symbol."
It would rank it relative to others.
One obvious example would be looking at a GPA on a transcript.
"Well, what we'll see after today's lecture is that the green building programs that have evolved in Europe, in the United States, and Australia, they really are based on that same kind of concept."
So how would you rate the environmental and health responsibility and energy efficiency of new building standards?
How would they apply or how might they apply to renovation projects?
So I'm basically going to use the lecture today to share with you an overview of a paper that will be published in about two weeks that is a critique of the U.S.
Green Building Council's program known as LEED.
So I'd like you also think about the importance of the building sector in its demand for energy in the United States.
Buildings consume seventy-six percent of the U.S. electricity and emit almost half of the nation's greenhouse gases.
So that how we manage the future of building and development will very much influence the intensity of energy demand.
"Keep in mind also that the U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, and U.S. consumers consume nearly twenty-five percent of the world's energy and only accounts for five percent of the world's population."
So that our energy demand is increasing at about two percent per year.
So why might that be?
"I mean, obviously, we're changing our behavior."
We're changing our technology and our dependence on technology.
"And also the environments that we shape around us have enormous implications for energy that often are not well understood, for a variety of reasons."
Martin:
How do you look at the whole scenario we are moving into now?
Ole:
"Now I also work a lot with economy, beeing employed at a business school and have done so for many years when I was young I was very interested in Marxist ideas and economic theories so as I see it unfortunately we are heading into some very horrible scenarios and it applies to both the economy as a whole and our relationship with nature and the terrible thing is that we only do something about it when it's too late"
It might as well lead to a cultural revival and it's actually from there I think it would arrive
Martin:
A cultural revival?
Ole:
"Yes, a cultural revival ... a spiritual awakening is perhaps a better word a spiritual awakening where you understand that you have to saddle completely and radically over again but the cost will be very high before this consciousness change occurs"
"Now they register 40,000 cars a day, in China and that just can't go on.."
"Thank God the Chinese don't use toilet paper, cause if they did, we wouldn't have any forests left and presumably, no oxygen"
Martin:
"No, but there would be a better smell in China anyway you see there is a catastrophe scenario, but you hope there will be a kultural revival?"
Ole:
In disaster scenarios there are always cultural revivals
Martin:
"Well, you see those things?"
What are the symptoms of those things?
Ole:
"I like many of the things going on in the culture where people start to deal with what is called ""the spiritual"" but it is a very complex concept and there is so much ""Boss word"" about it but I sense a much greater need for spirituality and the answers to problems in terms of being mortal and having a soul in a body .."
"""Soma Sema"" as Plato said, ""The body is the requirements of the soul"""
One tends to focus more on that and although the solutions are confusing and weird and often commercially mediated and very distant from those that religion gave because it was institutionalized yet I see an awareness of our spiritual sides that also appear in the way we discuss how to help each other so in that way it's not a bad society we have
Martin:
You have insider information from CBS .. it is also something that the future leaders are thinking of? ole:
Yes very much ... you are even judged on whether you do so by your employees so you can not do it differently
Martin:
"So, there's only been a short time from these rabbit killer courses where you have to develop a kind of cynicism and the way people lived in the 80s to what we see now?"
Ole:
"Yes that's completely ""out"", what we are trying to do now is to set the values ​​in the center and make leaders to people who relate to their own humanity to the community and to their own human edification, to tell the truth, and I really like that."
Martin:
"And there is something about it that you associate it with art, right?"
Ole:
Now certainly you go to certain parts of
"Greece or Italy, or any Mediterranean country for that matter, and see that maybe the diet doesn't exactly reflect this."
But in the period of 1960 this is what the Mediterranean diet traditio nally looked like.
"What do you notice, about this pyramid, that's different, than some of the other food guides, that you might have seen?"
"Well to start out with, if you look at the base, the base of this pyramid focuses on being physically active, and the notion of enjoying meals with one another."
"But there's certainly a pscyhological component, and the sharing of foods among family and friends, that's integral, to this lifestyle."
"The base of the pyramid, as it pertains to food, is focusing on fruits, grains, vegetables."
Mostly whole grains.
"And olive oil, beans, nuts, legumes, seeds, herbs, and spices."
There's a little bit of protein that comes from fish and seafood.
"And even less focus on poultry, eggs, cheese. and yogurt."
"At the top, in very limited amounts, you see meats and sweets."
"Notice over here, there's inclusion of wine and it says, in small print, but it's there, in moderation."
"There's also the encouragement to drink water, which is a nice way of saying don't drink sugary sweetened beverages."
One of the most interesting things about the Mediterranean Diet is that it's not a low-fat diet.
"Right, it's actually pretty moderate in fat intake, 25 to 35% of the total of the calories."
Saturated fat's comprises no more than seven to eight percent of the calories.
"So, it's pretty decent in fat, but the fat's don't come from butter and cheese and meat."
They come from monounsaturated fat.
"Things like olive oil, nuts, and seeds."
With just a tiny amount of animal foods included in a diet.
"These monounsaturated fats are not alone protective against cardiovascular disease, but in combination, the lifestyle factors plus the dietary components, are what researchers think is the primary reason why we see lower rates of heart disease in people who eat this way."
There also is inclusion in the Mediterranean diet on alcohol.
Alcohol may be cardio protective in two ways.
It helps to reduce clotting and it also slightly elevates your HDL
levels.
"Now if you don't drink alcohol, its not worth picking it up or starting to drink alcohol to get these benefits."
"But if you do drink alcohol, there is an incentive to drink in moderation."
"Moderation, in nutrition science, with regards to alcohol consumption is referred to as no more than one glass of wine per day for women, and one to two glasses of wine per day for men, or another alcoholic beverage."
"But the point is that it should be, limited to one glass or serving per day for females, and one to two per day for males."
"What does the research show about the Mediterranean diet and heart health outcomes, and how does the"
"Mediterranean diet which is not low in fat, compare to a low-fat diet?"
So the analyst in me wanted to see what are the rates of cancer here in the US versus the rest of these countries that never allowed this?
"Because while correlation is not causation,"
I wanted to see the data.
"So I turned to the American Cancer Society and I learned that one in two men, and one in three women are expected to get cancer in their lifetime here in the US."
I then learned from the Centers for Disease Control that cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in kids under the age of 15.
So I wanted to learn more because milk allergy is the most common allergy in the US according to CNN and the Wall Street Journal.
But I was an analyst so I knew correlation wasn't causation.
"And so I turned to soy, because a couple of years later, scientists genetically engineered the soybean to contain a new protein so that it could withstand increasing doses of weedkiller."
"Again, it makes sense as a business model."
"If you're a chemical corporation, you're trying to sell weedkiller."
"But at the same time, it had never been proven safe, there were no long-term human studies, and the one human study that had been conducted showed a 50 percent increase in the rates of soy allergy."
"And so when I learned that, I thought,"
"""Why is nobody talking about these foreign proteins, and the risk that they might present, and that they might trigger an allergic reaction?"""
"Because I was learning that while protocols were in place, there were no definitive tests to determine whether or not these proteins were causing these allergic reactions."
"So I reached out to some food allergy doctors, some food allergy organizations, and they pretty much had an allergic reaction to me."
"So I pulled their financial statements,"
"(Laughter) and I learned that some of the largest food allergy organizations, and some of the most prominent researchers, were funded by the agrichemical corporation that was engineering these proteins into our food supply."
"And as I sat on that, I thought,"
"""You know, I guess technically, there's nothing wrong with that."
"But I sort of wish these guys were more like Nascar drivers and maybe wore those logos on the fronts of their jackets."""
(Laughter)
"And so I thought, ""You know, what else?"""
"And I learned that a few years later, in the late 1990s, using this new technology, scientists genetically engineered a new protein into our corn."
It was to reduce the spraying of insecticides over cornfields.
Who could argue with that?
"But what they did was that they engineered that insecticidal protein into the corn seed, so that as the corn plant grows, it manufactures and creates its own insecticide which it can release as it grows."
It's a brilliant business model.
"But because of that new protein, that corn was then regulated by the EPA as an insecticide."
Countries around the world again said there are no long-term human studies we don't want this in our food supply.
Some countries didn't want it fed to their livestock.
"And in some countries like France and New Zealand, they didn't even want it planted in their soil."
"And yet, here in the US, we introduced it."
"And how not only did I arrive to mindfulness but how certain passion  would develop my circumstances, to create some social impact and  bring mindfulness out into the world."
"In 1985, I was diagnosed with Lupus."
"For those who don't know what lupus is, it is an autoimmune deficiency disorder."
I can only say that  it is horrendous physical pain.
"Every aspect of who I was, was gone  like the water going down the drain."
I just didn't know who I was any longer.
"I had been working and living in Israel, I had very little family support."
"And coming from Toronto, Canada,"
"I had very little experience as if almost none, on living in a country of conflict, that was fragmented by war and violence."
"I was quite suspect that a lot  of the stress that came right of that, was really the catalyst  to my lupus."
"I couldn't get any western doctor to agree with that, that is besides the point."
"So, I was in tremendous pain  and it was very debilitating."
"And at the risk of getting dramatic,  had it not been a girlfriend who walked into my living room with this little white book by Thich Nhat Hanh, called 'Peace is Every Step',  I am not so sure I will be here today."
It changed my life.
"I went that summer to Toronto,"
"I bought another book  called 'The Miracle of Mindfulness', and it set me free."
"I came back to Israel because I was living there at that time, I had two children."
"And I went to my doctor and I said,  ""No more medicine,I think I have the key."""
"I started meditation, tai-chi,  a micro-biotic diet, and I practiced breathing,  breathing, breathing, staying centered in the present moment as  supposed to, resonating into my own story, my challenges, and so on and so forth."
Mindfulness really helped me  navigate the obstacles in my life.
"So, as time unfolded,  I started to feel better."
"And in fact, my greatest obstacle  became my greatest gift, how about that?"
"I am sure you all experience that,"
"I am sure my story is similar to many of your stories but it ended up that this obstacle,  this loop was the gift that allowed me to open up and bring mindfulness to others."
"So it wasn't that I wanted my experience to be heard by others but what I did want to do is to discover and explore what is the role and relationship of mindfulness,  not just in every day living and healing but in countries of conflict  where societies are fragmented, where the people are growing up  in conditions that are horrific."
And so I went to Rwanda and  did a mapping report.
I found out that actually these societies generally fragmented by war really want to build community and  what better to all than using mindfulness as a way to bring people back to the present moment.
"After being encouraged to bring  mindfulness into health-care in Rwanda and actually in Kigali and only  in a selected number of NGOs... just to give the proportion, one small step at a time..."
"After our workshops there,  we then went to Nigeria and to Uganda, and we found out that everywhere we went, what mindfulness was doing, was unlocking the human potential of people unable to look at their life as they are in the present moment, because they are so stuck and  horrified by their pasts."
"So when we were in Rwanda,  one of our teachers said,"
"""Why don't you do this for youth,  especially youth in Rwanda."""
"Because when they transition  at the high school, it is not like a lot of them go to higher education, as they do in Canada and the States and another developed countries."
"I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns."
These are just not things we talked about very often.
"And yet, now, it's talked about all the time."
"At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way."
"And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this."
"How many of you saw USA Today, today?"
There it is.
Looks like that.
"There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover."
They've made a selection.
"They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture."
"Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here."
"He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go,"
"""Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."""
Right.
"Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities."
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.
"And so we got this, or we had a choice of that."
"Oh, stop clapping."
(Laughter)
It's too late.
That is gone.
"This was a scheme by a team called THlNK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme."
"This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it."
"Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever."
But that's what we're going to do.
"But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically."
"And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution."
"Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date."
"I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us."
"So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's"
"Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the -- in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism."
"The Minecraft community went bananas over this project, and Ben became an instant media celebrity."
"And indeed, for quite a few people, taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will, has turned into a life-changing experience."
"For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music and math major from East Lansing, Michigan."
"A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post on our website, and I'd like to read it to you."
So here's what Dan said.
"""I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through."
"I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree."
"But given what I now feel capable of doing,"
I would certainly do it again.
"To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."""
"So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners who take this course off the Web, on their own traction, on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades."
They are doing it because of one motivation only.
They have a tremendous passion to learn.
"And with that in mind,"
I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
I'm sick of it.
"We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data, and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing, and a huge part of education is about failing."
"Courage, according to Churchill, is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm."
(Laughter)
And [Joyce] said that mistakes are the portals of discovery.
"And yet we don't tolerate mistakes, and we worship grades."
"So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4, which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are."
"Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense, and grading became degrading."
"So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading, and share with you a glimpse from my current project, which is different from the previous one, but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-learning, learning by doing, self-exploration and community-building, and this project deals with K-12 math education, beginning with early age math, and we do it on tablets because we believe that math, like anything else, should be taught hands on."
So here's what we do.
"Basically, we developed numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining a particular concept in math."
"So for example, let's take area."
"When you deal with a concept like area -- well, we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn."
"So if area is what interests us, then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely."
And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area.
"Moving along, what about the area of this figure?"
"Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it."
"Right now, Governor Snyder is pushing a bill that would give himself,"
"Governor Snyder and his administration, the power to declare any town or school district to be in a financial emergency."
"If a town was declared by the governor and his administration to be in a financial emergency, they would get to put somebody in charge of that town."
"And they want to give that emergency manager they've just put in charge of the town, the power to ""reject, modify or terminate"" any contracts the town may have entered into."
Including any collective bargaining agreement.
"So this emergency person, who get's put in charge of a town deemed to be in financial crisis, by the governor's administration."
This emergency person gets to strip the town of union rights.
"Unilaterally, by their own personal authority."
"But this emergency person also gets the power, under this bill, to suspend or dismiss, elected officials!"
Think about that for a second.
Doesn't matter who you voted for in Michigan.
"Doesn't matter who you elected, you're elected local government can be dismissed, at will."
"The emergency person, sent in by the Rick Snyder administration, could recommend that a school district be absorbed into another school district."
"That emergency person is also granted power specifically to dis-incorporate or dissolve, entire city governments."
What year was your town founded?
"Does it say so, like on the town border, as you drive into your town?"
Does it say what year your town was founded?
What did your town's founding fathers and founding mothers have to go through in order to incorporate your town?
"Republicans in Michigan want to be able to unilaterally abolish your town, and dis-incorporate it - regardless of what you, as a resident of that town, think about it."
"You don't even have the right to express an opinion about it, through your locally elected officials, who represent you."
"Because the Republicans in Michigan say they reserve the right to dismiss your measly elected officials, and to do what they want instead, because they know best."
"The version of this bill that passed the Republican controlled Michigan House, said it was fine for this emergency power, to declare a fiscal emergency."
Invoking all of these extreme powers.
It was fine for that power to be held by a corporation.
"So ? of Michigan, could at the governor's disposal, be handed over to the discretion of a company."
You still want your town to exist?
Take it up with the board of directors of this corporation that will be overseeing your future now.
"Or rather, don't take it up with them, frankly their not interested."
"Instead of thinking of Michigan as the Upper and Lower Penninsula,"
"let's just consider the prospect of Amway-stan, right?"
The area between Pontiac and Flint?
"Could be the next Dow Chemical-ville, maybe?"
"We are seeing clinical reports of weight gain in patients, so that could be an issue."
"There is a potential for some urinary retention, so keep that in mind with patients."
"There are some drug interactions to be aware of, but not necessarily limiting treatment options, as talked about with some of the other agents."
"The next dual-action agent is an NDRl, or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor."
And this is unique because it's not touching anything related to serotonin.
So this is a different shift from what we've talked about.
We're increasing dopamine and norepinephrine.
"You have to remind yourself, too, that all of these increases, when you touch one neurotransmitter directly, you will indirectly increase all of them."
So this is a direct increase of dopamine and norepinephrine.
Not to say that eventually the patient may get some serotonin effect also.
So the one agent is Buproprion.
We have a lot of formulations of this drug:
"Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL."
"We have also an agent called Zyban, which is Buproprion, and it's indicated for nicotine addiction, so that's a smoking cessation agent."
"So you have to be careful if you have a patient already taking this drug for smoking cessation, then we don't want to add it on for depression."
Your dosing is anywhere from 75-450mg a day.
"And it's going to be in divided doses, depending on the agent you use."
And we'll kind of show you that on the next slide.
This drug is very activating.
"So, if you're on a formulation that needs to be taken three times a day, don't have the patient taking it past dinner time."
"If you have a patient taking this at bedtime, most likely next month they'll need some sort of sleeping agent because they're going to have trouble falling asleep."
"They're going to have restlessness, insomnia - often people just feel like they're crawling out of their skin."
There is absolutely no sexual side effect with this medication because there's no serotonin activity.
This agent can also be used for patients who have a decrease in sex drive while taking a [inaudible] other antidepressant that affects serotonin.
So you can add this in.
There are a few contraindications.
"Anyone... per the packaging, and that's with a seizure disorder and eating disorder."
A little history on that:
"The reason that this was contraindicated in seizure patients and in eating disorder patients is because it was studied in very high doses in bulimic patients, and that small subset of patients had an increased risk of head seizures, so, it's kindof followed the drug along throughout its history."
"And again, we talked about patients on Zyban for smoking cessation already."
It's the same medication.
"So, the different agents we have are immediate release, sustained release, and extra-long acting, I guess you could call it."
Well it turns out that free here does not mean the pricing is nothing.
"There is also implicit pricing, that is the amount of impact one can have."
So you can call that fame.
You can call that influential power.
"Basically those who contribute to Wikipedia believe that their reward, even though not financial, can be immense."
"In their articles and writing's might be read by tens of millions of people, might be quoted in various other articles and give them a very big sense of satisfaction and accomplishment."
So that is one reason why many people contribute a lot.
"There's also a very strong positive narrow effect, this N squared effect, which is mentioned, 'kay?"
As more people start to read a certain article.
It provides even more incentive for people to contribute cuz they know the audience is very big.
So the difficult part of Wikipedia is at the very beginning around 2001 to 2002 when you didn't have as many audience.
"When people realized that googling the term usually returns Wiki article within the top three entries, then people will have, have much larger incent, big incentive to contribute."
"We'll later in the next lecture look at the different trajectories of growth of popularity of a certain product and services and how the now, if that place in shaping that curve."
"The second challenge is that, is open to anyone."
Including those who are not experts.
"Non experts, including even those who are anonymous."
"And the saving grace for solving this problem is check and balance While you can write anything arbitrary, but probably within a few seconds, it will be corrected by somebody else."
So having a large pool of community is very important to provide the checks and balance features.
The third one is open to any subject.
"Including those that are sensitive, in terms of religion or political or other social subjects."
So there must be some guidelines and rules and some mechanism to enable a meaningful writing process and editing process for these subjects.
So what are the policy and guidelines?
"There are three key policies, and quite a few other guidelines, we'll just work through the top three policies here."
"One policy in Wikipedia is abbreviated as V, stands for verifiability."
"And this can be implemented in mechanism, which is external link."
You cannot just claim something is true on a weekend article.
"If you want to contribute article or an article with something new, you have to provide way for people to verify it."
"If it cannot be forcified or validated, it that it cannot be stated."
"Another policy is abbreviated as NOR, No"
"Original Research, because this is encyclopedia."
It's not a peer reviewed journal article.
"So you cannot say, I, invented a new, theorem, or new law."
"And when it dies, it falls to the bottom and then it rots, which means that bacteria break it down."
"And in the process they use up all the oxygen, and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away."
"So, what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish, as you see on the left in front of you."
"And the only fishery left -- and it is a commercial fishery -- is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right, where there used to be prawns."
"Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod, we now have a jellyfish fishery."
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms.
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
"I have talked about it a million times, but it's unbelievable."
"In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta, and the lower left of that picture is the Texas-Mexico border."
"You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico; you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish, made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right."
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore.
That's the same species.
"And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress."
And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida.
"A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night, and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on."
"And I said,"
"""So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe."
"And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast, because the coast, instead of being paradise, is harmful to your health."""
And then this is amazing.
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
"This is from the coast of Brittany, which is being enveloped in this green, algal slime."
"The reason that it attracted so much attention, besides the fact that it's disgusting, is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die, and a farmer died of it, and you can imagine the scandal that happened."
"And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all, and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis."
"And then, of course, there's climate change, and we all know about climate change."
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea.
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage.
"Well, the Northwest Passage is already there."
"I think it's sort of funny; it's on the Siberian coast, maybe the Russians will charge tolls."
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously.
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously.
"For all the denial of climate change by government leaders, the ClA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada, whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view."
"And, of course, Arctic communities are toast."
Rising food prices limits people's access to food.
"And years of intensive chemical farming has destroyed lands, affecting the viability of future harvests."
What can we do to GROW?
Let's GROW our own movement here in Southeast Asia.
We can help women empower themselves so that they can have better access to produce food ... for their families and communities.
The FAO estimates that if women had the same access to productive resources as men ... yields can increase by 20 to 30%.
We can do this by supporting communities and peoples affected by land grabbing ... especially those who are pushed off by giant corporations.
We should call on government and companies to put a stop to land grabbing.
As individuals and groups ... we can push for regulation to help ensure that investments also benefit and do not harm communities.
We can also push for a global climate deal that demand huge emission cuts from developed countries.
Developed countries should also provide technology and finance ... to support adaptation projects of communities in the region.
We can call on governments in the region to invest in sustainable agricultural production using the communities local knowledge.
"We can buy and consume locally produced food ... to also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, normally produced in shipping food."
We can plant and GROW our-own seed now.
"For food, livelihood, community and the planet."
"Dear Athletes, I am glad to welcome you here at the capital city of lower Austria"
Lots of you have been here in the last years the know the awsome track the organizators have done their best - and they invented some new goodies the ironkids and the expo is now situated in the city center
"I hope, that beside the ironman event you will find some time to visit the town center and the whole region"
"I wish all the best, an awsome Im 70.3 and a good time in St. Pölten"
Dear Athletes of the IM 70.3 in St. Pölten
The orga welcomes you we wish a pleasant time and all the best for the race we hope to see you again next year
"Honestly, I didn't expect there will be so many of you, and I don't mean here particularly, I mean here altogether."
"I've been living thinking that there are 6 billion of us on this planet, it turns out there are more than 7 billion of us here already."
"Yet, you know, many surveys and popular sentiment suggest people feel more and more isolated, more and more lonely, more and more depressed, or just bored."
"Which made me wonder: how many people, out of those 7 billion, can one actually have meaningful relationships with?"
"I'm not talking here about the illusion created by Facebook or Twitter,"
I mean like real friendships.
If I can just ask you to think and count: how many real friends do you think you have?
How many people can you have a long and interesting conversation with?
"Or, how many people would you invite and would like to see for your birthday?"
"Or, how many people in unfortunate circumstances would show up in the hospital?"
It turns out there is a number
It took about 150 million years for the distance between to continents to come to what it is today.
It's a story that began when Africa and the Americas were still joined together
"It's impossible to explain, to think or even to redirect the country's history"
"Obviously many species had already existed before, but the diversity has been"
One cannot thrive without the other.
So I think this point is crucial.
So the relationship between the water and the forest is a very close dependency.
"Starting about 150 million years ago, the two continents started separating"
The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's rain forests.
"The forests were entered, worked on,"
The measurements that have been made in recent years indicate that
The numbers are overwhelming.
The ocean waters recede from the coasts.
The principal conditioning factor in the Atlantic Forest is climate.
The story of the Atlantic Forest is a very old story
"There was rain and heat arriving at the Scarpas,"
These forests have a long biological history.
They live in traditional communities that know how to manage the Forest's resources
"They occur mainly in between the tropics,"
They show that we won't see even 30 more years of forest coverage.
They were long-term cycles that set new conditions for life on the planet.
This destruction didn't end with the economic cycles of the past.
"Through plains, dunes and valleys,"
Two of these areas are in Brazil: the cerrado and the Atlantic Forest.
"Waterfalls, springs, groundwater..."
All this right in the middle of the jungle.
"We need to consider not only their culture, but also how to return these benefits"
"We soon realize the importance of this rain forest,"
Weather becomes drier and cooler.
"You don't find such abundant water in a place without a lot of vegetation. all the way to the top of the mountains. all these are bits of our history that have seized upon the Atlantic Forest. and irrigate Brazil's Southeast Region. and it still has not stopped increasing. and so many benefits are being taken from the Atlantic Forest. and that water is a constant sight here. being reduced to practically 80 thousand square kilometers, but hosts the highest plant diversity index on the planet. coming from the Atlantic Ocean, which causes rain along the entire coastline. decomposing the rock that was forming, allowing vegetation to grow improved by a series of climate changes. in areas that see more than 1800mm of yearly rainfall. is home to a very large traditional population, known as glaciations."
"largely eliminated by social and economic processes. mangroves and bushes spread only about 8% of its pre-colonization size. particularly at this time when there is so much debate over biotech and patents, rain forest area is located inside Brazil. spawning the environment where today there lies the Atlantic Forest sustainably, i.e. there is a traditional science to the handling of the Atlantic Forest, the clearing of forests for coffee plantation, sugar cane taking over the Northeast, the forest roams. those who have lost at least 70% of their original vegetation are known as ""hot spots"". to these traditional communities. we've lost about the size of a football field every four minutes. which we need to understand, rescue and value, whose culture is connected to the Atlantic Forest. without going through the Atlantic Forest as a starting point."
The final for the outdoor cooking class is a practicum.
"What true capitalism does is rewards people who are productive; people who work a lot of hours, people who have a lot of talent, people who come up with good ideas, they get big rewards under capitalism, and people who don't do those sorts of things get less."
The one negative one might be concerned about is that some people have very little skill.
"They are not able to earn very much left on their own, and so very reasonable people support some antipoverty spending."
"But that's completely different than interfering with capitalism, regulating prices, limiting quantities, opposing all sorts of things on businesses."
"Those make the economy less productive, give us a smaller pie, and make it even harder for us to operate programs that help those who are less fortunate and because they were unlucky."
The third myth is that capitalism was responsible for the recent financial crisis and the recession.
"That, again, is almost exactly the opposite of what is true."
"First of all, nobody who's being intellectually honest thinks that we had unbridled, serious capitalism before the crisis hit, before the subprime buildup occurred, before we had all the housing problems."
"We had enormous government interventions that subsidized risk, enormous government interventions that encouraged an over investment in housing."
"If one's going to try to draw any conclusions, it seems to suggest much more clearly that interfering with capitalism generates financial crises, generates recessions, because what we experienced was directly related to the incentives for excessive risk taking, the incentives for over investment of housing that were created by government."
"The private sector responded to those incentives, so of course the private sector can't be completely absolved of being involved."
"But in the sense of causing, it was the bad policies that caused it not what the private sector or capitalism did on its own."
"Most importantly, whenever government bailout people who took excessive risk, they encourage people to do more of that in the future, and we unfortunately went a huge way in that direction via the TARP and via all the federal reserve policies, which helped Wall Street and the risk takers not have to pay the true price for all of the excessive risk taking they engaged in."

"And, and they've got a bunch of partnerships with retailers to redeem the rewards."
Standard straightforward kind of gamified system which they've been able to use in a large number of communities to encourage recycling behavior.
"Again this is a, this is a perfect example that this basic structure could be about anything, could be about something that's commercial, but it's using those techniques to help improve recycling and create all those sorts of benefits."
Education is in many ways ripe for gamification.
"Student motivation is a huge challenge, and we already have scoring systems, and reward systems, and credentialing systems, and so forth."
The challenge is for gamification to make the system better and not worse.
"Because to the extent that the game elements push students to just focus on those rewards, and just on what it takes to optimize on the game, and that's different from the true, authentic, intrinsically motivating learning that they should be engaged in."
"The gamification system, like a lot of educational reform effort might actually."
"Harm the educational process rather then help, so that's an important caveat."
"But there still are ways that gamification, if designed right, can be used in many positive ways in education."
And there are a range of different experiments and initiatives going on.
One interesting one is called Quest to
"Learn, which is an entire school."
There is now one in New York and in
Chicago built around games and games structures as the entire foundation of the curriculum.
"It's being led by Katie Sahlen, who is a noted game designer and game theorist and games educator."
"So, the number that are open at the end of one millisecond will be 100, because we started with 100 plus delta N zero is computed, as computed by the calculation we have just completed."
"So, if you would work that out please and find out what the actual number is at the end of one millisecond."
"Now, let's go on and do the question for ten milliseconds."
"Now, we can't just do this like we did part A because there is too much of an extrapolation."
"So, I'd say there's just too much, too long, ten milliseconds."
Too long to do in one step.
"I mean, for that matter, one millisecond might have been too long to do it in one step."
"We did it that way, but if we had done it in say, ten short steps, each 100 micro seconds, our answer might have been a little bit different and it would have been better."
"Ten milliseconds is definitely too long, so we have to do it some other way."
"Well, there are a couple of alternatives."
One alternative is to write a computer program and to do it as a whole bunch of short steps.
"But a better alternative, a better alternative is to look at our equation, dN0 / dt equals whatever it is, and then to solve that equation, solve."
"And when we solve the equation, we'll get"
N0 as a function of time equal to whatever it is over here on the right hand side.
Maybe you can solve it.
"And if you do, then, you'll be able to"
Each move will be made with millimetre precision.
Many objects in the Universe also glow in the infrared.
"Discovered by William Herschel, infrared radiation is often also called ""heat radiation"" because it is emitted by all relatively warm objects, including humans."
You may be more familiar with infrared radiation than you think.
"Because on Earth, this kind of radiation is used by night vision goggles and cameras."
"But to detect the faint infrared glow from distant objects, astronomers need very sensitive detectors, cooled down to just a few degrees above absolute zero in order to suppress their own heat radiation."
"Today, most big optical telescopes are also equipped with infrared cameras."
"They allow you to see right through a cosmic dust cloud, revealing the newborn stars inside, something that just cannot be seen in the optical."
"For example, take this optical image of the famous stellar nursery in Orion."
But look how different it is when seen through the eyes of an infrared camera.
Been able to seeing the infrared is also very helpful when studying the most distant galaxies.
The newborn stars in a young galaxy shine very brightly in the ultraviolet.
But then this ultraviolet light has to travel for billions of years across the expanding Universe.
"The expansion stretches the light-waves, so that when they are received by us they've been shifted all the way into the near infrared."
This stylish instrument is the MAGlC telescope on La Palma.
"It searches the sky for cosmic gamma rays, the most energetic form of radiation in nature."
"Lucky for us, the lethal gamma rays are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere."
But they do leave behind footprints for astronomers to study.
"After heating the atmosphere, they produce cascades of energetic particles."
"These, in turn, cause a faint glow that MAGlC can see."
And here is the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina.
It doesn't even look like a telescope.
"Pierre Auger consists of 1,600 detectors, spread over 3,000 square kilometres."
They catch the particle fallout of cosmic rays from distant supernovas and black holes.
And what about neutrino detectors?
"Built in deep mines or beneath the surface of the ocean, or in the Antarctic ice."
Could you call those telescopes?
"Well, why not?"
"After all they do observe the Universe, even if they don't capture data from the electromagnetic spectrum."
Neutrinos are elusive particles that are produced in the Sun and supernova explosions.
They were even produced in the Big Bang itself.
"Unlike other elementary particles, neutrinos can pass through regular matter, travel near the speed of light and have no electric charge."
"It's something that's happened over the last five or ten years in consumer electronics, but it's fundamental."
"So, what's happening now is that people are finally getting it to the point where we can build computers and computing technology that people actually want to use in their daily lives, it just works."
"It's taken us a very, very long time and I'm very proud to say that the just works option finally is available."
"It starts from a new strategy in the industry which I'm going to call ""Mobile First."" If you look at what's happening today in the industry, the best applications, the most powerful new uses of computers are occurring on smartphones."
"Now, why?"
"You would think that they would occur on these big, big expensive computers that are still being made."
"No, because the smartphones are so powerful now, and they have everything that you need to have a great information source, a great entertainment source, and of course, it's a very, very large market."
"So this new generation of programmers, the new generation of companies are starting Mobile"
First.
"And in a particular, smartphone first."
"It's interesting that smartphone sales will soon surpass PC sales, never to--never to catch-up again."
"And the mobile web, which is the web services that the mobile use is using, is growing eight times faster than the equivalent desktop web from ten years ago."
"So, not only is this a larger market, but its also growing much, much quicker."
"As a result, we see all of the developments that are occurring today."
And this is against the backdrop of pervasive connectivity.
"I don't need to tell you, Europe and Germany are particularly good at this."
There are very high-speed networks all throughout at least the western world.
"And when you go on vacation or you go to another country you don't normally visit, you're shocked to discover that they have no data connectivity or a small amount of data connectivity."
"We take it for granted that these networks have always been there, but in fact, they're relatively new, only a few years."
So how quickly we forget?
"It's interesting that the next generation of mobile technology, which is called LTE will generate 50 megabits per second."
"I can remember thinking, ""Oh, if we could just get to one megabit per second, I'll be happy."" Well, of course, I'm never happy and now I want 50."
"When we get 50, I'll want more."
What can you do with 50 megabits?
"Video, real-time streaming, all sorts of things that you could never imagine doing with a handheld device, all of these now are possible because of the technology that people are using."
"It's interesting that the Internet is now so pervasive that one estimate has 35 billion devices connected in one form or another, including devices in cars and all sorts of other kinds of things, many more than the kinds of devices that we're used to."
It's amazing that this is all occurring.
And this is giving us an opportunity to build these large platforms.
"And so, there's a set of products, a set of platforms and a set of companies that are driving this move forward."
"Let me give you an example, look at the iPhone and the iPad; new powerful applications that could access the data in the back, Google, of course, is a partner."
We'll show you Android.
We'll talk about Chrome OS.
We have another question coming in.
"Do we look at ways to talk about our work as place-based, because it often is?"
Arley:
I'll let Mark take that one because I know he's well versed in place-based.
Mark: that's a great question and I think that there's even language in the budget request talking about how we can look at CSBG work as place based.
Let me read you this quote specifically from the budget justification.
"""The purposes and goals of the Community Services Block Grant focus on strengthening communities and reducing poverty by using a broad range of federal, state, and local resources."
"Just as place-based efforts leverage investments by focusing resources in targeted places and draw on the compounding effect of cooperative arrangement""."
So clearly this is the work that Community Action is doing.
Part of it is messaging and talking about our work that is place-based but also looking at how we can collaborate and cooperate with other efforts the administration is specifically picking out as our place-based initiative.
"There are things like Community Action that are ongoing that are place based, but the administration has a couple of favored projects that they're working on."
There's a number of place- based things that they're doing that are even serving the same populations of people that the
Community Action is serving we need to look at how we can collaborate with better.
Brad:
Very good answer.
Let me just remind our audience we're in the final 15 minutes of the webinar.
If you do have any questions or if you have a comment to make on any of the issues that we've discussed please go ahead and enter the little chat function now and send us your question or comment.
We had several people write in about the audio.
It will be available at the end of this week on the NASCSP website.
"It will be prominently noted on the homepage of the website, so you will be able to quickly get to it."
We thank you for your patience.
I apologize to anyone who experienced audio problems.
We understand some folks at the beginning of the webinar did have some audio issues and we hope that they resolved.
"Now we have a question here regarding the performance of the CSBG program, and Arley this gets into a subjective area as to the national performance of the program based on funding received."
Are we performing well in terms of numbers and outcomes recorded on the national level?
"Is the problem quantity of services clients"" outcomes?"
Or is it that we are not reporting on the right things?
Arley:
"I think that that's a very good question, and I'll start it and I'll let Mark finish it."
When CSBG was turned into a block grant it was envisioned to be 50 experiments in the country.
50 programs that all
look different that are based upon the needs of that particular state or that particular area.
"You don't get better, just you accelerate your chakras and this is not a healthy condition, actually it's a condition of instability,"
It's a back and forth.
Be healthy and happy is to maintain the continuity of our energy linearity.
This is healthy!
"But for this we must ""be""."
"It's not a matter of controlling,"
"It's not a matter of saying you'll learn a technique and do it, because it does not work that way."
"So we're talking about energy and energy is a fundamental process, it's fundamental."
"It's everywhere, whether we believe it or not, there is no place that is empty."
There will always be energy.
"The composition of the universe or the universes, or everything that exists, is energetic."
And we are immersed in those energies.
"Depending on our thoughts, on how we are, we can make this energy better or worse."
"So, you catch this energy through the chakras all the time."
We can't create excuses like this:
"""Now I'll get energy."""
"No, you're receiving all the time."
"If you are in a place with purest and immanent energy you will feel very well, will feel happy, you will feel energized."
"In fact, this thing of feeling energized, I'll explain it: dense energies have a much slower circulation within us, that's why when you are feeling bad, feeling sick it's because the circulation of this energy is not happening."
"Then you go to a place with plenty immanent energy and stay there under a tree, a very good place, away from people, because people produce emotional energy, then you may say:"
"""Wow!"
"I'm recovered! """
"Of course you're recovered, you just consumed much more subtle energy, which circulates much faster in your energetic body and after all, when you realize, you're revitalized."
"So, know and understand energy is a very important thing."
Dense energies are produced in the lower chakras and subtler energies are those produced in the higher chakras.
"So, lower chakras: there is the spleen, the umbilical, the sex chakra, the hepatic chakra, these are the energies that transiting these chakras."
"The energy that would be average, i.e. not emotional, and not subtle, is that which is in the lower frequencies of the heart chakra."
These frequencies exist in the heart chakra because every chakra is connected with previous and next chakra.
"So, to make a connection with the previous chakra, which is emotional, you must have similar frequencies."
"Result: when you feel palpitations, or your heart is beating very fast due to an emotion,"
It's because the emotional chakras have contaminated the heart chakra at it's lowest part.
"Now, in the upper part the frequencies of heart chakra are stable, they are connected to the next chakra that would be the laryngeal chakra."
"It's important to know these things because we need to work with the best energies, but we should never despise any energy generated by any chakra, because they are all always working, with greater intensity or less intensity."
"And you may even know the level of evolution of a person by knowing in which chakra they are working most of time, that means, with their emotions, their feelings, their individual productions."
"It's important to know, but this is not the time to talk about it, which would be exactly the spiritual evolution of the individual. this will not be discussed."
Now I'm just talking about the energies and these energies are catched by our chakras and exteriorized to the environment.
"Well, that's an important thing for us to know, because we can not make up stories about it."
"All people ... there is no one on the planet who does not do this: you receive energy, one part stays with you and the other part you exteriorize in the environment."
"The part that stays with you is exactly the one that makes you perform, work, is your fuel, end the part which you exteriorize in the environment is the surplus of energies, because you are constantly capturing energy and constantly exteriorizing energy, furthermore you are using part of that energy."
"So, think of one thing: for every thought you are emanating, depending on thought, a mental energy."
"If you are, for example, imagining things, you will be working with the energies of the frontal chakra."
"If you are very emotional, you will already be working with the emotional chakras and then you will be producing emotional energies."
That's why we say very frequently:
"""Wow, I got so excited!"
"It was such a happy moment, I was deeply touched! "" gives the impression that we are doing something that is fantastic, but it is not."
Why it is not fantastic?
"Because the moment you get emotional, you work with the lower chakras, you are producing dense and unhealthy energies."
And may you think:
"""Gosh, I'll always have to keep my energy in a higher level?"""
"Look, this thing of keep the energy in a higher level, sounds like an effort, but you simply have to ""be"" and you will not make any effort to produce the best energies."
The best energies are produced when we are enlightened and this enlightenment allows us to make our life a linear life in terms of response to the environment.
"The environmental stimuli can become emotional responses or they can only become responses from the chakra of feeling (heart chakra), this way responses are very different and much more realistic."
So let's learn more about energy.
"And to learn more about energy, you could do some experiments."
"Start by experimenting, for example with plants."
Put your hands near the plants and try to feel what happens.
That's nice.
You will try to feel.
"Any variation of energy you feel, would be a good to note down."
Put your hand on the earth and try to feel earth's energy.
It's another good experiment.
Do you know another great experiment?
Put your hand into the cold water.
"Feel, feel it."
It's a measure of how the increase in the number of copies scales with the decrease in the size of the segment.
"And very roughly, it's sort of the density of the self-similarity."
"Let me quote a little bit from my own book, ""Complexity:"
"A Guided Tour."" where I talk about what fractal dimension means."
"""I've seen many attempts at intuitive descriptions of what fractal dimension means."
"For example, it has been said that fractal dimension represents the roughness, ruggedness, jaggedness, or complicatedness of an object; an object's degree of fragmentation; and how dense the structure of the object is."
One description I like a lot is the rather poetic notion that fractal dimension quantifies the cascade of detail in an object.
"That is, it quantifies how much detail you see at all scales as you dive deeper and deeper into the infinite cascade of self-similarity."
"For structures that aren't fractals, such as a smooth, round marble, if you keep looking at the structure with increasing magnification, eventually there's a level with no interesting details."
"Fractals, on the other hand, have interesting details at all levels, and fractal dimension, in some sense, quantifies how interesting that detail is as a function of how much magnification you have to do at each level to see it."""
Hello Space Lab!
"I am Sean Carroll, here at the Calfornia Institute of Technology where I am a theoretical physicist and the author of From Eternity to Here:"
The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time and I'm here to answer your questions.
The first question is:
"""If you would travel at 99.9%  the speed of light,"
"""what would things look like?"""
"And ""Is it possible that you can invent something like warp drive"
"""that would let you go faster  than the speed of light?"""
"And I love how specific this question is,"
"""99.9% the speed of light"" makes me think  that whoever asked the question has some sort of invention in mind  that would let us do this."
"It's far beyond what the spaceships  we can build right now, but you never know."
It's just a technology challenge.
"And the answer is really,  the world wouldn't look that different."
There is of course  what we call the Doppler Effect.
"If you're moving  in the direction of something, the light that gets to you coming from that direction is squeezed together."
"The wavelengths,  no matter how long they are, they are relatively shorter  from your point of view since you're moving toward them  as you look."
"So, all the red light you see  is what we call blueshifted."
The blue light is squeezed  to the ultraviolet and so on.
"Now 99.9% the speed of light  is a very, very fast speed so this Doppler Effect, this blueshifting, is quite severe."
You'd have to worry about the amount of radiation that you were looking at.
The things that are ordinarily ultraviolet would be X-rays to you so you better have some protection in front of you.
"And also, just because the signals that are coming from you are compressed together it looks to you like the things in front of you are moving faster  than they would otherwise."
Keep your hands off our barbecues!
"But ... once it becomes clear that all this meat is making a major contribution to the destruction of our earth, shouldn't we think again?"
"And yes, I hear some of you thinking:"
"""Here we go again, yet another vegetarian fanatic."""
But I'm certainly not the only one who is worried about this issue.
"I'm Huw McConachie, I'm farm manager of a farm with 1000 hectares of land in Mid-Wales."
"We have around 800 head of cattle, including 550 dairy cows."
We have 3000 herd of sheep and we grow some arable crops.
"You can't deny as farmers, as agriculturalists, that methane produced by cows contributes to global warming."
"I'm David Davies, I work at the Institute of Biological,"
Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University.
"Cows have a very complex digestive tract, more complex than humans."
"Within their stomach, they are able to digest plant fibre and humans cannot."
"To do that, they need a very complex mix of bacteria and fungi and protozoa within their digestive system."
"Now these micro organisms do not have access to oxygen, and the food that we eat as people gets converted into carbon dioxide and water."
"Because ruminants in the rumen don't have access to oxygen, they need to produce a different range of end products."
And one of the key ones from the rumen is methane.
"When you compare with carbon dioxide, methane is twenty-one times more potent."
"The cow eats the feed in front of it and it goes into its stomach and, as a result of that, the cow burps a lot."
"And this gas, which is produced when the animal burps, is one of the gasses linked to warming and the greenhouse gas effect."
Every cow and every ruminant regurgitates its food into the mouth to chew and this enables the micro organisms in the stomach to actually get better access to that feed.
"And whilst they are regurgitating it, they are actually releasing methane."
"So every time the cud, as it is called, comes into the mouth, a small amount of gas will also be released and this will contain a large proportion of methane."
"Well we don't notice anything about it, because it is just a natural process, which occurs in all ruminants."
The dairy cow that's producing 8.000 to 10.000 litres of milk every year will produce around 500 to 700 litres of methane every day.
So your average cow will produce around 700 litres of methane per day.
This is equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas CO2 emissions produced by a big 4x4 vehicle travelling around 35 miles per day.
The human population within the world is probably growing and it has to grow in line with the growth in population in order to feed that population.
I think that it should concern everybody.
"In 2006, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN, the FAO, published an important report, which first brought the link between livestock farming and climate change to light."
"I am now going to speak to Dr. Henning Steinfeld, the chief author of this report."
"Dr. Steinfeld, you have calculated that livestock farming is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions."
"But inevitably,  you go on, you forget."
"So this is what he wrote,"
"""The compassion came and it is simply doing nothing but to start over."
Compassion was experienced here and  practiced on the most basic form.
"Compassion for myself  and for my breath, to be sure that the more life-altering and monumental expressions of compassion to be had, perhaps this is just a seed  of a strong foundation of lasting compassion to be applied and lived in any relationship  for the world at large."
"Things, plants, animals, people,  all act and leave their mark on this world and I cannot control them."
"I need to be able to experience their movements and their contributions to the universe, with compassion just as  I practice the breath compassion."""
What a wonderful thing that this simple practice brought this deep compassion and I have witnessed this in so many of my students.
I am so grateful that I am able to do this work.
Thank you.
(R. Brady) Our next speaker will be Meena Srinivasan who is an international mindfulness educator.
She has brought it to classrooms of both middle school and upper school.
"She has quite a bit to say about how to bring mindfulness into the classroom, she has much experience doing so."
(Meena Srinivasan) Thank you Richard.
"I'd like to begin from a space of gratitude to all of my teachers, and to everyone who helped  make this conference a reality."
"And of course, gratitude to all of you, because there are so many other places  that you could be right now, especially during summer vacation,  yet you chose to be here and to spend a week sharing  in the practice of mindfulness."
"I think that this mindfulness  in education movement is really signaling a pedagogical shift, and a shift towards authenticity  and one that is infused with relationships and a shift towards the whole child that was so beautifully spoken about."
It is just a real gift to be here  and to share in that with all of you.
"Earlier on, in my career as an educator, first of all, I became a teacher like many teachers because I had this motivation  to want to serve and to want to contribute and to want to make the world  a better place in some way."
"Early on, I was at a conference and I had encountered this pretty well-known  Thai intellectual named Sulak Sivaraksa, some of you might have heard about him, He is a well-known engaged Buddhist."
I was asking him something theoretical about social emotional learning.
"He just looked at me and he said:""My dear, a good teacher must first be happy."""
I am going to quote Auden  and not the Buddha.
I had read Parker Palmer and I had read that teachers teach you who they are.
But it really wasn't until  I had encountered the Plum Village mindfulness practice that I was able to touch that peace in myself and really understood  how the teacher transmits their presence.
"A good friend of mine, once wrote that the unwritten curriculum in the classroom is the teacher's presence."
"Through the practice, I was able to get tools and ways in which I could really cultivate that happiness, that joy within myself."
"Of course, I was really eager to go back  and share with my students."
But what Thay really emphasizes is that the way in which you really share is through your way of being  and it starts there.
"And then,  you will develop that authenticity where when you are sharing mindfulness practices, they come rather naturally."
"So, I am going to share one story of transformation that happened in my classroom teaching."
"Then with time permitting, share some specific practices that I share with my students."
What is this conspiracy?
What is the truth?
There must be a fair account of it.
"It is a stultifying policy if politics is only defined by the powers-that-be, if history is interpreted with only one side of the story given."
Justice must be upheld and the dignity of citizens must be defended.
This is also the basis on which Function 8 was formed.
"Among the founders of F8, a few are ex-detainees of the 87 ""Operation Spectrum""."
"Needless to say, we too would like to close the chapter as far as the 87 incident is concerned."
"However, the one who created the problem should be the one to solve it."
"We might have been treated unfairly, but we are fully aware that we are not the only ones who have become victims of the ISA."
"There have been different magnitudes of arrest involving hundreds of people ever since the notorious ""Operation Cold Store"" in 1963."
The torture and humiliation suffered by those detainees were even more unbearable compared to those endured by us.
Many of them were kept away for decades for defending justice and defying violence unleashed on them.
But they continued to stand their ground and contribute to society in the way they see fit.
These are the citizens deserving our respect and admiration.
"The year 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of ""Operation Cold Store""."
We ought to remember those who symbolize our social conscience and those who live in exile not of their own accord.
We look forward to the day when they can come back to their homeland without any fear or recrimination.
Singapore will be for the richer in terms of vigour and wealth if that happens!
Thank you!
"Thank you very much! and most of the speakers have spoken in English and will be in English, I would like"
"Now that we've laid out the possible role for government as viewed by economists, it's worth looking at some policies that people have thought about and some of which have been tried particularly for adults when it comes to affecting behaviors that are related to obesity."
"And as a brief outline, we're going to talk about policies aimed at adults, We're going to mention policies aimed at children, and then we're going to conclude this lecture talking about some private sector initiatives that also might be influencing the behavior of individuals with respect to food choices and obesity."
So here's a list of different policies that we've thought about and that have been aimed at adults.
A change in the farm subsidy policy.
"Obviously that wouldn't be just adults, that effects everybody who consumes food in the United States."
Food stamps.
"Clearly that would also affect children because there are many families that are on food stamps, not just adults."
"Medicare, that seemed largely in older adults, things about neighborhoods,"
"That would effect children as well potentially, labeling,"
That's going to affect children as much as their behavior is shaped by what their parents choose.
"And fat tax issues again, might affect,"
A simple example of that is if we have x=x*0.
"So that can be replaced by the assignment, x=0, And again, we have, we still have a statement here."
We still have to execute a statement.
"But This statement may execute more quickly because it doesn't involve actually running the, the, the times operator."
"It doesn't involve referencing the value of X. Presumably X is registered, that doesn't really cost anything."
"But you know, it's possible that this instruction over here will execute faster than this instruction over here."
"Now, on many machines that's not the case."
"In fact, this assignment of this, this assignment on the right will take the same amount of time as the multiplication on the left, but as we will see."
"Having a assignment of a constant to a variable will actually enable other optimization, so this is still a very worthwhile transformation to do."
"An example that's almost certainly an optimization is replacing, the exponentiation operator,"
Raising a value to the power of two by an explicit multiply.
"So here, we're computing y^2, And over here, we just replace that by y*y."
Why is this a good idea?
Well this explanation operator here is almost certain not a built in machine instructions.
Probably this is gonna wind in our generated code being a call into to some built in math library.
And there will involve a functioning call overhead.
And then there will be some kind of general loop in there to do the right number of multiplies.
Depending on what the exponent is.
So in the special case where we know that the exponent is two.
"It's much, much more efficient."
"To just replace that, call to [inaudible] by an explicit multiply."
"Another example of, substituting one kind of operation for another, In a in a special situation, Is if we have, a multiplication by a power of two."
"We can replace that by a left bit shift, So here, multiplying by eight."
"That's the same as shifting the, binary representation of x over by three bits, And, I and, That will, you know, in fact compute the same thing."
And it doesn't even have to be a power of two.
"If we had a [inaudible] location by some other number that is not a power of two, that can be replaced by some combination of shifting and, and subtractions."
Okay?
"So we can replace the multiply by some combination of shifts and, and arithmetic operations, Simpler arithmetic operations."
"Now these last two here I should point out, you know, these are interesting transformations."
On modern machines generally this will not result in any kind of speed-up because on modern machines the integer multiply operation is just as fast as any other single instruction.
"Now, on historical machines these were actually significant optimizations."
"So all of these, instructions together are examples of algebraic simplifications."
ALEX FAABORG:
So I really like Fireworks.
"It has more direct manipulation of the objects, you can actually do nine slice symbols in it."
A lot of people use OmniGraffe or Keynote.
"For OmniGraffe and Fireworks, we have stencils."
We also have a Photoshop stencil for Android design.
"Really, the granularity of your mock-ups has a lot to do with how final you want people to think they are."
"So if you show someone a full-fidelity mock-up and ask their opinions, they're going to start commenting on the colors and those types of aspects."
"If you show them a wire frame, they're going to start commenting on the organization of the information, how you flow through the application."
So it's important to create the mock-up at the level of fidelity of the feedback that you want.
"Otherwise, really just sketching stuff on paper is a very quick, fast way of conveying ideas."
"Early in the process, it's about how many different designs you can come up with as opposed to creating a perfect one, so that's also important to consider."
AUDlENCE:
"A little bit taboo, but a lot of us have apps that are on multiple platforms, like iOS as well."
I just wanted to see what comments you might have on
"like where I work, there's like a-- to try to get it completely the same on both, and there's a lot of directions that designers want to go to consistency versus [INAUDlBLE] for the platforms?"
So I just kind of wanted to see what your comments are there.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
This is one that comes up quite a bit for designers in this industry.
"And the way that I think about it is, from the product to designer's point of view, what we're dealing with is all of these products across the different platforms."
"And so the first instinct is to design everything exactly the same because, and yes, it works the same across all the different platforms."
"But from the user's point of view, there are some users that have three different phone platforms in their pocket at all times, that's uncommon."
"More often, users will have one platform, and they're using all of these different parts of the platform."
"And so when they're looking for something to hang onto from a consistency standpoint, they're expecting things to work like the platform."
"So when you create an app that's consistent for you but not consistent for your user, then it's maybe not making the right choice."
"So designing for the specific platforms and designing for those conventions, it's a challenge to find a way to express your brand across all those platforms, but--"
ALEX FAABORG:
"Also, your brand should be stronger than just the Ul."
It's kind of silly if the UI is your brand.
"Your brand is about the emotional connection people have to your application, and your colors, and watermark, and things like that."
"And then also, Christian concluded his talk with showing users that you care, and also talking about how a poorly-designed icon, does that application crash more?"
"Your application, you could care a lot about it, but if it's identical to the other platforms, it kind of looks"
"The second reason we do it is to impose some structure on the course, including deadlines, to provide you with some additional motivation to work through all the topics."
Deadlines also have a very important side effect that synchronizes a lot of the students in the class.
And this of course makes the course discussion forum a far more effective tool for students to seek and provide help in understanding the course material.
"The final reason that we give homeworks is to satisfy those of you who, on top of learning the course material, are looking to challenge yourself intellectually."
[sound].
"Now, this class has tens of thousands of students."
So it's obviously essential that the assignments can be graded automatically.
"Now, we're currently only in the 1.0 generation of free online courses such as this one."
So the available tools for auto graded assessment are currently rather primitive.
"So, we'll do the best we can, but I have to be honest with you."
"It's difficult, or maybe even impossible to test deep understanding of the design and analysis of algorithms, using the current set of tools."
"Thus, while the lecture content in this online course is in no way watered down from the original Stanford version."
"The required assignments and exams we'll give you, are not as demanding as those that are given in the on campus version of the course."
"To make up for this fact, we'll occasionally propose optional algorithm design problems, either in a video or via supplementary assignment."
"We don't have the ability to grade these, but we hope that you'll find them interesting and challenging, and that you'll discuss possible solutions with other students via the course discussion forum."
So I hope this discussion answered most of the questions you have about the course.
"Lets move on to the real reason that we're all here, to learn more about algorithms."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
GAETJEN:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much for the warm welcome.
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
"My name is Steven Gaetjen, and I will be your host for today's closing keynote of the International IFA Keynote Program."
Great to have you all here.
I hope you're well and are ready to get started.
"This is a very special keynote that we have today, not only because we have one of the most important IT managers worldwide; the Chairman and CEO of Google, Dr. Eric Schmidt here as a guest on stage, but also because we will give you the chance to ask questions at the end of the keynote, an especially designed"
Q&amp;amp;A section for you.
"So, there are a couple of things that I would like you to keep in mind."
"First of all, dear photographers, welcome, great to have you here."
"We know that you want to take the best pictures as possible and we do want you to get the best pictures as possible, but please keep your activity to three to four minutes once Mr. Schmidt has entered the stage."
Thank you very much.
"Number two, just to have a smooth, nice, fun and exciting keynote and Q&amp;amp;A section, please turn off your cell phones."
"I mean, outside schools that's called collaboration, you know."
"But inside schools and this isn't because teachers want it this way, it's just because it happens that way."
It's because it's in the gene pool of education.
We have to think differently about human capacity.
"We have to get over this old conception of academic, non-academic, abstract, theoretical, vocational, and see it for what it is a myth."
"Secondly, we have to recognize that most great learning happens in groups."
That collaboration is the stuff of growth.
"If we atomize people and separate them and judge them separately, we form a kind of disjunction between them and their natural learning environment."
"And thirdly, it's crucially about the culture of our institutions, the habits of the institution, and the habitats that they occupy."
"Today, we talk about innovation and tradition."
But I am more innovation than tradition especially in a country like the
Philippines where we don't really know who we are because we are just in the process of defining ourselves.
"Three hundred years in the convent as people say and 50 years in Hollywood, we are the most confused people in the planet."
"And now, we're seeing that together with other emerging countries in the world, we're starting to define ourselves."
And I find it most interesting at this point in my life that I work more with young people than those who are my age.
"I guess my journey began when I was 35 years old, when I had my midlife crisis."
"Just like many of the people in this country, you know, we were taught to study hard, to become successful, get rich and give to charity."
And I realize that I did all that.
"But at 35, I discovered that you can achieve your ambition but doesn't necessarily make you a happy person."
"And oftentimes, when we are just ambition-driven, we get something that we realize later on is an empty bag."
"And so, at 35, I had a wife, I had three children but I was not happy because I realize that the more that I was driven by a desire for personal success, I was living in a country where there was deepening poverty and there was growing corruption."
"And I also realize that the tradition drives us - development is driven by charity when we need to realize that as a Christian country, we have to also talk about Christian stewardship."
"And, and so, three things that was very clear to me - that I needed to address."
"One was that we had become a mendicant society, we were migratory and we were also mercenary."
"And I often wondered, people talk about sustainable development but what I saw was sustainable poverty."
"And I tried to understand our situation, the Five S's of sustainable poverty that the Filipino was living as a squatter."
"And a squatter does not have any dignity, does not have any security."
And a country of squatters cannot be globally competitive.
So the second thing was that the Filipino had lowered their standards.
"In his subhuman conditions, he was living in a shanty, that's the second S. And so, he could not come up with the best quality products because he himself is born and raised in a shanty, in a pile of garbage."
"And the third, he is raised in a village called a slum."
It takes a village to raise a child.
"That was one group, then we had this very large engineering group building the Netscape navigator product."
"And in there Chofmann was there,"
"Johnny was there,"
"Jonas was there,"
Dbaron was there...
Dbaron came actually a little later.
But there is a bunch of people here in that engineering group.
That went on for a little while and it turned out to be not stable.
It turned out that the efforts of the Netscape management group to build the product to make money for them came into conflict with how we wanted to manage the code base as a Mozilla open source project.
That conflict simmered for a while and eventually it exploded.
"Yes, please feel free to ask questions at any point."
[Question]
"No, it turned out there are lots of ways to build a browser that makes money that people don't like."
"So in those days, Netscape had been acquired by AOL and AOL was a website property."
"So to that management team, the browser was a tool to drive people to the AOL website."
"You can do that, but it doesn't mean you like the product."
"You can add user interface features to it, you can focus on new buttons and menu items that in those cases were AOL specific, you can put your resources there rather than on security and new features, you might not be interested in features that help people find things across the web, because AOL wanted them going to AOL."
"So we found that there were immense conflicts and also, in an open source project, you have contributors who have an ""ownership stake"", meaning that they put effort in, they are building a product, if they are using the product they have a set of needs that might be different."
"As part of the open source project we were balancing the needs of our employers, Netscape, with various other people."
"And eventually,"
that broke down.
"So for example, we'll take user interface which is always a contentious issue in a product."
"The single most contentious issue, way back in 1999 and 2000, was user interface, because Netscape would want a user interface that drove people to AOL and Mozilla wanted an interface that was good for people using the Web."
I was the General Manager of the small group of people building Mozilla as an open source project.
In those days we called ourselves staff@mozilla.org or mozilla.org staff.
"When the tension exploded over the interface, over really who controlled the code, we had long fights about what would the basic process is by which we build the product."
"So things we take for granted today,"
"like you have to earn the right to be a committer, we fought with Netscape over that."
"Things like code needs code review, it has to be good enough; that being hired as an employee doesn't automatically make your code good enough; that even after you are hired as an employee your peers need to decide your code is good enough."
So basic things like code review were immense fights.
"I was the representative of Mozilla and when those tensions came to a head,"
I was fired.
Jenny Macintyre.
Shayne Currie was on the list.
Is Shayne here?
From the Sunday Herald?
"Given the events of the weekend, which have involved the news media in some difficult legal decision-making, today's forum is pretty timely."
"In the case I'm referring to so obliquely, questions arise over coverage of failed suicide bids, presumably not covered by the Coroners Act: reporting the activities of celebrities; contempt of court, given that the person involved in this faces an impending trial; and a relatively new legal remedy that he and his family may have available to them, the tort of privacy."
"This was only recognised by the Court of Appeal of 2003 in the Mike Hosking versus New Idea case, when Mike tried to stop pictures of his kids appearing in the magazine."
"He failed, but the judges recognised that the tort of privacy, which is..."
"A tort is... gives you the legal right, one Person A, to sue Person B for damages, and it's undeveloped in New Zealand, so I'm not sure whether it applies in this case or not, but it might do, so it'll be interesting to see whether Sunday News cops it, or not."
"Read my blog, there's more on it."
"Okay, if you turned up today in the hope of hearing something relatively rare in this country, a journalist breaking ranks and dissing his own profession,"
"I use the word ""profession"" in quotes, and those who purport to be its guardians and spokespeople, then I'll probably disappoint you."
You've read the synopsis of what I was going to say.
"Due to the demands of the printer, that was written before I'd written this paper, or done any research, or had a chance to position my thinking."
I'm not an expert in this area.
"What was expressed in the preview came from something that happened once a year in my hometown, New Plymouth, when I taught journalism there for five years."
We had a thing called Death Week.
It was an idea borrowed from the Australians.
"I went to a conference there, and I thought I heard a journalism educator mention Death Week."
"In fact, it was only Death Day, but we..."
"I found in our course there were so many times when we were dealing with the coverage of trauma, homicides, and road crashes, and ghastly things, so we aggregated that into a Week."
"And one of our best speakers was the local coroner, someone who's long since disappeared under the new system."
"He was a bit of a renegade, this guy, and he was a very straight talker, and he ran to his own rules, basically, and they were not legally correct, but he didn't care."
"And he said if the local paper, who complained all the time, wanted to do anything about it, they could go to the Judiciary, but he knew damn well they wouldn't, because it would be too expensive, and they didn't."
"But what he said, the phrase that resonates still with me, is:"
"""Suicide is nobody else's business""."
"And his rule was, even though the law said that he should allow the name and the fact that the death was self-inflicted to be published, he said no."
"And he might make an exception if it was a local celebrity, but that was a big ""might""."
The 2006 Act has tidied all this up.
"We now have professional, or full-time, coroners, and I presume now they're all kept in line by the Chief Coroner."
"But in those days, the coroners were a law unto themselves."
You got a great variation around the country.
"So, we need to be aware that our perception can be magnified, improved"
"If, indeed, we work most of the time our higher (superior) chakras."
This is a good idea.
"We will continue to talk about energy because energy is the basis for everything, but this energy that will be used in laying-on of hands, we need to have some understandings which I mentioned before and I will tell again."
Imagine that you are very upset and nervous.
"It's not a good idea to perform laying-on of hands, because the energy that you will exteriorize to this person has a bad pattern."
"Imagine that you are happy, you are in a good mood."
The energy that you will exteriorize is much better.
"So, just to exemplify for us."
But other things affect our energies.
"If you, for example, drink any alcohol, for sure the energies you will exteriorize will be ethylical energies."
"If you smoke a lot, look the energy you will discharge to others!"
"That is why we have to purify our body, not only from physical things, chemical, but also of our dysfunctional emotional processes to be in a state of stability in which we can, certainly... exteriorize very organized energies to other people."
"If you, for example, eat a very heavy food, during the energy exteriorization you'll be working at full speed in the splenic chakra, your energy will be much more emotional."
"You may ask me, ""Oh, but is not it good?"""
"Look, if we have much knowledge, any energy is good, but if we don't, is better understand some rules like this: dense energies are heavier, are more concentrated and don't move around so well and the higher energies are much more subtle, lighter and move around very well."
"So, we should always try to achieve subtlest energies through our thoughts."
That's why that idea of praying before the laying-on of hands maybe can help to stabilize the energies a little.
"I think that, if you want to exteriorize the best energies, you have a grateful heart."
"The grateful heart be able to look at yourself and recognize everything you have, everything you receive, all the things that are around you, all that you can create and build to make a better world."
Thank for this every moment.
"Thank all the supporters, all the energies, all the forces that exist, because you will be able to do a great job."
"Gratitude has a great advantage, it opens all the chakras, the energies circulate much more and the spiritual supporters will be able to perceive that this is the moment they can help you do the best assistencial work."
You have your heart open to it.
"So let's work, let's learn more about energy."
"I'll talk again about it, I'll also talk about chakras, we're going to talk a lot about chakras, let's talk about the environments, this way the learning path for laying-on hands will be worthwhile."
"Then, we meet again soon."
terraner rebels approching a noob planet
back in line dumbass
whaaaaa.......are we ready for a invasion
"YES SlR! we will raid there planet, we will demolish there fleets"
READY SlR!
Man has forgotten to love the world and all it contains and curiously is striving to understand it all.
"The countless henchmen who call themselves philosophers today, have never met sophia."
They are sealed around their own circles and do not know what wisdom is but who must solve the crisis if not the philosophers?
Who must innovate if not the philosophers?
"However, thats how I look at it!"
"But then again I was amongst those who introduced Pythagoras for Sophia, back then so I may be a little biased.."
"Let us instead ask our expert of today, Ole Fogh Kirkeby philosophy, master's in human and professor of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
"What do you say Ole, I'm biased or we have a crisis in philosophy?"
Ole:
"No, you are 100% right when you say we have a crisis in philosophy. but it is also a science crisis but funny that you should talk about ""the wisdom"", of it's become a fashionable word, a New Age phenomenon but it is very interesting because if you go back and look at one of socretas contemporary philosopher named Antístenes."
"He was a cynic and lived very old-fashioned, very poor, very simple"
He was asked what wisdom was and replied that it was about being as good as possible to unlearn everything you have learned.
Martin:
It is quite Taoist..
Ole:
"It is quite Taoist, yes and I have through out the summer been reading Chinese philosophy which puts you in a bad mood because this is where Greek philosophers got it from but trade routes were as such back then."
They had a different way of thinking..
Martin:
So it was not just spices and gold it was also philosophy from east to west?
Ole:
"It is quite clear there has been a huge exchange and if you start to think about life, you will reach to some of the same thoughts except of course that the Greek community is a fabulous community because it invents democracy and is so dynamic."
That you will not find in the Chinese feudal society.
Martin:
"No, China in the thirteen century, somehow turned the key as they burned their fleet and dissolved their academies and it is also true Islam, and at the time it was thought that ""now we know enough"" and that's about where we are now.. somehow people keep studying but they keep running around the same circles and what should be the recognition process where you say ""How do we improve the way of life"" is somehow removed, is not it?"
Ole:
"I 100% agree and therefore when I give lectures which I do a lot about a phenomenon that I've taken up from the Greeks, and then developed myself called Probtrektik, which means to turn its essence to essence in your life, to strengthen a person to think about why it lives and what it wants with his life."
"When I give presentations on ""Probtrektik"""
"I always start by saying that I follow the philosopher named Epicurus who was famous for letting the desire be in the right center but the good thing Epicurus said, was that ""the philosophy which does not relieve any suffering is false"" and I like it because suddenly you get philosophy ""into life"""
Martin:
Let's just highlight this ..
The philosophy which does not... so that means that philosophy is a human healing project?
Ole:
And that's everywhere.
"It's not just the fish, though, that are disappearing."
"Industrial fishing uses big stuff, big machinery."
We use nets that are 20 miles long.
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks.
"And we trawl, which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds, put it on a big chain, and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish."
"Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest, because it clears it away."
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable.
"This is a photograph, a typical photograph, of what the continental shelves of the world look like."
"You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn."
"What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral, which is a critical habitat for the development of fish."
"What it is now is mud, and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud, to parking lot, is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity."
We've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years.
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days.
"And all of that stuff is really disgusting, but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems."
And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution: one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients.
So this is the infamous
"Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae."
A book was written about it.
It's a bit of an embarrassment.
"It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco, it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria."
"It's very pretty, and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean."
I don't know how many of you remember the movie
"""The Little Shop of Horrors,"" but this is the plant of ""The Little Shop of Horrors."""
"But, instead of devouring the people in the shop, what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern"
Mediterranean Sea.
"We don't know anything that eats it, we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done, but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell, about which nobody knows what to do."
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients.
"The green revolution, all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it."
"It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it."
"It runs down the rivers, and it feeds the plankton, the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water."
"But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton, there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it, so it dies of old age, which is unheard of for plankton."
The project that we are working on right now is the tree house project and it is all about actively challenging neighborhood cooperative methods in city districts.
We are developing in a park under plan together with school kids and students a temporary intervention of a tree house made out of recycled material that would be built on the tree.
Our aim is the installation of a permanent prototype typology of tree houses developed by kids.
"We are a team of architects, urban planners, and urban designers working together with local experts who are around 10 to 12 years old."
Tomorrow we start testing stretched firefighting hoses to find out what are the limits of this material and what can we do out of it
Are you thinking of creating something like a hammock that would be hung simply between the trees... an oversized hammock ...?
"You should also imagine that in our first trial it would be this oversized hammock, but later we would create vertical layers of it, that would be connected horizontally to each other... this is what we hope we can achieve this week."
In our master program we also have the chance to develop new forms of how can urban designers from the bottom - with the inhabitants - develop a part of the city.
Right now we are working on a project in Munzviertel where we are trying out having an office as an automobile caravan as our platform where we and the inhabitants develop new ideas for the place.
Hello...
My name is Lene.
I studied sociology and political science and what really interested me in Urban Design and was for me very exciting is the way we work.
We work mainly as teams in projects and we present our projects with an open-source way of thinking - hung on the wall.
Every so often we get heavily criticized however the way we work functions really good because there is no competition between us but rather a cooperative way of learning.
This establishes overall a very stimulating work setting.
This is of course compulsory!!!
The big isometrics!!
From the outside!!
With all those small details and the drawings... and what is essential is how all of this is collected and composed...
It is all together remarkable!!!
My name Juan Camilo.
I come from Columbia.
I studied there Architecture.
I came here to Hamburg to study Urban Design in HCU.
I find it extremely interesting here although I...
I didn't really have a complete picture about the program before.
I find urban design as a kind of network where the professors and the students are the main the players in it... there is no strong hierarchy but we are more like forming a cooperative research field.
I find it really effective that we can have here in UD-HCU this chance to interact with the different professors and students because through that we are able to strengthen and deepen our own interests
All those key points... we have to express in some kind of form... and bring it in the right structure to present them in an A4 format that says this is our field of studies... or this is the complexity of our theme.
"And we need one A4 page that says ""we are here""."
It would be best when we can get all those points in a plausible sequence.
So.
"We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past."""
"And we published a paper in Science, the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane."
"And we predicted what would happen, and we got it all wrong."
"And the reason was because of overfishing, and the fact that a last common grazer, a sea urchin, died."
"And within a few months after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow."
And that is the same reef; that's the same reef 15 years ago; that's the same reef today.
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime.
"And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean, and increasingly, tragically, the coral reefs worldwide."
"Now, that's my little, depressing story."
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories.
"There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse."
"And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe,"
"like a hurricane, it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery, but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that."
And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things.
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod.
"It's difficult to imagine that two, or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod."
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
"It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles, the song ""Jamaica Farewell"" --"
"""Ackee rice salt fish are nice"" -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada."
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
"35,000 people lost their jobs."
"And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species, from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world, and what have you."
"It's a little hard to understand that, because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish."
"You ought to read the label to find out where it came from, but it's still cheap, and everybody thinks it's okay."
"It's hard to communicate this, and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish, because people like to go out and catch fish."
It's one of those things.
"This picture here shows the trophy fish, the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat, go to a place off of Key West in Florida, drink a lot of beer, throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water, come back with the biggest and the best fish, and the champion trophy fish are put on this board, where people take a picture, and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish."
"Well, that's what it's like now, but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock."
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
"And the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper, and if you wanted to go out and kill something, you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish."
And they tasted really good.
"And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little, tiny fish."
So you have to cut through the fog.
And this particular publication does a good job of describing how you might do that.
So here are.
"The NlST guidelines and then mapping them to an event that we held here couple of years ago to gain the attention of business and computing and community leaders in the city of Seattle, that really did not know or were aware of cyber-security issues."
"The message that we wanted to get across was the alarming vulnerability of public and private information on networks, if they are compromised."
The outcomes we wanted is to gain attention and to influence legislation.
In fact.
The Attorney General who was brand new to his position at that time.
Actually was enthused about this event and afterwards did quite a bit to make.
Cyber crime.
A factor in his agenda as attorney general.
And he was successful in passing some legislation that was landmark.
"For example, a cyber stalking statute, the first in the country."
As a result of some problems that the city of Seattle had experienced.
"And then you want to make sure that the, there is an awareness of roles and responsibilities."
So at the event summation after we had the training we focused on who is going to do what and what peoples' relative responsibilities were for identity theft.
Largely the care and feeding about own information that's out there on networks and various systems ends up being our responsibility.
Once we turn it over to a third party.
It's their's.
"And there are many agreements you, you might want to look at the service level agreement for Facebook for example, that discusses how your personal information will be managed."
"And so when you give your information to a third party, just assume you've lost control."
"So, as far as security's awareness training is concerned, it's a process of educating people."
"You want to wake them up to the risks and vulnerabilities they face, you want to talk about the tools that can minimize those risks, and you want them to understand that the company has a mechanism in place to keep people's knowledge current."
"So, those are the kinds of things you want to get across."
"So, let's look at this Google hacking event, it was an interesting training experience."
Here's the problem.
"We'll, we recognize as a community at cyber-security experts, when I say we, we have a group that meets on quarterly basis that stays current on trends in cyber-security threats and the vulnerabilities that they attack."
"And so, we are aware that there is a growing problem in the community around identity theft We knew that one in twenty"
Americans suffer from identity theft as victims every year.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are impacted in the economy.
"Most institutions will cover this as a part of doing business, although that is beginning to change."
"So consumers are coping with covering charges if they're not covered by an insurance policy of a certain amount, which can be significant."
What are the new ideas around advertisers?
And we have a lot of that coming.
"When we finally get through all of the fear and the sort of concern that advertisers have about the world around them, I can tell you that they understand the notion of a guaranteed sale."
"They understand that if they put money into on line advertising that's measurable, they understand that we can prove to them they'll get their sale."
"And, by the way, in this economy, you need sales. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"You did an exchange program with P&amp;amp;G in the, call it October, November, time frame of last year, where you said these guys--these are my words--"
P&amp;amp;G doesn't get what we're doing.
Maybe we don't fully understand their wants and needs.
Let's do a pen-pal employee slot.
What were some of the learnings from that?
How important was it?
"And have you been able to translate it into anything either with P&amp;amp;G, or with other large advertisers that spend 95% of their budgets off line?"
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
The larger--in a case that consumer packs his goods--people are trying to figure out how to use the Internet to achieve their objectives.
"Many of the organizations don't fundamentally understand, at some level, how to use the emergent on line communities to market within those communities."
"So the project that we did with P&amp;amp;G was really about getting--and we literally put people in their buildings and they put people in ours--was to exchange, sort of, how to do that, because they're one of the innovators in that space."
"So based on that, we changed the way we market to, sort of, consumer goods companies, by talking to them not so much on traditional text queries, which we'd been saying, you know, if somebody types in ""diapers,"" you should advertise against that because everybody sort of understands that."
"But how you can use targeted on line advertising within the communities-- the blogging communities, Facebook, and those sorts of groups-- that fundamentally are where your customers are getting information."
"The fact of the matter is that these days, if you're a consumer, the sophisticated consumers spend a lot of time on line before they make a purchase."
"And even if they make--they don't that in the first purchase-- once they have the product and once they're using it, they tend to join affinity groups that are part of that product."
Diapers being an obvious example as a metaphor for new mothers who are interested in learning about new products and new ways in which they can take care of their new family. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"But have you been--anything--has P&amp;amp;G--I don't want to pigeonhole P&amp;amp;G-- you got insights, but have you seen any translation yet?"
Are you doing the employee swap with other companies as well? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We're going to.
We're doing it carefully because you have to be careful about intellectual property.
And I don't want to talk about the specifics.
That's their data.
But we like that model.
"One of the ways that you can sort of effect change is, sort of, direct contact."
Literally put the people together.
And that's new for us. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
So if we look at the average company and the average consumer-- spending has been slowing down for a yet.
"And now you learn, you know that people are people, and you learn how to deal with every different person there is in every situation."
"And those situations, they need to be used to help benefit, not only my child and my daughter, but they need to be used to benefit all disabilities, all disabilities."
And everything that I can do and everything
"I've learned is important so that I keep my anger out of it, that it's not about the people it's about situations that we need to resolve and how we can go about doing those things, and, there again, the more knowledge you have the more power you have, which ultimately can make a change, and that's what it's about."

Welcome to the world of money.
"Bread, cash, dosh, dough,"
"loot, lucre, moolah, the readies, the wherewithal."
"Call it what you like; money can break us, or it can make us"
"In the past year, it's certainly broken more than a few of the biggest names on Wall Street and in the City of London."
"And while former masters of the universe crash and burn, the rest of us are left worrying if our savings would be safer in a mattress than in a bank."
The great financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 has most of us utterly baffled.
"How on earth could a little local difficulty with subprime mortgages in the United States unleash an economic tsunami big enough to obliterate some of Wall Street's most illustrious names, to force nationalizations of banks on both sides of the Atlantic, and to bring the entire world economy to the brink of recession, if not downright depression?"
"Shouldn't this series be called, ""The Descent of Money""?"
Well I want to explain to you just how money rose to play such a terrifyingly dominant role in all our lives.
"What's more, I want to reveal financial history as the essential back story of all history."
"Banks financed the Renaissance, while the bond market decided wars."
Stock markets built empires.
And monetary meltdowns made revolutions.
"From Ancient Mesopotamia right down to present-day London, the ascent of money has been an indispensable part of the ascent of man."
But money's rise has never been a smooth upward ride.
"As we'll see, financial history has been repeatedly interrupted by gut-wrenching crises, of which today's is just the latest."
"From the fluctuating prices of the homes we own to the high-speed industrialization of China, the power of finances everywhere we look and it affects all of our lives."
But are you in on the secret?
"Do you know what causes a bank run or a monetary meltdown, or a stock market crash?"
Can you tell the difference between a subprime loan and a prime loan?
Well I think these financial technicalities only really make sense once you know where they came from.
And that's why financial history is more than merely academic interest.
Not knowing this stuff can seriously damage your wealth.
"Crisis or no crisis, the amount of money sloshing around planet finance still boggles the mind."
The quantum principle that creates many versions of each person... can also create entire universes.
"The universe, at one point, was actually smaller than an electron."
If that's true and if electrons are described... by being many places at the same time in parallel states... this means that the universe also exists in parallel states.
You inevitably get parallel universes.
There's no choice.
But that's not all.
Scientists recently have shocked the world again... and claimed that there could be one more kind of parallel universe.
These level-four type are created... either by quantum fluctuations or by branes clashing.
What is created is radically different.
"In this type of parallel universe, all the rules are out the window."
"It could be, in fact... that the mathematics and physics describing reality... differs from what we're used to in our universe."
If the laws of physics are different in a level-four parallel universe... space could just consist of gas and particles.
"Galaxies, stars, and planets would not have formed... and life as we know it would not exist."
To show that any type of parallel universe...
"level one, two, three or four, truly exists... experts must find the evidence."
"Be they big, tiny or invisible... scientists must find physical indications... of the extra dimensions... that supposedly connect us to these other worlds."
"To do it, today physicists at Fermilab in illinois... are conducting extraordinary experiments... hoping to prove that any kind... even the wildest type of parallel universe, is really out there."
"For the first time ever, real and remarkable experiments... are taking place at particle colliders like the Tevatron at Fermilab."
"Right now, this detector is looking for evidence... of extra dimensions."
If there are extra dimensions of a certain size and shape... this experiment will find them.
Their best chance of exposing extra dimensions... comes from smashing microscopic particles together... at super speeds.
The smoking gun in the hunt is gravity.
It has been found to be a uniquely weak force... so the Fermilab physicists are looking for the particle that carries gravity.
It is called a graviton.
It's the particle that carries gravity... which we think knows about all of the extra dimensions of space.
So we think the gravitons... if you can produce them in high energies... should actually move off into the extra dimensions.
"But finding a graviton, or at least a sign of one... is a huge challenge."
It's tricky and complicated because you're looking for nothing.
You're looking for something that has disappeared.
What's the rate now?
"It's very, very rare that you make a really exotic particle."
So we literally have to collide them billions of times... in order to find the very rare event... where you make something like a particle... that disappears into extra dimensions.
It's not very busy here.
"You realize they've gotten so much bad press for not having food that they want to show, oh there's plenty of food!"
Food everywhere!
And they're carefully laying out the food the whole time you're eating.
"As you're leaving you notice, they're pulling all the things they've just carefully laid into little tiny trays they're going to carefully bring back and keep for the next day."
"And you're just sitting there by yourself eating your matter going,"
"""Okay, I've come to Crazyland!"""
"Now that we have the model of experienced utility, we can model the behavior of the consumer as a utility maximization problem."
One thing that you should keep aware is that this is a model of a rational consumer.
"And the consumer is rational in the sense that he knows each experience utility function and is going to act, either explicitly by thinking about it or implicitly somehow, his psychological processes will guide him to choose the action that maximizes his well-being, his experienced utility, okay?"
"Now, this consumer faces the following constraints, or has the following characteristics."
"Has an extenal amount, W, which we are going to denote or call wealth, of this composite good m."
And is allowed to buy any non-negative amount of good x at a fixed price p.
"Notice that there is an assumption here that is often called a price taking hypothesis, which is that the consumer has no control over the price."
He can only control how much it can consume.
"And the consumer can choose how much x it wants, or how much m it wants."
"But notice that, how much m it wants is just given by his total wealth minus the cost of buying the level of x that it wants."
"So in reality, we can make this a problem over a single maximization."
Sorry.
We can make this a problem over a single control variable as we saw repeatedly in the previous unit.
"By the quasilinearity assumption on the form of the experience utility function, this problem is just a equivalent to maximizing over x negative the benefit function, plus the total amount consumable m of, of, the composite good, which is just W - xp."
"Now, that's just replacing the functional form of the utility function."
"But we also see that we can drop the constant from any maximization problem since it affects the total value of the experience utility subject gets, but it doesn't effect the optimal choice of x."
"So, this is equivalent to maximizing wver x greater than zero, B(x) - xp."
"Where B(x) is the benefit from consuming x units of good x, and this is the cost of buying them."
"So I hope that you see that the utility maximization problem under the assumptions that we have created has this familiar structure of a benefit minus a cost, okay?"
"Now, one piece of notation."
"We are going to denote the solution to the problem, the optimal choice, as a function of the price as x star of p."
That is equal the optimal choice as a function of p or for p given p.
But that's also going to recall the demand for good x at p.
"Now, as"
"I mentioned before, the consumer in reality has to choose how much x and how much m he's going to consume."
And to do that we cannot afford not to pay attention to agriculture.
"If we just want to achieve a fairly conservative objective in this sector, which is to stop this sector adding more by the middle of the century, then we have to take quite radical steps."
"Because the natural dynamic is that as populations get richer, they almost universally consume more animal products."
"In the global context at the moment, this argument really in a way focuses on China, because China is the biggest increaser in meat consumption."
Its doubling every 10 years.
The population of pigs and chickens in China is doubling every 10 years.
"These are mono-gastric animals, they don't create a greenhouse gas problem in terms of methane release, but they do create environmental problems because they have to be fed."
"And the feedstuffs have to come from global sources, and they come from soy bean production in Brazil, which comes from deforestation and so on."
"If the rich countries keep on consuming at their high level, and countries like"
"China come up to our high level, then the situation will be much worse and that will make it very much more difficult to achieve global warming targets overall."
"So its rather strange that most governments only focus on quick fixes, like taxes on gas guzzlers."
Certainly when you realise that research shows that in a year a cow in the Netherlands will produce just as many greenhouse gas emissions as a car that drives 70.000 kilometres.
70.000 kilometres!
This means driving around the globe more than one and a half times.
"In a medium-sized car, I should add."
The image we get to see of global warming is always so one-sided.
We only get to see factory chimneys and traffic jams.
Where are the public information campaigns about the relationship between carbon emissions and eating meat?
I certainly haven't seen them yet in the Netherlands.
Despite the fact that we slaughter five hundred million animals here each year.
"Animals, however, discover exactly what factory farming is, very early on in their lives."
"Piglets, for example, are castrated without anaesthetics."
Their tails are docked.
They are forced to live in dark concrete stalls and usually only see daylight when they are taken to slaughter.
"It's not much different for other factory farmed animals: take laying hens, for example."
They are crammed into battery cages and their beaks are trimmed to stop them from pecking one another.
"Since 2006, I have represented the Party for the Animals in the Dutch parliament and I strive to put an end to these kind of practices."
But my work doesn't just stop at animal welfare.
It's only recently that the Dutch Environmental Agency has sounded the alarm at the speed at which we're exhausting the Earth and its resources.
The Netherlands uses four times its own surface-area to produce what we consume.
"Think of it like a buffet: we are heaping up our plates with enough food to feed four people, which means that there will not be enough left for those at the back of the queue."
"One billion people on our planet suffer from obesity, while elsewhere one billion people go to bed hungry."
"If the scientists find anything that  the Buddhists are incorrect round around the 2600 years old tradition in Buddhism, Buddhism will change."
"So far, science has changed  and it changes so rapidly because of how Buddhism is leading us  through the science with the understanding of what  has just been the meditation tradition."
"So, is that an answer to your question?"
"(Man) What I am more interested in  is shifting the focus a little bit from happiness and suffering to the cause is that we don't see reality clearly, that is what creates the suffering."
(R. Brady) I see that is an important question and we have heard it.
Others may want to be thinking about it  and talking with you about it.
But let us hear some more questions.
(Woman in the audience) I just wondered if anyone could talk about on line learning and bringing mindfulness into that.
"I know that is on the rise,  I am an on line teacher, and I just wondered how to be mindful on line."
(T. Koffler) Thank you for that question.
"It seems like keeping up with technology is also a very important way to spread any body of work, including mindfulness."
"We just recently, because of the many people around the world that were asking for our programs, as well as to learn mindfulness, addressed that through an on line training program."
"And we had a lot of resistance  from our faculty and quite a bit of discussion around,  'is that possible?'."
"Because truthfully, we all know,  mindfulness should be something that we want to share and learn  as a body of work between human beings."
Either I develop community and so on  and so forth and develop the practice.
"From my short experience of teaching our first ever online training, which was 5 weeks for an hour and half each session, we discovered that it was something we could do as long as the participants were committed to developing their own practice at home."
"So, we are continuing on the way and  we are also know that many organizations,"
"Dan Siegel for one,  Mindful Schools for another, many organizations outside of Mindfulness Without Borders are teaching their learning  and offerings on line."
"So, I think it is something to expect and  certainly still in development, a work in progress."
(R. Brady) Thank you.
"(Man in the audience) Thank you very much to the panel, to each of you for insightful discussion."
"I think, in listening it refers to me that one of the biggest problems teachers face is, with increasing class sizes, will be the ability to give direct  one-on-one attention to the students."
"When you are standing in front of a class with 30, 40, sometimes even 50 students, it becomes a temporal impossibility  to give the attention that in my experience was always very formative, to have a teacher that really is there and even sees you and is working directly with you."
"Last year, I worked with a non-profit organization that makes it demanded to find spaces for teachers and educators to make that 1-on-1 relationship possible and teaching and learning institutes can have it in schools."
"So, when I heard Jack and Meena speak about teachers developing their presence for the classroom, as well as John Bell at the end speaking of how a lot of people who leave the school system feel like it was because they were not cared about in it,"
I wonder what can teachers do to really develop that presence for the students in the classroom.
Of course that is for everyone.
(J. Miller) I think one thing is that  we can use a variety of groupings.
We can use small groups and moving  from large group to small group.
It is going to be difficult  to do a individual when you have 35.
"Again, I am a believer in the circle."
"If you can set the class up as a circle,  and I have class up to 35, when it gets over 35, it becomes a problem."
And even
local community action agencies are looking into their work.
"They do a community needs assessment to determine what within the social strata, what within the entrepreneurial makeup and philanthropic community, what is missing in my community that would make a person's success from poverty to self- sufficiency, what is lacking."
So each if the programs within the CSBG dollars take on a different aspect of poverty.
Some are dealing with child care.
Some are dealing with education.
"Some are dealing with training, depending on what's already in the community."
And so it doesn't make it easy to use a wide brush or barometer to measure that success.
"We know the IS report that so many of you so dutifully prepared and worked on in your local agencies and also the state comes to us, we compiled that data as best we can along the 6 national goals to determine the success of this program."
"The problem of that is since some programs are so different and some of the measures aren't quite the same from one region to another, it's hard to get a true scientific look at those numbers and projections which is what a group"
like urban institute would do.
It may require some stream lining of CSBG.
In some instances we are measuring the same item in order to get a true national sense of where the program is.
Locally and state-by-state we can show you successful agencies and successful programs.
"We can show you successful states, but it's not always easy to do on a national sense because of the way these things are recorded and judged."
"Mark, you may want to add something to that, but I think that is a problem for"
CSBG.
"The strength of CSBG is also now, 50 years later, probably the weakness of CSBG because of the modern conveniences, technology, and the way things are measured now, things are recorded and things are judged."
CSBG is not conducive to that with such a myriad of programs from one state to another.
Mark:
Thanks Arley.
The one thing I wanted to add to that is as you read through the President's budget request and you look at our current ROMA and MPI systems you can see how it's a system that's set up to measure performance.
It is not a system around performance based programing and performance based funding.
I think that's a distinct difference between what they're looking to do with CSBG and what we currently have.
This is just in the request.
"This is not something we're pushing for, but this is something that they're looking for."
It's how they can make the programing and the funding performance based.
"They recognize the performance measurement system that we have, and they understand it."
"They just think it's not quite what they need, or what they wanted to see for the CSBG."
"And I understand too that to do that you're looking at drastic changes to the program, to the way fund are distributed, to the way formulas are run, really a major reform."
Brad:
Let me ask one additional question here on CSBG and then we're going to talk to Bob Scott just a concluding comment on weatherization.
"If you love your work, you will never work."
"After long hard years of work and study, you've made it!"
This is your day of triumph; this is your day of joy.
All of us join in your celebration today.
You graduate into a world of accelerating change.
Do not fear this world.
You are unusually well prepared for it.
You possess unusually refined senses of self reliance and creativity.
That is the Rochester way.
"Go forth with confidence and pride in your accomplishment, knowing that your faculty and all who have had a role nourishing your intellectual growth here are immensely proud of you."
Meliora.
"To my fellow members of the class of 2012, thank you."
It has been an honor being a peer amongst you all as we learned and grew together over the past four years.
"While we've all taken different paths to get to today's ceremony, it's also true that we have had many experiences together that unite our class."
"Remember the experiences we have had together: the painted tunnels, your freshmen hall, your sports victories... for these are our roots."
"But also feel empowered to move your life to the next level, for this is not the end and simply just the beginning."
I grew up in a different time and context where freedom was limited and gender roles were greatly constrained.
"Indeed, my childhood was dominated by a lack of options, in a culture that made clear everyday that I was to be forever constrained by race, gender, and poverty."
I was told that I could not not aspire to a profession.
"That I was not deserving of excellence in education, but few who espouse such views understood that a movement was taking hold that would change this reality."
"For example, women today increasingly hold positions of prominence, choice, and parity."
And that progress and that progress while not complete is still improving.
The gender balance in this graduating is proof that women rock.
"So today graduates, you have an immense and welcome burden of choice that many, in previous eras, lacked."
"I exhort you to live up to the community principle so clearly articulated in this university's mission statement if your education has served you well, you will not shed its principles when you toss your hats into the air and return your academic robes."
Your education places a heavy burden upon you to use your knowledge to benefit society.
"May you live with joyful discovery, challenging dilemmas, and uplifting choices that build your confidence in the blessings in life, liberty, and human dignity."
May your highest aspiration be to live consonant with the sacred trust you hold as an educated person to defend and advance the common good.
"Congratulations to you all, and god speed."

"And since we can spend as much money as we want, the composite good m can go negative as much as necessary that is feasible."
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"Now, two additional things about the nature of the solution to the utility maximization problem."
"First is that, for most utility functions that are used to model economic behavior, this case doesn't apply."
"And it doesn't apply because they tend to satisfy the crossing condition property or, or something that you know is a crossing condition, which is that B prime of infinity is equal to zero."
"In other words, this marginal benefit keeps going down, down , down to zero for x sufficiently"
large.
"So, in most examples that we're going to do and in most applications of this models in economic analysis, this case is not interesting and we're not going to basically look at it again."
The other thing that I wanted to bring out which is extremely important is to highlight the economic intuition for the solution to the utility maximization problem.
"And, of course, it's going to parallel the math that we saw in unit one."
But there is something extra about the current situation that is worth thinking.
"So, think about what is going on."
"You start at zero, okay?"
And you can ask a way of solving the optimal choice problem for x is to start at zero and decide where to stop.
Okay.
"So you can start at zero, and say, should I take the first unit?"
"Well, if I do that, that increases my utility by the marginal utility of x at zero, which is this much, B prime of zero."
And it only costs me p dollars.
"That decreases my consumption of the composite good by p, so my net increase in utility is by this."
"So, when B prime of zero is greater than p, I should do it."
"In this particular case, I should not do it because the loss in the composite good is more than the gain in utility."
"And clearly, I should keep doing that."
"I should keep increasing x as long as the marginal utility of increasing x exceeds the marginal cost, which is the loss of consumption on m at the margin."
"So, I should keep going all the way to this."
"It's only at the point with the marginal benefit or the marginal utility of x is equal to the marginal cost that it generates, the loss and consumption of x, that you should not take the extra step of x."
"In this particular case, since the extra cost of x, of consuming x, keeps getting larger and larger by the decrease on B prime, just stop at zero and you never go further."
"So, the marginal benefit function is very important because it really measures the value of this additional unit."
"And the reason, the, the, the, it really measures the value in terms of utility of consuming an add itional unit of x."
"And p is very important because it measures the cost, in terms of lost utility from consuming less m or buying an additional unit of p."
"And somehow, the optimal solution involves balancing these two."
"Hello again, this is Roger Coke Barr for the bioelectricity course."
"Week one, lecture eleven."
"We'll talk about a new product called Google Television that's part of--part of this right now, which, again, think of them not as devices but rather as portals onto this very, very large set of data and supercomputers that are in the back."
"So it's not the smartphone by itself, and it's not the network by itself, it's the smartphone and the network and then all of the information that is behind it; it's the sum of that that is creating all of the excitement that everybody cares so much about."
"Now, in that model, which is called Cloud computing, it's like having a supercomputer in your pocket."
This happens all the time.
"When we do voice translation, when we do picture identification, our computer, the smartphone, all it does is send the request to the supercomputers that then do all the work."
They wait and then the answer comes back.
"The smartphone itself just has to have enough power to get to the network, take the picture or what have you and give you the answer."
"So it's the sum of all of that that has made such a huge, huge phenomenon."
"So when I go for example to the--to the cathedral, the Berliner Dom and I say, first question is ""How do I get there?"" Well, it'll say you can--how long to get there to walk or bike, you have lots of bike paths here in Berlin."
"And when I get there, I can say, ""Navigate to it"" it will tell me there."
"I can point it at the cathedral and it will tell me all of the information about the cathedral, you know, in this particular case, yesterday, the building dates back to the 15th century; the present building was completed in 1905, reconstructed after the war and the organ has a 113 stops, whatever that is."
"So, all of a sudden, my experience as a tourist, I found it where I wanted to go, I was told this is the most important place."
"I managed to walk there by myself, I looked up and everything"
I needed to know was right there.
And I can repeat that in all of the great cities of
"Europe and, in fact, in all the great cities around the world, and soon, we think, pretty much everywhere."
That's an amazing extension of my experience here in Berlin.
This is a form of artificial intelligence.
Its intelligence where the computer does what it does well and it helps us think better.
"One way to think about it is the computer and the human, together, each does something better because the other is helping."
"We help the computer, the computer helps us."
How do we help the computer?
"You do it all the time because you help tell the computer, ""This is a--this is this kind of an object, this--this is that kind of an object"" and we use those signals, they're called classifiers, and all of a sudden we learn, this is this type of thing, this is that type of thing and the computer can then map that."
"Obviously, humans then benefit from all that information as you go."
"So in this notion of augmented humanity, of Google helping, computer companies helping, it's not a new idea."
"It's been around along time, Bill Gates in 1990 in Comdex called it ""Information at your Fingertips."" All the information that someone might be interested including information they can't get today."
"And we're nearly there, which is what's so profound."
"And literally, you can know literally, everything."
"It's fantastic, right?"
And this is only going to become more pervasive.
"Think about it as hearing, speaking, thinking, augmenting the way you understand things, all of it literally available to you now."
"That's the big change because of the combination of the mobile device, the network."
"Similar to Ebbinghaus's original forgetting curve, though, most of your forgetting will occur within the first few years of disuse."
"After that point, your forgetting will pretty much level off."
The interesting thing about decay and forgetting is that just because you can't retrieve something doesn't mean it's completely gone from your long-term memory.
"Other than outright retrieval, one way we can tell if people have learned something before is by how quickly they re-learn that information or skill."
So remember Ebbinghaus?
"In addition to forgetting, he studied re-learning with those same three-letter nonsense syilables."
"He found that even if he couldn't produce all the syilables from his list, it took him less time to learn the list the second time around than the first time, indicating that some foundation of the memory still existed, even though he couldn't produce it at the time."
"This foundation is called savings, because it's what saved in your memory, whether you realize it or not Re-learning works with procedural skills, too."
"For example, imagine that you learned how to play particular song on the piano a few months ago, but you can't play any of it today."
Now I give you the music to that song and ask you to learn it again.
"If the inability to retrieve something meant that it was completely gone from your long term memory, then it would take you the same amount of time to learn the song the second time around."
However it probably would take you
less time to re-learn it than it did for you to learn it originally.
This faster rate of re-learning tells us that you still have some information about that song stored in your long-term memory.
"Sometimes decay isn't the problem, though."
It's that something else seems to be blocking our ability to get to the information we want.
"This experience is called interference, and there are two main types-- retroactive and proactive."
"Retroactive interference is interference that goes backwards, that is, some new piece of learning seems to reach back and impair your ability to retrieve something you used to know."
"For example, when you move to a new place, you get used to writing your new address on all the different forms and documents and stuff."
"And after a while of using this new address, you may find it difficult to recall your old one."
"In this case, your new address would be running some retroactive interference on your old address"
"Proactive interference, on the other hand, is interference acting forward."
Something you learned in the past gets in the way of your ability to learn and retrieve something correctly in the future.
So I'll give you an example of something that happened to me a few months ago.
I used one password for my email for a really long time.
But then I had to change it.
"Sometimes when I log in, it's still hard for me to remember what my new password is, because all I can come up with is my old one."
"In this case, the prior learning up my old password is impeding my ability to remember the new one."
So let's just see how it works on the same example we traced here earlier.
So we sorta have just by initializing things in the obvious way.
"So, the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero."
And the shortest path from S to itself is just the empty path.
"I grew up in this business, and I plan to stay here how do I answer this question?"
"I love wasbordjes, nicely shaped. there I really horny enormously. en een lekker kontj, maar dat is moeilijk uit te leggen,"
"I would have to show you kontje en wasbordjes, daar ga ik voor"
"Oh, Abramovic Method."
The Abramovic Method was - you know it took me about 40 years of my career to actually come to the idea that I right now have to think about my legacy.
I have to think what I'm going to leave behind me.
"You know, when you are 65 years old, you really start thinking about dying and you start thinking about this like a lost period of your life."
"You know, it can be five years, it can be ten, it can be 20, I don't know."
But I still think that his is the moment of legacy.
So Abramovic Method is really ... of all my knowledge in performance and I came to the conclusion that one thing that is really transformative performance is time.
Time is one thing and the second - die with experience.
"And I understand that the public until till now always when you look performance is a kind of voyer they come, they look - their always outside but they're never inside."
"And in this Abramovic Method,"
I actually reverse the whole situation.
So we have a certain amount of public who are experimenting and interaction with these objects behind me and the other normal public is looking the other public performing.
"So, it's a kind of funny kind of idea of observing, observer becomes observed and can change position and an observed can become observer."
And then I had two different levels of observing.
"One is the public can just come and look at the other public performing but we also have telescopes we have 12 telescopes that actually not only that you have like macro total image but you also have micro image so you can see the person in his eyes, you can see the color of his skin."
So you can really go inside his own structure to see a different level what the experience is going to be.
This movie was really there to focus on preparation.
"One year of preparation for this performance to really understand for large public that performance is a serious thing, it is not just the kind of hocus-pocus little entertainment but really takes everything from you - every atom of your being to do this kind of effort."
And a part of this - this is also a little bit of elements from the different parts of my life and my own private life also some flashbacks from performances I have been doing.
"You know, we made 700 hours and we only used 90 minutes so I think we have at least material for another six movies."
But we just hardly had the money to finish this one so we have to wait for that.
"You know, I am not looking for reaction from people thinking I am crazy."
"I wanted people to take me very serious and actually an artist is a person to take very serious otherwise you cannot understand why I had 850,000 visitors - at the moment I am the only living artist to have such numbers."
Why I had 1750 people sitting an enormous amount of time waiting for hours.
"So, it's not crazy."
There is something there.
"And to make even these things more interesting,"
I now work with scientists and I put caps that you actually can study your brain waves in the moment of observing another person and you can visualize two brains what is happening and now we're analyzing data as America and Russia scientists doing it.
"So to really understand that actually that kind of exchange of energy which is invisible and immaterial for our eyes, actually has an enormous amount of information and something is happening on the scientific level, not just artistic so I will pretty much soon prove that I am not crazy at all."
And that's what we're trying to do.
"You can see here one of my colleagues, fighting off school children as they attempt to classify in an attempt to discover their own planet."
And so the message I want to leave you with is that there is a solution to this problem of big data.
There is a solution to this problem of having more data about the universe than we can possibly use.
"The solution is to invite hundreds of thousands, millions of people to come along, and join us in our scientific adventures."
"And if we can find a way to do that so that they feel they're making a real contribution, we not only educate these volunteers, but we can change their lives, and change their attitudes towards science as well."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
*Moaning and growling*
Library zombies again?
This is getting to be an everyday occurance.
These zombies are going to keep us from the instruction class.
It starts in 10 minutes!
And that zombie wants to eat up all our research.
What can we do?
Maybe....
That's it!
Here's an online course that deals with our research topic!
So we can learn how to use the library without having to run by the hungry undead!
"The library provides several hour-long virtual instruction sessions each semester, so that you can learn how to start your research assignments, and use citation management software without ever leaving home."
"The research classes provide a tour of the library's website, a description of our physical spaces, and help on finding resources that your professors will love, while the Zotero and Endnote classes will teach you basics, tips, and tricks for those programs."
"In this video I'll talk about various aspects of the course, the topics that we'll cover, the kinds of skills you can expect to acquire, the kind of background that I expect, the supporting materials and the available tools for self assessment."
Let's start with the specific topics that this course is going to cover.
The course material corresponds to the first half of the ten week Stanford course.
"It's taken by all computer science undergraduates, as well as many of our graduate students."
"There will be five high level topics, and at times these will overlap."
"The five topics are first of all, the vocabulary for reasoning about algorithm performance, the design and conquer algorithm design paradigm, randomization and algorithm design, primitives for reasoning about graphs, and the use and implementation of basic data structures."
The goal is to provide an introduction to and basic literacy in each of these topics.
"Much, much more could be said about each of them, than we'll have time for here."
"The first topic is the shortest, and probably also the driest."
But it's a prerequisite for thinking seriously about the design and analysis of algorithms.
"The key concept here is big-O notation, which, conceptually, is a modeling choice about the granularity with which we measure a performance metric like the running time of an algorithm."
"And an example of this might arise when multiple concert, consulting firms compete for the same contracts."
And they start to differentiate into types of specialists.
"And according to Scott, competitive dependence arises under normative coordination or co-optation in the forming of interlocking boards of directors."
"When you have trade associations, joint ventures, and horizontal mergers when competitors kind of merge."
The argument is that these kinds of strategies correspond with particular.
"There're kinds of, of resource dependence relations."
"Just like all the theories we've reviewed in the course so far, resource dependaence theory is flawed, it's not perfect."
It's not a panacea.
And it has certain shortcomings.
And I want to discuss a few of those right now.
First.
Resource dependence theory has an assumptions built in that all organizations are more or less similar.
They approach the environment in the same way.
They acquire resources in an uncertain world.
Those firms are staffed by boundedly rational managers who are seeking to optimize both their own and their organizations interests.
"But it, you kind of have to ask yourself, is that accurate?"
Do some organizations live outside the issues of resource dependence?
Are they more about identity and matching?
It's not clear here.
"Another thing that, to consider, is whether the notion of certainty and uncertainly are relatively clear with resource dependent series."
Is dependence on social resources and knowledge clear whereas dependence on money and materials are less clear or more clear?
Resource dependence theory is purely resource exchange based.
And as soon as there is clarity and value and importance but all too often the value of a resource is unclear until well after the fact.
"So meaning making and sense making are lost by resource dependence theory and we, we kind of ignore all that."
"Also, we kind of wonder with resource theory as to what happened to culture and mission."
"It talks about normative coordination but it doesn't thoroughly describe it and we find far stronger characterizations of that process in theories and, like organizational culture."
Slide 30.
Last.
All of the dependencies are described in pair wise fashion.
"And we have to kind of wonder with resource dependency, what about the larger network."
Can the larger network pattern define opportunities and constraints.
Can the network define norms and pressures better than relations of dependence.
"We're going to talk about Brazil within our spirit of discussing interesting topics with intelligent people, such as Eduardo."
"But before that, let's watch a video so we can get to know Eduardo better."
so you have a career growth that is sustainable.
"Sustainability is a very complex subject, as in doing something that will affect your future."
Do the many workers at your press understand this?
How have you shared these concerns with them?
"From what I have noticed, this concern has grown in society, and we're still not on ideal ground here."
"There is still much to be done, and this concern has begun to appear more spontaneously in people."
There is a bigger discomfort in people about this.
"Even our own employees worry about things such as what does the press do about the ink residue, what does it do with the paper, or what does it do to reduce the amount of wasted gas."
"We are making a rationalization program to reduce the costs of electricity, water, and gas, and we always seek to involve everyone in here, so they know that it's not just about economics, but also about sustainability."
To use these resources well is to be sustainable.
"We have began to learn more and more that being sustainable means administering resources, and using them well and intelligently."
"We noticed that, in several different companies, the level of the workers' awareness has increased, especially this year, after the manifestations in july."
"It seems that after we saw these things on social networks, such as the Facebook pages, and the protests for better public services, it made the people more aware of these things."
"We also have noticed a different communication between the workers, there is a lot more equality."
There isn't that old and archaic submission anymore.
"It seems that there is a new model of cooperation, of helping each other instead of ordering or obeying."
Do you feel that change in your team?
Yes.
"As you said, in the past, it was a lot more of this situation of one person orders, the other obeys."
It wasn't possible for it to be that way anymore.
"If a company wants to be competitive and efficient and have good results, it can't work that way."
"You need everyone's participation, and you need them to bring not only their arms, but their brains, their will, and their knowledge to the company."
And it's only possible to take advantage of that in a cooperative environment.
"As a director of the Abril press, what is your biggest professional concern right now?"
"There is a market with clear and valid rules to all of those who want to compete here, and it's very important, for a businessman, to create a market this way and to keep it this way."
Everyone in my position has wondered exactly that.
"Which path should we follow, what is the impact of social media or of other means of communication, and I think it is very interesting that we are living in a period of transition, and because of this we need to know what our opportunities are."
"Because I think with change, opportunities emerge, and by taking these opportunities, we grow stronger."
"You mentioned your professional concerns, now I would like to know your concerns with Brazil, and the direction that it is going, in your opinion."
What are your concerns with the country?
This question made me think of it.
"You talked about the stimulus package, and as consumers on Wall Street, we don't see a lot of the impact of the stimulus package with any immediacy, but that's not the point."
"The point, or that's not the question."
"On the academic side, the institutions that are going to get some of the spending now--have a good sense of when they're going to get it."
But who's going to get it?
They're prioritizing--they're really excited.
You grew up in your business career in Silicon Valley.
"You grew up in an industry and with a company son that might not have existed but for government funding and AT&amp;amp;T support, and I'm stretching the facts here a little bit to make a different point."
"Are you confident, given what you've heard, given where you've been over the course of the last several weeks, that the American economy will see some good things come out of that directed spending that is going into academic institutions, as unlike what we have seen in a very long time? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"I am, and I think there's a lot of reasons to be very optimistic."
"I know everybody is sort of depressed when you read the headlines and watch the television, and so forth."
"But, the American story is a story of innovation."
"And the system of universities that we have, the young founders that come out of universities that form great companies, the ability to do quickly the capital formation and the venture industry, and so forth, is unparalleled."
"If you look at where jobs come from, they come from the private sector."
"And high-paying jobs come from people who work in knowledge-intensive industries that are sophisticated, or very high in manufacturing jobs."
"So it seems obvious to me that part of the way to get this fixed for the longer term, and I'm not talking about the regulatory failures, which is another separate and long conversation."
"It's to make sure that the necessary pre-conditions are present for entrepreneurs and existing businesses to either re-use existing capital plants to build, for example, the classic example here is batteries for hybrid cars in the United States, as opposed to in Korea and in Germany."
"And, basically, get those jobs in the United States."
"That's ultimately the answer to all of the incessant criticism that you hear about jobs moving to India and China, and service wages, and so forth and so on."
"It's ultimately about the extraordinary asset that we have in our universities and our research labs to, essentially, create the next Google."
And not just in our industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
We have time for one more question.
"Yeah, go ahead."
Eric will repeat it. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;OFF MlKE SPEAKER:
Getting around to the [inaudible] that you talked about.
What are the three things that need to happen for it to become
a material part of your business? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
The question was what are the three things that needs to get done to become a material part of our business?
"Let me answer your question without the word â€˜material' in the middle of it, because â€˜material' has a very specific meaning."
"The first problem, if you're a display--if you have essentially a display property-- you know, you want to sort of show ads, it's very difficult to figure out which ad to show."
Because there are multiple vendors who show you these ads.
"And we're in the process of building the equivalent of an ad exchange, which will allow you to do that automatically."
"A lot of patients, this drug is just not covered because there's really no great superiority over Celexa."
"The last SSRI we're going to talk about, for completeness' sake, is Fluvoxamine."
This is actually not indicated for the treatment of depression.
It is indicated for the treatment of OCD -
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
"So you don't see a lot of use of this, and really the main reason you don't see a lot of use is there are some potent drug interactions and some significant interactions that we need to be aware of."
"So it's a little complicated of a drug to use, and with the other agents being just as effective as a treatment option, we just can get away with not using it as a first line agent."
"Okay, we're going to transition into kind of talking about some of the side effects of these medications."
And where these side effects are most prominent is in the first two weeks of treatment.
"And really, this is kind of to give you a picture as to why, as when we created all that neurotransmitter, remember those receptor sites were still in that upregulated state, meaning there is a lot of them."
"So there's a lot of targets for all that serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine to go to, and some of those targets relate to side effects."
And it takes about two weeks for that brain to downregulate back down to only having a few of those target sites.
So what are some of these side effect that we see initially?
"We see nausea, diarrhea - majority, there's a lot of serotonin receptors in stomach and the gut, so that's where a lot of these GI symptoms come into play."
"We can see sedation or insomnia, so again, it really depends on the agent; it really depends on the patient also."
"So, it can go either way."
"We do see an initial increase in anxiety, in the drug, so - which is ironic, because a lot of these drugs are used to treat anxiety, so"
"Patients are just a little more restless in the beginning, and we need to be aware of that in the first couple weeks."
And we can see a headache in the first couple weeks.
"Kind of transitioning over to the chronic side effects, that don't go away, necessarily, and are related, that you have to kind of think about beyond the first two weeks, and you can't really talk the patient, necessarily, out of just sticking with it, is, first of all, that headache could continue."
"So I always tell patients,"
"""You could have a headache in the first two weeks."""
"""If it sticks around three to four weeks later,"
"let your doctor know."""
"Sexual dysfunction, which we'll talk about."
You'll see increase in sweating.
"People, especially at night, often sweat and wake up with sweat on their sheets and things like that."
"And then, we see an interruption in the sleep cycle."
"So, patients sometimes don't get that, don't spend as much time in that deep-sleep phase of rest."
"So I'm going to talk a little bit about the sexual dysfunction side effects, because I think they're really important to highlight."
Oftentimes patients are uncomfortable talking about this.
"Providers are uncomfortable talking about it, but it's really something we need to address."
We don't think that there are people or objects that actually do that.
"If there were, not only would it look  like things were moving backward in time but everything we know about causality, cause and effect, the past versus the future, this would all get jumbled together in a way that doesn't really  make sense to us."
So we should be thankful that Einstein says there is a speed limit on the universe.
"And the last question is,  is there a timeless zone in the universe?"
This is an intriguing question  because it's not absolutely clear what it would mean to have a timeless zone in the universe.
"It makes you think about what is time, what is the definition,  and what would it mean to not have it?"
So the simplest way to think about time  is that it's a label.
It's a label on the different moments  in the history of the universe.
Our universe is like a film  with different frames in the film strip or a book with different pages.
"There's stuff in the universe,  scattered throughout space."
And that stuff scattered throughout space happens over and over again with everything slightly in a different position than it was just the time before.
"And the time is just a label, it's just like the page number in the book, or the frame number in the film."
So a timeless zone in the universe would be a place where there were no different moments.
Where the universe didn't happen over and over again.
There was just one configuration of stuff forever.
"But if you think about it,  what if you sort of visited that timeless zone in the universe?"
We have some intuitive  science-fictiony picture that everything would slow down  and then stop or something like that.
"But the truth is, you could never get there, to the timeless zone, because as you approached,  if you try to reach your hand in, your hand would stop moving."
That's what it would mean to be timeless.
You could never see the timeless zone  in the universe because no light could ever come from it  because it takes time for light to travel.
"So our best guess right now is no,  there are no timeless zones in the universe."
"But we keep an open mind, that's what makes theoretical physics and cosmology so much fun."
"Thanks for all your great questions, if you have any more questions for the next expert, please leave them in the comments below."
one boy and the other is so different again
I look forward to all boys with everyone I try something else and I learn also from all
"I think it's great that everyone is different, and of course there are some guys that I really like"
"I enjoy working with Jack, with Luke and Roger which is a group that I would like to work together all the time and I would still like to do a group"
"I would go for Jack, Luke and Roger."
With those three would be great and what about adam adam is great too! but I would go for Jack
"Jack is a little bigger than Adam, and that makes him still the winner size is important to you? yes size is certainly important but not necessarily just look at Todd, he is not so big, but we really click and there is romance"
"Jack just has a huge dick, and Luke is aggressive during sex, and he has a lot of energy they all have some"
"I have lots of friends in Bel Ami, that's for sure there are even people that I really see as family when I needed it, they really helped me always the feeling is mutual, we really support each other there are a lot of people that I can trust, just like in a real family"
"Anyways, this is the time to the top of the trajectory but we know the full time is twice that so I'll just put a 2 here."
"Once we know the time, how do we find the range?"
We'll we used this equation and now I've plugged in for the initial velocity the initial x velocity V₀ cosine of 45.
I've multiplied by the time that we just calculated because remember in the x direction the acceleration is always zero.
"Okay, let's simplify--well, I've multiplied the V₀ together to get this V₀² and actually if I carry out cosine of 45 times 945, I find it's just equal to one half."
"This part the one half cancelled with the 2, I've find that my maximum range is equal to my initial V²/a."
"Now, I do not really care about V₀²."
I want to know how range scales with a and it turns out well it's proportional to 1/a or R is proportional to a⁻¹.
"Well so what, how do I use that--just like we did early in the unit, we found out using a lot of ratio and the ratio of the range on earth to the range of this unknown planet is going to be equal to the ratios of the accelerations taken to the -1 power."
A -1 power just means flip what you have inside.
I can solve this for the unknown acceleration and I get this equation.
The acceleration on our unknown planet is equal to the ratios of the ranges times the acceleration on earth.
"When I found what we know, I find that the acceleration on our unknown planet must be 1.6 m/s², which is exactly the acceleration on the moon and we've figured out where we are."
Amazing work--there were other ways to solve this--equally valid-- but this is one tool that you should try to familiarize yourself with.
I'm Peter Du Bois.
I live at Speakers Court.
The situation at the moment is as near perfect as it can be in sheltered accommodation
Staff at Speakers Court are very understanding and they've come to know us all very well
I think Scope has given me the opportunity to become as independent as I can be
"Assuming that we have an accurate voter registration database, we know who the proper voters are."
The next procedural question is how are we going to authenticate those voters when they arrive at the polling place.
"In many countries, there are national IDs and most countries that have these, just use these for voting as well."
"You present your national ID card, they check your picture, and you're allowed to vote."
"In the US, however, we don't have a national ID card."
We have drivers licenses issued by each state and we have passports issued by the
"Federal Government, but it's really a patchwork rather than just one single standardized system."
"This greatly complicates election procedures in the US and results in a variety of, of different solutions."
Many states require only a signature to verify that the voter is who they claim to be.
The voter registration database is printed with into a list at each polling place of the people who live in that area and each voter who's eligible to vote at that polling station has a space on this list.
"And for a long time, this was done entirely on paper like this."
"So, the way it would work is the voter would arrive at the polling place they'd announce themselves to the to the poll workers."
"The poll workers would look them up on both the registration list, and then they'd sign their name into the poll book."
"The Tevatron collider shoots miniscule protons and antiprotons... at terrific speeds just short of the speed of light... around a four-mile-long, super-enforced, steel-encased ring."
To protect the sensitive experiments from surface noise... and for safety reasons... the collision ring lies deep underground.
"We take beams of high-energy protons going one way around a big ring... and a beam of high-energy antiprotons going the other way around the ring... and then, at two places in the ring, we smash them together."
The mighty collision annihilates the particles... and produces an intense ball of pure energy...
The idea being that perhaps we can make new particles... that disappear into the extra dimensions.
"If nothing happens, how will the scientists know... that a graviton has moved off into an extra dimension?"
"The way that you tell that is by reconstructing... everything else that happened in this messy collision... and then saying, ""Oops, there's some energy..."
"""and momentum that's missing here."""
So we call this a missing energy search.
It could take years and billions of collisions... before history happens and higher dimensions are found.
"If extra dimensions are there, it means the universe... is a much bigger and much stranger place... than we have ever imagined."
"But if it does happen, it would be proof positive... that parallel worlds exist."
"The question then will be, how do we get there?"
Faced with extinction in the far-flung future... can humankind open a portal to a parallel universe?
Parallel universes are not just a crazy idea... dreamed up by physicists to marry science with fiction.
If finally proven to exist... they could have an important practical purpose... in the far-off future.
Finding a tunnel to another world could one day save humanity.
Billions of years from now... our Earth will meet its inevitable demise.
Experts say that it will all end either in a big crunch or big freeze.
If other universes are shown to exist... some say they could serve as a kind of cosmic lifeboat.
For a future generation... a passage or gateway to another world... could be their only hope for survival.
"The question is, can we find a way to get there?"
One cool way of theoretically going from our universe to another one... is to go through what's called a wormhole... a bridge connecting two universes... kind of like getting on a train or a subway.
Like a subway system in a city... going through this tunnel to a different place.
"Think of two sheets of paper... that are stacked parallel to each other... but then think of a gateway, a shortcut... a portal connecting these two universes."
"This extreme idea was first proposed back in 1935... by the inimitable Albert Einstein and his student, Nathan Rosen."
"A ""throat"" with two conjoined black holes, theoretically... allows someone, like a passenger on a subway train... to quickly travel to another space and time."
This could work if the universe is really an infinite multiverse.
"Certainly, it's a theoretical possibility... a sort of shortcut, if you like."
And it allows the possibility of traveling... between distant parts of the universe... or perhaps between different universes.
There are all sorts of problems with trying to traverse a wormhole.
But one challenge above all seems insurmountable.
We have just a very small internet café.
This is the map that the police is using.
We have 14 no-go zones and when you are banned
- it is only drug users and homeless people who are banned from being in these zones - it will cost about 100 euros every time you are in these areas.
"We have the main station here and the church is here, and here in an overlap of 3 no-go zones we have the needle exchange program."
So what is the message you are sending?
"It is ""do you want a fine or HlV?"
"Pick yourself."""
"""Fixerum"" means ""user room or injection room"" and that is from Vancouver in 2004 and it is still like that."
And this is 2 huge garbage disposers in Copenhagen where users are injecting and using their drugs because we don't have injections rooms.
Actually it is explaining the choice... what choice do we have?
We cannot choose that people are not using.
We cannot choose a drug-free society - that's an illusion.
But we can chose - do we want them to inject like this?
With nurses and safety?
Or do we want them to inject like this?
That's our choice.
We've had the discussion about injection rooms as well for about 15 years in this country.
The majority of our politicians still find that establishing safer injecting facilities is too controversial.
It is characterised by legalising drugs.
"So people still have to use around here on the open drug scene, in our back yards and they are put at great risk for overdose, infections and amputation because of that."
"I also speak in favour of what you can call injection rooms where you can go inside and take your illegal drugs, get clean needles, and also get access to healthcare if you have any diseases or have been infected or have anything... that you can get help in these places and also take your drugs in a safe place, so that we don't have people lying around for instance taking an overdose outside in the cold weather or during the winter"
"If you have a safe injection facility, we hope from the police and I think the citizens hope the same, that there will be a very clear reduction in injection pumps and needles around this area."
"It is my opinion that Denmark, like many other states is under social pressure from the UN system or from, for example, the Americans and others, not to engage too much in for instance injection rooms or prescription of heroine and such because they feel that it is undermining the international treaties in the area."
The treaties were made in 1961 when the world
looked a little different.
"So, I think sometimes that the UN system should actually be in favour of making sure that human rights, for instance securing that people get access to healthcare, also on a street level even if they are drug users or homeless or the like."
"And actually, the UN in this question has been doing the opposite and it has been very unfortunate."
"We see a room with nurses and doctors, a clean room,"
I think it can be there in a few years.
Punishment as a tool to prevent people from potentially harming themselves is absurd.
"So we need to start with decriminalising drug users; at least stop the war on drug users and invite them - they need to be socially included, they need acceptance, they need healthcare - that is the first think to do."
And that's exactly what a topological ordering will accomplish.
"So, it's reasonable to ask the question, when does the directed graph have a topological ordering and when a graph does have such an ordering, how do we get our grubby little hands on it?"
"Well there's a very clear, necessary condition for a graph to have a topological ordering, which is, it had better be acyclic."
"Put differently, if a directed graph has a directed cycle then there's certainly no way there's going to be a topological ordering."
"So, I hope the reason for this is fairly clear."
Consider any directed graph which does have a directed cycle and consider any purported way of ordering the vertices.
Well now just traverse the edges of the cycle one by one.
So you start somewhere on the cycle.
"And if the first edge goes backwards, well you're already screwed."
You already know that this ordering is not topological; no way it just can go backwards.
"So evidently the first edge of this cycle has to go forward, but now you have to traverse the rest of the edges on this cycle, and eventually you come back to where you started."
"So if you started out by going forward, at some point you have to go backward."
"So that edge goes backward in the ordering, violating the property of the topological ordering."
"That's true for every ordering, so directed cycles exclude the possibility of topological orderings."
"Now the question is, well what if you don't have a cycle?"
Is that a strong enough condition that you're guaranteed to have a topological ordering.
"Is the only obstruction to sequencing jobs without conflicts, the obvious one of having circular precedence constraints?"
"So it turns out that only is the answer yes as long as you don't have any directed cycles, you're guaranteed a topological ordering, but we can even compute one in linear time no less, via depth-first search."
"So before I show you this super slick and super efficient reduction of computing topological orderings to depth first search, let me first go over a pretty good but slightly less slick and slightly"
less efficient solution to help build up your intuition about directed acyclic graphs and their topological orderings.
So for the straightforward solution we're going to begin with a simple observation.
Every directed acyclic graph has what I'm gonna call a sink vertex.
That is a vertex without any outgoing arcs.
"So in the four node, directed acyclic graph we were exploring on the last slide, there is exactly one source vertex and that's, excuse me, sink vertex, that's this right most vertex here."
Right?
That has no outgoing arcs; the other three vertices all have at least one outgoing arc.
"Now, why is it the case that a directed acyclic graph has to have a sink vertex?"
Well suppose it didn't.
Suppose it had no sink vertex.
That would mean every single vertex has at least one outgoing arc.
So what can we do if every vertex has one outgoing arc?
Well we can start in an arbitrary node.
Proof is twice the alcohol content.
All of those have about the same amount of alcohol and are considered to be 1 drink.
It's important to pay attention if you do drink alcohol to what your actual serving sizes are.
You might sit down to a glass of wine that's 10 ounces.
"That's technically 1 glass to you, but you can see, based on these recommendations that that's 2 different servings of alcohol."
"There are some individuals that think that dietary supplements are going to help improve their blood sugar control more so than exercise, diet and weight loss and medication and really, all of the major international diabetes bodies recommend against Routine supplements."
Especially with antioxidants.
There's lack of evidence that these productrs even work.
And there's also concerns related to the long term safety.
"So you should never be taking high doses of supplements such as Vitamin E, Vitamin C, or things like"
"Beta Carotene, in order to treat your diabetes."
"When thinking about the meal plan for people with diabetes, it's important to take into consideration the fact that individuals who have diabetes, in addition to having high blood sugar, are often also prone to having low blood sugar."
And that's a condition called hypoglycemia.
Clinical hypoglycemia is blood sugar of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter.
If you do experience hypoglycemia it's advisable to follow what's called the rule of 15.
If you test your blood sugar and it's below 70 you want to consume 15 grams of carbohydrates.
And then wait 15 minutes.
Test your blood sugar again and if it hasn't gone back up have another 15 grams of carbohydrates.
It's important not to over compensate if you see your blood sugar's really low and you get really worried and then you eat a hundred grams of carbohydrates your going to have rebound hyperglycemia.
"A 15 gram carb snack is about the equiv, equivalent of a half of cup of juice."
Results of candies and packets that you can have on hand so in the event of hypoglycemia you can quickly consume those 15 grams.
"Wait 15 minutes, test again."
"And if it's not brought back up, wait another fifteen minutes."
"If you do have hypoglycemia, it's important to test your blood sugar on a regular basis following the period as you're at increased risk of your blood sugar going back down."
"For people who get sick and have diabetes, it's still important that they consume regular intake of carbohydrate."
"They should be checking their blood sugar more than usual with the overall goal of when you're sick, to keep your blood sugar under 200."
"As part of the stress mechanism of being sick, when you're ill there's different hormones that are released that elevate your blood sugar so you're going to be more likely to have high blood sugar even if you're not eating any carbohydrates."
"You should be eating meals, small meals throughout the day."
"Even a very small amount of blood, of carbohydrate in your diet could make your blood sugar react, probably non-traditionally for you."
So keep a closer eye on your blood sugar than normal.
You might need more insulin and you're advised not to exercise Vigorously.
"People who have diabetes and become ill are advised to drink plenty of fluids, at least 12 8 ounce cups per day."
"So why would a programmer, in their right mind, ever write a program that had code in it that wasn't going to be executed?"
"And there's several actually ways in which unreachable code can arise, and it's actually quite common."
"So this is an important optimization, getting rid of the unreachable code is actually fairly important."
"Perhaps the most common situation Is that the code is actually parameterized with, code that is only compiled and used in certain situations."
"So, for example, in C, It would be sorta typical to see some code that looks like this."
"If debug, then, you know, executes something, where debug is a pound defying constant."
"So in C, you can define names for literals."
So you say something like this.
You might define debug.
"To be zero, and so you might see a program that had this piece of code in it, and what this"
"literally means is that this piece of code is equivalent to if zero, then blah, blah, blah."
"Alright, so, so when you're compiling without debugging, you have debug to find the zero, when you're compiling with debugging, you would change this line to define debug to be some non zero constant."
So in this case we are compiling without debugging.
What will happen?
Well we'll see that this predicate is guaranteed to be zero the constant folding will take care of that.
And that will result in an unreachable basic block on the [inaudible] branch and then that code can be deleted And so essentially the compiler is able to go through using the optimizer and strip out all o f the debugging code.
That isn't going to be used since your compiler [inaudible].
Another case where unreachable code comes up is with libraries.
"So, very frequently, programs are written, to use generic"
libraries.
But the program might only use a very small part of the interface.
"So, the library might supply 100 methods, to cover all the situations that various programmers are interested in."
"But for your program, you might only be using three of those methods."
"And the rest of those methods could potentially be removed, from the final binary, to make the code smaller."
"And, finally another way that unreachable basic blocks occur, is as the results of other optimizations."
So as we will see optimizations frequently lead to other to more optimizations.
"And it could be that just through other rearrangements of the code that the compiler makes some basic block redundant and, and able to be deleted."
Now some optimizations are simpler to express if each register occurs only once on the
left-hand side of an assignment.
"So that means if each register is assigned, at most, once then some of these optimizations are easier to talk about."
"So we're gonna rewrite our intermediate code, always to so that it's in single assignment form."
So this is called single assignment form.
Where you set missions for yourself or the game can set them for you.
"You have your allies, your community, your power-ups that you use to level, and there even are the bad guys, thing like, things like here, caffeine and fluorescent lights and running."
I guess running in this case is a bad guy if you have a concussion.
"So as you can see, this is a very game-like kind of approach."
As I may have mentioned earlier.
Jane McGonigal doesn't like the concept or the term of gamification and wants to focus more on the truly game-like side of the equation.
If you recall the chart that I put up that there's a more behaviorist kind of gamification and a more game-based framework.
She's more on the game side and so this reflects that kind of framing.
"But it has many of the same kinds of game elements that we've seen in other contexts, just structured in a different way, and not using quite the same simplistic kinds of point mechanics and reward mechanics."
That we see in some of the shallow examples of gameification.
"But again, an example of trying to help people get better and do better using game elements."
Next category is energy and environment.
"First example here is something called Opower and this is a company that gives you reports on how much energy you use in your house and what the patterns are, and you see trends and so part of it is just a quantification, a feedback mechanism that"
"lets you see how you're doing and you can see here you're doing good in this case but it also shows you a bunch of relational data, so this says."
You use less energy than the average person.
But 55 percent more than your more efficient neighbors.
Part of what's interesting about Opower is it creates a social dynamic.
A friendly kind of competition with your friends.
"So, for example, here's a report showing a comparison with your neighbors."
"Where you see you, and the bar chart shows what all of your neighbors are doing."
"So you can see you're worse off than the norm among your neighbors, but really worse off than the category of more efficient neighbors."
"And what they've been able to show, and researchers have been able to show in other contexts is that, that social dimension, that peer pressure, if you will is really powerful in getting people to engage in new behaviors like, using less electricity."
"And here we see the goals which are similar kind of structures that we have seen in other gamified context, and leader boards, another way to compare yourself against your friends."
Opower has been able to show roughly a two to four percent improvement in the communities where it operates in energy utilization.
"May not sound like much, but that's enough to drive."
100's of millions of kilowatt hours of energy savings.
"We're talking about people who use a lot of energy, and potentially millions and millions of people in cities that can have this effect."
So even a small sustained impact on energy usage is a huge benefit.
"For the energy companies in terms of pollution, in terms of energy sustainability, and so forth."
Next example is Recycle Bank.
Recycle Bank has a Gameified system of rewards and points and so forth for encouraging people to recycle.
"So they partner with local communities that have recycling programs and say if you e-, if you recycle in this program you earn the points which you can then redeem for rewards."
"And now it has this cash, and then it could use this cash to invest in essentially the Legacy Loans Program, the public-private investor Legacy Loans Program that Geithner talks about."
"And if they did this, they could take this-- let's say this was $7."
"They could take this $7, contribute it to the equity in the program."
The Treasury would contribute another $7.
"The Fed would contribute $84, and then they would have $100, and I know this is kind of messy, but they would have $100 that they can then use to go buy these assets."
"And the net effect of this is that this bank went from having 100% exposure to this toxic asset to having only $7 exposure through this loan to this hedge fund, or this special-purpose entity, or whatever you want to call it."
"And I got a couple of emails, even from some colleagues, to say, well, can this really be done?"
"And my kind of knee-jerk reaction was, well, if this can't be done, they'll figure out a way to do it, because there's billions of dollars at stake, and really, the incentive here is structured to do it."
"And frankly, the Government probably wants them to do it, because on some level, even though this would be a massive transfer of exposure and wealth from the taxpayers to the banks, it would on some level solve the problem."
"And if people really aren't aware of it, everyone will be happy about it, because all of these banks, Citibank and Bank of America, will just survive, and they can just kind of say that all's well."
"So what I wanted to do, just to answer those questions, is get a little bit particular about the wording."
And I got an email.
"Leigh Logan actually emailed me, and she highlighted one clause in the Legacy Loans term sheet that seems to address what I talk about in that second video there."
And this is from the Legacy Loans terms sheet.
It says:
"""Private investors may not participate in any"
"PPlF""-- so this is that Private-Public Investment"
"Fund-- ""that purchases assets from sellers that are affiliates of such investors or that represent 10% or more of the aggregate private capital in the PPlF."""
So the question is what's an affiliate?
"And I looked it up in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and there are multiple definitions."
But this is probably the best one.
It says:
"""The term affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company."" And that's an area that I just outlined."
"This bank really doesn't control this hedge fund, right?"
"They just essentially gave them a loan with very little stipulations on it, and then the hedge fund can go do it."
"But, you could say, oh, well, you know, there's nothing that this bank could do to force this hedge fund to buy these assets, so maybe this plan won't work."
And another thing is what's the definition of the private capital?
You also can't represent 10% more of the aggregate private capital.
"Frankly, when I think of private capital, I think more in terms of equity investments, but maybe the definition of private capital also includes debt investments, although, I doubt it."
"So in this video I want to lay out a scenario that, essentially, it can do the same thing economically, and in fact, the exact behavior that they want in other parties without being in any way an affiliate of the counterparty and in no way giving capital directly to them."
So what Bank A could do instead-- let me redraw it.
"Actually, not Bank A."
"So basically, the demand for food is going to continue to grow unabated over time as population grows."
"Demand for food [? it fuels ?] proportional to population, so it's growing over time."
"Yet the production of food eventually has to slow down, because there's a diminishing marginal product of labor without an increasing capital."
"So basically what you've got is a forever growing demand, but a gradually slowing production, because the marginal product of labor's diminishing with this fixed capital or land."
The result is mass starvation.
"So Malthus predicted that by about where we are now, if not before, the world would be suffering from mass starvation."
Through the basic principles-- not because he's a crazy nutcase-- but the basic principles we've studied so far.
"Which you've got ever-increasing demand, but diminishing marginal product of producing food."
And in the end you get mass starvation.
"Well, as we all know Malthus was wrong."
"World population has risen about 800% since he wrote his article at the end of the 18th century, and yet we're fatter than ever."
"Our problem is we eat too much, not enough."
"Now that's not true around the world, there's starvation elsewhere."
But there's clearly no more starvation worldwide than there was at his time despite the fact that the world population has grown eight-fold.
So what did Malthus get wrong?
What Malthus got wrong is what I haven't taught you yet.
"Which is that aggregate production is not just about k and I, but also about productivity."
It's also about productivity.
"That the production function really looks like-- the form of the production function, which we wrote last time as q equals f of k and l."
"Really more generally, can be written as q equals A, times f of k and I, where A is aggregate productivity."
"Really, let's say that this is big Q. If we think about the big Q for society, now let's think of aggregate quantity for society or else we wouldn't talk about a specific firm."
"But if we think about aggregate product, aggregate quantity produced in society, it's a function of the aggregate capital and labor of the society, but also a function of productivity."
It's also a function of the fact that we use our inputs more effectively over time.
"So for example, one thing Malthus missed is that the acreage of land-- it's an empirical fact, the number of acres of land on Earth are fixed."
Earth is not growing-- but the arability of that land is not fixed.
We get better and better at figuring out how to grow more and more stuff on the same amount of land.
"That's the factor A, that's a productivity improvement."
"Likewise, agricultural technology has improved."
"We have disease-resistant seeds, we have better land management."
The bottom line is we are making more and more of a given plot of land compared to what Malthus saw in his time.
"So while k if it's defined as land may be fixed, and l therefore there's diminishing marginal product of a given production function, the production function itself is improving over time because of productivity improvements."
"Productivity, the arability of land, disease-resistant seeds, and other things are making that given quantity of land more productive over time."
"So ""this too will pass""."
"The other part of that story, which is very valuable to consider, is that that emperor wore that ring not just in difficult times but also in the happy times as well."
"Because it's in the prosperous, happy, good times that we should always remember, ""this too will pass""."
"Because he knew that the happy prosperous times were also fragile, he had a few celebrations but not many, because he knew he had to work hard to make sure those prosperous happy good times lasted as long as they possibly can."
And they did.
He became a very successful and well-loved emperor because the bad times were very short and the happy long times were longer than anybody could ever remember.
And of course you know who that emperor really is - it's you.
"And your empire is your life, your body, your family, your environment."
"When we have these negative emotions what we're actually saying, we're sulking, we're forgetting, ""this too will pass""."
"But also when you have the positive emotions, when you have happiness and joy and inspiration, please never take them for granted."
"They also need to be guarded, and cherished and nurtured, otherwise they go too quickly."
"So when we have our positive emotions, when things are going well, be careful, don't get heedless and think ""Oh my life is going well now, I'm healthy therefore I don't need to exercise anymore, I have a wonderful relationship now so I don't need to put effort into caring for my partner, I have a wonderful Buddhist Society now, so I don't need to put donations in the donations box anymore [laughter]""."
"You've got to keep caring, otherwise the whole thing sort-of falls apart!"
"""I'm happy, therefore"
"I don't need to put effort into my happiness anymore."" Be careful there because all these positive emotions, they're fragile, you know where they're caused from."
"If you have the happy emotions well done, if you feel well, you're happy, you have these beautiful inspirations of kindness and generosity, now how does that feel?"
The positive emotions are great.
They need to be cultivated.
Where do they come from?
"Just like the negative emotions, when you're happy, where does it come from?"
"You can actually see the positive thoughts get more and more and more, like in the movies, when they have a romance."
"In a romance movie, it's years seen I've seen these movies, but I'm sure they haven't changed, they don't fall in love at the very beginning and get married."
That happens at the very end of the movie.
It all builds up to this.
So the whole movie is building up to the suggestion that these two people are going to meet and be happy and all their problems are going to be solved.
"And that thought is been on your mind again and again and again for about an hour, an hour and a half, so when they do meet, ""oh at last they've met!"", you get emotional, you start crying, ""oh isn't it wonderful"", because that emotion has been built over the whole course of the movie."
"And once you understand where these positive emotions come from, you can actually start building them up inside of you."
"One of the things which I teach my monks, teach nuns, teach yourself as well - negative emotions they come basically from what we call the fault-finding mind."
"You always see what's wrong in other people, you see what's wrong in yourself, what's wrong in the monks, what's wrong in the Buddhist Society, what's wrong in the government, what's wrong in the whole world!"
And that gives a lot of negative emotions.
Why don't we look at the other side
"- not the fault-finding mind, but what we call the gratitude mind."
So I'm going to-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"I didn't really answer your question about netbooks, if you want to talk about netbooks for a sec. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Yep. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
Netbooks are the next generation of the small device that the OL PC was trying to talk about.
What's particularly interesting in netbooks is the price point that they talk about.
"It makes sense that eventually it will make sense for operators and so forth to subsidize the use of those books, because they can make services revenue and advertising revenues on their consumption."
That's another new model that's coming.
Products today are not completely done; there are things that are missing.
It's perfectly possible that operating systems that are Lynux based will become a significant player in that space where there historically have not been significant players in the PC space. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Okay.
One of the things we might want to talk about is how carriers end up playing--how the financials end up.
But we can get there.
"I want to ask a couple of questions about search, a couple of questions about financials, one or two on video, one or two on mobile, and just turn it over to folks in the room."
"But on the search side, and this is an economic--an economy question--as well."
Query growth has remained strong--high teens--15% or 20%--for a while.
Our data--for what it's worth--indicates it's still there.
"Cost per click has been declining--it was negative in the last quarter, but only by about 2%."
"Any trends you can update, or you can get us to update it, on how you play through a more difficult economic environment and any real time information. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, in the first place, I don't think I need to talk to this audience about the state of the global economy."
I view the situation as pretty dire.
The combination of everything that we have seen does not appear to have a current bottom.
"I worked hard to promote the stimulus package, not because it was perfect, but because I thought that the government--and I believe government should act very broadly to address the sort of historic issues everybody is aware of."
"So during this time, what's happening is people are using the Internet more."
"It obviously will affect the on line advertising market, simply because our systems are so tightly tuned, that if customers are buying less it will eventually, we don't know exactly when, it will eventually be reflected in CPCs and CPMs."
"So it's important, I think, to say right up front that we are not immune; we Google and the on line advertising market, are not immune to this."
"We may be better positioned from an advertising perspective, and other advertisers, because our advertising can be sold to a salesperson."
"But ultimately the confusion in companies that are saying, ""Oh my God, you know, what are we going to do?"""
"The sort of real pain that is being felt by corporations worldwide, will translate to our world. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
What are some of the--we know what the negative issues are with the economy.
We know what the negative issues are with regards to on line commerce and off line commerce.
"What are some of the positive signals that you are seeing on the core search business that might relate to increased queries; using the word coupon; or increased products being liquidated and people finding bargains; or any data points that are, while they may be small in total, are positive? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, every data point that we have is obvious."
So we can utilize that exponent property right here to rewrite this as being equal to the derivative with respect to x of e to the natural log of 2 times x.
And what's neat about this is now we've got this into a form of e to the something.
So we can essentially use the chain rule to evaluate this.
So this derivative is going to be equal to the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something.
"Well, the derivative e to the something with respect to that something is just e to that something."
So it's going to be equal to e to the natural log of 2 times x.
So let me make it clear what I just did here.
This right over here is the derivative of e to the natural log of 2 times x with respect to the natural log of 2--
let me make it a little bit clearer-- with respect to the natural log of 2 times x.
"So we took the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something-- that's this right here, it's just e to that something."
"And then we're going to multiply that by, this is just an application of the chain rule, of the derivative of that something with respect to x."
So the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x is just going to be natural log of 2.
This is just going to be natural log of 2.
The derivative of a times x is just going to be equal to a.
This is just the coefficient on the x.
"And just to be clear, this is the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x."
So we're essentially done.
But we can simplify this even further.
This thing right over here can be rewritten.
And let me draw a line here just to make it clear that this equals sign is a continuation from what we did up there.
"But this e to the natural log of 2x, we can rewrite that, using this exact same exponent property, as e to the natural log of 2, and then all of that raised to the x power."
"And of course, we're multiplying it times the natural log of 2, so times the natural log of 2."
"Well, what is e to the natural log of 2?"
"Well, we already figured that out."
That is exactly equal to 2.
This right over here is equal to 2.
And so now we can simplify.
"This whole thing, the derivative of 2 to the x, is equal to-- and I'll switch the order a little bit-- it is the natural log of 2, that's this part right over here, times 2 to the x."
Or we could write it as 2 to the x times the natural log of 2.
"Today's lecture, we will be talking about the treatment of depression."
"The goals and objectives of today's lecture are: to describe the target symptoms commonly associated with depression, incorporate concepts from pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacology, and therapeutics to select a treatment regimen for an individual patient with depression, to identify phases of treatment, desired therapeutic goals, and factors that determine the duration of therapy when managing patients with depression, to describe clinically significant drug interactions and adverse events with antidepressants and how to prevent or solve some of these issues, to develop a care plan for a depressed patient with selection and monitoring of appropriate antidepressants and community and hospital settings, and then to classify antidepressants based on their individual mechanism of action."
"Before we get started in some of the discussion of the actual antidepressants,"
"Yes, art is a great source of inspiration for a lot of other areas such as leadership for one discovers's what artists can ... see, I called it in my dissertation titled ""Events and body shells"".."
"I called it ""translokutionaritet"" which means ""I know only what I mean, when I hear what I say"" it can be compared with .. now, you're a artist painter, right?"
"And when you start to paint, take the picture takes over, right? and paints for you ... that's also ""translokutionaritet"", right? but the importance of companies and processes ... when you get something going, you'll be able to learn from it and be able to change course and think ""What the hell is that I've got going on here"" and ""Hey, this can become something better and much different and stronger and bigger"" and all that experience has"
Martin:
"But I also think about.. ehrm ... if you believe that this artistic process, in which one is has the need to open a lot more for the deap values ​​in oneself can help managers to take some more humane decisions?"
Ole:
"Well, I think it is important for two reasons.."
"Firstly, because the leaders are forced to make innovation not just make new products and services but also change the organization in a certain way and also do so in a humanist way, right? so therefore in every way in a world where art really is commercialized and remooved from the ideal of the work as something substantial and as a messenger from the other side then yet it is as if the positivity of art is foaming and flowing on to other worlds while parts of the art just becomes ""installation art"" or Damien Hirst over again."
"A laugh, right?"
"So speculative art.. and yet, the hole artistic way to be which throughout history has been characterized by that in art, the human values is realized as well as the existential problems, right"
"Thats what the artists expresses and it also starts a need to express both the existential and the valuational flowing on to almost, one might say, the banal sphere of the economy, in technology"
"look at the design, look at ... in general ... we become much more artistic because we become much more spiritual"
"I think so, I see it!"
Martin:
"I sometimes think about the invention of conceptual artists which of course doesn't really have a piece it is a sign that the idea of ​​a work piece, at a very high level of professionalism and craftsmanship, are disappearing in benefit that some of the things might leak out among us?"
"Because you can say, if we had the artistic way of expressing ourselves at the moment and with each other, we wouldn't need so many works of art.."
Ole:
"And that was what I tried to say.. to dealing with other people ... both in communication and in private life, by all means but also, from managers to employees and back again ... can be an art the arts also means that you master and that you can"
"Martin: and it is very exciting, I think."
Ole:
"So what I tryed to say was, I don't think the dream of arts ever dies because the works'll retain there power and force if those that redeems it is good enough it'll launch itself.. but there will not be as many of them as they are more spread out in the sence you said it, and I really like that."
"Holes are made in the art into real life, right? which leaks out a warmth and a force to become a much more artistic expression"
Martin:
"And I know this is something you use together with Peter Hanke, the conductor"
Ole:
"I have, yes. and a conductor's also a leader, right?"
Does it have anything to do with that?
Ole:
"Yes oh yes, to put it mildly."
Martin:
So I wonder ..
"Are there any others that does that around the world, since you have so much faith in a cultural awakening?"
And then personal files with no business value.
I have a little screenshot here.
You don't have to be able to read that.
But this is an example of the reports generated from the software that we ran on our shared drives.
These were all files identified that I had to review.
"It showed the file size, what the format is, and the date of last access."
This could show that these are all files that haven't been accessed for ten years.
"And so it's time to look at those and see what they are, and if they should be handled in a different way."
Reviewing and removing unwanted content could mean working with the subject matter experts.
"Once you have reports or queries generated, you can establish deadlines for when the subject matter experts should review the files."
It could mean scheduling meetings to review the files as a group.
And then documenting lessons learned to assist in developing future policies and procedures.
"In our experience, we ran queries and produced reports."
And then they were sent out for individuals to review.
And they could identify unwanted content.
Also we found that meeting with stakeholders was a quick way to identify content and tag it for removal or further followup.
"Once it's all cleaned up, then it's time to work with the subject matter experts to identify and review any remaining plans."
"This means identifying records, applying appropriate dispositions, and filing them appropriately according to their case files or disposition authorities."
Also developing a standardized folder directory structure.
And then implementing an office level file plan.
And then executing any disposition actions in accordance with NARA-approved record schedules.
"So in developing the day-forward policies and procedures to maintain and organize shared drives, these are some of the steps to take for maintenance activities on an ongoing basis."
Configuring the network to attribute file properties correctly.
This is one step that would mean working with IT to make sure everything's happening as it should.
Developing maintenance strategies.
"This could mean running periodic queries, doing the maintenance of figuring out what's coming up and what could be candidates for deletion or for other cleanup."
Also some agencies find it helpful to do annual or semi-annual cleanup days.
This could be a designated time set aside for people to go through their files and get them cleaned up.
Then implementing the folder structure and naming conventions.
Developing the written guidance and reference materials for shared drive users.
"And as always, providing training for staff once they've been able to look at the guidance and answer any questions that they have."
And then the maintenance and updates of the shared drive could be included as an item in internal records program reviews.

The price per gallon.
The price per gallon is measured in dollars over gallons.
"And this makes perfect sense if we think about what quantities we're using to calculate this slope on this graph. y here, stands for the total price of solution, which is, of course, measured in dollars."
"And x here, stands for the number of gallons of solution that Grant has bought, or is willing to buy."
And that's measured in gallons.
"We know that slope is equal to the change in y over the change in x, which is, just as we found here, dollars over gallons."
"Boing Boing teamed up with Institute for the Future and Sun Microsystems to create the Digital Open, an online tech expo for teens 17 and under around the world."
"Now, meet one of the winners."
"I'm Brennon Williams, I'm 15 years old, and I live in Burlingame, California."
BW Science Labs has been in the making for about 2 years.
It started out as just a way for me to document my research and all of my projects and it really just grew from there.
Here I have a very old computer that I just bought from my friend for $5.
"And usually, this would be useless, but the reason why I'm using it is because it will make a brilliant server."
"As a little project, I coded my own server in Python."
"I started programming when I was about 10 or 11, in several languages."
"So, my love has really grown from there."
"I used microcontrollers like the BASlC Stamp, but now I'm more of a PlCAXE programming kind of a guy."
I can't live without a soldering station.
I use it to wire-- to solder joints together in circuity.
"If I'm building a robot or just, you know, making LEDs blink,"
I need my soldering station.
"It's incredible to me that you can take bits of copper and silicone and plastic and put them together to simulate something that's autonomous, that can think for itself, that can interact with its environment."
"So this is kind of how I started out, piecing together things."
And this is one of my latest robots...
There we go.
"One of the biggest problems with today's generation is that, one, we're not science literate, and we need our generation to be inspired more."
"Because if you look at the heroes of the younger generation today, they're mainly rappers and musicians, and people who wouldn't really inspire kids to go out and create."
"If you start out from something basic, and you think, Wow this is a really cool device, or robot, or whatever that I've built, and then you can put the plans out, and someone maybe who's smarter than you or just as curious as you can modify them and make it even cooler and have even more benefits."
"I mean, if we didn't have open-source technology, [sighs]"
"I have no idea-- well, I wouldn't be here,"
Determined physicists believe they are now on the brink... of uncovering the ultimate mysteries of the universe.
Why look for these parallel universes that we can't touch?
Because they hold the secret of secrets.
They hold the secret of the origin of everything there is.
"For the first time, we can imagine where our universe itself came from."
Perhaps when our universe popped into existence... colliding with another parallel universe... perhaps budding from another universe... these are the stuff of modern research today: pre-Big Bang physics.
Physics before Genesis.
But there is a problem.
"For decades, scientists have been searching... for one cohesive theory of everything... one to unite Einstein's theory of general relativity... which explains how gravity works over large scales... with quantum physics, the science of the tiniest matter."
"Together, these two great theories explain... everything humanity knows so far about the cosmos."
But like a cartoon cat and mouse...
They are at war with one another.
These two theories hate each other.
"They're completely inconsistent, incompatible."
No way to understand in today's world... a quantum version of general relativity.
How can we get a shotgun marriage... between these two theories that don't like each other?
"Bringing those together would give you... a theory of everything in the sense... that those are the ingredients you would need, I think... to understand the Big Bang... to understand the origin of the universe."
"When, in the 1980s, scientists came up with... a lyrical-sounding idea, string theory... it promised to solve all the mysteries of the universe... including whether or not parallel universes are real."
The idea is that all particles are not solid points or dots... as science said they were.
"Instead, if you could see up close... particles are, in fact, tiny string-like objects... that individually vibrate in various ways."
"String theory starts out... by taking the idea of a string which vibrates... giving rise to different particles, and doing physics with that."
"That's rather musical, in a way."
It's like using guitar and bass in a band... to generate different notes from vibrations of strings.
As scientists explored string theory more closely... they made a remarkable discovery.
We found that it wasn't just strings... that were involved in the physics... but also membranes and other extended objects... which could vibrate.
And that's rather like enlarging the band... to have drums and other instruments... which enrich the sound... and really broaden the repertoire of things that could be played.
String theory has now evolved into what is called...
"""M"" or membrane theory."
"So now we realize that the particles we see in nature, the universe itself... consists of vibrating membranes and vibrating strings."
"The crowning achievement of M-theory came... when scientists realized that, to make sense of everything... you need to think of the universe as existing in 11 dimensions."
"If you're sitting on a mountaintop... and you look down, you can see all the separate little villages... that are not unified at all."
"But from a mountaintop, you look at a coherent, whole, beautiful picture."
Emacs versus vi?
Better?
So vi has a tremendous number of mode errors because you are in either insertion mode or command mode.
"And I say it has the mode errors, because you could blame the user."
"I mean, it is their job to maintain state in their head of what's going on."
"But maybe they got an email or something, things are distracting them, they're thinking about their day."
"Next thing you know, they're entering commands when they want to be entering text."
It's a classic example of a mode error.
"Another example, you're in your car, put the car in reverse, it checks on messages, then floor it."
"You don't have that mental state of what mode the car was it right then, or even just if your garage door is up or down, the occasional mode error."
"So to avoid these, you want to make sure that your application doesn't have modes unless absolutely necessary."
"And if you do have a mode, there's a couple ways to fix it."
"If you have a mode where the user is actually actively doing something, it's considerably more useful."
"So like keyboard shortcuts, you have that muscle memory of sort of pushing the key in, as you're in the Command mode, once the keyboard shortcut accelerator is invoked, so you're not going to have mode errors because you're actually doing something."
If you have a very strong visual change on the screen during a mode-- imagine there was something obvious to indicate this was in Command mode-- that would help.
"But generally speaking, you want to try to avoid modes as much as possible, because otherwise you're going to have mode errors."
"Next one, reasonably obvious, data loss."
"It's often the user's fault, you want to protect them from themselves."
Google Docs does a really good job with preventing data loss where it's reasonably hard to lose data with Google Docs.
"You have to sort of type the most important thing in the world, pull the ethernet cable, and knock the computer off a cliff all in one gesture, and it's hard."
"Android phones, also really useful, where all the data on the phone is going to be backed up into the cloud and secured in your account, so you're not going to lose all of that really important information."
So that's just some examples of preventing data loss.
Also really important as people move between devices is to have access to information.
And those are major cases.
"Also, you have to worry about minor data loss, which is, you did a change and you want to undo it."
It is really important to support undo across all the various actions in your application to help prevent users from making these mistakes.
So that covers preventing errors.
"Now finally, making users fast."
"Obviously, speed is something Google cares deeply about, and it's not just true of how things operate, but also how the user operates."
So the first thing I want to talk about is visual hierarchy.
"Computer science obviously focuses a lot on trees, the various algorithms you can apply on trees, and B trees, and [? black ?] trees and binary trees, and all these various things, and breath for a search versus depth for a search, and actually, it doesn't just apply to computation."
"Like obviously, if you're caching data, you want data that users access the most to be higher in the hierarchy, so you have the least number of hops to get to it, a very common thing with computing."
"I assure you if you wait long enough, eventually it will tell you that the recursion effectively overflowed."
So it is trying to compute this unbounded number of routes in the recursive part of the with statement and never even gets to the query that we want to execute.
"OK, here's my first attempt at fixing the problem."
We know that we're never going to want to take a arbitrarily long route.
We're never going to want to go around a cycle lots of times as our cheapest way to get from point A to point
"B so what I've done here, and I'm not going to go into this in great detail, but I have added a condition in the recursion that says ""I'm only going to add a new route, a new route into my recursively defined route table when the total cost of that route, and that's defined as the cost plus total here when we added, is less then all of the ways we can already get from that place, to that origin to that destination."
"So in other words, I'm only going to add cheaper routes than the ones that are already there."
"And by the way, if there are no routes already from the origin to the destination then this will be satisfied and we will add that first route, then after that only adding cheaper ones."
So let's try running this query and see what happens.
"Well, we got an error."
Now this is not a runtime execution error.
This is actually an error that says we're not allowed to refer to our recursively defined relation in a sub query within our recursion.
"The SQL standard actually might allow this particular use, but"
I don't know that any implementation actually handles it.
It can be fairly difficult to handle a case where you have the recursively defined relation in a subquery as well as in the outer query here.
So that's obviously not going to solve our problem.
Now there's actually a feature of
Basic SQL that can help us here with our problem.
There's something called Limit.
"We actually didn't discuss this in the SQL videos, but that says just give us this number of results."
"So let's say that we're going to have our recursion here for the roots, but down here we're going to say I only need up to 20 results for how"
I get from point A to point B. And the posary system actually makes use of the limit command in the final query to restrict the recursion.
"It's a nice feature, and it was added specifically for this problem of possibly infinite recursions where we actually don't want it to be infinite because we only need a finite number of answers."
"Okay, so, let's go with that here and we'll see that Ah, great."
Everything worked well.
"We got our roots from A to B. And I do have 20 roots, I mean, so they're getting very expensive."
Down here I'm going to go around and around the mid west while lots and lots of times but that did the limit the recursion it did stop unlike our query where we didn't have the limit and it just went on indefinitely.
"So that looks pretty good, with one unfortunate problem, which is if we still want the minimum, we're going to again get a infinite execution."
"So the old result is still sitting here but now the system is chunking on because the limit here is applied to this min to the number of tupimit the recursion, we're always going to get only one tuple in our result."
"So even if we said limit one here, we'd still get the infinite behavior, so we haven't quite solved our problem."
"Okay, so, here's what we're going to do."
"Aesthetically, maybe it's not the absolutely best solution but"
"Well, I subtracted those two numbers and I didn't get the numbers that they had in the text."
I didn't get anything close.
"So, it was like, huh, Well I, I'm totally confused here."
"And then even worse, they calculated percentages also from table two and, and they came up with totally different percentages than I did."
"So since it's simple arithmetic, I'm thinking that they used different numbers to calculate the figures and text than they did for the tables and figures and that raises a big red flag."
"Why are those numbers, why don't they match?"
"And then I've also seen the case where so numbers in one table are figured don't match, this, this what's suppose to be similar number in another table, I figure."
"So, the very common case of that you will have some numbers at a table and then somebody will also present those numbers in a graphic."
"And if I kind of look at the graphic and try to figure out the exact values in the graphic and then I look at those numbers in the table, those often don't match."
"So again, it raises all sorts of red flags and I don't know exactly why these kinds of, things happen."
It might just be human error.
"It might be that people are using different iterations of the data set, But all of those things, raise real red flags for a reviewer, especially, a statistical reviewer."
So you want to make sure that you are consistent throughout your paper and that those things match.
"And then, the final thing to think about is your references and you wanna find out and kind of nature you pay attention to whether or not you have what I call references to nowhere."
"And these are references that when you go to the reference,"
If you're reading the paper and then you go to the reference to try to find the information that the authors indicate is available in that reference.
"In fact, it turns out that, that information is not there."
And I have to tell you that I do a lot of this for various reasons.
I end up wanting to get the information from the original source.
And I go back from a reference from a paper I'm reading.
I go back to the paper they've indicated is the citation and it's more often than not the case that the reference does not if fact provide the indicated information or fact that what the authors are saying in their paper it provides.
"So this is the rule, not the exception."
"So you should know that,"
So that you don't end up accidentally citing somebody's mistaken citation.
So there's a number of reasons this might happen.
So often times authors will sort of misinterpret or exaggerate the findings from the original source.
"If you go back to the original reference, it turns out that they were selective in the information that they chose to cite in their paper."
"Or they're, they're referencing a paper to back up a particular statement and that statement is not exactly supported by the original reference."
It might be supported in some roundabout way but not directly.
"So oftentimes, those sources really don't back up the statements that the authors are writing in their paper where they are citing the source."
"Another really, really common problem is that the reference that the authors have cited actually is a secondary source and it's not the primary source."
I call this citation propagation and I'm going to talk about a little more.
(Video) John Reganold:
"Soils have parents, just like we have parents, so they came from somewhere."
And soils form from some material that's in a particular location.
"So in this location, we had wind-blown sediments that came in, and you have these loose sediments that are mostly silt-sized particles called loess - L-O-E-S-S, with some clay and some sand, and then soil formed."
That kind of material is transported.
It's transported parent material because it came in by the wind.
Other types of parent material can come in by the water.
"You can have rivers that overflow, like along the Mississippi, they deposit alluvium."
"Water rushes out of a mountain range, it might drop a lot of material,"
like an alluvial fan.
"When they deposit that material, new soils form in that material."
And then we also have glacially-transported material - soils that formed in glacial sediment.
"When those glaciers melt, they drop the material."
We also have soils that are not transported.
We have soils that form in place.
"Right where we're standing now, we're on a butte, kind of an old mountain range."
"This particular mountain, the soils formed from rock in place."
"It was exposed; after probably a million years, we had a soil that actually formed in that rock."
"So transported soils - rough to say,"
I'm guessing 70-75% of our soils formed in transported parent material.
Then another 25% formed in soils that are in place.
A lot of those are up in the mountains.
Fred Kirschenmann:
"OK, so it's taken millions of years for nature to accumulate this soil."
"Now, there's another problem: that is, that we're losing soil now at even faster rates, primarily because as climate change is coming into the picture, we have more severe weather events."
"So this was what a lot of the landscape looked like in the heartland where we have some of the richest soil in the spring of 2008 when we had two weeks of incredibly heavy rainfalls, and this is what we saw on the landscape out there, so we've been losing that soil now, and it's threatened at a much, much faster rate even than we have in the past."
"So now it's easy to simply blame the farmers, and say,"
"""Well, look, the farmers ought to be better stewards, they ought to take better care of this,"" but the point is that we have all been part of creating a food system that puts farmers in the position where they have to do simply one thing, and that is, produce as much of the food as cheaply as possible."
"And so what they do now, what they have been put into a position to do, is to concentrate the animals in one place as we've heard about earlier today, because that is presumably a more efficient way to produce meat, and, our crops are now produced in these huge monocultures, because again, it's a more efficient way to produce food in as cheap a way as possible, so the landscape now looks like this."
So we don't have any of that diversity that's a part of a necessity of creating that biologically healthy soil that actually feeds all of that living community beneath the surface of the soil.
"Now fortunately - you could be tired of hearing me talk about all the problems - there is some good news, because we do know that there are alternatives."
"A friend of mine, Matt Liebman, who is an agronomist at Iowa State University, has now done eight years of research in which he has simply looked in these research plots as a simple thing."
Okay?
And then the alternative could be the mean return is not equal to two percent per month.
"And this might be interesting if you have a, a, an expected return target."
"So, suppose you're saving, you know, for some particular purchase."
"And that savings, you know, you need to hit a certain amount of money, you know, say, in a year from now."
"And, in order for your savings to grow to hit that target, you need to have on average two percent per month."
"So you might be interested in screening all your assets and seeing which of those, you know, satisfy that particular condition."
So that would be one example why you might wanna test something like this.
You could also test whether or not the volatility of your acid is equal to a particular value.
"So this is like saying I'm gonna test the hypothesis that the volatility on, you know, Microsoft stock is ten percent per month."
"And, you know, again, why might you wanna do such a hypothesis?"
Well my experience in doing risk management for Black Rock is that when you
"look at portfolio managers and, you know, they have particular portfolios that they're managing, you might have a risk target on the portfolio."
"So you're going to market this portfolio to clients, and you want a and the clients you know they pick different portfolios in some respects based upon their risk characteristics."
"So you might say, you know, I have a target risk on my portfolio to be ten percent per month, right?"
"And then you're gonna look at the historical performance of that portfolio, and see, did you actually hit that risk target?"
"So that could be a reason why you might want to test the hypothesis that a volatility is equal to a particular value, okay?"
"And then another kind of hypothesis you might wanna test is that, the correlation between two, two stocks."
"So the correlation between, say, Microsoft and the S and P 500, you know, is .2, or something like that."
"And you know, again, you're interested in, you know, a particular value of a correlation?"
"Now, when we study portfolio theory we'll see that correlation is very important in terms of the diversification properties of your portfolio."
"And so, and, and in general the less correlated the assets in the portfolio the better the diversification properties."
So if you want to create a highly diversified portfolio you might want to screen your assets such that they have correlation values that are low.
"And so you might use a hypothesis test as a screening device, to say, I wanna test hypothesis that."
"Say I wanna put assets in my portfolio that have a correlation of point, say, two or lower."
"And so then, you might be able to use a hypothesis testing approach, to determine which assets satisfy that criteria."
"So that's, testing for a sp-, particular value."
"Sometimes, you wanna test for a sign."
"So when we look at these hypotheses here, notice that the alternative hypotheses are two sided."
I'm testing that the mean is equal to a particular value.
And the alternative is that it's not equal to a particular value.
Sometimes we're particularly interested in the sum.
"Or they'll do it in a really good way until the investors come, and then they do it the bad way."
What actually happened in this case is the way we got to b was they both went after the
"length at the same time, so they both ended up wanting to store the value into the same cell."
The one that went last won the race.
This is really bad.
There's no integrity in this program now.
"This is the kind of bug that's really impossible to find, because you can look at the source and you can't see any way that says what happened to a."
I can see the statement 'a went into there'.
Very few people are able to think in the multi-dimensional way you need to be able to to work this out.
"It's impossible to have application integrity when you're subject to race conditions, so you have to prevent the races from happening."
Fortunately there are mechanisms for doing that -- it's called mutual exclusion.
There are several famous techniques that are all somewhat equivalent.
"Some have better expressive capabilities than others, but they all do the same thing, which is to try to prevent two threads from getting at the same memory at the same time and causing this kind of problem."
"This used to be operating system stuff, but unfortunately it has leaked into applications because of networking, because you now need to be able to go off to someplace where you may have to wait a long time before you can get a response back."
"And also because of the multi-core problem; we don't know how to make CPUs go faster anymore, so the way we go faster is by having more of them, which turns it from a hardware problem -- which is what it should have been -- into a software problem."
"So now in order to make your application go faster, your application has to take advantage of threads, and nobody knows how to do that well, particularly at the application level."
"Under mutual exclusion only one thread can be executing a critical section at a time — all the other threads that are waiting on that section are blocked, and cannot proceed until it's released."
"Now, if threads don't interact then the program runs at full speed, and everything is great."
"But if they do interact, then races will occur unless mutual exclusion is employed."
"But there's another problem that comes from that, and that's deadlock."
"Here we have Gaston and Alphonse, two threads who are both employing the same mechanism, which is 'I will go after he does.' Neither can go, and so they're deadlocked."
It turns out that this is a remarkably easy thing to do when you're dealing with threads.
Deadlock occurs when threads are waiting on each other.
Races and deadlocks are just really difficult to reason about.
There are very few people in the world who can reason about them effectively.
"My belief -- I mean this sincerely -- is that they should all be enslaved and made to work on operating systems, and that nobody else should have to go near this stuff, because it's just way too complicated."
"These are the most difficult problems in software development to identify, debug and correct."
Managing sequential
"logic, which is what we do, is really hard."
"Managing multi-dimensional temporal logic is really, really hard, and you should not be doing it at the application level."
It's just wrong.
"Getting back to our con list, it turns out there's overhead in dealing with threads."
So that's natural mapping.
"Basically, natural mapping is correctly abstracted layout."
But even better than natural mapping is direct manipulation.
"So especially in touch interfaces, you don't want to have abstraction if you don't need it."
"You don't necessarily need little Close buttons on things because you're able to literally directly touch the interface, whereas in the world of mice and keyboards, you had to have this type of abstraction."
"So for instance, closing an open application on Android, you're just swiping it away, just as you would get rid of something in the real world, and that's a consistent affordance throughout platform."
"So going back to the stove example, what would direct manipulation of a stove corner look like?"
"This is, of course, kind of curious because now the dial is the burner and it's going to light on fire, but you can imagine maybe some kind of gesture, or like, you create fire, or you put it out."
"It would be at least very exciting, and you'd never be confused over which dial, because you'd have direct gestural control over the burner."
"So that's the fourth one, direct manipulation, no abstraction, you actually act on the objects themselves."
Then the fifth one is metaphor.
So metaphor shows up a lot in application icons.
"Basically, what you're trying to do is you're trying to bootstrap off of something the user's seen, either in the real world or in the sort of introductory phase of our crazy experiment."
"So things like telephones, maps, various real world objects, helps kind of frame them and ground them in something in reality to explain what the application does."
And you don't have to go too far with this.
"It's enough to just kind of give them the cue as opposed to having stitching or something in your application, unless you want to do that because you think it looks nice."
"You don't have to be super literal, but at least draw that kind of distinction of, this is the object that I'm conveying to you."
"And it's not just application icons, but also it's sometimes more fundamental things, like we're just used to having a"
"light source which is above us, the sun just shining in the sky all the time, and the way that conveys light."
"So when you see a button, that light source is conveying to you that this thing is convex and you can make it concave."
It looks like you can push it in.
"So it's just that kind of quick, interactive affordance that you're getting through your experience with the real world through that metaphor."
And also not just small widgets but larger ones.
"You know, a tab."
"If you have that sort of same curvature and angle, people are going to be immediately thinking of physical folders they've seen in the real world."
So major structural components are going to be part of your interface as well.
So metaphor is basically abstract consistency.
So those are the five parts about making it self-describing.
"So let's move onto the next one, which is preventing errors."
So the first one I want to talk about is mode errors.
"Obviously, engineering audience, so how many people think vi is better than Emacs?"
"Actually not that many, all right."
You may have done this when you were in high school.
"If you haven't, it's a lot of fun, and I suggest trying it out."
"And what you can do with an egg drop device, is you're building a contraption that will protect an egg from a fall."
"Here we threw one out my third-story office window and, lo and behold, the egg survives."
And we tested a whole bunch of people in variance of this design and people come up with all sorts of stuff.
"They come up with good ideas, and bad ideas, and creative solutions, and really unimaginative ones."
"And one thing that is really interesting is that, in aggregate, people often pick one idea early on, and they stick with it to their detriment."
And so here is a couple participants talking about that experience.
"(No, I don't know, for some reason this is... this seems to be the only idea, in that there needs to be a platform and then it's going to cushion, if possible, with the materials."
I...
"I don't see any, any other way. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm not a very good outside-the-box thinker, so I kind of just had one idea and I was going to try and make it work. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I kind of went with the whole parachute idea, and what I had from the beginning."
So. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is the best approach for such a design.)
"What we see here is an example of what Karl Duncker called ""functional fixation."""
"In a number of experiments that he ran in the 1940""s he gave people tasks like this:"
"""Attach the candle to the wall such that none of the wax drips on the table."""
"Ten, twenty percent of the people figured it out."
Take a moment and see if you can figure it out.
"The solution — as a couple of you have got, but I bet many people didn't — is to take the box that holds the tacks and use that as a container for the candle."
That will protect the wax from dripping on the table.
"And what's interesting about this is that, because the tacks are in a box, we don't see the box."
"If you give people the exact same set up, where the tacks are outside the box, all of a sudden the box becomes obviously available as a resource and nearly everybody solves exactly the same problem."
So Stephen and I set off and tried to figure out whether we could augment people's design process to get them to explore more alternatives.
"And one of the things that we did, is we forced people to come up with multiple alternatives in parallel."
"We call this parallel prototyping, and in this particular study we had people design graphical advertisements for the web."
"So, we're going to put people in one of two conditions:"
"You're either going to be in a serial condition, where you iteratively create six prototypes from start to finish; or in a parallel condition, where you create three alternatives, get feedback, create two more, get feedback, and then make a final one."
"I should clarify that the amount of time that was available was exactly the same in both conditions, and in both conditions people got exactly the same amount of feedback."
The only difference is when and how they got it.
"And, again, people come up with all sorts of stuff:"
"Creative ideas and crummy ideas, well executed and poorly executed, and, overall, we're able to measure, using web analytics, the click-through rate that people clicked on these advertisements."
"And so, over the past several years, we've run millions of advertisements out on the web."
"And what we see, in aggregate, is that participants who got a parallel design medicine — who were forced to create multiple alternatives in parallel — had a higher click-through rate:"
"And we state that we will accept material that is of diplomatic, political, ethical, or historical significance that has not been published previously, that is not been self-authored, so it's official documents, that is under some kind of restriction."
"Provided that is met, we publish, after a harm-minimization review."
So we guarantee to publish.
"And that has kept us impartial in the same way, not perfectly, but in the same way that courts are kept impartial by saying that, provided you meet certain initial criteria, the court will hear your case."
"Provided our sources meet certain initial criteria, because we can't do everything, we're not big enough, we will try and get public opinion to hear the case."
"Now, the sort of misapprehension that we concentrate on the US military is simply because that's what people in English like to talk about."
"They don't like to talk about the work we've been doing in Kenya, they don't like to talk about the work that we do East Timor, they don't like to talk about the work we do in Spanish or in South America."
They like to talk about the US military.
"And there is no doubt, as the largest military power in the world whose military spending is greater than that of all other countries combined and has an extensive secrecy system, that the US military is an important player of those groups that are trying to conceal information that would lead to political reform if it was revealed."
"On FOX recently, a FOX host, or rather a FOX panelist said, ""Well, Wikileaks wouldn't be too bad, you know, if they actually ever did non-military reporting."
"Why don't they talk about tobacco, as an example?"
"If they only spoke about tobacco, they might be a legitimate organization."
"But because they speak about the US military only they are not a legitimate organization."""
"So, I had a look."
"Go to our search box and type in ""tobacco"" and you'll see hundreds of reports about tobacco companies and how tobacco is managed around the world."
Those are simply not things that are so dramatically newsworthy that people want to talk about them so much.
And your second question was ...
If you care about how you get the information.
Oh yea.
Quite interesting.
"Now, one of the Pentagon demands was that we stop, and the exact phraseology was that we stop soliciting material from government sources in the United States."
"Now, we had a look to see, on our submission page, was there soliciation in that sense?"
There wasn't in any concrete sense.
"So, within United States jurisprudence, solicitation is, you sort of have to ... asking someone for a particular document as an example."
And we don't do that.
We say we provide an avenue.
"We did last year, send out an email to some 5,000 members of the US military saying we could help them with the False Claims Act, a federal act in the US that helps discover fraud against the government."
"And there's a lot of fraud by miltary contractors, so we work with a lawyer to try to expose that fraud."
"That's really very progressive legislation, that the whistleblower who reveals the fraud is entitled to between 15 and 90 percent of the fraud discovered."
"So, we sent out that email."
"But otherwise,"
"I can't think of anything else that would classify as solicitation, not that we would be against that."
"You don't even need to know any calculus, save for a single simple integral that magically pops up in the  analys of the randomized quick sort algorithm."
"I imagine that many of you have studied math in the past, but you could use a refresher, you're a bit rusty."
"And there's plenty of free resources out there on the web, and I encourage you to explore and find some that you like."
But one that
I want to particularly recommend is a great set of free lecture notes.
It's called Mathematics for Computer Science.
It's authored by Eric Lehman and Tom
"Layden, and it's quite easy to find on the web if you just do a web search."
"And those notes cover all of the prerequisites that we'll need, in addition to tons of other stuff."
"In the spirit of keeping this course as widely accessible as possible, we're keeping the required supporting materials to an absolute minimum."
Lectures are meant to be self-contained and we'll always provide you with the lecture notes in PowerPoint and PDF format.
"Once in a while, we'll also provide some additional"
lecture notes.
No textbook is required for this class.
"But that said, most of the material that we'll study is well covered in a number of excellent algorithms books that are out there."
So I'll single out four such books here.
The first three I mention because they all had a significant influence on the way that I both think about and teach algorithms.
So it's natural to acknowledge that debt here.
"One very cool thing about the second book, the one by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani, is that the authors have made a version of it available online for free."
"And again, if you search on the authors' names and the textbook title, you should have no trouble coming up with it with a web search."
"Similarly, that's the reason I've listed the fourth book because those authors have likewise made essentially a complete version of that book available online and it's a good match for the material that we're going to cover here."
"If you're looking for more details about something covered in this class, or simply a different explanation than the one that I give you, all of these books are gonna be good resources for you."
There are also a number of excellent algorithm textbooks that I haven't put on this list.
"I encourage to explore and find you own favorite. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; In our assignments, we'll sometimes ask you to code up an algorithm and use it to solve a concrete problem that is too large to solve by hand."
"Now, we don't care what program and language and development environment you use to do this as we're only going to be asking you for the final answer."
"Thus, we're not requiring anything specific, just that you are able to write and execute programs."
"If you need help or advice about how to get set up with a suitable coding environment, we suggest that you ask other students for help via the course discussion forum."
"Finally, let's talk a bit more about assessment."
"Now this course doesn't have official grades per se, but we will be assigning weekly homeworks."
Now we're going to assign homeworks for three different reasons.
The first is just for self-assessment.
It's to give you the opportunity to test your understanding of the material so that you can figure out which topics you've mastered and which ones that you haven't.
What's the probability if each of them makes the defect with a one percent likelihood?
"Well, the likelihood of us making a defect at the very end is simply 0.1 raised to the power of three."
"If every one of them catches the defect, the redundancy kicks in and the defect is detected."
"So in order for the defect to happen here, at the end, all three of them have to go wrong."
We can then define the yield of this process as thirteen.
Minus 0.01 raised to the power of three.
"So you notice how the process flow diagram,"
A true understanding of what's happening in the process is driving how the individual defect probabilities get aggregated to an overall defect probability into the process here.
"In this session, we have discussed two examples of defects."
"In the assembly line example, we saw a situation in which a defect anywhere in the process would leave to a defective unit of flow at the end."
"In the Swiss Cheese situation, we could afford to have some mistakes in the process,"
"But due to redundancy, this would not necessarily lead to a bad unit of output."
Multiple things have to stack up in a bad way to lead to that fatal outcome.
"We've talked about how you can look at the process flow diagram, and then think about how to aggregate the individual defects, and compute an overall defect probability, and that allows you then to compute the process here."
"When improving processes like the ones we discussed, especially the Swiss Cheese situations, it's important to not just go after bad outcomes."
"Hopefully, these bad outcomes, at the end of the process, are really rare."
"Instead, you want to look at internal process variation."
This is the idea of near misses.
"It's also an idea we will see in more detail in the session on sig-, sigma."
The worst resources are those that sometimes work and sometimes they don't.
"If a resource always works and never does any defects, wonderful."
"If it is always broken, and everything the resource touches gets defective, we'll figure that out pretty quickly."
"In this session, we have used simple probability theory to describe the"
likelihood of a resource producing a defect.
We can then use defects in our understanding of the process flow diagram to describe the percentage of flow units that are produced correctly.
"We refer to that number, as the yield of an operation."
"Now, not every time, a resource does something the wrong way,"
We'll get a yield loss at the end of the process.
Some defects and internal variation are absorbed by other activities.
"There is redundance oftentimes built into the process,"
"However, understanding such deviations in the process,"
"Even if they do not lead to fatal consequences at the end of the process, is a very important point of a good quality management program."
Do you produce that?
"No, and we don't agree with that for ruminants."
"I agree with the fermentation for omnivores because in nature pigs and poultry do scratch into anaerobic layers, getting down in the soil, scratching into the anaerobic layers, and do eat ensiled, pickled type stuff."
"Herbivores never do, there's no place in nature where herbivores eat fermented anything."
"What that does, the fermentation, it changes the pH in the rumen, and makes it acidic, so not only does it make the microbes that should be..."
Cause lactic acid is being produced in there.
"Exactly, and so what it does is, it allows the E. Coli, and the things that are supposed to help that digestion become acidically acclimated."
So that if we happen to eat some it kills us instead of our acidic system killing it.
"So in some ways, some of the same downsides of eating grain."
"Exactly, very much so."
So I adhere to the rule of thumb that with herbivores silage should be looked at as kind of a condiment.
No more than maybe 10% of the diet.
"It can be done as taking a vitamin pill, or something like that, but no more than that."
"Or then you start really setting up this acidosis situation, and you deny the rumen its job of fermenting the roughage."
"The way this controlled grazing or mob grazing works, where we have them in little tight paddocks everyday, is, I am making a little ""S"" here, grass grows in an ""S"" curve."
Just like a lot of businesses.
"Well, like people!"
"So I call this down here diaper grass, this right here is teenage grass, and out here it's nursing home grass."
"OK, so our job as land stewards, is to try to keep this forage in this fast solar metabolic stage."
"We don't want to go out here, nursing home, cause then it stops."
"We don't want to be here in ""diaper"", cause then it stops."
"What we're doing is using the herbivore in its historical role as nature's pruner, to prune this back so that it can restart this fast metabolic solar conversion into biomass cycle."
"Without the herbivore, that doesn't happen, so under grazing is as bad as overgrazing."
Both of those extremes are incorrect.
It's that because it grows up and goes to seed?
"Yeah, it goes to seed and just stops, and desiccates."
"And since all that carbon dioxide goes back into the air, rather than pulling it out of the air, and sequestering it in the root system."
"Essentially, the herbivore is nature's biomass accumulation restart button."
"Just like a viticulturist would prune a vineyard, or an orchardist would prune an orchard to stimulate more verdant healthy lush production, the herbivore stimulates that verdancy by pruning the forage plants."
"In nature it's accomplished by moving, mobbing and mowing these herds of herbivores, you know, the wildebeest of the Serengeti, the cape buffalo in Botswana, the American bison, was accomplished through moving, mowing and mobbing for predator protection and moving on, and so we don't have the predators here for the cows, so we use electric fence as our steering wheel, accelerator, and gas pedal on that four legged sauerkraut vat."
"That cow is basically a portable fermentation tank, and so we are moving her day to day on this forage in biomimicry like nature does with predators and herbivores to prune back the biomass and restart this fast accumulation cycle."
"We call this mob stocking, herbivorous, solar conversion,"
How much labor do you have to give up to get another unit of capital?
Or how much capital do you have to give up to get another unit of labor?
"Now, armed with isoquants, which are like indifference curves, and these isocosts which are like budget constraints, we can then figure out what is the economically efficient combination of inputs for the firm to use."
The economically efficient combination of inputs for a given level of output.
So the economically efficient input combination for a given
"level of output is going to be determined by the tangency of the isoquant with the isocost, as you see in figure 9-2."
"Here we're going to use our same isoquant we had before, which is we're going to assume that q equals square root of k times l."
"So same production function we had before, which gave a series of isoquants last lecture."
"So basically, what we see is that the efficient-- if you want to produce a given amount of q, then basically what you're going to do is you're going to look for the tangency of that isoquant with the isocost."
And you're going to say that the efficient way to produce that is going to be to use 2 1/2 units of capital and 5 units of labor.
"It's going to say look, given the relative prices that are given to us by this budget constraint, the production technology is given to us by this production function from which we derived isoquants last time."
So the optimal combination of inputs to get this level of output is going to be 2 1/2 units of capital and 5 units of labor.
And that will produce basically square root of 12 1/2.
"So basically the quantity will be equal to the square root of 5 times 2 1/2, or the square root of 12 1/2 units of production."
"So basically, that is going to give us the efficient way to do that."
"Now, once again as always, we want to think about things intuitively, graphically, and mathematically."
Let's think about for a second the mathematics.
We know that the slope of the isoquant-- we talked last time-- the slope of the isoquant at any given point.
The isoquant slope was the marginal rate of technical substitution.
We defined that last time.
The slope of the isoquant was the marginal rate of technical substitution which is the marginal product of labor over the marginal product of capital.
And what we're saying is we want to set that marginal rate of technical substitution equal to the input costs ratio w over r.
"That's what we're saying, the efficient thing to do is to set the marginal rate of technical substitution equal to the price ratio."
That's what happens when the slopes are equal.
"Now, once again, I find it easier to rewrite this equation-- once you've developed the intuition, I find it easier to think of it this way."
"Rewrite this as the marginal product of labor over the wage, equals the marginal product of capital over the rental rate."
"What this is telling us is the efficient place is where essentially for every dollar you spent on workers, you're getting the same return as a dollar spent on machines."
The marginal product of labor over the wage is sort of the bang for buck of workers.
What are you getting for your next dollar of wage?
The marginal product of capital over r is the bang for the buck of machines.
What are you getting for your next dollar of rent?
And the efficient point is where these are equal.
"We think of that most especially in connection with the brain, but it can occur in clusters in a three-dimensional sense in other kinds of tissues as well."
"So, in our course, we don't have time to examine lots of different tissue structures, interesting though that would be."
"Instead, what has been done here is we work only on the uniform cylindrical fiber, this case does not have myelination which is a material surrounding the fiber and that makes it conduct fast and the fiber is located in an infinite volume."
These are all simplifications.
"In a certain sense, you would say, this is the simplest."
Model that incorporates all of the major structural features that must be present.
There are two good reasons for starting with this model.
"One, is that most other issue models, start from here."
People first understand how the cylindrical fiber works and then they modify it or build on it to get a more complicated structure.
The corollary is the uniform fiber model is the easiest to understand.
"So, we're trying to get the main idea of what works and we want the structure to be present but we don't want it to be so complicated, it gets in the way of gaining that initial understanding."
"So, as we go forward here and for the rest of our course, our special structure will be the uniform cylindrical fiber."
"So, blue flowers, as you know, are special flowers and here's a not very uniform and not very cylindrical Duke campus flower."
Which I took a picture of just yesterday and I thought you would enjoy seeing it.
Thank you.

The universe is flat.
The WMAP seems to show that the universe is flat.
"For some, however, the jury is still out... on the flat universe question."
"I tend to think that the universe is, in fact... a soap bubble of some sort, but it is bent so slightly that we can't see it."
"Some experts say that there are other... even more mind-boggling kinds of parallel universes out there... a level-two type parallel universe... made up of giant, cosmic soap bubbles that float in hyperspace."
Each independent bubble has within it an entire universe.
"The question is, do we all really live in a giant cosmic bubble?"
Could our universe be just one mega bubble... in a cosmic crowd of mega bubbles?
"If the sensational, level-two type parallel universe idea is right... then the true nature of the cosmos... could be even more astonishing than ever imagined."
"The amazing concept is that in the instance of creation... our universe rapidly, suddenly, and massively inflated... creating a giant cosmic soap bubble."
Our unique universe floats in a seething sea... of other super-bubbles... where bubbles can clash... and spawn baby brother and sister universes.
It's happening all the time.
"Universes are inflating, popping out... and then blowing up to these huge sizes of universes."
The medium these level-two bubbles are floating in... is what some call the bulk and others call hyperspace.
"In this new paradigm... soap bubbles can form, re-form, they can split."
It's dynamic: universes being created out of nothing... universes budding off other universes.
"Altogether, these bubbles form the level-two type parallel universe."
"And within it, there are an infinite number... of level-one type parallel universes."
The level-one and level-two universes... are all in our same one space.
There's only one space.
Then there are these different regions... which we call level-one and level-two parallel universes.
A fly-by through the level-two parallel universe... or what some also call the multiverse... would be a terrifying and spectacular experience.
"A multiverse of universes, each one popping into existence... popping out of existence, perhaps colliding with each other."
Out of calamity comes existence.
"What we call the level-two multiverse... is really best thought of as a tree or a fractal structure... where you have a region of space expanding like crazy... and spiraling off other regions... which then expand, spiraling off other regions."
And other ones can bud off of that.
"So you can get this chaotic, eternally branching set of universes... budding off from their predecessors."
An infinite set of universes in this multiverse.
The big term for this monumental process is bubble nucleation.
"Bubble nucleation is the geek-speech phrase... for the process where you have this inflating strange material... and then a little piece of it stops inflating... and causes a bubble-shaped region expanding around it... to also stop inflating... and then you create in this bubble a nice, calm region of space... where you will eventually form galaxies, stars, planets... and even people like us."
So we are the children of the bubble.
For the first time in human history... children of the bubble are peering out... and seeing on the horizon parallel universes.
"If we train our system and try to improve our linguistic model based on that, we're going to get something better."
Then we can basically do the same thing with the language model using a weakened acoustic model and then improve our language models.
The result is that we end up with a better system hopefully that become a gold standard and we can iterate from there.
"So, the message there is that there are ways to do iterative development without having human support."
"Unsupervised learning is not new, and has been done for a very long time, having a completely into a pipeline where you can do training, evaluation, tuning, entirely unsupervised without involving any human."
At least in speech-recognition that's very new and very exciting.
That's really the kind of thing that we are excited about because it really enables us to scale- models of scaling that we were not able to reach before.
"And so, while we're not yet at super-human performance"
"It's possible that, by removing that ceiling of human performance, maybe that will enable us to get to that faster, that ascent towards the actual human performance that we see."
So that was my bit of wisdom that we've been working on recently and. . . it's been a very exciting development for us and there's a little bit more in the paper that I quoted in the previous slide.
"Now, the next choice we have in agent design revolves around how adventurous he wants to be."
"One possibility is what's called the passive reinforcement learning agent-- and that can be any of these agent designs, but what passive means is that the agent has a fixed policy and executes that policy."
"But it learns about the reward function, R, and maybe the transition function, P, if it didn't already know that."
It learns that while executing the fixed policy.
So let me give you an example.
Imagine that you're on a ship in uncharted waters and the captain has a policy for piloting the ship.
You can't change the captain's policy.
"He or she is going to execute that, no matter what."
But it's your job to learn all you can about the uncharted waters.
"In other words, learn the reward function, given the actions and the state transitions that the ship is going through."
"You learn, and remember what you've learned, but that doesn't change the captain's policy-- and that's passive learning."
"Now, the alternative is called active reinforcement learning-- and that's where we change the policy as we go."
"So let's say, eventually, you've done such a great job of learning about the uncharted water that the captain says to you,"
"""Okay--I'm going to hand over control and as you learn, I'm going to allow you to change the policy for this ship."
"You can make decisions of where we're going to go next."""
"And that's good, because you can start to cash in early on your learning and it's also good because it gives you a possibility to explore."
Rather than just say:
What's the best action I can do right now?-- you can say:
What's the action that might allow me to learn something-- to allow me to do better in the future?

"I had a lot of people tell me that there was such a waiting list and it was so difficult to come on board to do this type of job, but, here I am."
"I've only been working as a flight paramedic for several years, but one of the calls we had was for C-response for a motorcycle accident with two patients down and just flying into the scene was kind of surreal because you're seeing the ambulances down there, you're seeing people scattered on the roadway"
"On landing, coming up close to the scene and seeing the providers and just being part of that whole team from the basic life support all the way up to the trauma center just kind of put it in perspective that it's, all this working together to accomplish one main goal, which is patient care."
"Schizophrenia is a condition affecting 1% of the world population, regardless of race, gender or culture."
"In Spain, with 45 million people, this means there would be 450.000 individuals with schizophrenia."
This disease is characterized by several clinical manifestations; some of the most important ones being delusions and hallucinations.
"Both of these main symptoms are called ""positive"", there are also ""negative"" ones, such as social withdrawal and loss of interest."
"Ultimately, it is caused by the overactivity of a neurotransmitter called dopamine."
"One of the most accepted hypothesis concerning the origin of schizophrenia is the alteration in brain development due to infections, which can affect us even in our mother's womb."
"The illness can become manifest during puberty and other stages of life, once this impairment in brain development has been produced, if there are certain psychosocial events such as severe stress situations."
"Fortunately, there are excellent drugs that control the symptoms of this disease, allowing many people to lead a nearly normal life."

Calculate the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 9.8 mols of solid NaOH - that's sodium hydroxide - in enough water to make 3.62 liters of solution.
"To find molarity, you take mols of solute and divide it by liters of solution."
"So to set our equation up here, we have molarity equals mols of solute, sodium hydroxide is the solute here, because it's getting dissolved in water, and we have 9.8 mols of that - divided by liters of solution, which is 3.62 liters, right here."
"So find molarity - 9.8, divided by 3.62."
"Round the answer to 2 significant figures, because I have 9.8 up here, and I get 2.7."
What should the units be for this?
"When we find molarity, the final answer is in units of molar - M - 2.7 molar."
"But what 2.7 molar really means is that there are 2.7 mols of NaOH, of the solute, for every one liter of the solution."
"So 2.7 molar, but don't forget that means 2.7 mols for each 1 liter of this solution up here."
You dissolve 152.5 grams of CuCl2 - that's copper chloride - in water to make a solution with a final volume of 2.25 liters.
What is its molarity?
"So for molarity, as you know, we want to take mols of solute, divide it by liters of solution."
"CuCl2, copper chloride, is our solute in this case, because it's getting dissolved in the water."
But the problem doesn't tell us how many mols of copper chloride we have.
It tells us how many grams of copper chloride we have.
"We see weight gain with this drug, and we can see significant weight gain with this drug."
"So, anywhere, you know, up to 20 pounds is not uncommon."
"We'll talk about that in the next slides, showing you a little bit further how it happens."
"Dry mouth, constipation; there's no sexual side effect because, again, we're kind of targeting and directing exactly where we want the serotonin to go."
"And oftentimes, it's due to this unique action, we can use this as a good augmentation strategy if we need to."
"So, it's something to think about in that aspect to kind of kick-start the brain again."
"So, let's kind of show you what this Remeron kind of direction is showing in terms of how we're directing some of these serotonin receptors."
"So we're blocking 2A, we get this anxiolytic response, we get this sedating response, and we don't get any sexual side effects there."
"We're not letting any serotonin get to 2C, we get that anxiolytic calming, but we get some weight gain."
"And that can also be described as how the weight gain occurs is to, it interferes with the brain's ability to get the message from serotonin that it's full."
"So patients need to be aware that they may not feel physically full quickly, so they may end up consuming more food."
"We see that blocking at the third serotonin receptor, 5HT3, so we don't see a lot of nausea or GI distress."
"So this is, again, those initiation side effects of nausea, vomiting, and things like that are not a problem with Mirtazapine."
"And the last thing that when you put in that histamine, anti-histamine effect with Mirtazapine, you get some drowsiness and also some added weight gain to be aware of."
"The next group of medicines in the dual action are the S2 antagonists, and we're just gonna touch on these from a broad spectrum, because the utility in the actual anti-depressant realm is not very strong anymore."
Nefazadone is limited in use.
There's a black box warning on liver failure.
The manufacturer actually no longer makes the brand name.
There are still generic products out there.
But you have to be very careful with the monitoring aspect.
"Like Remeron, this kind of targets where it wants serotonin to go, so you do not get any sexual side effects."
"But again, because of that, even though you have that benefit, all the other consequences of the liver damage really limit its use."
"This was much more of a sedating, calming antidepressant when it was being used."
"But, again, not out there."
"The other limitation with it is there's a lot of drug interactions with the medicine, so even before they pulled the brand name, we didn't see it a lot."
"And then, Trazadone, also in the same class of antidepressants, too, is not clinically being used as an antidepressant anymore."
"Because of this potent histamine activity, we're primarily seeing this being used for insomnia, rather than depression."
"So if you see patients on Trazadone, it's not that they're - when we start talking about how to handle refractory patients and combination therapy, that they're on a combination product."
"They're actually just getting it for sleep, and they're using it in much lower doses than the antidepressant doses."
"We need to just kind of touch on St. John's Wort, an herbal product, has an active ingredient of hypericum."
"Mechanistically we kind of go around in circles, but right now it's kind of thought to be similar to an SSRl."
You need to be careful with drug interactions with this drug.
"Remember 2 to the power of n minus 1 is the size of the bet on the nth game, so therefor these are our winnings at time n, if we win for the first time on the nth bet."
"If you actually compute this sum, just using the, the formula for summing a geometric series, remember it's a to the 1 minus r to the power of n, all over 1 minus r, that's the general formula."
"In this case, this translates to 1 times 1 minus 2 to the power of n minus 1 divided by 1 minus 2, and that is equal to 2 to the power of n minus 1 minus 1, which is what we have here."
"So W n, if we win for the first time on the nth bet, is equal to minus 2 to the n minus 1 minus 1, plus 2 to the n minus 1, this term cancels with this term and we're left With 1."
"Thereafter of course, we're always left with 1 because we stop playing the game as soon as we win."
"So the other situation that can arise, is that we have not yet won after n bets, in that case, the winnings, Wn is equal to minus 1 plus 2 and so on up to 2 to the n minus 1."
"It's 2 to the n minus 1 because we also lost the nth bet, so in fact this is a minus, this becomes a minus down here, and we get this quantity here, we sum it up and we get a sum of minus 2 to the n plus 1."
"So therefore these are the two possible values of Wn, 1 and minus 2 to the power of n plus 1."
"To show Wn as a martingale, we only need to show the following, that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn, is equal to"
Wn.
And this follows by an iterated expectations argument.
"And the reason is as follows, suppose we want to calculate the expected value of Wn plus 2 given Wn."
"Well in that case, we can write this as the following, the expected value of the expected value of Wn plus 2, given Wn plus 1, all given Wn."
"Now this term inside here, is equal to Wn plus 1 by this result here."
"So by star, with n equals m plus 1, so by evaluating star but not taking n equals m plus 1 we get that this inner expectation here equals Wn plus 1."
"So therefore, this is equal to the expected value of Wn plus 1, given wn and of course, this is equal to Wn again by star."
"So in fact, for any value of little n, we can show that this result holds, just using this iterated expectations argument we did here."
"So all we need to do to show that Wn is martingale, is to establish star, and that's what we'll do now."
There are two cases to consider.
The first case is where Wn equals 1.
"Recall, we have shown that Wn can only take on two values, the first value is 1."
"So if Wn equals 1, then actually we stop playing the game, because it means we've already won at some point, we've stopped playing the game and therefore, Wn is always equal to 1 in every period after we have first won."
"So in this case, the probability that Wn plus 1 equals 1, given Wn equals 1, is indeed equal to 1."
"Which means, the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn equals 1 well it must be equal to 1 because that's the only value it can take."
"It takes on this value 1 with probability 1, so the, this expected value equals 1, which is equal to Wn."
"The other situation that can occur, is that Wn equals minus 2 to the power of n plus 1."
"If that's the case, then we will bet 2 to the power of n, on the n plus first toss."
"So in that case, Wn plus 1 will be either 1, if we win the n plus first toss, or it will be minus 2 to the power of n plus 1 plus 1, and this follows from our arguments on the previous slides."
"Wn plus 1 will take on this value with probability a half and it'll take on this value with probability half, and that follows because it's a fair coin, we win with probability a half and we lose with probability half."
"So therefore, we have these two expressions here, from which it immediately follows that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn equals minus 2 to the power of n plus 1, it is equal to 1, with prob-, with probability a half and is equal to minus 2 to the n plus 1, plus 1 of probability a half."
"If we sum these two together, we get minus 2 to the n plus 1, and that of course is equal to Wn."
"So in both possible cases, case 1 and case 2, we have shown that the expected value of Wn plus 1, given Wn, is equal to Wn."
Force them to clean up.
"And enforcing them to obey, come, pollution, they force the firms to incur higher cost."
Now back to the graph.
"If, in fact, firms are required to incur higher costs that is, the cost of their pollution or cost of abating the pollution, then the supply curve will shift from S1 to S2."
And the equilibrium will go to P2.
"And Q2, the price will go up and the quantity will go down."
"So on, on environmental regulations is, is going to impact consumers."
"It's going to force them to pay a higher price and they're gonna get fewer units but presumably th e improvement in, in envrironmental quality exceeds the disadvantages of having to pay a higher price, for a smaller quantity."
"And it exceeds it by this, this triangular area."
"One other way in which the government can solve this inefficiency problem, is simply by imposing a tax on, on the firms."
Back to the graph again.
"That is, if the government Were to impose an excise tax similar to the type of tax we considered earlier equal to AB, then the firms would consider their supply curve as equal to S2, not S1."
The result is that the equilibrium would go to P2 and
Q2.
Consumers may in fact suffer from the excised task on the good they have to pay a higher price for a smaller quantity.
But then again the reason for the excise tax is to improve the environmental quality and presumably the value of the added environmental quality is greater than the value of the goods that had to be given up.
Because of the excise tax.
"If you are at all typical of my in-class students, you very likely have never thought that at the foundation of the pollution problem is the absence of defined and enforced property rights, as was the case in the"
Tragedy of the Commons we considered in terms of an open Pasture.
"Indeed, pollution is a tragedy of the commons."
"And you might not have considered the possible, solution to the pollution problem can be the assignment of rights to the now common airways and waterways."
It's hard to imagine how property rights can be assigned to sections of the atmosphere or the waterways since those resources are always on the move and it's hard to tie them down.
"But the same end can possibly be accomplished by the assignment of rights to pollute, as measured in, say pounds of identifiable harmful flumes, fumes, and chemicals."
Say units of CO2 that can be emitted by people who hold the right.
"That is, if you hold a right to pollute, you can emit CO2."
"If you do not have the right to pollute, then you can not use the atmosphere."
And you likely have never ever think in the prospect that the government might be able t o achieve its environmental goal at lower cost through the selling of pollution rights than through government regulation of environmental quality.
"Now to see this possible outcome with some clarity, suppose that the Environmental Protection Agency establishes that the atmosphere in a given geographical location can safely absorb ten units of CO two."
"Suppose also there are five polluting firms, or for that matter government agencies and churches that pollute."
They do pollute.
"Suppose there are only five firms, polluting firms in the area with different cost structures for eliminating each of their five units of pollution."
EPA allows each firm to emit two units of CO2.
"It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall."
"It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people, but it has no traction."
It's almost as if that stimulus -- you -- you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives.
"Now, we thought those data were so powerful, in a way, that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life, because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-old, you'd be surprised by how social those babies are."
And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily.
"And using these kinds of measures and many others, what we found out is that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on."
We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life.
"If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early-emerging -- things that are online from the first weeks of life -- we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now."
"Now, we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children, but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community."
"Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by those who are in the trenches -- our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child -- and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children."
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child.
"But this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment."
"We need to be able to work with the families, support the families, to manage those first years with them."
"We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment, because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives."
"Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years,"
"I can tell you, having been in this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated."
"There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities, preventing, in fact, those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field."
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.
No longer.
We can do a great deal of things.
And the idea is not to cure autism.
That's not the idea.
"What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation."
"We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity."
"And they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined."
"Because after all, they learn about the world almost, like, about it, rather than learning how to function in it."
"But this is a strength if you're working, for example, in technology."
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.
We want them to be free to do that.
"We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths, but to fulfill their promise."
"Well, thank you for listening to me."
(Applause)
"So insert A, B, C, D, E, F, G."
"And so, the operation of inserting a new character into this form of the buffer is pushing something on the before stack."
"So if I want to move the cursor, let's say I want to move it back one, then I pop the top off of the before push it on the after."
"I keep doing that and it transfers the G to the H, you know, the E and so on, as I back up."
Moving forward does that same operation in the inverse.
If I want to move forward I take something off the top of the after and push it on before.
So it's kind of shuffling it from one side to the other.
"Given that these push and pop operations are constant on both implementations of the stack we saw, then that means that our cursor movement is also of one so I can do this."
And if I do deletes it's actually just popping from the after stack and throwing it away.
"So also easy to do edits because I'm talking about adding things to the before and deleting things from after, both of which can be done very efficiently."
The one operation that this guy has trouble with is big cursor movement.
"If I want to go all the way to the beginning or all the way to the end, then everything's got to go."
"No matter how many things I have to empty out the entire after stack to position the cursor at the end, or empty out the entire before stack to get it all the way over here."
"So I could of sort of talk you though this code, and actually, I won't type it just because I actually want to talk about its analysis more than I want to see its code."
Each of these actually becomes a one liner.
Insert is push on the before stack.
Delete is pop from the after stack.
"The cursor movement is popping from one and pushing on the other depending on the direction and then that same code just for the Y loop, like wild or something on the one stack, just keep pushing and popping from one empty to the other."
"So very little code to write, right, depending a lot on the stacks abstractions coming through for us and then making this ultra fit that we've managed to get editing suddenly,"
"like, a lot more efficient but the cost of sacrificing one of our other operations."
Let's take a look at what that
"look like, right."
"Suddenly I can do all this insert and delete at the insertion point with very little trouble, and I suddenly made this other operation, oddly enough, slow."
"All a sudden it's like if you go back to the beginning of your document you're in the middle of editing, you're at the bottom."
"You say, oh, I want to go back to the beginning and you can imagine how that would feel if you were typing it would actually be the act of going up and clicking up in the top right by where you made the insertion and all a sudden you'd see the white cursor and you'd be like, why is that taking so long."
"How could that possibly be, you know, that it's doing this kind of rearrangement, but yet it made editing even on a million character document fast."
But that movement
"long distances, you know, jumping a couple of pages or front to back, suddenly, having to do this big transfer behind the scenes, so different, right."
"So now I had six operations, I had four fast, two slow, now I have four fast, two slow."
"It still might be that, actually, this is an interesting improvement, though, because we have decided those are operations that we're willing to tolerate, being slower, especially, if it means some operation that we're more interested in, if performance being faster."
"And that likely seems like it's moving in the right direction because editing, right, being the whole purpose, right, behind what we're trying to do is a text setter, that seems like that might be a good call."
"What I'm going to start looking at and it's going to be something I want to talk about next time, is what can a link list do for us?"
So that's a way that you can actually test these different areas.
And the last one is the tertiary classification and here we have low cortisol again and we're going to have low ACTH and we're going to have low CRH because the problem now is located in the hypothalamus.
"The hypothalamus is not giving us CRH, so ACTH has turned off and so has cortisol."
"So in this case then, what you would do for your patients is you give them ACTH."
"If you give them ACTH, the cortisol levels should rise."
Okay?
"So this is how you would then go through and classify these different these different endocrine pathologies, and as we start to deal with all of the different endocrine axis, this hypothalamus, pituitary axes, then you're going to be able to see that there are these multiple levels of regulation."
"And that, at each level, we can have this negative feedback loop, and if the negative feedback loop isn't working correctly, then you'll have inappropriately levels of these of the feeding hormones."
Okay.
So what's our general concepts then?
"So, the pathology in endocrinology occurs when there is either too little of hormone or we have too much hormone or we can have resistance of the, of the target cell due to its receptor dysfunction."
"And we really didn't talk about receptor dysfunction in this particular lecture, but we had addressed it in the previous one."
"Secondly, we have an interpretation of the hormone levels and this is going to require consideration of either the trophic hormones or the releasing hormones."
These are the things which are controlling the downstream target endocrine gland.
"So, we're going to have to consider their concentrations if the target gland is misbehaving."
"And then, we can also see that these things can be controlled by ions or can be controlled by nutrients, such as the parathyroid gland or the pancreas, for instance, which actually directly senses glucose."
"So, if the, if the endocrine problem is at the pituitary, at the pancreas where we are not able to sense glucose and we have very high levels of glucose within the plasma, we will not secrete insulin."
There will be an insufficient release of insulin under those conditions.
"Or, so, why don't you go ahead and consider these questions and think through what the, these basic concepts and apply them to these questions."
"And again, your answers will be if you just click at the bottom."
See you next time.
What I want to do in this video is order these fractions from least to greatest
"And, the easiest way--and the way that people are sure to get the right answer-- is to find a common denominator, because if we can't find a common denominator, these fractions are difficult to compare:"
"4/9 v. 3/4 v. 4/5, 11/12, 13/15."
"You can try to estimate them, but you'll be able to directly compare them if they all have the same denominator."
"So, the trick here is to first find the common denominator."
"And there is many ways to do it, you could just pick one of these numbers, and take all of its multiples until you find a multiple that is divisible by all of the rest."
Another way to do it is to look at the prime factorization of each of these numbers. and then the 'least common multiple' of them would have each of those prime numbers in it.
"Let's do it that second way, and then verify it."
"So, 9 is 33, so our LCM is going to have at least one 33 in it."
And then 4 is the same thing as 2*2.
"So, we will also have 2*2 in our prime factorization (LCM)."
"So yes, you can temporarily fix a lot of carbon by planting a"
"lot of trees, but in the long run it's not a stable solution because those trees get burned up; they either get literally burned up, or they get metabolized by the detritivores, and the detritivores put the carbon back into the system."
What happens when you fix carbon in a reef?
"You make limestone, and limestone sticks around for a long time."
"And if you take a big reef and you slam it into a continent with a tectonic collision, you get marble."
So the marble quarries of the world are the fixed carbon of 3 to 500 million years ago.
So you can actually tie up carbon for a much longer period more stably by putting it into limestone than you can by putting it into wood.
"However, there are also some important things about different kinds of forests and how well they can grow, and a lot depends upon whether you have a deciduous tree or a conifer."
"And if you look around the world at the different kinds of forests, it turns out that the coniferous forests can actually fix more carbon per year than a deciduous forest, basically because they keep on growing at times when the deciduous trees have dropped their leaves."
Okay?
"So their primary productivity, in terms of tons of carbon per hectare per year, is about 1 and a half that of a deciduous forest."
And I mention that because there are-- these are the kinds of broad-scale biological differences that are important to pay attention to if you're doing ecosystem ecology.
"There are some that you can ignore, but this is a big difference and it's something that has to be kept track of."
So I think you're getting an idea of the sort of filter that ecosystem ecology places on the details of other kinds of biology.
"Ecosystem ecology, it's going to be interested in keeping track of things that make big differences to the flow of energy and materials, and it's going to say we probably want to ignore the rest, just because life is complex enough as it is."
Okay?
So this is really what's driving that.
"And that's why, if you go back and you look at those biomes, you will see that when people make biome classifications, they keep track of whether they're dealing with a coniferous forest or a deciduous forest, and things like that."
"Okay, if you look across the world at grasslands, forests and the open ocean, you see a nice food pyramid."
"And the green is the herbivores--excuse me, the green is the producers, the yellow is the herbivores, the red is the carnivores."
"And if you just look at biomass, you will see that in grasslands you have a few big fierce animals, that are rare, and then you've got a bunch of grazing animals that are a bit more common, and there are more of them, and then you've got a lot of plants; pretty much the same in the forest."
Out in the open ocean it's really quite different.
You have a few large top predators; so these are the tuna and the sharks and the whales and things
like that.
"Then you've got a big biomass of herbivores, and then not too many- not too much biomass of the algae, in the open ocean."
"If you look at the energy flow for the grasslands and the forests, it's pretty similar to the standing crop."
This would be the standing crop.
This is how much energy calories per square meter per day is flowing through it.
"But in the open ocean something is converting this kind of anomalous picture into a sort of standard food pyramid, when you look at energy flow."
What's doing it?
What's the difference between a grass and a single-celled alga?
Student:
The only real difference here is that we're also accumulating these costs as we do the recursion.
"So once we've done this recursion then we have a complete specification of all the roots within our flights database, all of the way's we can get from"
A to B and the total cost.
Now one thing I should say is this is not actually giving us the ways of getting from one place to another.
"If we wanted to accumulate the actual route that we take so the flights and the costs and the airlines and so on, we have to kind of use a structured structure inside our data base to accumulate those."
There are ways of doing that but I'm not going to demonstrate that here.
I'm just going to demonstrate the is accused of recursion and computing the total cost.
"OK, so let's go ahead and run this query so we've computed all of the routes, and then we're just gonna start by finding the routes from A to B and what the total cost of those are."
So we'll run the query and we'll find out that there are three ways of getting from A to B. The first one happens to be that direct Jet Blue flight for 195.
The second was the flight through Chicago for a total cost of 300.
You can go back and look at the data and verify these.
"And the third one was that complicated routing where we stopped several times, but we save a lot of money, well twenty dollars over the direct flight, by going through those cities because the total sub-cost is 175."
I'll leave it up to you whether it's worth twenty dollars to stop several times versus the direct flight.
So now since my actual specification of what I wanted to know was the cheapest way to go then
I just say min total instead of in my final query and I run that and my answer is that 175 is the cheapest way to get from A to B. Now here is an alternative formulation of the same query That essentially parallels the alternative that we looked at with our project cross where we built in project X into our recursion that simplified the recursion in that case.
"In this case it's not simpler, but it could potentially be more efficient."
We're going to build in the fact that we're starting from origin
A so instead of finding all roots from any point to any other point in our recursion and then finding the roots from A to
"B, let's create a relation recursively that says,"
"""Starting from point A,"
I can get to a particular destination for a particular total cost.
"So this is going to build up roots starting from A the base query is going to, of course, start by looking at direct flights where the origin is A and is going to put the destination and the cost into our relation called from A. So that starts with that first gives us direct start from A where we can get on the direct, where we can get to, and how much it will cost us, and then our recursion is going to add flights to that one."
"Again, it really parallels what we did with the Project X."
"Our recursion is going to say, ok we know we can get a, from particular, we can get to a particular place from point A for a certain cost and that's our destination."
If we add 1 more flight so the origin of that flight is the destination of where we can get then that will also be a destination that we can get to from point
A and we'll just add the cost of the additional flight on.
One more time a strong suggestion that you download and try these things for yourself.
Once we found all the places we can get from A then we'll use that to figure out the cheapest way to get to Point B. But let's just start by running the
With statement where all we do is see the places we can get to from A and the total cost of getting there.
So here we go.
"And we can get to Chicago,"
"Phoenix or we can get to B a couple of different ways, three different ways actually as we already know."
"So through all the intermediate recursive calls, we have no cycles."
"By our first observation, there's always a sink."
So the second thing we have to argue is that we really do produce a topological ordering.
So remember what that means.
"That means that for every edge of the graph, it goes forward in the ordering."
"That is, the head of the arc is given a position later than the tail of the arc."
And this simply follows because we always use sink vertices.
"So consider the vertex V, which is assigned to the position I, this means then when we're down to a graph that has only I vertices remaining, V is a sink vertex."
"So if I is, if V is a sink vertex for, when only the first I vertices remain, what property does it have in the original graph?"
Well it means all of the outgoing arcs that it has; have to go to vertices that were already deleted and assigned higher positions.
"So for every vertex, by the time it actually gets assigned a position, it's a sink."
And it only has incoming arcs from the as yet unassigned vertices.
"Its outgoing arcs all go forward to vertices that were already assigned higher positions, and got deleted previously from the graph."
So now we have under our belt a pretty reasonable solution for computing a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph.
"In particular, remember we observed that if a graph does have a directed cycle, then of course there is no way there's a topological ordering."
"However you order the vertices, some edge of the cycle is going to have to go backward."
"And the solution on the previous slide shows that as long as you don't have a cycle, it guarantees a topological ordering does indeed exist and in fact it's a constructive proof, a constructive argument that gives an algorithm."
"What you do is you just keep plucking off sinks, sink vertices one at a time and populating the ordering from right to left as you keep peeling off these sinks."
"So that's a pretty good algorithm, it's not too slow."
"And actually, if you implement it just so, you can even get it to run in linear time."
"But I wanna conclude this video with an application of depth first search, which is a very slick, very efficient computation of a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph."
So we're just going to make two really quite minor modifications to our previous depth first search subroutine.
The first thing is we have to embed it in a for loop just like we did with breadth first search when we were computing the connected components of an undirected graph.
"That's because in computing a topological ordering, we'd better give every single vertex a label, we better look at every vertex at least once."
"So to do that, we'll just make sure there's an outer for loop and then if we have multiple components, we'll just make sure to invoke DFS as often as we need to."
The second thing we'll do is we'll add a
little bit of bookkeeping and this will make sure that every node gets a label.
"And in fact, these labels will define the topological order."
So let's not forget the code for depth first search.
"This is where you're given a graph G; in this case we're assuming a directed acyclic graph and you're given a start vertex S. And what you do is you, as soon as you get to S, you very aggressively start trying to explore its neighbors."
"Of course, you don't visit any vertex you've already been to; you keep track of who you've visited."
"And if you find any vertex that you haven't seen before, you immediately start recursing on that node."
Everyone was in a state of shock.
But some believed it was only the beginning of the counting process.
"Half an hour later it was declared that 10 million votes had been counted, and Ahmadinejad has seven million votes, and Mousavi has over two million votes."
It was a very weird situation.
People were swearing.
They didn't know what to do.
Everyone was very confused.
"What we want is to build this system-level random testers as early as possible in the development process, and there are a number of reason for this."
First of all what we'd like to do is start off with a simple version of our system that doesn't implement very much functionality and then we want to use sort of a weak fuzzer.
"That is to say, we're going to test it with values that are maybe perhaps not that interesting."
And the good thing about this combination is these weak random tests probably are going to find some flaws.
What they are not going to do is flood our developers with huge numbers of bugs
like might happen when we use an extremely strong random tester.
There is sort of no easier way to demoralized software developers than to hand them a really big pile of bugs--nobody wants that.
What they're gong to start to do is ignore those bugs and get back to getting work done.
"What you want to do is give people a slow but steady stream of important bug reports and let them fix this as they go on, and that's another reason why it's nice to give people with continuous stream of bug reports, which is that what these do is help show us flaws in our software."
They help show us interfaces that we don't understand.
"They help show us modules that end up being extremely weak for one reason or another, and it basically helps us better understand where our software development effort is going wrong."
"Now, if instead of giving people maybe a couple of bug reports a week for a year, we give them a hundred bug reports in the very end"
"All they're going to do is triage to find the five most critical bugs, and fix them using hacks."
So nobody learns anything.
Everybody is angry.
Nobody is happy.
Rather what we like to have done is have been doing random testing all along and using it to spot weakness in our software.
"The other thing that happens is, as our software evolves to be more robust as we move toward releasing it, we're evolving our random tester to be stronger and stronger."
"That is to say, maybe this week we have a feature where we generate a new kind of random input that we haven't generated before."
"Also it's going to generate some bug report, and we'll fix them, and our software evolves to be more robust."
"If we keep doing them not just over weeks but over years, what we'll end up with is a random tester and a system that have sort of gone through this co-evolution process where they both become much stronger."
"That is to say, we've evolved in extremely sophisticated random tester, and we've also evolved the system that gives robust with respect to the kind of vaults it can be triggered by that random tester."
"What I firmly believe is, and of course I can't prove this and you're free to disagree, is that if, for example, Microsoft had done this from the beginning, Adobe had done this from the beginning, and these other companies that end up with lots of security vulnerabilities had fuzzed their products all the way through the development chain they'd end up with far fewer of this sort of nasty crashes and critical security vulnerabilities that they are always scrambling to patch, and that anybody with a fuzzer seems to be able to find without a whole lot of effort."
"Or at least that's been the case in the past, and it's possible now that with more widespread user of more aggressive fuzzers with that kind of error of easy security bugs in popular products maybe is hopefully starting to kind of tail off."

"When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility.

While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages."

The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_2 and formula_3, after the scores have been arranged in ascending order (becoming bigger as one goes further). The second quartile formula_4 is also known as the median."
"The interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores). In fact, it eliminates them."

Motion of no confidence
"A motion of no confidence, is a vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader. This is mainly a statement or vote which states that a person in a superior position, be it government, managerial, etc., is no longer deemed fit to hold that position."
"The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782 when, following news of the British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that they ""can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers"". In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is relatively rare in two-party democracies. Party discipline is usually enough to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence."
"There are variations of this in different countries. For example, in Germany, Spain, and Israel, a vote of no confidence requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the respective head of state. A motion of no confidence in some countries can be proposed in the government collectively or by any individual member, including the Prime Minister. In Spain it is presented by the Prime Minister after consultation."
Sometimes a party proposes a confidence vote even though it is not likely to pass. The no confidence vote may pressure the government. Or when the government proposes the vote it can embarrass critics who do not vote against the government.

"Remnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic peoples. The origin of the word ""Bangla ~ Bengal"" is unknown, but it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ""Bang"" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC."
"After the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the ""Atharvaveda"" about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Persia and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ""Gangahrd"" (Land with the Ganges in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire."

Simple Network Management Protocol
"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite. SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects."
"SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc."
Overview and basic concepts.
"In common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an ""agent"" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems."
"SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as ""free memory"", ""system name"", ""number of running processes"", ""default route""). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration."
"The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."

As of 2021, all of its speakers speak it as a secondary language with finnish or plain sami being first."
History.
"Hoffish originally started off as a dialect of the sami language in what is guessed to be in the middle ages. All we know about its history is from Mina Napoi, who interviewed many people of the sami culture. Her findings are at the helsinki central library in finland which are currently being approved for digitalization as of February 2021. In her last two pages of her article titled, ""Saamen murre nimeltä hoseff"", she talks about how the language most likely formed as a dialect of sami in the late middle ages but then over time reformed due to the hoffish-sami group's migration. The hoffish-sami people she interviewed said that their ancestors moved a lot from northern finland to as far as southern norway while trading furs. She finally states because of this common migration that the people must of picked up a lot of new nordic words and grammer which in time turned the sami language into what the hoffish people speak today."

"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human."
"According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing ""divine"" in daytime and appearing ""humanly"" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of ""divine origin"" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion."
In Hinduism.
"According to 's ""The Meitheis"" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to ""Enoog Howba Chonoo"", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga (""Dapar Jug"") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga (""Kali Jug""), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, ""Jobista"" (also spelled as ""Yavista"") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata."
"In the 18th century AD, the ""Vijay Panchali"" (also spelled as ""Bijoy Panchali"") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as ""Yavistha""."
"Notably, in the year 2020, ""A Short History of Manipur"", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata."
In art and culture.
"In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL)."
"Ritual ceremonies are performed and the ""Salai Taret Huiyen Lalong Thang-Ta Lup"", giving guard of honour, hoists the flag of Nongda Lairen Phakhangba."
The ceremony is performed for the purpose to preserve and promote the indigenous art and culture of Kangleipak.

Death of Gloria Ramirez
"Gloria Ramirez (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994) was an American woman dubbed ""the Toxic Lady"" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She was from Riverside, California."
"Ramirez had been admitted to the ER while suffering from late-stage cervical cancer. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms."
"Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in intensive care unit for two weeks."
"Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. This incident was initially thought to be a case of mass hysteria."
"The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart. Many people saw an oily substance covering Ramirez's body. Others noted a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth."
"An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that Ramirez had been self-injecting dimethyl sulfoxide as a treatment for pain, which converted into dimethyl sulfate, an extremely poisonous agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although the medical sector of Riverside supports this claim, scientists still believe it is not the case."
"Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park in Riverside."

Order of the Indian Empire
The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria in 1878. The Order includes members of three classes:
"No appointments have been made since 1947, the year of Indian independence and the Partition of India. In 2010 the last surviving knight, The Maharaja of Dhrangadhra, died and the order became dormant ."
"The motto of the Order is """", (Under the auspices of the Empress), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the Empire of India; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India."
History.
"The British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and ""native"" officials who served in India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but a second class, Knights Commander, was added in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"On 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became ""The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire"" and was divided into two classes: Knights Commander and Companions, with the following first Knights Commander:"
"However, on 5 January 1888, a further proclamation regarding the Order was made; the Order was expanded from two classes to three - Knight Grand Commander, Knight Commander and Companion. Seven Knights Grand Commander were created; they were:"
"Normally the highest grade in British orders is Knight Grand Cross, but Knight Grand Commander was chosen for the two Indian awards because of the Christian symbolism of the cross."
"Appointments to both Orders stopped after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished, and Queen Elizabeth II remains the Sovereign of the Orders to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order."
"The fictional characters Purun Dass (invented by Rudyard Kipling) and Harry Paget Flashman (invented by George MacDonald Fraser) each held a KCIE; Kipling's engineer Findlayson in ""The Day's Work"" (1908) wants the CIE."
Composition.
"The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order. The Grand Master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"" rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"" so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order."
"At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion. There could be any number of members. In 1887, the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander (50 at any given time) and Companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same."
"British officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed Knights Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, except the princely rulers, could not be members the Order. Female princely rulers were admitted as ""Knights"" rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies""."
"As well, other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed."

Garret FitzGerald
"Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 1926 – 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who served twice as Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1982 to 1987. Elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Teachta Dála (TD), he served as Ireland's foreign minister from 1973 to 1977 and as leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987."
Early life.
"FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, His mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent."
"He was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD). A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer), a fellow student whom FitzGerald would marry in 1947."
He later qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.
Early political life.
"FitzGerald was eager to enter politics and, although it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil (including Charles Haughey) that he should join them, he made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency."
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
"After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, however the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, with his innovative views, energy and fluency in the French language, won Ireland a status in European affairs far beyond the country's size and ensured that the first Irish presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success."
Leader of Fine Gael.
"In 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him."
"Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas than Fianna Fáil, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years."
Taoiseach 1981–82.
"By the time of the 1981 general election, Fine Gael won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981."
"Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed region in the South Caucasus. Legally, it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but from 1994 until the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, most of it was militarily controlled by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, which is not officially recognized by any other country, including Armenia which supports it. Currently, different parts of the region are controlled by both Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Azerbaijan controlling most of it and Armenia controlling a smaller central area."
Etymology.
"The names for the region in the different local languages all translate to ""mountainous Karabakh"", or ""mountainous black garden"". The word ""nagorno"" is Russian for ""mountainous/on the mountain"", ""kara"" is Turkish for ""black"", and ""bakh"" means ""garden"" in Azerbaijani."
History.
"The region became a subject of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1918 when both states gained brief independence. Two years later, Soviet Union conquered both of the new states and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within Azerbaijan."
"When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow and started campaigns of publicity and democratic reforms at the end of the 20th century, Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh sent letters to Gorbachev demanding him to move the autonomous oblast to the control of Armenia. When it was declined, the Armenians started an independence movement."
"In November 1991, seeking to stop this movement, the Parliament of Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous status of the region. In response, the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians held a referendum on December 10, 1991, which was boycotted by Azerbaijanis living in Nagorno-Karabakh and none of them participated in it, therefore the overwhelming majority of the population voted for independence."

Suryavanshi
Suryavanshi refers to a person belonging to the Solar Dynasty of the Rajputs .
The Suryavanshi clans are:
Some other castes are also Suryavanshi like:-
Chandravanshi
"Chandravanshi or Candravaṃśa is a legendary principal house of the Kshatriyas varna, or warrior–ruling caste mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (Soma or Lunar). The Hindu deity Krishna is believed to be born in the Yaduvanshi Ahir branch of the Lunar dynasty."
"According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas."
"According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururavas who became the first Chandravanshi emperor of the planet. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas"
"In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses."
By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna &amp; later becomes the King of Mathura.
"As the only surviving grandson of Krishna, all branches claiming descent from Krishna (Krishnaut Yadavas) descend from him."

Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer. He was the leader of the first circumnavigation of Australia and identified it as a continent.
"Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree."
"Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie."
"Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, ""A Voyage to Terra Australis""."
Induction coil
"An induction coil or ""spark coil"" is a type of electrical transformer. It is used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter."
"The induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in X-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is for ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction."

Ferdinand lost his devoted wife, Barbara of Portugal in August 1758 and would fall into deep morning for her. He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily."

"Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia as part of the festivities that accompanied the coronation of Maria Luisa and her husband Leopold as king and queen of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. In musical circles, Maria Luisa is famous for her putative denigration of Mozart's opera as ""German rubbish"" (""una porcheria tedesca""), however no claim that she made this remark pre-dates the publication in 1871 of Alfred Meissner's ""Rococo-Bilder: nach Aufzeichnungen meines Grossvaters"", a collection of stories about cultural and political life in Prague in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."

Romantic orientation
"Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the sex or gender that a person is most likely to have a romantic relationship with. It is compared to the term ""sexual orientation"". Romantic orientation is based on the idea that sexual attraction is one component of a larger picture. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation, as some are not aromantic."
Carbon sequestration
"Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the atmosphere. One method of sequestration is by capturing CO2 produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere. When the CO2 gas is in long-term storage, that means it has been sequestered."
Carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from Earth's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also used to prevent future human caused climate change.
Methods.
There are two long-term ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere:

Kenneth Clarke
"Kenneth Harry Clarke, Baron Clarke of Nottingham, (born 2 July 1940), often known as Ken Clarke, is a British politician. He was the Justice Secretary in the coalition government. Clarke has had a long career in politics and has served in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. On February 26, 2017, Clarke became Father of the House after the death of Gerald Kaufman."
Early life and politics.
"Clarke was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England and was educated at the University of Cambridge. He became the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe at the 1970 general election and became a Queen's Counsel in 1980. He held a number of lower positions in government under Margaret Thatcher until she promoted him to Health Secretary in 1988. He became Education Secretary in 1990 and when Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced with John Major he stayed on as Health Secretary until 1992 when he was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. He stayed as Chancellor until 1997 when the Conservatives were defeated in the General Election."
In opposition.
John Major resigned as leader of the Conservative Party soon after he was defeated in the general election and Clarke stood for election to replace him as leader and therefore become the Leader of the Opposition. However he was defeated by William Hague in this contest. When Hague himself resigned after losing the 2001 General Election Clarke again stood for leader but was defeated by Iain Duncan Smith. In 2005 he stood for the leadership for a third time but was defeated by David Cameron. It is thought that Clarke was unable to become leader because many in the Conservative Party do not wish to see the United Kingdom replace the pound with the Euro as the main currency whereas Clarke has always been very much in favour of this policy.
As Shadow Business Secretary.
Clarke returned to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as the Shadow Business Secretary where he has the job of monitoring the performance of the current Business Secretary Peter Mandelson. When the coalition government was formed on 11 May 2010 Clarke was made the Justice Secretary.

Optical gain medium
"An optical gain medium (also called an ""active laser medium"") can make light stronger. In general, gain media must be powered by another energy source in order to have energy to provide as light. Some gain media can be powered using electricity, but many others need light energy from bright flash lamps or a laser. Optical gain media are used in lasers. The first lasers used artificial ruby as their optical gain medium."
Microvillus
"Microvillus (plural microvilli) is a very tiny hair-like membrane in the body. The microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell. In humans, the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area. They are good for absorbing things and for secreting things. They are found in many places in a human body including the ear, the tongue, the nose and the intestines."
"On a tongue, the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain. These signals are interpreted by the brain, and tells the brain what things taste like. Over time, as a person tastes more and more things, the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information. This databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes, and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities."
"In the intestines, the microvilli are able to absorb (take) nutrients from the digested food for the body to use."
Languages of the United States
"English is the ""de facto"" national language of the United States, with 82% of the population claiming it as a mother tongue, and some 96% claiming to speak it ""well"" or ""very well"". However, no ""official language"" exists at the Federal level. There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills, but none of these bills have made a federal language. However, some states have adopted the English language as their official language. On the other hand, a lot of another languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hindi, Mandarin, Hebrew, Cantonese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Navajo, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Portuguese, etc. Are spoken in the United States as second languages."

"Khat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources are used for it because farmers get more money than for other cash crops. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. It uses so much water that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea."
"Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares."

National Capital Region (Canada)
"The National Capital Region () is an official federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The National Capital Region covers an area of 6,287.03 square kilometres (2,427.44 square miles). It has a population of 1,235,324. The Ottawa part of the region is part of the eastern subregion of Ontario. The Ottawa-Gatineau CMA is the only CMA in Canada to include parts of two provinces."
"The National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option."

Other towns within National Capital Region.
"While not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa."
Gatineau
"Gatineau (as of 2006 census population 242,124) is a city in western Quebec, Canada. It is on the northern bank of the Ottawa River, immediately across from Ottawa, Ontario, within Canada's National Capital Region. Ottawa and Gatineau comprise a single Census Metropolitan Area."
Orientability
"In the Euclidean space, ""R3"" is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is chirality. This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable."

"In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's request. Schröder had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005."
"In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing a bill. It would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as president, Köhler was authorized to not sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006, he did not sign the Consumer Information Law, because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills. In most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history."
"In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector, stating that ""a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs""."
"On 22 May 2008, Köhler said, that he wants to be the candidate for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009, he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly, and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009."
"In November 2009, Köhler refused to sign the ""Zugangserschwerungsgesetz"" (Access Impediment Act) into law without further information. The law, which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography, is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional."
Resignation.
"On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:"
"He came under criticism for his statement that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade. He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position. After getting no support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010. He made a statement saying ""I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect."" The resignation was considered a ""surprise"". The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position."
"As written down in the German constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens Böhrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010."
Personal life.

Gifted education
Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.
"Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage."
"In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word ""gifted,"" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An ""aptitude"" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. ""Competence"" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10 percent of the population."

"Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart."
Forced disappearance of Stuart Angel.
"Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October (""Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro"" – MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames ""Paulo"" and ""Henrique"". He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police."
"Officers of the Air Force Information Center (""Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica"" – CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from rasphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found."
Aftermath.
"Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book ""History of the Brazilian Republic"" by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed."
Death.
"Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events."
"In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named"
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this boo he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others."
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdigão had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission."

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)
"Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is the name of a disease that normally begins in childhood. It causes Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics. The symptoms begin very suddenly. If it is not treated at the beginning the disease can be there also in adults. The reason for PANS can be a bacteria called ""Group A streptococcus"" (PANDAS type) or an immunologic reaction to other pathogens like certain bacteria or viruses. (PITANDS type)."
Signs and symptoms.
Patients suffering from PANS show sudden begin OCD and/or tics and at least two of these symptoms:
Similar conditions.
"PANS shares symptoms with other diseases. Therefore diagnostic tests must be done to exclude other conditions like Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Proof of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification."
Treatment.
There is no direct treatment for PANS available yet. This means today only some of the symptoms can be treated. But scientists are already working to develop treatments with antibiotics and immune-based therapies that can heal the disease. Nevertheless early and consequent treatment of the symptoms seems to be important. Otherwise the disease can become a lifelong problem.
Province of Cattaro
"The Cattaro (Italian province), called in Italian ""Provincia italiana di Cattaro"" was an administrative section of the ""Governorate of Dalmatia"", created during World War II by the Kingdom of Italy with ""Regio Decreto Legge"" of May 18, 1941."
Characteristics.
"The newly created province had approximately the borders of the Albania veneta, that was part of the Republic of Venice until 1797 in southern Dalmatia."
"In the province of Cattaro there were the cities of Cattaro, Perasto, Risan|, Teodo and Castelnuovo di Cattaro. The province had a small territory around the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (Boka Kotorska) of 547 km² and nearly 39,800 inhabitants. The island of Saseno in Albania was annexed to the province, after separating it from the province of Zara (since 1920 this little island was part of Italy)."
"The population was mostly Slav, but there were nearly 3,000 autochthonous Italians, descendants from the Dalmatian Italians since Roman times: they were concentrated in the areas of Cattaro and Perasto."
History.
"Italian General Vittorio Ambrosio conquered in a few days all the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, and occupied the area around Cattaro (called ""Kotor"" since 1919) in April 1941."
"The new Italian province of Cattaro was created by order of Italian leader Benito Mussolini the next month, with the ""May 19 Treaty between Italy and Croatia"". Francesco Scassellati Sforzolini was named ""Prefect"" of the Cattaro province, serving from June 1941 to June 1943."
The governorship of the Cattaro province (and all the Governorate of Dalmatia) was held by Giuseppe Bastianini until January 1943 when he was recalled to Italy to join the cabinet; his place as governor was taken by Francesco Giunta.
"In summer 1941 the Italian government started a policy of Italianization in all the Governorate of Dalmatia. New Italian schools were opened in the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (now called Boka Kotorska). Administrative personnel from Italy moved to Cattaro city (nearly 6,700 Dalmatian Italians took refuge in Italy after the creation of Jugoslavia in 1919, and many of them were offered work if they returned to settle with their families in the Governorate of Dalmatia). Bastianini started needed public works, building hospitals, sewage and roads in the area."
"Some 500 Jews took refuge in the Cattaro province, after escaping the Ustasha and Nazi German persecution in their areas of former Jugoslavia."
"The province was spared the bloody guerrilla, that happened in the rest of Italian-occupied Montenegro, until mid-September 1943 when Germans took control of the area and the Italian province of Cattaro disappeared. The Italian Division ""Emilia"" of the ""XIV° Corpo d'Armata"" fought the German occupation of the Province of Cattaro, having 597 deaths e 963 wounded soldiers, from September 9 until September 16, 1943."

Williams syndrome
"Young children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury."
Quaternary injuries.
"Quaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse."
Quinary injuries.
"This category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation (""dirty bombs"") as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast."
Psychological trauma.
The psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event. Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries.
Neurotrauma.
"Neurotrauma can occur due to the mechanisms of one or more blast injury categories. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma."
"Individuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation."

Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes."
"Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: ""research"", ""design"", ""testing"", and ""construction"" which are featured with the images below:"
Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century.
"Entry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building."
"Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, earthquake engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts."

"Started in 1999 as nba.com TV, the channel, which had its studios at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey, began a multi-year deal with American television companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, and Time Warner on June 28, 2003, allowing the network to expand to 45 million American homes, and 30 different countries. NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier."
Programming.
"NBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder."
"The channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time."
"NBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout)."
"The channel's flagship program is ""NBA Gametime Live"", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of ""The NBA on TNT"". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours."
Personalities.
The studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.
Ownership.
"On October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to"
Hoopsworld:
"""NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September."""
"Turner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT."
"The studio was also upgraded, and the show now airs live from Studio B at Turner Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; Studio B is adjacent to Studio J, home of Inside the NBA."
International presence.
"In 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, not the league)."
"As of 2010, NBA TV coverage can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners:"
NBA TV HD.
"NBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of NBA TV. All studio programs and original shows are shot in HD, and all live games and recent game rebroadcasts are shown in HD. For programs not available in HD (such as older game footage), unique stylized pillarboxes are used, the NBA logo with ""NBA TV"" under it, or alternately, just ""NBA TV"" sideways. Both are in black and gray"
New carriage agreements.
"On April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add-on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers."
"On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add-on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel."
"Verizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009."
"The channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009. They also reached a new deal with Cox Cable earlier this year."
"With all of the above carriage deals, the NBA believes it will now reach 45 million viewers."
HBO Asia
"HBO Asia is a television network in Asia. It is a franchise of HBO. HBO Asia is now a joint venture of media giants Viacom (25%) and Time Warner (75%). Sony Pictures Entertainment and Universal Studios exited the fifteen year-old HBO Asia premium movie joint venture on January 16, 2008."
History.
"Launched in 1992, Singapore-based HBO Asia is a commercial-free 24-hour subscription movie channel. It also offers some original movies and series that are produced by the Emmy and Golden Globe award winning American channel, HBO."
"HBO Asia has five channels under its multi-channel strategy (HBO, HBO Signature, HBO HiTS, HBO Family and Max). HBO launched its first subscription Video-On-Demand service, HBO On Demand, in Hong Kong, it was launched in Singapore a year later."
"HBO recently launched its first regional HD channel, HBO HD, in Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines,Thailand and Malaysia. HBO is available in twenty-two countries throughout Asia and has closed-captioned subtitling in several local languages."

Master of Public Administration
"Master of Public Administration (usually abbreviated MPA) is a postgraduate academic master's degree given by universities. Usually, it is awarded for studies toward Administration in the Public sector and Non-profit organizations. Usually, Public policy is part of the study. Additionally, there may be studies of comparisons between countries."
It is usually required to start a doctorate in Public Administration.
Tanzanite
"Tanzanite is a blue-purple gemstone found in Tanzania, in the Mererani Hills near the city of Arusha and Mount Kilimanjaro. It is named after the country of Tanzania, where it is found. It is a kind of a mineral called zoisite. When it is first mined, tanzanite is usually a red-brown colour. It needs to be heated to 600 degrees Celsius in a special oven to bring out its purple colour."
Elephant shrew
"The elephant shrew, also called sengi, are any of 16 species of rat-sized African mammals named for their long, tapered, and flexible snout (proboscis). All have slim bodies, slender limbs, and very long hind legs and feet. Although they resemble shrews, they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order Macroscelidea. Long thought to be related to shrews, they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews although this was not known or even widely believed until the 1990s."
Description.
"Elephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day. Their ears and eyes are large, and, when alarmed, they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain, sometimes leaping over obstacles. When foraging, they move along the pathways, using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey, which consists of small insects (especially ants and termites), other arthropods, and earthworms. Gestation lasts two months, and litters contain one or two well-developed young."
Hyrax
"Hyrax also called dassie is any of four species of thick, herbivorous mammals in the order Hyracoidea, any of six species of small hoofed mammal (ungulates) native to Africa and extreme southwestern Asia."
"Hyraxes are well-furred rotund creatures with a short tail. Most measure between 30–70 cm long and weigh between 2–5 kg. Hyraxes are mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is possible that the Hebrew word for hyrax (""shafan"") is the source of the name of present-day Spain. Even though hyraxes are not native to Spain, rabbits are, and the theory states that early Hebrew explorers considered the rabbits to be a variety of hyrax."

Absorption
"Absorption is when something takes in another substance. It is a physical or chemical phenomenon or process. Atoms, molecules, or ions enter in the inner part (called ""bulk"") of a gas, liquid, or solid material."
"This is different from adsorption. Molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the volume of the material, instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the surface of the material. A more general term is ""sorption"", which covers absorption, adsorption, and ion exchange."
"Other meanings of ""absorption"" are:"

"Roads from Ķekava: Riga—Warszawa (A7), Riga bypass road (A5), Ķekava-Plakanciems (V6), Ķekava bypass road (not built yet). The center of Riga is 17 km from Ķekava to north-west."
Attempted assassination of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner
"On 1 September 2022 Argentina's former president and current vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had a gun pointed at her head by a man outside her official residence in the neighborhood of Recoleta, Buenos Aires. As the man tried to kill her, the gun failed. No shots were fired. He was arrested on the scene."
Facts.
"On September 1, 2022, at 8:50 p.m. (local time in Argentina), the vice president of Argentina arrived at her home after a session in the Senate. Fernández was signing copies of her book ""Sinceramente"" outside her home, when Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel, about 35 years old, pointed a 32-caliber Bersa gun at the president's head. He pulled the trigger twice but none of the magazine's five serviceable cartridges were chambered. The object had a damaged serial number."
Supporters of the vice president gathered at the scene to sing songs in her support.
Attacker.
"Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel is the person who tried to fire at Cristina Fernández. He has a record for carrying a knife. He lives in the La Paternal neighborhood. In photographs of the attacker released by the media, a tattoo of the black sun, a neo-fascist symbol, can be seen on his elbow."
Investigation.
Sabag was quickly arrested by the victim's security and police elements. He was taken to a police tent where he is interrogated. Elements of the Argentine scientific police carried out expert investigations on the site.
"Alberto Fernández, president of Argentina, announced that María Eugenia Capuchetti is the judge in charge of the investigations and the prosecutor is Carlos Rívolo."
The president asked the judicial authorities for speed in the clarification as well as to take care of the detainee's life.
Background.
"For a week, the corner of the vice president's apartment has been in constant presence of sympathetic protesters, this presence responded to the previous presence of opposition protesters, in turn incited in response to a breakthrough in one of the corruption cases linked to Lázaro Báez on August 22."
Controversy.
"After the event, several doubts arose from some sectors of the population and the media, due to the way in which the assassination attempt against Fernández was raised. For example, the police had mistakenly broken into a home of the detainee, Sabag Montiel, but his real home had been located after a person showed up at a police station claiming that he had rented it for eight months , citing the serious lack of security on the part of the police to protect Fernández, Sabag Montiel came to aim just a few centimeters from his face."
"The attacker posted photos of his tattoos with Nazi symbols, such as the black sun, on Instagram, which generated speculation that if he worked alone or is part of an organization; political scientist Pedro Núñez told DW Español that ""the Justice obviously has to act quickly, since the worst that could happen is that this is diluted over time and more and more conspiracy theories appear about what happened."""
"Some Peronist politicians accused the opposition of promoting ""hatred"" towards Cristina Kirchner. The former president of Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, accused Fernández of ""self-victimizing"" and ""blaming"" the opposition without any investigation and impose a political holiday. The provincial deputy of Santa Fe, Amalia Granata, said that the attack on Fernández was ""armed"" and is ""a pantomime"" to victimize her."
The attack is added to the list of presidents of Argentina who suffered assassination attempts
Michelle Visage
"Michelle Visage (born Michelle Lynn Shupack; September 20, 1968) is an American radio DJ, singer, actress, media personality, television host producer and former showgirl."
"As a member of the band Seduction, she earned five singles with the group that charted on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. In 1993, as lead vocalist in The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M., she reached the top of the dance charts. In 2011, she joined the American reality competition series ""RuPaul's Drag Race"". She has served as a permanent judge since season three.

Probability density function
"In probability and statistics, a probability density function is a function that characterizes any continuous probability distribution. For a random variable ""X"", the probability density function of X is sometimes written as formula_1. The integral of the probability density function in the interval formula_2 yields the probability that a given random variable with the given density is contained in the interval provided. By definition, the probability density function is non-negative throughout its domain, on which the integral sums up to 1."
Probability density versus probability mass function.
The probability mass function is to a discrete probability distribution what the probability density function is to a continuous probability distribution. The probability density function is necessary to be able to work with continuous distributions.
"A random variable with a continuous probability distribution can take on any value within that distribution. Casting a dice will give the numbers 1 to 6, with a probability of formula_3, but this is not a continuous function, as only the numbers 1 to 6 are possible."
"In contrast, two people will not have the same height or the same weight. Using a probability density function, it is possible to determine the probability for people between and , or between and , even though there are infinitely many values between these two bounds."
Model airplane
A model airplane is a small sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. It may be a replica of an existing airplane or an imaginary aircraft.
"Model aircraft are generally divided into two basic types, flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also called static, display, or shelf models. Flying models range from simple toy gliders to powered scale models. Some can be very large, especially when used to simulate the conditions of a real flight. Static models range from mass-produced toys to highly accurate models used for museum display."
Aircraft manufacturers and researchers use wind tunnel models. They are used for testing new designs and development of new ones. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modeled.
Heidi Cruz
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz (née Nelson;born on August 7, 1972) is an American investment manager at Goldman Sachs. She is the spouse of Republican Texas senator and 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz."
Personal life.
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz was born on August 7, 1972 in San Luis Obispo, California, and grew up in a Seventh-day Adventist family. Cruz's political interest developed when she traveled to Washington with her parents at age 8, and grew when she was age 12 and read an issue of Time magazine concerning the 1984 presidential election."
"She graduated with a B.A. in Economics and International Relations from Claremont McKenna College in 1994. She was active in Claremont McKenna's Republican group, but was asked to resign after spying on Bill Clinton's campaign for reelection. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management in Brussels, Belgium and in 2000, she graduated with a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School."
"Heidi married Ted Cruz on May 27, 2001. Heidi met Ted Cruz while the two were working together on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. In April 2008, Cruz gave birth to her first child, Caroline Camille Cruz. Her second daughter, Catherine Christiane Cruz, was born in 2011."
Career.
"In 2003, she worked for the Bush administration on economic policy, eventually becoming the director for the Western Hemisphere on the National Security Council under National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in 2003. She left Washington DC in 2004 to support Ted Cruz's run for elective office in Texas."
"Cruz has worked for three investment banks, JP Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs."
"In 2005, she joined Goldman Sachs, serving as a private wealth manager and is currently the Region Head for the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman Sachs in Houston."
2016 presidential election.
"Ted Cruz said that the decision for him to run for president was difficult for his wife, because she was busy with her business career and raising their 2 children. She changed her mind after listening to a CD from her sister-in-law."
"Cruz was there the day her husband announced his run for president in March 2015. When Ted Cruz was criticized for not being born in the United States and running for president, Heidi defended Cruz by saying that the questioning showed that Ted Cruz was winning and his opponents wanted to defame him as a result."

Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution says that if the President becomes unable to do his or her job, the Vice President becomes the President (Section 1) or Acting President (Sections 3 or 4). This can happen for a short period of time, if the President is just sick or disabled for a short time. It could also happen until the end of the President's term (the President's time in office), if the President died, resigned, or is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office""."
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment also says what should happen if there is a ""vacancy"" in the Vice President's office (meaning there is no Vice President)."
"The Amendment was ratified by the states and became part of the U.S. Constitution on February 10, 1967."
Background.
of the Constitution says:
"This means that if the President is fired, dies, resigns, or is unable ""to discharge [his] Powers and Duties"" (unable to do the things a President has to do), the Vice President will take over their job. The Vice President will do the President's job until they get better (if they are just sick or disabled), or until the next Presidential election (if the President resigned or is dead). If neither the President nor the Vice President can do the President's job, Congress can decide who takes over the President's job. This is all the Constitution says about this subject."
This clause was not very specific. It did not say:
"In 1841, the ninth President, William Henry Harrison, became the first United States President to die in office. Before this, Representative John Williams had suggested that the Vice President should become Acting President if the President died. Also, after Harrison died, his Cabinet had met and decided that Vice President John Tyler would become ""Vice-President Acting President."" However, Tyler did not like this idea. He announced that he had become the President, and was not just doing the old President's job. He refused to look at any papers that were addressed to him as ""Acting President."""
"Tyler took the Presidential Oath, moved into the White House, and took over all of the old President's powers. Nobody formally challenged Tyler's claim to the Presidency. Eventually, both Houses of Congress passed a resolution saying that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States. This created ""the precedent of full succession."" A precedent is a rule or law that might be followed in the future if a similar situation came up again. ""Full succession"" means that the Vice President would become the President, not Acting President, if the actual President died. The ""precedent of full succession"" became known as the ""Tyler Precedent."""
"At other times, Presidents did not die, but they were unable to do their jobs because of illness. For example, during his Presidency, Woodrow Wilson had a stroke. However, the First Lady, Edith Wilson, and the official White House doctor kept the stroke a secret. Because of this, no one took over the Presidency, even though Wilson could not do the job at that time."
"Before the 25th Amendment, the office of Vice President had been empty eighteen times because the Vice President died, resigned, or had to take over for the President. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly four years after Franklin D. Roosevelt died."
These problems made it clear that the government needed more specific rules.
Kennedy assassination.
"On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Kennedy's assassination made it very clear to Congress that they needed to figure out a solution about presidential succession right away. The United States was in the middle of the Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had previously had a heart attack in 1955 along with a family history of Johnson men dying relatively young (in their early 60s, which he did in 1973 aged 64). The next two people in line for the presidency were the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John McCormack (who was 71 years old), and the President pro tempore of the Senate, Carl Hayden (who was 86 years old). Congress started moving more quickly."
Proposals.
Members of Congress suggested two different amendments to fill in the details missing from Clause 6.
"The KeatingKefauver Proposal suggested allowing Congress to make a law about who should decide when a President is disabled. It was proposed in 1963 by Senator Kenneth Keating of New York,p. 345 and supported by Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver.p. 28 However, other Senators were worried that Congress could abuse this power, or would not actually make the law after the amendment was passed.pp. 30–35"
"The BayhCeller Proposal ended up becoming the Twenty-fifth Amendment. On January 6, 1965, Senator Birch Bayh proposed the amendment in the United States Senate, and Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) proposed it in the United States House of Representatives. Unlike the KeatingKefauver Proposal, it suggested a way to fill the Vice President's position if it was empty, and also set out rules for how a President could be declared ""disabled.""pp. 348–350"
"On February 19, 1965, the Senate passed the amendment. However, the House passed a different version of the amendment on April 13. The House and Senate had to form committees to figure out a version of the amendment they could all agree on. On July 6, 1965, both Houses of Congress passed the final version of the amendment and sent it to the states for ratification."
Ratification.
"As with all Constitutional amendments proposed by the Congress, the Twenty-fifth Amendment had to be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38 of 50). Ratification was complete 19 months after the Amendment was proposed. Another nine states subsequently also ratified the Amendment; three states did not vote to ratify the Amendment."
The states ratified the Amendment in this order:
Effects.
Section 1: Presidential succession.
"Section 1 made the ""Tyler Precedent"" a law. It says that if a President is removed from office, dies, or resigns, the Vice President immediately becomes President (not ""Acting President"")."
Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy.
"Before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, if the Vice President's position was empty, it stayed empty until the next election."

Windows Mobile
Windows Mobile is a discontinued operating system that came with basic applications for mobile devices.
It is designed to look like desktop versions of Microsoft Windows.
"The first version was Pocket PC 2000, released in April 2000. It was based on the kernel of Windows CE 3.0 (Handheld PC 2000). Then came Pocket PC 2002, released about two weeks before Windows XP. It was similar to 2000, having full compatibility with Windows CE. Windows Mobile 2003, released in April 2003, was the first version called Windows Mobile. It was software-compatible with Windows"
CE 3.x and 4.x.
"Windows Mobile 5 was released around July/August 2005. It was similar to WM2003, except for a few new additions."
Windows Mobile 6.0 was released in February 2007 and had a kernel powered by Windows CE 6.x.
"6.1 in 2008 was much the same, and 6.5, released in 2009/2010, was the last version."
It was discontinued in March 2010 and replaced by Windows Phone.
"Microsoft ended sale of Windows Mobile devices on June 13, 2010 and ended all support of it on August 21, 2010."
"Two months later, Windows Phone was released."
Shoot (professional wrestling)
"A Shoot is something in professional wrestling that is completely real and is not scripted. In other words, broken kayfabe. A shoot rarely happens."
Worked shoot.
"On the scripted level, a Worked shoot is a scripted segment that takes place in a show with elements of reality being exposed, such as an off-screen incident between wrestlers being used as fuel for an on-screen rivalry between them. It can also be a segment that fans are meant to believe is a shoot, but is not."

Sustainable biofuels
"Biofuels are fuels from plant materials. They offer the prospect of oil price moderation. Some biofuels can supply sustainable energy. Responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia."
Biofuel options.
"There are many biofuel options which are available. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition."
"Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources."
Lord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several trade-offs:
"Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product."
"According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland."

"The campus, roughly bounded between 31st and 35th streets, Michigan Avenue and the Dan Ryan Expressway, was designed by modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, ""one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture"", who chaired the IIT School of Architecture from 1938 to 1958. Van der Rohe's master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived. The campus has twenty of his works. It is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world. The layout of the campus departs radically from ""traditional college quadrangles and limestone buildings"". The materials are inspired by the factories and warehouses of Chicago's South Side and ""embod[y] 20th century methods and materials: steel and concrete frames with curtain walls of brick and glass."""
"Alfred Caldwell designed the campus landscape. Caldwall was van der Rohe's close colleague at IIT and was called ""the last representative of the Prairie School of landscape architects."" Known as ""the nature poet"", Caldwell's plan reinforced van der Rohe's design with ""landscaping planted in a free-flowing manner, which in its interaction with the pristine qualities of the architecture, introduce[d] a poetic aspect."""
"On the west side of Main Campus are three red brick buildings that were original to Armour Institute, built between 1891 and 1901. In 1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe began his 20-year tenure as director of IIT's School of Architecture (1938–1959). The university was on the verge of building a brand new campus, to be one of the nation's first federally funded urban renewal projects. Mies was given great freedom in the large project. The university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized. From 1943 to 1957, several new Mies buildings rose across campus, including the S.R. Crown Hall, which houses the architecture school, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001."
"Though Mies had emphasized his wish to complete the campus he had begun, commissions from the late 50s onward were given to Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM), prompting Mies to never return to the campus that had changed architecture the world over. SOM architect Walter Netsch designed a few buildings, including the new library that Mies had wished to create, all of them similar to Mies's style. By the late 1960s, campus addition projects were given to SOM's Myron Goldsmith, who had worked with Mies during his education at IIT and thus was able to design several new buildings to harmonize well with the original campus. In 1976, the American Institute of Architects recognized the campus as one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The new campus center, designed by Rem Koolhaas, and a new state-of-the-art residence hall designed by Helmut Jahn, State Street Village, opened in 2003. These were the first new buildings built on the Main Campus in 32 years."
"In 1976, American Institute of Architects named the IIT campus one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The IIT Main Campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005."
Hermann Minkowski
Hermann Minkowski (22 June 1864 in Kaunas – 12 January 1909 in Göttingen) was a German mathematician of Jewish descent. He was one of Albert Einstein's teachers.
"Minkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905), could be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space-time, since known as the ""Minkowski spacetime""."
Certificate of deposit
"A certificate of deposit (CD) is a way to store money at a bank or credit union. A CD is written for a period of time: usually between three months and five years. The person who wanted the CD—the consumer—agrees to give the money to the bank for that period of time and may not take the money back until the time has expired. If the consumer takes the money back before the agreed amount of time, they will have to pay a penalty fee. Once your contract is over, you are given your money back plus the interest it earned. People open CDs instead of savings accounts because the interest is higher. A certificate of deposit (which is common only in the United States) is similar to a time deposit."
Cousins Subs
"Cousins Subs is a ""sub"" shop that makes submarine sandwiches. It was created in the 1970s in Wisconsin."
"They opened their first restaurant in Milwaukee, at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive. It closed after several years of success. The oldest Cousins Subs is on the corner of Brady Street and Farwell Avenue in Milwaukee."
"Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch, or simply Alexander Gode (October 30, 1906 – August 10, 1970), was a German-American linguist, and translator. He helped create the auxiliary language Interlingua."
Oceania
"Oceania is a name used in geography for the region made up of Australia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and several other island nations in the surrounding area. It is often listed as one of the continents of the world."
"The term ""Oceania"" does not have one single agreed definition. The widest definition of Oceania includes the entire region between continental Asia and the Americas, including Australasia, as well as islands in the Pacific Rim such as the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, and the Aleutian islands."
"On the other hand, the Oceania ecozone includes all of Micronesia, Fiji, and all of Polynesia except New Zealand. Sometimes, people use the term 'Oceania' to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean, as separate from Australasia. When Oceania is treated separately from Australia, the region of Oceania is referred to as ""Australia and Oceania""."
"In the United Nations' geographic regions, Oceania includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not the Malay Archipelago or Indonesian New Guinea."
"A smaller usage of Oceania as a continent includes only Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and the islands between them. This part of the world is usually called Australasia instead. For these reasons, it is ""not"" correct to say that Australasia is part of Oceania, because what is meant by 'Oceania' is not clear. Australasia has an exact definition in biogeography and geology; Australasia includes New Zealand, Australia (including Tasmania), and Melanesia, New Guinea, and the islands just north and east of Australia. All these are south-east of the Bali–Lombok line, also known as the Wallace Line."
Southern Ocean
"The Southern Ocean is the ocean around Antarctica. It means the waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans around the continent of Antarctica. Since the 1770s geographers have discussed its limits. Nowadays, sixty degrees south latitude is often accepted. Some people call this ocean the Antarctic Ocean."
"The total area is 20,327,000 km², and the coastline length is 17,968 km."
Catalan language
"The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencian Community, the eastern part of Aragon, the Balearic Islands, a small zone of Murcia (all of them in Spain), Andorra, North Catalonia (in France) and the Italian city of L'Alguer. Together, those places are often called the Catalan Countries."
"The language that most similar is Occitan. Catalan also has similarities to other Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese. It came from Vulgar Latin and was first spoken in the in the Eastern Pyrenees in the Middle Ages."
There are about 4 million people who speak Catalan as a first language and about 6 million people as a second language. Catalan is the sixth-most-spoken Romance language and also the most-spoken language that is not an official language in the European Union.
Corset
A corset is a body covering undergarment (clothes worn under others).
It is made in many forms.
Pop music
"Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to. The term ""pop music"" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word ""pop music"" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular. Styles of pop music in the 2020s (today) include rock music, electronic dance music and hip hop. Pop music tends to change quite a lot so the description is quite flexible."
History.
"Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll, (for example Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard) and rockabilly (for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly). In the 1960s, The Beatles became a famous pop music group. In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as funk and soul music. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker."
How does the business of pop music work?
"There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video. These people include the studio staff (people who help the musicians to record CDs and music videos in music studios), production staff (people who help make the music recordings sound good), distribution staff (people who help sell the music to stores) and retail staff (people that sell the music to people at CD stores)."
"Tour staff help the band to travel around the country (or around the world) for their concert tours. Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage. Other tour staff drive buses or cars, so that the band can get to the concert. Some tour staff operate sound equipment, such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify (make louder) the band's music for the audience."
"Promotional staff help to market or promote the band's music, so that more people will know about the band, and buy the band's CDs. Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band's CD to radio station managers or DJs (disk jockeys: the people who announce songs on the radio). Other promotional staff write press releases (short articles) about the band which are sent to the newspapers."
Types of music that became pop music.
"Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s, when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults."
Teuku Iskandar
"Teuku Iskandar is an Indonesian scholar, literary critic, and lexicographer. Teuku Iskandar is one of the native Indonesians (Acehnese) who are eager to explore the books that record the Sumatra's civilizations (mainly Acehnese and Malay)."
Biography.
Background.
"Teuku Iskandar was born at Trienggadeng, Pidie, Aceh (part of modern-day Indonesia). He is a native Acehnese who was born to a father who are an ""uleebalang"" ( 'district chief' in Acehnese) in Aceh."
Early life.
"In 1947, a day after Queen Juliana appointed as regent, the 18-year-old Teuku Iskandar was able to continue his study at Leiden University in Leiden (part of Netherlands."
"In 1955, he earned his doctorate from Leiden University with a dissertation which was later published as a book, ""De Hikajat Atjeh"" ( 'Acehnese Annals'). Topics related to Aceh has became his personal interest, which also became his dissertation. His insterest is mainly driven by his personal background because at that time he was part of the first generation of Acehnese who studied at Leiden University. Moreover, at that time there were not as many Acehnese books written by native Indonesians. In addition, Teuku Iskandar adore the Acehnese culture so much, as he told to his children."
1960s.
"In the 1960s, Teuku Iskandar asked by Sukarno (the first president of Indonesia) to be part of the founders of a state university in Aceh which later known as Syiah Kuala University and briefly served as the dean for the Faculty of Economics for several years."
Studies.
"His diligence in studying Malay literature and culture in Sumatra attracted another countries interest, such as Malaysia who had no capable scholars at that time as newly created country, he is offered to work at the ""Dewan Pustaka dan Bahasa"" ( 'Language and Library Council') of Malaysia. During his tenure, Teuku Iskandar asked by Malaysia's linguistic council to copied the ""Bahasa Indonesia dan Pembakuannya"" ( 'Indonesian Language and its Standardization') and ""Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia"" ( 'Great Dictionary of Indonesian Language') who are developed by Raja Ali Haji (an Indonesian scholar) since 19th century and Anton Moeliono in 1969 to re-branded and claimed it as the ""Kamus Dewan"" ( 'Dictionary of Malay Language') that published in 1970 to became the main linguistic reference for Malay language. At the same time, he was also asked by the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam to become a lecture at the University of Brunei Darussalam and he received a professorship from the university. His works are still used as the main linguistic source for Standard Malay until nowadays."
Return to Leiden.
"Teuku Iskandar later returned to Leiden to give lecture. At his alma mater (Leiden University), he became a professor for Acehnese and Malay literature, and also gave special classes in the Acehnese language. As a Acehnese lover, he also continues to produce his works related to Aceh including the Catalog of Acehnese Manuscripts compiled with Voorhoeve, two large volumes of the Catalog of Malay, Minangkabau and South Sumatra, and Manuscripts in the Netherlands."
Perspectives from his daughters.
"Studying classical literary manuscripts is a job that not many people can do. It takes passion, perseverance, thoroughness and high concentration. But indeed, such qualities seem to be attached to Teuku Iskandar. ""Dad really likes history and art"", said Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar who are the second daughter of Teuku Iskandar. Teuku Iskandar is very thorough even in reading the books he referenced."
"As a close daughter, Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar often found his father's handwritten notes in reference books, which indicated that the information in the books could be referenced or questioned. Ubit also said that his father is the type of person who reads and contemplates a lot. Despite his abundant knowledge, he is not an 'outsider' or talkative person. Not all of his interlocutors can also make him interested in talking. But if he meets someone he thinks is sharp-minded, this father of three will be an extraordinary storyteller. “When there is a moment like that, my mother usually asks me to bring a recording device to save the interesting conversation,” recalls Ubit."
"Teuku Iskandar is also a scholar and person who holds principles. He's not the kind of person who wants to please others but rather be himself. In Ubit's eyes, his father was not interested in politics even though he loved Sumatran (especially Acehnese and Malay) culture very much, he was an intellectual who carried himself as a citizen of the world. Also not many people know that Teuku Iskandar is very fond of architectural history. According to Ubit, it can be said that his father's first love was precisely in architecture. However, because his chemistry skills were not sufficient to become a scholar of architecture, he then chose to study literature."
Architecture.
"Teuku Iskandar's passion for architecture can be found in his residence in Jakarta which he designed himself. He also built a rest house with an English garden-style garden in Bogor, which he also designed his own architecture. At his home in the Netherlands, Teuku Iskandar designed a fireplace made of wood from a bridge from the 17th century with Acehnese decorations. One of his other hobbies is sketching. Teuku also once conveyed his dream to his sons and daughters, he wanted to build a farmhouse in Aceh. ""I have a dream (to develop) in Aceh"", Ubit remembers his father."
Translations.
"In one of his works, a book that discusses ""Bustanas-Salatin"" by Nuruddin ar-Ranniry, Teuku Iskandar asked Ubit to translate it into English. For years, father and daughter studied books by 17th century clerics who were read by scholars and sultans in the Kingdom of Aceh. For Ubit, it was a wonderful experience that was unforgettable."
Reputation.
"As a respected scholar (mainly in Indonesia), Teuku Iskandar is a very down-to-earth person. Cut Rosmanida, his first daughter who lived in Medan, said, “Father is a humble and simple person. His demeanor is mediocre. When you go home to Aceh, you always ask for Acehnese food to be cooked. He likes all Acehnese dishes.” A valuable lesson from his father that he always reminded him to be proud to be Acehnese and proud to speak Acehnese language."
Awards.
"Teuku Iskandar awarded with the ‘""Satyalancana Budaya""’ award by the national government of the Republic Indonesia due to his revolutionary and persistent works especially in terms of Sumatra's linguistic and culture (mainly Acehnese and Malay). Responding to the award given by the government to his father, Cut Rosmanida expressed his gratitude. “I am happy and excited that my dad are one of the recipients of the award. I thank God and thank the government (for these honour)"", said Cut Rosmanida beaming."
Borislav Ivkov
"Borislav Ivkov (November 12, 1933 – February 14, 2022) was a Serbian chess Grandmaster. He was a World championship candidate in 1965. He played in four more Interzonal tournaments, in 1967, 1970, 1973, and 1979. Ivkov was born in Belgrade, then-Yugoslavia. He was a three-time Yugoslav Champion (1958, 1963, 1972) and was the first World Junior Champion in 1951."
"Ivkov died on February 14, 2022 at the age of 88."

Controversies.
"In 2009, several groups, including the American Family Foundation, attacked SpongeBob for being homosexual. The character had recently appeared on a music video with other kids' show characters to promote diversity and tolerance. However, the creator said in 2002 that SpongeBob is asexual, meaning that he does not seek sexual partners at all."
Decreasing quality.
"Many fans and critics believe that after season 11 and the first movie, the series started to decline in quality. This was because many writers from the first three seasons seasons left (although Doug Lawrence, Aaron Springer, Erik Wiese and C.H. Greenblatt still stayed). Some of the later episodes were poorly received because the characters did not act the way they acted in the first three seasons. However, apparently, the show's quality improved once more after the second movie, when Stephen Hillenburg returned, until his death in 2018."
Paul &amp; Paula
"Paul &amp; Paula (Ray Hildebrand, born December 21, 1940, and Jill Jackson, born May 20, 1942) are a pop/rock singing duo. They charted three ""Billboard"" Top 40 singles in 1963."
Seafood
Seafood is food made from fish or other sea animals such as shrimp and lobsters. The harvesting (collecting) of seafood is called fishing.
Seafood is rich in protein and is usually thought as healthy food.
Peer review
"Peer review is a process used when publishing documents where the work is reviewed by the author's peer group (someone in their field). It is a way of checking and reviewing a person's work. It is often used by scientists, scholars, medical professionals, engineers, and in some aspects of government."
"For example, scientists report new discoveries through a peer review process. This means that they ask other knowledgeable scientists (peers) to review their report, and check for any problems. The problems must be fixed before the report is released to other scientists. This process helps to maintain the trustworthiness of scientific discoveries."
Puerto Rico
"Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean Sea. This means that it is part of the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but there has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence."
"Puerto Rico has almost 4 million (4,000,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English. The currency used is the United States dollar. ""Puerto Rico"" means ""rich port"" in Spanish."
"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. The common languages are Spanish spoken by 94.7% of the population and English, spoken by 5.3%."
"On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy. It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history."
Status with respect to the USA.
"Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. Because it is not a state, citizens cannot vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives."
History.
"The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it ""San Juan Bautista"", the people living there were the ""Taínos""."
"Since it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery."
"The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States."
"During the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish–American war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards, in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established."
"The political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country."
"In May 2022, Members of Congress sponsoring competing bills on how to resolve Puerto Rico’s territorial status and its relationship to the U.S. have come together to introduce new legislation combining both. The proposed legislation combines elements of the pro-statehood bill introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, alongside the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, both New York Democrats. The draft legislation says that a plebiscite to resolve Puerto Rico’s political status shall be held on November 5, 2023."
Geography.
"Puerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390 feet (1,338 meters)"

Hugo Black
"Hugo LaFayette Black (February 27, 1886 – September 25, 1971) was an American judge and politician. He was from Ashland, Alabama and studied law at the University of Alabama. Black was poor as a child and lived simply for most of his life. Black was in the Army during World War I. In the 1920s, Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Black was a member of the U.S. Senate from Alabama from 1927 to 1936 as a Democrat. Black was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt for President and his New Deal policies. In 1937, Roosevelt put Black on the United States Supreme Court. Black supported many New Deal organizations and programs which his fellow judges wanted to limit or strike down. Black often believed in interpreting the Constitution exactly as it was written (textualism), against ideas both that judges had the power to re-interpret the meaning in accordance with their time, or that it could be taken as a general guideline that lawmakers should follow but also consider other interests. One prominent example is the First Amendment, which Black believed to literally protect any form of ""freedom of speech"" against a law that would ""abridge"" (meaning to hinder) it, or at least laws prohibiting certain ""opinions"". He also believed that the Fourteenth Amendment meant this applied to states as well as the federal government, and that states subsequently could not limit free speech and other constitutional liberties anymore than the federal government. For many years most jurists and judges had believed this. He also did not believe in the substantive due process doctrine, meaning that the Fourteenth Amendment secured certain ""implicit"" rights regarding privacy and so on, which were not written into the constitution but had to be made by judges as they went along. Black believed that, while the Constitution promised generous liberties, judges should never decide for themselves on which these liberties should be. (Because of this he also did not believe in things such as natural law, which he called ""mysterious"".) This contradiction is uncommon among later judges. He did not believe in a right to privacy, which is not expressed in the constitution, and voted against one in the case ""Griswold v. Connecticut"". He did, famously, vote against segregation in ""Brown v. Board of Education"" (1954), an important case that began the desegregation of schools. Black was the fifth longest-serving justice in American history. He served on the Court for 35 years, one of the very longest tenures, and was the last of president Roosevelt's appointees except William O. Douglas (who served 36 years, the longest). Black died of a stroke in 1971, which happened two days after he chose to leave the Supreme Court. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery."
"One of the most famous judgments Black wrote is called ""Korematsu v. United States"" in 1944. In this case, the majority believed the imprisoning of civilian (non-military) Japanese Americans during World War II was just or at least acceptable, under the circumstances. This is one of the most controversial verdicts of the Supreme Court in its history and often seen as a stark contrast (meaning opposite) to what he stood for in most other cases."
Abhar
"Abhar is a city in northwestern Iran. In the year 2006 there were 55,266 people living there."
Colugo
Colugos are gliding mammals in the order Dermoptera.
"There are two living species, found in south-east Asia. They are also called 'flying lemurs', though they are not lemurs (all lemurs are in Madagascar). They can glide long distances, as they have a thin membrane stretched to the ends of the tail and each limb."
Life style.
"Colugos live in the tropical rain forests of southeast Asia. Their diet includes leaves and young shoots. During the day they rest high in the trees, clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes. At dusk they become active, gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind. The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane."
Habitat.
"Colugos range from Burma, Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. They also occur throughout Borneo. A second colugo species inhabits the southern Philippines."
Butter
Butter is a dairy food. It is made by moving the cream from whole milk for a long time. The fat in the milk separates from the liquid. The fat is butter.
"Butter is often put on on bread, as a main ingredient in biscuits, as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes, and for frying foods."
"Often, butter is made from cows' milk, butter can also be made from the milk of other mammals, like sheep, goats, bison, and yaks. Salt, flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to butter."
Many people use butter in their foods instead of oil.
It has a melting point of about .
There are 717 calories in of butter.
Types.
Cultured butter is a butter made from fermented cream. Sweet cream butter is butter made from pasteurized fresh cream. Raw cream butter is butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream.
Cold War
"The Cold War was the tense fighting between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union (also called the USSR) and its allies between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union. It is called the ""Cold"" War because the Americans and the Soviet Union never actually fought each other directly. Instead, they attacked each other in conflicts known as proxy wars in which powerful countries fight a foreign war but do not send their own troops."
Conflicting countries.
"Most of the countries on one side were allied by NATO, whose most powerful country was the United States. Most of the countries on the other side were allied by the Warsaw Pact, whose most powerful country was the Soviet Union."
"The Western Bloc was the name of the capitalist countries led by the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an alliance created in 1949 and included the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Greece, and Turkey. Other countries allied with the Western Bloc include Israel, Brazil, South Korea, Kenya (1960-1991), Bangladesh (1964-1968), Pakistan, North Yemen, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand."
"The Eastern Bloc was the group of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was an alliance created in 1955 and included the USSR, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary (until 1976), Poland, and Romania. Other countries allied with the Eastern Bloc included Angola (1975–1991), Cuba, Bolivia, Cambodia (1977–1979), South Yemen, Tunisia, Nepal, Bhutan, Libya (1974–1991), Mongolia (1976–1988), Jamaica, North Korea, China and Laos (1975–1991)."
Background.
"In February 1917, Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire was overthrown because people were unhappy with their living conditions (like being a serf), especially during World War I. The new government in Russia was a democratic socialist government. Unfortunately, it was ineffective, and people were still unhappy. In November 1917, a communist group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the new government and were supported by groups of workers called Soviets. The Bolsheviks created a new communist government called the Russian Soviet Federation Socialist Republic (also called simply Soviet Russia or the Russian SFSR)."
"However, not everyone supported the communists. Many countries that had been part of the Russian Empire had left, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Belarus. The Russian Civil War began, with the Soviet Russian Red Army fighting against the White Army of anticommunist Russians. The White Army was not very united or organized. The Allied Powers of World War I, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, invaded Russia to support the White Army and stop the Red Army. The Red Army eventually won the war in 1922, and established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also called the Soviet Union), along with the newly formed Socialist Republics of Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
The start of the Cold War in 1947 was caused by a belief that all governments would become either communist or capitalist. The Western Allies feared that the Soviet Union would spread communism to the rest of Europe and was very concerned that Soviet agents had learnt how to make atomic bombs after the war.
"Both nations had opposed Nazi Germany although the United States worked with Nazi scientists and Soviet Union had chosen not to fight with Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the two occupied Poland in 1939. However, Germany turned against the Soviet Union in June 1941 and invaded it during Operation Barbarossa."
After World War II.
"After World War II, Germany was left in ruins. The victorious Allies that occupied it split it into four parts. in the western half of Germany, one part was given to the United States, one to the United Kingdom, and one to France. The eastern half was occupied by the USSR. The city of Berlin was also split among the four countries even though it was entirely within the eastern half."
"The Federal Republic of Germany (""Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" or BRD), or West Germany, was recognized by the Western Allies in June 1949 and was a capitalist democracy. West Berlin was considered a part of the country. The Soviets named their section of Germany the German Democratic Republic (""Deutsche Demokratische Republik"" or DDR), or East Germany, later in 1949; it was a communist dictatorship."
"From April 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin to prevent the city from using West Germany's currency. The United States and its allies supplied the city by airplanes until September 1949 in what became known as the Berlin Airlift. Many East Germans wanted to live in West Germany for having greater quality of life and political freedom. In 1961, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, dividing the two halves of the city, and heavily guarded it to prevent more people from escaping to the west. The wall was considered a symbol of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain that divided Europe."
1950s.
"Espionage, or ""spying,"" has been around for a long time and was very important during the Cold War. After its successful nuclear espionage in the Manhattan Project, the Soviets created their spy organs, especially the KGB. The CIA led Americans efforts abroad, and the FBI led counterespionage. Catching foreign spies and fighting domestic subversion were KGB functions."
"In 1953, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin died, and Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev took his place. Khrushchev later took sole control of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's Secret Speech marked a period of de-Stalinization, and Khrushchev tried to undo many of the things done by Stalin (such as the Gulag prisons and Stalin's cult of personality)."
"In the United States, there was a ""Red Scare"", and when the Soviets detonated their own atom bomb, there was a big political fallout and the United States government made everybody scared about communists. Famous people in many fields who had been Communist sympathizers in the past like Larry Adler lost their positions. Many actors were 'blacklisted' and so were not hired to act in movies, which ruined their careers. US Senator Joseph McCarthy was believed by many when he accused some important Americans of being communists, including some high government officials."
The 1950s were the beginning of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. It began with the Soviets putting the Sputnik 1 satellite into orbit around the Earth as the first country in space. The United States responded by starting NASA and soon sent up its own satellites. The Soviets also sent the first man (Yuri Gagarin) into Earth orbit and claimed that proved communism to be the better ideology.
"In the 1950s, the United States (under President Dwight Eisenhower) created a policy called ""New Look"" to cut defense spending and to increase the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking the West. The Soviets also increased their nuclear force, which resulted in mutual assured destruction."

Biscotti
"Biscotti is an Italian type of almond biscuit. It originated from the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo."
Biscotti is also known as cantucci.
History.
Italy.
"Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, ""biscotti di Prato"", in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name ""cantuccini"". These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds."
"The confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of ""Biscottificio Antonio Mattei,"" the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: ""Manufacturers of cantuccini,"" which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name ""cantuccini"" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily."
Preparation.
"Biscotti is made with flour, sugar, eggs and almonds or pine nuts. Sometimes they have a layer of glaze, usually chocolate."
The Jaguars
"The Jaguars (ザ・ジャガーズ, ""Za jagāzu"") is a Japanese group sound band that was created in 1964 until 1971. The band sung many both Japanese and English music covers, manly The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, Paul Revere And The Raiders, and other American and British band groups."
Overview.
"The predecessor of The Jaguars was active as an electric group at jazz cafes under the name of ""Yukio Miya and The Play Five"" in April 1964. In 1965, they began to appear regularly on electric programs such as the TV programs ""Beat No. 1"" and ""Young Pops Excite"", and the band's name recognition gradually increased. In May of the following year, Shin Okamoto, who was a 16 year old vocalist from Kanagawa at that time, reluctantly joined the group and they became popular in the magazines and songs. The Play Five was renamed to The Jaguars in June 1967 and made their record debut with ""Kimi Niaitai"" (Want To See You Again)."
"This debut songs was a big hit, and popular songs such as ""Dancing Lonely Night"" and ""Mademoiselle Bruce"" were skipped one after another. In March 1968, The Jaguars first and only appeared in many televisions shows and of course there was a movie called ""Make Way For The Jaguars"" (directed by Yôichi Maeda and produced by Shochiku), but at the end of the same month, the band leader Yukio Miya withdrew due to internal conflict with the music directors. After Yukio left the group, 19 year old Takeshi Hamano joined the alternative drums in April and Shin became the leader of the group at the age of 20. In June, they released a hit song ""The Legend of Xanadu"" and in September with ""Two People In The Starry Sky"", but in January 1969, ""Bruce for Lovers"" was a remarkably popular song like other GS songs. It has become a song that has been turned into a musical stage play."
"Around this time, the GS genre began to fade as disco and funky music became to flourish in Japan, and lead guitarist Hisayuki Okitsu left the group due to illness treatment, and in 1970, keyboardist Yasuji Sato and Takeshi Hamano also leaving, thus repeating member changes. After ""Someday Someone"" released in April 1970, they became active in nightclubs in Tokyo without a release song in 1971, but did not hold any dissolution concerts, and The Jaguars ended was in July 1971. After appearing in ""Goodbye Nikki Western Carnival"" in 1981, the band was reunited when ""Want To Meet You"" song was appointed as a commercial for Asahi Breweries, but in 2009, due to the death of Shin Okamoto, The band dissolved again soon after."
Vikram Bhatt
"Vikram Bhatt (born 27 January 1969 in Bombay) is an Indian film director, producer, screenwriter and actor. Formerly, he was the creative head of ASA Productions and Enterprises until 2014, when he resigned from the company."
"His directed his first film ""Jaanam"", which was produced by Mukesh Bhatt. His first four films did not fare well at the box office; his first successful directorial venture was ""Fareb"". Following this, he had multiple successful films such as ""Ghulam"", ""Kasoor"", ""Raaz"" and ""Awara Paagal Deewana"". After ""Awara Paagal Deewana"", he gave flops like ""Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage"", ""Deewane Huye Paagal"" and Ankahee. Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai was another flop although Bobby Deol's and Ameesha Patel's performances were well-received. In 2008, Bhatt came back with the horror genre and he delivered three films that were successful at the box office; these include ""1920,"" ""Shaapit,"" and ""Haunted – 3D"". In 2010, Bhatt introduced stereoscopic 3D for the first time in India with his film Haunted – 3D; the film was released in May 2011 and it then set the record of the highest grossing Hindi horror film of all time, making Rs. 270 million at the box office."
"In 2012, Bhatt's Raaz 3D recorded domestic box office collection of 729 million after the 3rd weekend and the overseas collection was at 46 million. Riding high with the success, Bhatt is writing another horror-thriller for Bipasha in the central role, with a more shocking image than Raaz 3. Following the success of Raaz 3, Vikram Bhatt's written Hindi horror movie which has been directed by debutant Bhushan Patel topped the first weekend collection chart at the box office and the approximate collection was Rs 124.3 million nett. The movie further collected approx Rs 37.5 million nett in the second Weekend, taking the total to Rs 228.6 million nett. The film has been declared a 'Hit'. Soon after, Bhatt signed a deal with Bhushan Kumar's T-Series to produce 5 films of sci-fi, thriller and horror genre. Two of the films will be directed by Bhatt himself."
"In early 2013, Bhatt announced his upcoming projects, Creature 3D, India's First 3D Monster Movie with Bipasha Basu in the lead role and 1920 London, third in the 1920 series. Vikram Bhatt will mark his foray into Marathi cinema with 'Ek Doosrey Ke Liye', which will be directed by Ashwini Kumar Patil."

Jack Stauber
"Jack Stauber (born April 6, 1996) is an American musician, animator, and YouTuber from McKean, Pennsylvania who now lives in Pittsburgh. He is known for his strange lyrics and accompanying music videos on YouTube used as internet memes. Stauber has been a member of the bands Joose and Zaki. In 2020, he won the Shorty Award for Best in Weird."
"His first album, ""Finite Form"" (2013), was released when he was 16. Inspired by folk music, his second album, ""Viator"" (2015), was released two years later. Stauber's third studio album ""Pop Food"" (2017) experimented with pop, lo-fi, and a 80s and 90s aesthetic. The first two tracks, ""Buttercup"" and ""Oh Klahoma"", went viral on TikTok, and has a combined 354 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. His latest album, ""HiLo"" (2018), has elements of funk, pop, and rock."
"Slangs for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: ""going down on"", ""giving a blowjob"", ""giving head"", or ""eating out"". The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. When a man performs fellatio on himself, it is called autofellatio, and autocunnilingus if a woman performs cunnilingus on herself. Few men and women are able to do this."
"People can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex, such as herpes (which can be passed between the mouth and groin), HIV and even oral cancer."
Anal sex.
"Anal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into a sexual partner's anus. Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself, however, semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina, and pregnancy may rarely occur. Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear, bleed and get infected with bacteria. For safety and pleasure, partners often use condoms, female condoms and/or lubrication."
Painful sexual act.
"A painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse due to physical and/or emotional causes. Doctors call the condition ""dyspareunia"". It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives."
Ctenophore
"The phylum Ctenophora, the comb jellies, is a phylum of marine invertebrates. They are part of the plankton, and there are also pelagic species. The phylum includes the sea gooseberry (""Pleurobrachia pileus"") and Venus' girdle (""Cestum veneris"")."
The phylum was grouped with Cnidaria (jellyfish) in the former Coelenterata phylum. Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals.
"Even though they look like jellyfish, they are zoologically not related to them. They lack the characteristic nematocysts (stinging cells), but have ""colloblasts"", sticky cells that snare small victims. They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb, hence Ctenophore = comb-bearer. Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous"
"system. There are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea."
"Although there are a few benthic species, most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age."
Colour and light.
"Many planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by ""diffraction"", the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness. However some groups appear incapable of bioluminescence."
Croats
"Croats () are a South Slavic ethnic group mostly living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and nearby countries. There are around 5 million Croats living in the southern Central Europe region, along the east bank of the Adriatic Sea and an estimated 9 million throughout the world. Large Croat communities exist in a number of countries, including Chile, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa. Croats are noted for their unique culture, which comes from their location on the edge of the Western world which subjected them to various non European influences. The Croats are predominantly Catholic and their language is Croatian."
Poles
"The Polish people, or Poles (, singular ""Polak"") are a Slavic nation and ethnic group native to Poland, they are bounded by the Polish language, which belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of west slavic languages of Central Europe, living mainly in Poland. Their religion is mainly Roman Catholic. They use modified Latin alphabet."
"There are about 60 million Poles in the world. Besides Poland, many live in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and elsewhere."
"The most famous Poles are Pope John Paul II, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Nicolaus Copernicus and Lech Wałęsa."
"Polish names often end with ""-ski"", ""-ska"", ""-cki"" or ""-cka""."
The most popular Polish surnames are Nowak and Kowalski.
Histories (Herodotus)
"The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus is considered the first work of history in Western literature. Written about 440 BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek, ""The Histories"" tells the story of the Greco-Persian Wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city-states in the 5th century BC."
Thracians
"The ancient Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes who spoke the Thracian language - a rare branch of the Indo-European language family. Those peoples lived in Thrace: the eastern, central and southern part of the Balkan peninsula, and the adjacent parts of Eastern Europe. The Pomak claimed to be descendants of this old Trachians. Today People from Thrace, no matter if they are Turks, Bulgarians, Greeks, Pomak or Xoraxane Roma, said simple we are Thracians."
"According to Pliny the Elder, an expedition of Mauretanians sent by Juba II to the archipelago visited the islands: when King Juba II dispatched a contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador (historical name of Essaouira, Morocco) in the early 1st century CE Juba's naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, Madeira and probably the Cape Verde islands, using Mogador as their mission base."
"We have even recorded historically that, according to Pliny the Elder, the Greek Xenophon of Lampsacus stated that the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) were situated two days from ""Hesperu Ceras"" (today called Cap-Vert), the westernmost part of the African continent, showing a knowledge of the area by the Romans."
"Furthermore, according to Pliny the Elder and his citation by Gaius Julius Solinus, the sea voyage time crossing the Gorgades (Cape Verde islands) to the islands of the Ladies of the West (""Hesperides"", actual São Tomé and Príncipe and Fernando Po) was around 40 days: this fact has created academic discussions about the possibility of further Roman travels toward Guinea and even the Gulf of Guinea. A Roman coin of the emperor Trajan has been found in Congo."
"Aelius Gallus in 25 BCE led an expedition across the Red Sea against the Sabaeans of Arabia Felix (modern Yemen). In order to control Sabaea the Romans took control of both sides of the entrance to the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, since Cornelius Gallus had established a garrison at Arsinoe (near Assab, in actual Eritrea) on the Ethiopian shore."
This was the only Roman outpost in eastern Africa south of Egypt and lasted a few decades.
Maritime commerce.
"Emperor Augustus decided that the circumnavigation of Africa should also be attempted (in 1 BC). Romans had two naval ouposts in the Atlantic coast of Africa: Sala near present Rabat and Mogador in southern Maroc (north of Agadir). The island of Mogador prospered for the local exploitation of purple (highly esteemed in imperial Rome) from Augustus until Septimius Severus times. Augustus, based even in the discovery of a sunken merchant ship from southern Spain in the Djibuti area (done by his adoptive son Gaius Caesar when he sailed toward Aden), wanted to organize an expedition from Egypt to Mogador and Sala around Africa."
The eastern coast of Africa south of Egypt was at the center of a huge sea commerce between Rome and India through the Somali coast.
"Roman books such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and Ptolomey's ""Geography"" list a string of market places (emporia) along this coast. Finds of Roman-era coins along the coast confirm the existence of this huge trade even in coastal Tanzania, and Ptolomey's Geography refers to a town of Rhapta as ""metropolis"" of a political entity called Azania near actual Zanzibar. Archaeologists have not yet succeeded in identifying the location of Rhapta, though many believe it lies deeply buried in the silt of the delta of the Rufiji River."
"The scholar Felix Chami found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafija island near the Kenyan coast and, not far away, on the African mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River and the northern Mozambique coast, which he dated to the first few centuries AD."
"Roman coins have been found in Zimbabwe and Madagascar, supporting the possibility that Roman vessels sailed south of Azania toward the area of the gold mines of the Zambesi river and the legendary Greater Zimbabwe kingdom."
The Little Match Girl
"""The Little Match Girl"" is a story by Hans Christian Andersen. It was first published in December 1845. Andersen got the idea to write the story after seeing a print by Johan Thomas Lundbye of a little girl selling matches. The story has been adapted to various media including an animated movie."
Story.
"A little match girl in poverty lights all the matches she carries to keep herself warm on a cold New Year's Eve. Afraid of beating by her father when she could not sell any match, she could not return home. In the glow of the firelight, she sees wonderful visions of a Christmas tree and a festive dinner. In the sky, she sees a shooting star, which her late grandmother had told means someone is on their way to Heaven. The last vision is her dead grandmother, the only person to ever show her any love. The little match girl dies in the cold, and ascends into Heaven with her grandmother."
The Steadfast Tin Soldier
"""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The story was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children."" The booklet includes Andersen's ""The Daisy"" and ""The Wild Swans"". The story was Andersen’s first story not based upon a folk tale or a literary model. ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated movie."
"The story tells of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina. He falls from the window in the toy room. After many adventures, he is returned to the toy room. A little boy throws the tin soldier in the fire. A breeze blows the paper ballerina into the fire. The two toys are destroyed together."
"Joan G. Haahr writes in ""The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales"": ""The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life."""

Turpan
"Turpan, also referred to Turfan or Tulufan in Chinese, is an oasis county-level city in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China."
Background.
"An endocrinologist can find out if a person has one of these diseases by doing tests. They can test a person's blood to find out if they have too much or too little of a hormone. An example of this is Type 1 diabetes. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not have enough of a hormone called insulin. Endocrinologists usually do not treat patients directly, but give advice to physicians about what how patients might be helped."
Endocrine disorders fall into three groups:
"Most medical applications concern the lack of balance between hormones, and sometimes the complete lack of a necessary hormone. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone."
Helping transgender people.
"Endocrinologists can advise on hormone treatment for transgender persons. A transgender person might want their body to look different so that they look more like their chosen gender. For example, a transgender woman might want less facial hair so that she looks less like a man to other people."

Adipose tissue
"In histology, adipose tissue or body fat or just fat is a tissue made up of cells called adipocytes. They store nutrients called fats in fat cells. Adipose tissue produce different compounds which are called adipokines. They include leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta and others."
Flying Spaghetti Monster
"The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the god of Pastafarianism. It is often seen as a parody religion and thus has become popular with people opposed to the idea that God or gods created the world. Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are sometimes called ""Pastafarians"". The multiverse theory has suggested that what began as a spoof has become potentially real in the infinite universes and their countless creatures with at least some matching the general description of the FSM. Bobby Henderson first described the Flying Spaghetti Monster in 2005 in a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education. Henderson wrote the letter to protest rules about teaching intelligent design in public schools. The Board of Education required teachers to teach intelligent design."
"The Church's website (spaghettimonster.org) contains several sighting of 'His Noodlieness', multiple propaganda resources and an ordination package available for $49. This package contains a paper certificate of ordination, a black/silverresin wallet card and two vinyl car decals. The package also comes with free shipping. As the church states, 'Great. Consider yourself a member. You’ll notice there’s no hoops to jump through. You don’t need to pay anything.'"

Spin-offs.
"""Slimer!""."
"At the start of the third season in 1988, with the series renaming, it was given an hour long time slot. In addition to the regular thirty-minute ""Real Ghostbusters"" episode, a half-hour ""Slimer"" sub-series was added that included 2-3 short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. At the end of its six season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of ""Slimer"", with multiple episodes airing out of production order. The segments added several characters as friends of Slimer, including the character Professor Norman Dweeb—mad scientist accompanied by a poodle named Elizabeth who wanted to capture Slimer to experiment on him. The Professor Dweeb also made infrequent appearances in the main series. One of the ghosts from the ""Slimer"" cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in ""The Real Ghostbusters"" to be captured a second time."
"""Extreme Ghostbusters""."
"In 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled ""Extreme Ghostbusters"", was created by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997 and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8, 1997. Set several years after the end of ""The Real Ghostbusters"", the series opened by saying the team has disbanded due to a lack of supernatural activity. Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system and teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon's students, returns to manage the office. The original Ghostbusters return for the series two-episode finale to celebrate Egon's 40th birthday, leading to them reluctantly working together with the younger generation to solve one last case."
"Anthropology uses a ""four-field approach"" that divides anthropology into four big kinds:"
Archaeology.
Archaeology is the study of humans from the past. People who study archaeology are called archaeologists.
"Archaeologists look at things that past people left behind to know how they lived. They look at tools, bones, and past houses to see how people in the past are not the same as people that live today."
Here are some other examples of what archaeologists like to study:
Biological Anthropology.
Biological or physical anthropology studies human bodies and how they change over time.
They look at how humans live in nature and how their bodies change because of where they live. They also study how human beings and apes and monkeys are alike. Sometimes biological anthropologists study human and animal bones to learn about how past humans lived. They are also called physical anthropologists.
Here are some other examples of what biological anthropologists like to study:
Linguistic Anthropology.
Linguistics is the study of how people talk.
"Linguistic anthropologists study sounds and how they go together to make words. Then they study what the words mean and how people use them. Linguistic anthropology also studies how language changes what people think and how people change language. No two people talk the same way, so linguistic anthropologists want to know why that happens."
Here are some other examples of what linguistic anthropologists like to study:
Socio-Cultural Anthropology.
Socio-Cultural Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures.
It looks at how human beings understand the world around them and how they act with the people around them. Socio-cultural anthropologists study living people by going to their homes and learning about who those people are and what they do. They write about people in places all over the world to see why people are different. Some socio-cultural anthropologists study medicine in these places and some look at how babies grow up in other places.
Here are some other examples of what socio-cultural anthropologists like to study:
Other Kinds of Anthropology.
"Even though there are four main kinds of anthropology, there are a lot of different kinds of anthropology within the four main kinds. Here are some examples:"
Rules of Anthropology.
"Like everything in life, anthropology has a set of rules that every anthropologist needs to follow. The rules try to make sure that no one gets hurt or mad when studying other people. Here are some of the rules:"
Notable people.
This is a list of important people who studied anthropology.
Education
Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.
"Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen."
"Education may help and guide individuals from one class to other. Educated individuals and groups can do things like, help less educated people and encourage them to get educated."
Types of education.
"There are different ways to categorize education, for example by age or subject. One way is to divide it into ""formal education"", ""non-formal education"", and ""informal education""."
"Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,"
"Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In nonformal education someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning), distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities."

"Christian churches often send individuals, or small groups of people to a foreign country. These people should then convince the local population to convert to the Christian faith. Very often, this couples evangelisation with humanitarian work. The missionaries are priests as well and can administer sacraments, but sometimes they are laypeople. Today, missionary activity often means cooperating with the local church. As an example, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Tanzania has sent missionaries to Mozambique."
"Missionary work is often criticized for the ways used. Examples are forced baptisms, proselytism, and that during colonial times, there were strong ties between colonialism and missionary work. Sometimes, there is the problem that the moral standards of the societies are very different from the moral standards of Christianity, missionary work will force different standards onto indigenous societies."
Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville
"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville (23 February 23 1680 Montreal, Quebec – March 7, 1767). He helped colonise North America for France, and was governor of French Louisiana 4 separate times between 1701 and 1743. He is also known as Sieur de Bienville."
His older brother was the explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
Evolution of the eye
The evolution of the eye is an example of a homologous organ which many animals have.
"Some components of the eye, such as the light-sensitive opsins, seem to have a common ancestry. They evolved once, early in the evolution of animals. They control the conversion of photons into electrical signals. For example, an opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in vision."
"On the other hand, complex image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times – using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction."
"Complex eyes seem to have first evolved in a few million years, in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion. There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian, but many eyes can be seen in fossils from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale."
"Eyes show many adaptations to meet the needs of the organisms which have them. Eyes vary in their acuity (accuracy of sight), their sensitivity in low light levels, and their ability to detect motion or identify objects. Their sensitivity to wavelengths decides whether they can see in colours, and which colours they can see."
Rate of evolution.
"The first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago. This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, dubbed the 'Cambrian explosion'. The evolution of eyes perhaps started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution."
"Earlier than this, organisms may have used light sensitivity, but not for fast movement and navigation by vision."
"It is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution. Simple modelling supposes small mutations exposed to natural selection. This shows that a primitive optical sense organ based on good photopigments could evolve into a complex human-like eye in about 400,000 years."
Early stages of eye evolution.
"The earliest light sensors were eyespots. They are photoreceptor proteins found in protists. Eyespots can only distinguish light from dark. This is enough for the daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They cannot distinguish shapes, nor decide from which direction the light is coming."
"Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups. The ""Euglena""'s eyespot, called a ""stigma"", is at the front. Its red pigment shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light to do photosynthesis, and to predict day and night. These movements are the main circadian (daily) rhythms."
"There are visual pigments in the brains of more complex organisms. They are thought to help synchronise spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms can synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the fertilisation of their eggs."
Vision itself relies on the basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. How this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely. Eyes have a wide range of structures and forms. All of these have evolved much later than the underlying proteins and molecules.
"At a cellular level, there appear to be two main ""designs"" of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms)."
PAX6.
"PAX6 is the protein which is encoded by the ""PAX6"" gene."
"""PAX6"" is a master control gene or ""transcription factor"" for the development of eyes and other sensory organs. It is medically important because various mutations produce eyesight defects."
Rudolph Boysen
"Charles Rudolph Boysen (July 14, 1895 – November 25, 1950) was a California horticulturist. Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921-1950. He created the boysenberry, a hybrid between several types of blackberries, raspberries, and loganberries."
Baku
"Baku (; , from the medieval ""Bâd-kube"", meaning ""wind-pounded city"", a compound word of ""bād"", ""wind"", and ""kube"", which is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ""kubidan"", ""to pound"", thus meaning a place where the wind would be strong and pounding, and ancient city names ""Baraca""/) is the capital) is the capital and the largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. It is on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula. Baku is located below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Modern Baku has three parts: the Old Town (İçəri Şəhər), the boomtown and the Soviet-built town. About 3 million people live in the metropolitan area. There are large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons."
In Baku area there is a lot of oil. There are a lot of state and private universities.
"Baku is hosted the 57th Eurovision Song Contest in May 2012. They also bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. The city's three main football clubs are Neftchi Baku, FC Baku and Inter Baku. Baku is one of world's leading chess centres."
Divisions.
"Today, Baku is divided into 11 ""raions"" (administrative districts) and 5 settlements of city type."
Windows ME
"Windows ME is the Millennium Edition of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Windows ME is based on Windows 98. Windows Me was based on MS-DOS (as were Windows 98 and Windows 95), and is meant for people using computers in their homes. Windows 2000 and Windows ME are similar in looks, but Windows ME has features that families find useful, while Windows 2000 was meant for businesses, although many home users also used Windows 2000 especially after Windows ME got bad reviews."
"It was released in the year 2000, and thus was called Windows Millennium Edition. It was the last Windows to be based on MS-DOS. Unlike Windows 2000, Windows ME generally got negative reviews due to bugs and incompatible hardware. Support and updates for Windows ME (and Windows 98) ended in 2006, whereas Windows 2000 was supported until 2010."
Reception.
"Windows Me initially received generally positive reviews, with reviewers citing the operating system's integrity protection (branded as ""PC Health"") and the new System Restore feature as steps forward for home users. However, users' real-world experience did not bear this out, with industry publications receiving myriad reports of issues with the ""PC Health"" systems, PCs refusing to shut down cleanly, and general stability problems."
"As time went on, the reception became more negative, to the point where it was heavily panned by users, mainly due to stability issues. Retrospectively, Windows Me is viewed as the worst operating system Microsoft has ever produced, being unfavorably compared to its immediate predecessor and successor. Due to its many bugs and glitches, Windows Me is considered one of the worst operating systems of all time and the biggest failure in Microsoft Windows. A ""PC World"" article dubbed Windows Me the ""Mistake Edition"" and placed it 4th in their ""Worst Tech Products of All Time"" feature in 2006. The article states: ""Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running."" Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise-orientated."
"System Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001, incorrectly. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem."
"Byron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS, they had noted ""The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (far less Blue screen of death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased."" In a recommendation of the operating system upgrade for users of Windows 95 and 98, they had stated ""If Windows Me isn't a revolutionary OS it's clear that Microsoft has focused its efforts to make it more user-friendly, stable and packed full of multimedia options. The result is great and the enhancements added are really worth the wait."" The new features that Windows Me introduced were also praised and have since remained part of subsequent Windows generations."
"Along with Windows 2000 from the NT family, Windows Me was the last version of Windows that lacked product activation."
Librarian
"A librarian is a person responsible for selecting, organizing, and delivering information materials in a variety of formats such as electronic databases, primary source materials, or printed books. Librarians also teach people to find and evaluate information found on the World Wide Web using Internet search tools and strategies. Librarians may work in different areas. Purchasing materials, putting them into categories, teaching, assisting people with questions, and working with information technology are a few of the possible specializations."
The role of a librarian varies across different types of libraries and locations.
Training.
To become a librarian in a university a person needs to have a master's degree in Library Science (MLS) or a master's degree in Library and Information Science.
Employment.
"Most librarians work for libraries in schools, colleges, or universities or in municipal, regional, or national libraries. Some librarians also work for private companies, to help them to organize their documents and reports. There are librarians that also work with the deaf and in prisons."
Related jobs.
"Other jobs in libraries include the job of library technician. To become a library technician, a person needs to complete a college diploma."
Geronimo
"Geronimo (""Chiricahua"" Goyaałé 'One Who Yawns'; often spelled Goyathlay in English), (June 16, 1829–February 17, 1909) was a well-known Native American leader, but not chief, of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, but he was a Bedonkohe Apache. He was born in what is now the state of New Mexico and was also a respected medicine man. The name Geronimo was given to him by Mexican soldiers who either called to Saint Jerome while fighting him or transcribed his name into Spanish wrong. He led 38 Apache men, women, and children to resist being sent to reservations by the United States government or being captured by the Mexican Army. He surrendered in 1886. After that, he was moved to many different forts in the United States. In 1904 during the world fair in St. Louis, he sold souvenirs and pictures of himself. He died in 1909 from pneumonia."

Chris Candido
"Christopher B. ""Chris"" Candito (March 21, 1972–March 28, 2005) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known by his ring name Chris Candido. He was best known for his time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was also known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where he competed under the ring name Skip and was part of the tag team, The Bodydonnas."
"He was married to wrestling valet, Tammy Lynn Sytch who is better known by the name, Sunny."
Death.
"On April 24, 2005 at Lockdown, Candido suffered a fractured tibia and fibula as well as a dislocated ankle during a steel cage match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki. He would undergo surgery the next day and would have titanium plates and screws inserted into his leg. Candido would be at the following ""Impact!"" tapings and managed The Naturals when they defeated America's Most Wanted to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. On April 28, 2005, Candido felt ill and his condition had worsened during the day. Candido collapsed during the evening and he was rushed to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. The doctors drained his lungs, but he died shortly afterwards. His brother Johnny said that Candido had died because of a blood clot, a complication from surgery."
"On the April 29 episode of ""Impact!"" as well as at the Hard Justice PPV event, TNA paid tribute to Candido. TNA decided to hold a tournament called the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament in his honor in late 2005. In 2009, Candido was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame."
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (also called Fukushima I) is a disabled nuclear power plant in the town of Ōkuma in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Fukushima Daiichi was the first nuclear power plant to be built and run only by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)."
"In March 2011 there were nuclear emergencies at the power plant and some other Japanese nuclear facilities, which raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."
The nuclear reactors.
"The nuclear reactors for units 1, 2, and 6 were supplied by General Electric, those for units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and unit 4 by Hitachi. The architectural design for the General Electric's units was done by Ebasco. All of the building work was done by Kajima. Since September 2010, unit 3 has been fueled by MOX fuel|mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Units 1–5 had/have a Mark 1 type (light bulb shaped torus) containment structure, unit 6 has Mark 2 type (over/under) containment structure."
"Unit 1 is a 439 MW boiling water reactor (BWR3) constructed in July 1967. It started to commercially make electricity on March 26, 1971, and was planned to shutdown in March, 2011. It was damaged during the 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami. The reactor had high atomic and earthquake safety levels when it was made, but it is now both old and out of date. No one knew such a bad earthquake could happen in Japan. Unit 1 was designed for a earthquake ""peak ground acceleration"" shaking motion of 0.18 g (1.74 m/s2) and a seismic ""response spectrum"" based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the seismic ""ground acceleration"" was 0.125 g (1.22 m/s2) for 30 seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered."
2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
"In March 2011, soon after the Sendai earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese government cleared people from around the plant and started local emergency laws at Fukushima I. Ryohei Shiomi of Japan's nuclear safety board was worried about the chance of a meltdown at Unit 1. The next day, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yukio Edano said that a partial meltdown at Unit 3 was ""highly possible."""
"The Nuclear Engineering International group had reported that Units 1, 2 and 3 were automatically shut down. Units 4, 5 and 6 had already been shut down for maintenance. Back-up generators were damaged by the tsunami; started at first, but stopped after 1 hour later."
"Japan’s government said it had and a nuclear emergency when the cooling problems happened as the back-up diesel generators broke down. The cooling is needed to remove decay heat even when a plant has been shut down, due to the long term atomic reactions. Hundreds of Japanese troops were said to be trucking generators and batteries to the site."
"Reactor and generators damage reports (09.53 UTC, 16-3-2011)."
"After the back-up diesel generators pumps broke down, emergency batteries ran low after about eight hours. Batteries from other nuclear plants were sent to the site and mobile electric and diesel generators arrived within 13 hours, but work to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps was still continuing. The diesel generators would normally be connected by switching gears in a basement area of the power station's buildings, but this had been flooded by the tsunami."
Data estimated by JAIF (Japan Atomic Industrial Forum).
"Later, unit 4 at the nearby Fukushima II Nuclear Power Station was also shut down by the safety systems. Now, a source of off-site power is available but the damage level at the plant is bad."
Proposed long term safety activity.
Boron.
"Officials have thought about putting in or aerial dropping radiation killing boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the spent fuel pools to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011. Neutron are absorbed by boric acid, which has been injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was also included with the hose and fire truck water spraying of SFPs."
A 'Sarcophagus tomb' and liquid metal.
"On 18 March, the Reuters news agency reported that Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman of Japan's nuclear agency was asked about burying the reactors in a sand and concrete tomb, said: ""That solution is in the back of our minds, but we are focused on cooling the reactors down."""
"After the Chernobyl disaster, the atomic safety workmen used 1,800 metric tonnes of sand and clay cover the plant. This created a problem because they were thermal insulators and trapped heat inside. So first a non-evaporating coolant such as a liquid metal has to be put on it. After it has all cooled off a structure such as the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant 'sarcophagus tomb'."
Implications.
"The nuclear emergencies at Fukushima Daiichi and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Platts has said that ""the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world"". Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."
"The British zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater named this species after Peter Comrie, who discovered the bird at Fergusson Island in 1874."
Trumpet manucode
"The trumpet manucode (""Manucodia keraudrenii"") is a medium-sized bird of paradise about 31cm long with an long horn-like head tufts and loose neck feathers. It looks blackish glossed blue, green and purple. It has a red iris, long coiled trachea, and blackish bill, mouth and legs."
"They live in lowland rain forests of northeast Australia, New Guinea and nearby islands. They eat fruits and arthropods."
Superb bird-of-paradise
"The superb bird-of-paradise (""Lophorina superba"") is a small passerine, about 26cm long and 70 g in weight. It is one of two members in the genus ""Lophorina"". The male is a black bird-of-paradise with a shining green crown, blue-green breast shield and a long velvety black erectile cape covering his back. The female is a reddish-brown bird with brownish barred buff below."
The superb bird-of-paradise lives in the rainforests of New Guinea.
"The male is polygamous and performs a song and dance for to gain the interest of the female. He starts by singing loud and rapid notes, then he starts to hop around in front of the female making a tapping or clicking sound. Then, he uses his folded black cape and blue-green breast shield to spring upward and spreads widely around its head, making him a dancing ellipse-shaped creature."
Azula
"Azula is a fictional character in Nickelodeon's animated television series """". The character and series were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko."
"Azula is voiced by Grey DeLisle and will be played by Elizabeth Yu in the Netflix . Her family is her mother Ursa, her father Ozai, her uncle Iroh, and her brother Zuko."
Twelve-wired bird-of-paradise
"The twelve-wired bird-of-paradise (""Seleucidis melanoleucus"") is a medium-sized bird-of-paradise about 33cm-long. The male has a red iris, black shoulders and wings, a long black bill and rich yellow plumes along its sides and stomach. From the rear of these plumes come twelve blackish, wire-like filaments, which bend back near their bases to sweep forward over the birds hindquarters."
"The female is a brown bird with black-barred buffy underparts. Its feet are strong, large-clawed and pink in color."
"It is the only species in the monotypic genus ""Seleucidis"". The male displays on an exposed vertical perch with its breast-shield flared. They eat fruits and arthropods."
"The bird is found in lowland forests, New Guinea and Salawati Island of Irian Jaya."
Sokka
"Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeon's animated television series """". The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and voiced by Jack DeSena. In the film version, ""The Last Airbender"", in which is his name is pronounced differently, the character is played by Jackson Rathbone. In the Netflix , he will be played by Ian Ousley."
"In the show, 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole's , a race of people who can control water. He, along with his younger sister Katara, discovers an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world."
Concept and creation.
"Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be ""much"" more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts."
"As a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series, often a victim of visual slapstick. He also is extremely sarcastic."
History.
"Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending. When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders."
"While on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole, determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders."
"In ""Sokka's Master"" (the 4th episode of ) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus."
"In the two-hour , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King (Ozai). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more ""memorable""."
"Scholars disagree about the origins of the word ""sharia"". Some say that ""sharia"" comes from the old Arabic word meaning ""pathway to be followed"". This would make it similar to ""halakha"" (the way to go), the Hebrew word for Jewish law. Other scholars think that the word ""sharia"" originally meant ""path to the water hole"". They say that knowing the way to a water hole could save a man's life in the dry deserts where many Arabs lived in ancient times, and that is why this word came to refer to God's guidance to man."
Theory.
Islamic scholars who lived during the first centuries of Islam developed different methods for interpreting sharia. Most of them came to agree that sharia rules should be derived from the following main sources:
"The process of deriving sharia rules from the Qur'an and hadith is called ""ijtihad"". Sharia rules classify actions into one of the following categories:"
"These acts have ""material or moral"" provisions in the understanding of Sharia. The abandonment of the actions ""that are considered fard, wajib and sunnah"", and doing the forbidden ones ""that are considered makruh and haram"" are penalized. (hadd or tazir punishments). E.g; Beating, imprisoning and killing those who insist on not praying can be considered in this context."
"Sharia in Islam is viewed as the revealed law of God, which cannot be altered. On the other hand, its interpretation, called ""fiqh"", is the work of legal scholars, who have frequently differed in their legal opinions. Some parts of sharia are similar to what people in the West call ""law"", while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
"There are several schools of legal thought in Islam, of which the most important are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam and the Ja'fari school of Shia Islam."
Branches of sharia.
"The divisions of sharia are called ""branches"" (""furu"") in Arabic. The main branches are ""ibadat"" (rituals or acts of worship) and ""mu'amalat"" (human interactions or social relations). These branches are divided into many smaller branches, some of which are listed bellow:"
Acts of worship.
The Five Pillars of Islam are:
There are two festivals that are considered Sunnah.
There are some special rituals used during these festivals:
Dietary laws.
Islamic law lists only some specific foods and drinks that are not allowed.
"While Islamic law prohibits already-dead meat, this does not apply to fish and locusts. Also, hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth, birds having claws and talons in their feet, tamed donkeys, and any piece cut from a living animal."
Sacrifice.
There are some specific rules regarding the killing of animals in Islam.
Crime and punishment.
Sharia recognises three categories of crime:
"Although there is some disagreement about which crimes are ""hudud"" crimes, they usually include theft, highway robbery, zina (sex with forbidden partners), falsely accusing someone of ""zina"", and drinking alcohol. The prescribed punishments for these crimes range from 80 lashes to death. However, classical jurists developed very strict rules which restrict when these punishments could be applied, so that in many cases it became almost impossible to convict anyone under these rules. For example, there must be four adult male Muslim witnesses to a hudud crime or a confession repeated four times, before someone can be punished. If a criminal could not be convicted of a ""hudud"" crime, they could still receive a ""tazir"" punishment."
"In the historical practice, qisas appears in two ways. One of them is the punishment of the perpetrator with a “counter-action”, exactly the same as the crime committed, in crimes against the person's bodily integrity; A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth... etc."
"Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person ""of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs"" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of ""social equality"" in qisas means that; ""if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied"", whereas ""if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied"". On this pre-islamic understandings the discussion ""whether a Muslim could be executed for a non-Muslim"" was added in Islamic period."
"In these cases, ""compensation (Diya)"" can be paid to the family of the murdered person."
The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;
""": ""'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well."""
"While retaliation is certain in crimes of murder, according to the verse(2:178)), the situation is not clear in the crimes of wounding. For such (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, etc.) punishments, the expression ""This is how we wrote to them (the Children of Israel) in the book"", is used. (5: 45)"
"Murder, bodily injury and property damage - intentional or unintentional - is considered a civil dispute under sharia law. The victim, victim's heir(s) or guardian is given the option to either forgive the offender, demand Qisas (equal retaliation) or accept a compensation (Diyya). Under sharia law, the Diyya compensation received by the victim or victim's family is in cash."
Apostasy is punished by death unless the apostate agreed to return to Islam.
Legal system.
Muftis.
"During the Islamic Golden Age, sharia was interpreted by experts in Islamic law (""muftis""), most of whom were independent religious scholars. Anyone could ask them a question about law, and they were expected to give an answer for free. Their legal opinions were called ""fatwas""."
Sierra Entertainment
Sierra Entertainment was an American video game developer/publisher founded in the late 1970s by Ken and Roberta Williams.
Games.
"The company is known for making the graphic adventure game genre, including the first game, Mystery House. It is also known for its adventure game series King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry, and Quest for Glory, as well as being the original publishers of Half-Life."
Affiliation.
"After 17 years as a lone company, Sierra was bought by CUC International in February 1996 to become part of CUC Software. However, CUC International was caught in an scandal in 1998. Therefore many of the original founders of Sierra including the Williamses left the company. Sierra remained as part of CUC Software as it was sold and renamed several times over the next few years; Sierra was dissolved as a company and reformed as a division of this group in 2004. The former CUC Software group was acquired by Vivendi and branded as Vivendi Games in 2006. The Sierra division continued to operate through Vivendi Games' merger with Activision to form Activision Blizzard in 2008. However, it was shut down later. The Sierra brand was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently developed games."

"Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, had planned to use the company to create business software for the TRS-80 and Apple II. Ken had brought a teletype terminal home one day in 1979, and while looking through the host system's catalog of programs, discovered the text adventure ""Colossal Cave Adventure"". He encouraged Roberta to join him in playing it, and she was thrilled by the game; after Ken had brought an Apple II to their home, she played through other text adventures such as those by Scott Adams and Softape to study them. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could improve the adventure gaming experience. With Ken's help in some of the programming, Roberta designed ""Mystery House"", inspired by the novel ""And Then There Were None"" and the board game ""Clue"", using text commands and printout combined with graphics depicting the current setting."
"On-Line Systems leased their first office space from Ponderosa Printing, a modest space in the back of a small town print shop."
Mystery House.
"""Mystery House"" was released in 1980. It was a great success with 15,000 copies sold, earning 167,000 American dollars (equivalent to 525,539 American dollars in 2020). It is the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although made with crude, static, monochrome line drawings. The two decided to shift the company's focus to developing more graphical adventure games. ""Mystery House"" became the first of their ""Hi-Res Adventure"" series. The ""Hi-Res Adventure"" series continued with ""Mission Asteroid"", which was released as ""Hi-Res Adventure #0"" though being the second release. The next release, ""Wizard and the Princess"", also known as ""Adventure in Serenia"", is considered a prelude to the later ""King's Quest"" series in both story and concept. Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including ""Cranston Manor"", ""Ulysses and the Golden Fleece"", ""Time Zone"", and ""The Dark Crystal"". A simplified version of ""The Dark Crystal"", intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as ""Gelfling Adventure""."
Rebranding (1982 - 1988).
"On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and they moved to Oakhurst, California. The ""Sierra"" name was taken from the Sierra Nevada mountain range that Oakhurst was near, and its new logo had the image of a mountain reflecting that. By early 1984 ""InfoWorld"" estimated that Sierra was the world's 12th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $12.5 million in 1983 sales."
"The company weathered the video game crash of 1983 by seeing only a 20% increase in sales, after analysts in 1982 had predicted a doubling in 1983 of the entire software market. The company had spent much of 1983 developing for a Commodore machine and the TI-99/4A which were both obsolete by the end of the year. Ken Williams was reportedly described as ""bewildered by the pace at which computers come into and fall out of favor"", and Williams said, ""I've learned my lesson. I'm not moving until I understand the market better."""
"Many of Sierra's most well known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for the new PCjr. IBM offered to fund the entire development and marketing of the game, paying royalties. Ken and Roberta Williams accepted and started on the project. Roberta Williams created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept includes animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character is visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that understands advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) was developed. In mid-1984, ""King's Quest: Quest for the Crown"" was released to much acclaim, beginning the ""King's Quest"" series."
Sierra On-Line expanded into a larger headquarters in the early-1980s.
"While working to finish ""The Black Cauldron"", programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken Williams, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named ""Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter"". The game was released in October 1986 as an instant success, spawning many sequels in the ""Space Quest"" series in the following years."
"Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken Williams to write a modern version of Chuck Benton's ""Softporn Adventure"" from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. ""Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards"" was a great hit and won the Software Publishers Association's Best Adventure Game award of 1987. It can be deduced that the game first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game. A series of ""Leisure Suit Larry"" games followed."
"Ken Williams befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create ""Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel"", which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and the series was touted for adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games' manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer."
"""Quest for Glory"" is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, ""Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero"", was released in 1989. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a five-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled ""Hero's Quest"", Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, ""HeroQuest,"" which forced Sierra to change the series' title to ""Quest for Glory"". This decision caused all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of ""Hero's Quest I"") to switch over to the new name."
"In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish its own gaming magazine, about its upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named ""The Sierra Newsletter"", ""The Sierra News Magazine"", and ""The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine"". However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called ""Sierra Magazine"", the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to ""InterAction"" in 1991. It was discontinued in 1999."
"Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with ""King's Quest"", was replaced in 1988 with Sierra's Creative Interpreter in ""King's Quest IV"". The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and better rendering technology."
Sunkist (soft drink)
Sunkist is a brand of soft drinks. They mostly make orange flavored drinks. the brand was launched in 1979.
Thomas Letsch
Thomas Letsch (born 26 August 1968) is a German football manager. He is the manager of Eredivisie club Vitesse Arnhem.
Managerial career.
Early career.
"By the first quarter of 2011 the average monthly household income is 2,318 Romanian leu (equivalent to approximately £862 USD)."
The different between countryside and urban area may vary the income is 36 per-cent higher in the urban area than in the countryside.
The pension system is reformed.
"The most worrying thing is the fact that there are more pensioners than the number of working people. because many who dismissed during the privatizations had per-retirement. Romanian Pensioners average pension at the month is at about 190 euros (equivalent to approximately £250-300 USD). The current low average retirement age (55 years for men and 57 years for women) will be gradually increased until 2014, when it gets 60 years for women and 65 years for men."
"Many of the country's Gypsies have no identity cards and are therefore excluded from the social benefit systems, schools and health care. The State-run health care is free, but the care system is neglected and has deteriorated in recent years due to lack of resources and underpaid staff. In many cases,the patients paying ""under the table"" to get treatment. here is evidence to suggest that a patient's wealth plays an important role in how they receive medical treatment."
Science and technology.
"Historically, Romanian researches and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields, such as: aeronautics, medicine, mathematics, computer science/engineering, physics, biophysics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology. In the history of flight, Traian Vuia and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Preceding him, Elie Carafoli was a pioneering contributor to the field of aerodynamics in the world."
"Victor Babeş discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil. Costin Neniţescu found new methods for the synthesis of pirilium salts, of carbenes, tryptamine, serotonin, two new syntheses for the indole nucleus, and a new method of polymerisation of ethylene."
"Several mathematicians distinguished themselves as well, among them: Gheorghe Ţiţeica, Spiru Haret, Grigore Moisil, Miron Nicolescu, Nicolae Popescu and Ştefan Odobleja; the latter is also regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics."
"Notable physicists and inventors also include: Horia Hulubei in atomic physics, Șerban Țițeica in theoretical physics, Mihai Gavrilă specialized in quantum theory and discoverer of the atomic dichotomy phenomenon, Alexandru Proca (known for the first meson theory of nuclear forces and Proca's equations of the vectorial mesonic field), Ştefan Procopiu known for the first theory of the magnetic moment of the electron in 1911 (now known as the Bohr-Procopiu magneton), Theodor V. Ionescu, the inventor of a multiple-cavity magnetron (1935), a hydrogen maser in 1947, 3D imaging for cinema/television in 1924 and hot deuterium plasma studies for controlled nuclear fusion, Ionel Solomon known for the nuclear magnetic resonance theory in solids, Solomon equations and photovoltaic devices, Petrache Poenaru, Nicolae Teclu and Victor Toma, with the latter known for the invention and construction of the first Romanian computer, the CIFA-1 in 1955."
"The nuclear physics facility of the European Union's proposed Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) laser will be built in Romania. Romania currently has 1,400 MW of nuclear power capacity by means of one active nuclear power plant (Cernavodă) with 2 reactors, which constitutes around 18% of the national power generation capacity of the country. This makes Romania the 23rd largest user of nuclear power in the world."
Government.
Politics.
"The Constitution of Romania is found to be based from the Constitution of France's Fifth Republic. It was passed into law on December 8, 1991. after a referendum was held. 73 amendments were added to the constitution in October 2003 to bring the constitution of Romania up to code with the constitution of the European Union."
"The legislative branch of the Romanian government is known as the Parliament. It contains two chambers – the Senate, containing 140 members, and the Chamber of Deputies, which has 346 members. The members of both chambers are elected every four years through party-list proportional representation."
"The judicial branch of the Romanian government is separate from the other branches. It is made up of a system of courts. The court with the most authority is the High Court of Cassation and Justice, which is the supreme court of Romania. Other courts, including appeal, county, and local courts also make up the judicial branch of the Romanian Government. The way the system of courts works in Romania is modelled off of the French model of law. It is based on civil law."
Divisions.
"Romania is divided into 41 counties, including the municipality of Bucharest, which is also its own county."
"Romania is divided further into 319 cities and 2,686 communes. Each of the communes has its own council that is led by a mayor."
Army.
"The Romanian Army is made up of Land, Air, and Naval Forces, which are all led by a Commander-in-chief. The commander-in-chief is given orders by the Ministry of Defense. During war, the President leads the Army. 90,000 people were in the Romanian Army in 2003: 15,000 civilians and 75,000 military people. Of the 75,000 military people in the Romanian Army, 45,800 are in the land forces, 13,250 are in the air forces, 6,800 are in the naval forces, and 8,800 in other areas of the military."
Argon
Argon is a chemical element. Its symbol is argon is Ar and its atomic number is 18. It is part of the noble gas group. It is an odorless and tasteless gas. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere.
"The name ""argon"" is from the Greek word ἀργός meaning ""lazy"" or ""inactive"" because it does not react with other chemicals."
Chemistry.
"Argon atoms are found in air. About 1% of the Earth's atmosphere (the air around us) is argon. It is not toxic and it does not burn easily. Not many compounds can be made from Argon. However, some compounds have been formed, like argon fluorohydride (HArF). Argon is a heavier gas than helium, so if a balloon is filled with argon, it would fall the the ground."
History.
"Argon was first removed from air in 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay at University College London by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen from a sample of clean air."
Isotopes.
"The main isotopes of argon found on Earth are 40Ar (99.6%), 36Ar (0.34%), and 38Ar (0.06%). The most abundant isotope of argon is 40Ar. But other planets have different isotopes of argon."
Production.
World War I.
"When World War I started in August 1914, Romania said it was a neutral country. In 1916, the Allies promised to give Romania parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire where many Romanians lived, if Romania started a war against Austria-Hungary."
"The military campaign ended in disaster after Romania's forces were defeated in 1917 and Moldova was one of the few parts of Romania that was not captured. When the Allies eventually won the war, the Austria-Hungarian Empire was dissolved and an independent Hungarian republic was proclaimed. Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Romania in 1918 as had been promised. After the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, Hungary formally gave up any claims over Transylvania. Romania and Bukovina were joined together in 1919 as a result of the Treaty of Saint Germain. Bessarabia joined with Romania in 1920 when the Treaty of Paris was signed."
Greater Romania.
"After World War I was much bigger and more nationalist. The small Kingdom received (""major Transylvania""). The principalities Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia (Moldova) together formed the ""Greater Romania"" 1918-1940. ""Greater Romania"" did not survive World War II."
"Romanians called their country ""România Mare"", meaning ""Great Romania"" or ""Greater Romania"", in the time between World War I and World War II. They called it so because it controlled of land."
"The Great Depression meant social unrest, high unemployment, strikes and riots, especially a miners' strike in 1929 in Valea Jiului and a strike in Griviţas maintenance workshops. By the mid-1930s, with a recovering Romanian economy, industry grew, although about 80% of Romanians still were engaged in agriculture."
Iron Guard.
"In end of 1930s, Romania's liberal democracy was slowly being replaced by the fascist dictatorship. The Archangel Michael Legion, known as the Iron Guard organization, was led by Corneliu Codreanu Zelea. In 1937 elections the party supported Adolf Hitler and Nazism and got 15.5% of the votes and became the third biggest party. In 1938 king Carol II of Romania seized power over Romania. He dissolved all political parties and executed Corneliu Codreanu Zelea along with 12 other leaders."
World War II.
"Carol II of Romania declared the country as neutral when World War II broke out in 1939, but included since the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina an alliance with Hitler's Germany. This occurred after field marshal Ion Antonescu forced the authoritarian Carol II of Romania to abdicate. Antonescu appointed himself ""conducator"", Romania's dictator, and signed at the November 23 of 1940 three-powers pact with Nazi Germany. Hitler's Germany was dependent on a continuous importation of fuel and crude oil from the Romanian oil fields of Ploesti. In 1940, yjr Kingdom of Hungary took over the legitimate domination in Northern Transylvania to the end of the World War II."
The country's troops fought together with the German Wehrmacht against the Soviet Union.
"In summer of 1941, Romania join Hitler's war against the Soviet Union in combination also Finland, Slovakia and Hungary join Hitlers war. Romania built concentration camps and began conducting a massive persecution of Jews, of which became very extreme in the city of Iasi."
Holocaust in Romania.
"Romania participated in the Holocaust. The author of the book ""The Destruction of the European Jews"" Raul Hilberg writes follow: ""There was / ... / moment when the Germans actually had to intervene and slow the speed with which the Romanian measures were taken."" The hunt for Jews in eastern Romania (including Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transnistria and the city of Iasi) had more the character of pogroms than the German, well-organized camps and transport."
"There were pogroms in the city of Iasi. The homes for the Jewish minority in Iasi were marked with crosses. On June 27, 1941, Ion Antonescu make a phone call with the city's mayor and Antonescu said into the phone: ""clean the city Iasi from the Jews."" And the Holocaust in Romania has began. Police officers and many civilians went to every Jewish home marked with a cross in the town and murdered thousands of Jews on the same day."
"In June 1941, the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave an ""illegal secret order"" to the special police force. He ordered the police in cooperation with the Romanian Army and the German SS troops to kill all Jews in east Romania within the next coming years. The Jews living on the countryside was being killed right on the spot. The Jews in the cities were first collected in the ghettos and later deported away."
"On October 22, 1941 the Soviet union with bombs blow up the Romanian military headquarters in Odessa, and killed 66 Romanian soldiers. As revenge Ion Antonescu decided that for every dead Romanian officer, 200 Soviet communists must be killed and for each dead soldier, 100 communists must be killed. All other Communists were imprisoned and Jewish families were taken hostage in the hope that the partisan movement would cease its operations."
"The day after in Bucharest, on October 23, 1941, around 5 000 people and the majority were Jews was arrested who later executed by hanging. In the Soviet village Dalnik, almost 20,000 Jews were incarcerated in to several locked buildings and burned alive."
"After the massacre, many of the Jews who remained in Odessa were sent to various concentration camps. Nearby Odessa on October 25, 1941, approximately 40,000 Jews, was gathering together on a special closed military secured area, and the Jews had to stay outdoors for more than ten days without food or supply. Many died of cold and starvation. The survivors were murdered one month later."
"Totally approximately 469,000 Jews had been murdered by the military and police in Romania between 1941 and 1944, including the 325,000 murdered Jews in Bessarabia and Bukovina."
End of war.
"At the end of 1943, the Red Army liberated most of Soviet territory and started advancing westward from its borders to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies. It was in this context that the Soviet forces crossed Romania. If the Soviet Union could hit Romania, Nazi Germany's last hope is gone, said the military leadership of the Red Army. Russians deposited the entire 1.5 million soldiers in the attack against Romania and Romania last reserves consisting only of 138 000 soldiers. During the summer of 1944 it began the attack on Bessarabia (Moldova) and the Romanian army fled the area. On 2 August, the whole Bessarabia (Moldova) is captured by the Red Army. The Russians then went a long way in Romania and on 23 August they reached into the Romanian capital Bucharest. The public opinion turned in the country against Antonescu and of summer 1944 he was deposed and imprisoned. The new government signed a ceasefire and extradited itself to the Soviet Union. The Red Army killed the members from the old fascist regime (including Ion Antonescu) on June 1, 1946."
"At the end of the war, Romania was allowed to keep the whole of Transylvania in west and Dobruja from south, but lost Bessarabia/Transnistria and Odessa Oblast in the east (with rich oil reserves) which became parts of the Soviet Union. Bukovina was split in half because in the north part the majority ethnic group was Ukrainian and in the south part Romanian."
"The Soviet Union replaced the royal monarchy with a communist regime in 1947. The Soviet Union took the country's resources, which led to increased poverty in Romania."
Romania and communism.
"Michael I abdicated the throne and had to leave Romania in 1947 because of the Communists. Romania changed from a monarchy into a republic. The USSR occupied Romania until the late 1950s, when Soviet troops left Romania. During this time, resources in Romania were taken by the Soviet Union due to agreements made by Communist leaders."
"After the Soviet troops left Romania, Nicolae Ceauşescu wanted Romania to become more independent from Moscow. Romania started following slightly different foreign policies than Moscow. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Romania began talks with Israel and started relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. Romania started to have their own relations with Arab countries. Romania officials were allowed to participate in peace talks between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization."
"The national debt Romania owed to other countries went from $3 billion to almost $10 billion between 1977 and 1981. The amount of money that Romania owed other countries caused them to rely on banks and other lenders from around the world. President Nicolae Ceauşescu's autarchic ways meant he did not want to rely on other countries and Romania paid back money borrowed from other countries. This affected the Romanian economy. To try to stay in power, Ceauşescu had anyone who disagreed with him arrested and put in prison. Many people were killed or hurt. Almost 60,000 people were put in psychiatric hospitals. Ceauşescu eventually lost power and was killed in the Romanian Revolution of 1989."
1989 to 2007.
"In 1989, the National Salvation Front came into power. It was led by Ion Iliescu. When they came into power, several other parties from before World War II were remade. These included the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party and the Romanian Social Democrat Party. In April 1990, as a result of several rallies, protests started. The people who protested did not recognize the results of the election. This was because they thought that members of the National Salvation Front were communists. More and more people protested, and it became a demonstration – a very big protest. This was called the Golaniad, and it became very violent."
"When the National Salvation Front lost power, several other parties were made. These were the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and a couple of other parties from before the war. The Social Democratic Party ruled Romania from 1990 until 1996. Ion Iliescu was the head of state, or person in charge. After 1996, several other parties came into power and lost it. In 2004, Traian Băsescu became the president."
"Jingū was the principle wife of Emperor Chūai Her son would become known as Emperor Ōjin. The ""Gukanshō"" mentions her, but she is not included on the list of persons born within the line of Imperial descent."
Events of Jingū's life.
"The limited information about Jingū does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After the death of Chūai, Jingū also served as regent, according to the oracle of Sumiyoshi-jinja, until her son was old enough to be emperor."
After her death.
This empress' official name after her death (her posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jingū.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the empress's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). Jingū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") at Nara."
"In the centuries before the Meiji period, Jingū was known as the 15th Japanese imperial ruler, according to the traditional order of succession. However, Jingū's name is now removed from the official list of emperors of Japan. Jingū's son, Emperor Ōjin, is today considered to have been the 15th emperor in the order of succession."
Hypermodern
The hypermoderns were a school of chess players who set out to rethink some of the principles of chess openings. The name was given to them by the Polish-French grandmaster Tartakower.
"The key idea was, in reaction to the older ideas of Siegbert Tarrasch, to dispute control of the centre by more subtle methods. Whereas old theory was to occupy the centre with two or three pawns immediately, the hypermoderns concentrated more on attacking the opponent's centre. A characteristic first move was 1Nf3 with White, or 1...Nf6 with Black, especially in reply to 1d4. To 1e4 they favoured an asymmetric defence such as 1...e6 or 1...c5 rather than the classical reply 1...e5."
"Nimzovich was the founder, and Alekhine, Tartakower, Réti, Grünfeld, and Bogolyubov all took part. All were top grandmasters of the 1920s and 30s. Several modern openings owe their popularity to this group: Alekhine's Defence (1e4 Nf6); Réti's Opening (1Nf3); the King's Indian Defence (1d4 Nf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 Bg7); the Grünfeld Defence (1d4 Bf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 d5) and the Modern Defence (1...g6).p178"
Confidence interval
"In statistics, a confidence interval, abbreviated as CI, is a special interval for estimating a certain parameter, such as the population mean. With this method, a whole interval of acceptable values for the parameter is given instead of a single value—together with a likelihood that the real (unknown) value of the parameter will be in the interval. Thus, if we're not sure of the exact number of vehicles that crossed a bridge, we can say 400 plus or minus 10 instead of just saying 400."
"The confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample, and hence differs from sample to sample. The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called the confidence level, and the end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits."
"Very often, this is given as a percentage (for example, the 95% confidence interval). The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level. For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be."
"The calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process, since it is primarily a ""parametric"" method. One common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal. As such, confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics, though changes can be made to add robustness."
"Meaning of the term ""confidence""."
"The term ""confidence"" has a similar meaning in statistics, as in common use. In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating near certainty. In statistics, a claim to 95% confidence simply means that the researcher has seen one possible interval from a large number of possible ones, from which 19 out of 20 intervals contain the true value of the parameter."
Practical example.
"A machine fills cups with margarine. It is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250g of margarine. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X."
"This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250g, with a standard deviation of 2.5g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of ""n"" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random, and the cups are weighed. The weights of margarine are ""X""1, ..., ""X""25, a random sample from ""X""."
"To get an impression of the expectation μ, an estimate is needed. The appropriate estimator is the sample mean:"
"The sample shows actual weights ""x""1, ...,""x""25, with mean:"
"If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. A sample mean value of 280 grams, however, would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g."
"There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter ""μ""."
"To calculate such an interval, the endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample ""X""1, ..., ""X""25, and hence are random variables themselves."
"In our case, we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation ""μ"", but with standard error ""σ""/√""n"" = 0.5 (grams). By standardizing, we get a random variable"
"which depends on the parameter μ to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter ""μ"". Hence it is possible to find numbers −""z"" and ""z"", independent of ""μ"", where ""Z"" lies in between with probability 1 − α, a measure of how confident we want to be. We take 1 - α = 0.95. So we have:"
"The number ""z"" follows from the cumulative distribution function:"
Jatropha in India and Africa.
"Crops like Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities:"
"Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too."
Jatropha in Cambodia.
"Cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves, and is almost completely dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development."
"Biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price, independent of the international oil price. The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security, rural development opportunities and environmental benefits. The Jatropha curcas species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia. Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia, based on the Jatropha or other sources, offers good potential benefits for the investors, the economy, rural communities and the environment."
Sweet sorghum in India.
"Sweet sorghum overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops. With sweet sorghum, only the stalks are used for biofuel production, while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed. It is not in high demand in the global food market, and thus has little impact on food prices and food security. Sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity, so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply. Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation, an important consideration in dry areas."
International collaboration on sustainable biofuels.
Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels.
"Public attitudes and the actions of stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based"
"both on the scientific case and an understanding of public and stakeholder views, is important."
"The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable developed a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions."
"The Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released “Version Zero” of its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels on August 13, 2008. This includes a dozen principles, each with several criteria developing the principle further."
Sustainable Biofuels Consensus.
"The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to take concerted, collaborative and coordinated action to ensure the sustainable trade, use and production of biofuels. In this way biofuels may play a key role in the transformation of the energy sector, climate stabilization and resulting worldwide renaissance of rural areas, all of which are urgently needed."
"The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a landscape that provides food, fodder, fiber, and energy, which offers opportunities for rural development; that diversifies energy supply, restores ecosystems, protects biodiversity, and sequesters carbon."
Oil price moderation.
"Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes."
Sustainable transport.
"Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach,"
"which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as moderating the overall demand and need for transport. The development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better urban and rural planning all need to be considered."
Montreal Screwjob
"The Montreal Screwjob was an incident that happened on November 9, 1997, at the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s Survivor Series professional wrestling show. It happened in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is called a screwjob, because in real life, the way the match would end was changed without one of the wrestlers knowing about it. The wrestler who was screwed was Bret Hart. The people who took part in the screwjob were Hart's opponent Shawn Michaels, WWF's owner Vince McMahon, and referee Earl Hebner."
Why the screwjob happened.
"Bret Hart had wrestled in the WWF for 14 years, since 1983. He was popular, wrestling alone or as part of a tag team. He became WWF Champion five times. He was WWF Champion when the screwjob happened. In 1996, he signed a contract that lasted 20 years. The contract was meant to last until he retired as a wrestler, and let him be part of WWF's backstage plans. This meant he would be paid a lot of money."
"At the same time World Championship Wrestling (WCW), another professional wrestling company, was getting more popular. WCW had become popular using wrestlers who left WWF, like Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash. They were now more popular than WWF. This meant WWF could not make as much money. WWF had signed a 20-year contract with Hart because they did not want him to leave, go to WCW, and make them even more popular. But now they found it hard to pay Hart, so they had to promise to pay him later because they were in danger of running out of money."
"Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels did not like each other. Hart took professional wrestling very seriously, whilst Michaels liked to party. This meant they would argue a lot. One time, when Michaels said that Hart was cheating on his wife with Sunny, a woman wrestler, the two had a fight backstage. Michaels said that if he were champion, he would not agree to lose to Hart, even though Hart had agreed to lose to Michaels on any occasion except Survivor Series. The Survivor Series show took place in Canada, which is Hart's home country. Hart did not want to lose the championship to someone he disliked in his own home country. Bret also did not like how his character had changed in the WWF. He was being told to act like he hated America."
"At the start of November, Hart agreed to leave WWF and sign a new contract with WCW. His time in the WWF would end after Survivor Series. Because he was still WWF Champion, and he did not want to lose it in his final appearance, Vince McMahon was worried that Hart would bring the championship belt to WCW. This had happened before, when Debra Miceli, a wrestler who appeared as Alundra Blayze in WWF and Madusa in WCW, left WWF as WWF Women's Champion. She brought the belt on to WCW's TV show, ""WCW Monday Nitro"", and dropped the belt in a trash can. The WWF Championship was the most important belt in WWF, so it would be even worse if Hart did something like that."
"McMahon and Hart agreed to a plan, where Hart would still be champion at the end of Survivor Series. The next night on WWF's TV show, ""Monday Night Raw"", he would give up the belt. McMahon did not follow this plan."
The screwjob.
"Many people believe that it is unfortunate to discuss causes of homosexuality and bisexuality without discussing causes of heterosexuality, too. Although it is easy to understand why heterosexuality exists (heterosexual sex produces babies), that does not explain how the brain develops to produce heterosexual people. Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality all have causes, and some people believe that to discuss only the causes of homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people who have those orientations."
Relationships.
"Gay people can fall in love and have lifelong relationships. In most countries, they cannot legally marry their partners. However, they still have relationships in the same way as heterosexual people."
"Some homosexual people have wedding ceremonies even though governments do not recognize or accept them. They may call their partner a spouse, wife, or husband despite the law."
"But to them, the important part about marriage is not just the name. Married people get many benefits from being married. Depending on the country, these benefits can include paying less taxes, getting their spouse's insurance, inheriting property, social security benefits, having or adopting children together, emigrating to a spouse's country, being able to make choices for a sick spouse, or even being allowed to visit a sick spouse who is in a hospital."
"Today there are numerous countries that allow homosexual people to marry, including: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Uruguay, the United States and Wales. The Netherlands was first in 2001. It is also legal in six Native American tribes."
"Instead of marriage, some countries or states offer homosexuals civil unions or domestic partnerships. This gives them some of the protections and benefits of marriage, but not all. Civil unions and domestic partnerships are sometimes seen by the LGBT community as being 'second class' (not as good as 'first class'). They do offer some benefits for gay and lesbian couples, but they also suggest that these couples are not as important or valid as heterosexual couples. Some people even say this is like the ""separate but equal"" rules that were used to segregate people by race in the United States. They believe that separate is ""never"" equal and homosexuals should not accept being second class citizens."
Religion.
"Many religions teach that homosexual sex is a sin. Such religions traditionally include Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Usually, it is only the act of sexual intercourse that is considered sinful and not natural. Not all believe the attraction, is sinful, just the actions in response to the desire."
"However, some denominations (different parts) of these religions and some eastern religions now accept homosexuality. There are several other religions that are accepting of homosexuality, particularly new religions. There are also some religions which are indifferent to homosexuality, such as Zoroastrianism and Jainism."
Problems homosexuals face.
"In many countries, homosexual people are discriminated against. A homosexual person can be fired from a job because they are gay, even if they are a good worker. Homosexual people can be denied renting a home or being able to eat in a restaurant because of their sexual orientation."
"In some countries, homosexual people can experience violence. For example, Islamic law is used in some places to kill homosexuals or place them in jail. Some groups believe over 4,000 homosexual people have been killed in Iran since 1979 because of their sexual orientation. In 2005, after fourteen months of prison and torture, two teenage boys were hanged in Iran for homosexuality."
"In modern times, homosexuality has become more accepted in Western countries. Most western countries have laws that protect homosexuals from violence and discrimination."
"In the United Kingdom, homosexuality used to be a crime. Oscar Wilde, the famous Irish writer was imprisoned for it, and as a result, it destroyed his reputation and career as a wit and playwright. Alan Turing, the man who helped the Allies in World War II by breaking the Enigma Code used by the Germans, was convicted of this crime and according to some speculations he ultimately killed himself over the effects of the attempt to cure his homosexuality."
"Today in the United Kingdom, homosexual people are safer. Homosexual sex between adults is not a crime. Gay and lesbian couples can marry. Gay people can be in the military."
"In most of the world, homosexual people still do not have the same rights and freedoms that heterosexuals have."
Homosexual behaviour in animals.
"Homosexual behaviour has also been seen in animals. Homosexual, transgender and bisexual behaviour includes sex, courtship, affection, pair bonding, and parenting. Homosexual behaviour is widespread among animals. Bruce Bagemihl did research in 1999. It shows that homosexual behaviour has been observed in close to 1500 species, from primates to gut worms, and is well documented for 500 of them. The sexual behaviour of animals takes many different forms, even within the same species. The motivations for these behaviours are only partly known, mainly because the respecive species has not been fully studied yet. According to Bagemihl, ""the animal kingdom [does] it with much greater sexual diversity—including homosexual, bisexual and nonreproductive sex—than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept."""
Other websites.
There are national and international groups or organizations for the LGBT community. These organizations are often political. They fight for the rights and safety of homosexuals.
Some of the more important political organizations are:
Dwight D. Eisenhower
"Dwight David ""Ike"" Eisenhower( (October 14, 1890 – March 28, 1969) was the 34th president of the United States, from 1953 to 1961. He was known across the world for his help leading the Allied invasions in World War II."
Early life.
"Dwight David Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, at 609 S. Lamar Avenue in Denison, Texas. He was the third of seven sons. His mother originally named him David Dwight, but she switched two names after his birth so that there wouldn't be two Davids in the family."
"In 1892, the family moved to Abilene, Kansas, which Eisenhower considered his hometown. Dwight became very interested in exploring the outdoors. He learned about hunting and fishing, cooking, and card playing from a man named Bob Davis who camped on the Smoky Hill River."
"Eisenhower went to Abilene High School. He graduated with the class of 1909. He and brother Edgar both wanted to go to college, but they did not have enough money. They decided to take different years at college while the other worked to earn money to pay the tuitions."
"Edgar took the first turn at school, and Dwight was working a job as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery. When Edgar asked for a second year, Dwight accepted and worked for a second year. At that time, a friend named ""Swede"" Hazlett was applying to the Naval Academy. He wanted Dwight to apply to the school, since there was no tuition. Eisenhower asked for consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was one of the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was too old for the Naval Academy. He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911."
"At West point, Eisenhower liked the traditions and the sports. In sports, Eisenhower later said that ""not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest"". He joined the varsity football team and was a starter as running back and linebacker in 1912. He tackled the legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians. Eisenhower got a torn knee while being tackled in the next game, which was the last he played; he re-injured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring, so he turned to fencing and gymnastics."
"Eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader. He graduated in the middle of the class of 1915. That class became known as ""the class the stars fell on"", because 59 members became general officers."
Macroevolution.
"Macroevolution: the study of changes above the species level, and how they take place. The basic data for such a study are fossils (palaeontology) and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Some subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution:"
"It is a term of convenience: for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolution.p87 For some palaeontologists, what they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis. They are in the minority."
Altruism and group selection.
"Altruism – the willingness of some to sacrifice themselves for others – is widespread in social animals. As explained above, the next generation can only come from those who survive and reproduce. Some biologists have thought that this meant altruism could not evolve by the normal process of selection. Instead a process called ""group selection"" was proposed. Group selection refers to the idea that alleles can become fixed or spread in a population because of the benefits they bestow on groups, regardless of the alleles' effect on the fitness of individuals within that group."
"For several decades, critiques cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution."
"In simple cases it can be seen at once that traditional selection suffices. For example, if one sibling sacrifices itself for three siblings, the genetic disposition for the act will be increased. This is because siblings share on average 50% of their genetic inheritance, and the sacrificial act has led to greater representation of the genes in the next generation."
"Altruism is now generally seen as emerging from standard selection. The warning note from Ernst Mayr, and the work of William Hamilton are both important to this discussion."
Hamilton's equation.
Hamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for altruistic behaviour will spread in a population. The gene will spread if rxb is greater than c:
where:
Sexual reproduction.
"At first, sexual reproduction might seem to be at a disadvantage compared with asexual reproduction. In order to be advantageous, sexual reproduction (cross-fertilisation) has to overcome a two-fold disadvantage (takes two to reproduce) plus the difficulty of finding a mate. Why, then, is sex so nearly universal among eukaryotes? This is one of the oldest questions in biology."
The answer has been given since Darwin's time: because the sexual populations adapt better to changing circumstances. A recent laboratory experiment suggests this is indeed the correct explanation.
"In the main experiment, nematode worms were divided into two groups. One group was entirely outcrossing, the other was entirely selfing. The groups were subjected to a rugged terrain and repeatedly subjected to a mutagen. After 50 generations, the selfing population showed a substantial decline in fitness (= survival), whereas the outcrossing population showed no decline. This is one of a number of studies that show sexuality to have real advantages over non-sexual types of reproduction."
What evolution is used for today.
"An important activity is artificial selection for domestication. This is when people choose which animals to breed from, based on their traits. Humans have used this for thousands of years to domesticate plants and animals."
"More recently, it has become possible to use genetic engineering. New techniques such as 'gene targeting' are now available. The purpose of this is to insert new genes or knock out old genes from the genome of a plant or animal. A number of Nobel Prizes have already been awarded for this work."
"However, the real purpose of studying evolution is to explain and help our understanding of biology. After all, it is the first good explanation of how living things came to be the way they are. That is a big achievement. The practical things come mostly from genetics, the science started by Gregor Mendel, and from molecular and cell biology."
Evolution gems.
"In 2010 the journal ""Nature"" selected 15 topics as 'Evolution gems'. These were:"
Responses to the idea of evolution.
Debates about the fact of evolution.
"The idea that all life evolved had been proposed before Charles Darwin published ""On the Origin of species"". Even today, some people still discuss the concept of evolution and what it means to them, their philosophy, and their religion. Evolution does explain some things about our human nature. People also talk about the social implications of evolution, for example in sociobiology."
"Some people have the religious belief that life on Earth was created by a god. In order to fit in the idea of evolution with that belief, people have used ideas like ""guided evolution"" or ""theistic evolution"". They say that evolution is real, but is being guided in some way."
"There are many different concepts of ""theistic evolution"". Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution. As Darwin realised, the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is what it means for human origins."
"In some countries, especially in the United States, there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who do not accept it. The debate is mostly about whether evolution should be taught in schools, and in what way this should be done."
"Other fields, like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts. These ideas were once also fiercely opposed. Death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that Earth was the center of the universe."
"Evolutionary biology is a more recent idea. Certain religious groups oppose the idea of evolution more than other religious groups do. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church now has the following position on evolution: Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical ""Humani Generis"" published in the 1950s:"
"Pope John Paul II updated this position in 1996. He said that Evolution was ""more than a hypothesis"":"
The Anglican Communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution.
Using evolution for other purposes.
"""Indohyus"" is a small deer-like creature, which lived about 48 million years ago in Kashmir. It belongs to the artiodactyls family ""Raoellidae"", and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea."
"About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes."
Size.
"Scientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales, and they found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals. They said this may be why modern whales and extinct diving animals like plesiosaurs became so large."
Coal ball
"A Coal ball is a permineralised life form that is full of calcium, magnesium and occasionally iron sulfide. They generally have a round shape. Coal balls are not made of coal, even though they have the name ""coal ball""."
"In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, found coal balls in England. Because of that, the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe. Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922. Since then, coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed."
"Marie Stopes and D.M.S. Watson also examined coal ball samples. They agreed that coal balls formed ""in situ"". They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form."
Coal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe. The oldest coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia.
"In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls."
"The quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree. However, plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse."
Analysis.
"Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The ball was cut into thin sections with a diamond saw. Then it was flattened and polished with an abrasive. Then it was examined under a microscope. This is the procedure which was carried out by Hooker and Binney. The time needed, and the poor quality of samples produced, led to a more convenient method."
"The new method, first used in 1928, is called the ""liquid peel technique""."
Napster
Napster was a computer program that allowed people to share music over the Internet. It was shut down as the result of a lawsuit by the RIAA. Napster has since reopened with some changes
Paul Flory
"Paul John Flory (June 19, 1910 – September 9, 1985) was an American chemist and Nobel laureate. He worked in the field of polymers, or macromolecules. He was a leading pioneer in understanding how polymers dissolve in solutions. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 ""for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules."""
Biography.
Early life.
"He graduated from Elgin High School in Elgin, Illinois in 1927. Flory received a bachelor's degree from Manchester College (Indiana) in 1931 and a Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 1934. His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers."
Polymer science.
Flory's earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental station. Most chemists studying condensation polymerization believed that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew. Flory argued that the reactivity was independent of the polymer's size. He showed that the number of polymer chains present decreased with size exponentially.
Flory introduced the important concept of chain transfer to the study of addition polymerization. This improved chemists' understanding of the kinetic equations. It also helped chemists to understand the distribution of the polymer sizes.
"In 1938, after Carothers' death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups. He also developed the theory of polymer networks or gels."
"In 1940, he joined the Linden, NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company. He developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures there."
"In 1943, he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as head of a group on polymer fundamentals. In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye, then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University, invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures. He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year. At Cornell, Flory expanded and refined his Baker Lectures into his best work (magnum opus), ""Principles of Polymer Chemistry"" which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press. This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers, and is still widely used to this day."
"Flory introduced the concept of excluded volume to polymers. (Werner Kuhn had already invented the term in 1934 for molecules in general.) ""Excluded volume"" refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough. Excluded volume explained several puzzling experimental results of that time. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics – the long-range interactions coming from the excluded volume are eliminated. This allows experimenters to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory taught another advantage of performing the experiment at the theta point: the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution. This works because excluded volume interactions are neutralized at the theta point."
"He also invented an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution. He invented the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory. He derived the Flory exponent, which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution."

Nadia Comăneci
"Nadia Elena Comăneci (born November 12, 1961) is a Romanian former gymnast."
"She is famous for scoring the first ever perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics history in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Comaneci scored six perfect scores in Canada. She was coached by Béla Károlyi. She is married to former American gymnast Bart Conner, who is a commentator for the sport."
History of post-Soviet Russia
"Because of the end of the Soviet Union, Russia went through a large change politically, economically, and militarily. First off the Soviet Union became the Russian Federation. People now consider that the Federation is a follow up of the Soviet Union. However, Post-Soviet Russia lacked the military and political power of the former USSR. Now that communism died, Russia could elect a President. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected as the first president of Russia."
Change in Economy.
"Boris Yeltsin told his people that he would help the economy. One thing he did was help improve trade with other countries. However, not all his ideas would be good. When Yeltsin lifted price controls, a sudden increase in prices occurred (hyperinflation). Because the military was hit hard during the fall of the Soviet Union, many plants laid off workers because the Government was not sending the plants any new orders. This led to large unemployment."
"In August 1998 the Russian government devalued the ruble and defaulted on their debt. This was called the 1998 Russian financial crisis. This was due in part to the Asian financial crisis and the war in Chechnya. Many banks were forced to close down. The government stopped making payment of wages, pensions and when workers were paid, it was often with goods rather than rubles."
"Despite this, Russia came back from the August 1998 financial crash with speed. This was because the price of oil went up. Having the prices of oil go up, the exportation of the oil form Russia would cost more, this would bring in lots of money for the economy."
A series of privatizations occurred.
Relationships with Countries.
"Unlike in the Cold war, Russia now said that the West was considered an ally. In June 1998 they joined the NATO peace-keeping forces. The Russians also have begun relationships with China. In 1997 the Russians made a treaty with Belarus"
Today.
"Russia in the 21st century has gone through many changes. In 2000 Vladimir Putin was made President of Russia. Through his term he had good and bad approval ratings. In 2001-2002 Putin took over several media stations. Issues like this have also occurred with print media. However Putin has done good things for Russia, Indeed, during real GDP grew on average 6.7% a year, average income increased 11% annually, and a positive balance of the federal budget now let the government to cut 70% of its debt during his term."
Hurricane Henriette (2007)
"Hurricane Henriette was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The storm, which caused nine fatalities, formed from an area of cloud on August 30, 2007, and became a tropical storm the next day. The storm moved along the Mexican Pacific coast, and it rained very heavily. The city that had the most problems was Acapulco, Guerrero, where six people were killed by landslides, and where over 100 families had to leave after the La Sabana River flooded. Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas when it was at its strongest, causing the death of one woman because of rough seas."
"Hurricane Henriette then moved over the Sea of Cortez, and made its second landfall near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm weakened over the Sierra Madre Occidental and what was left went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. The damaged caused cost about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two time when an Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane have made landfall on the same day."
Meteorological history.
"Henriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2007. The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached Central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur. Early on August 30, the area of low pressure, now 400 miles (640 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, started to gain clusters of strong convection. By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning. By 0600 UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven-E."
"Convection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85 miles (137 km) south of Acapulco."
"It continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This is believed to be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico."
"Henriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85 mph (135  km/h) that morning while centered about 75 miles (120 km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas."
"The center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with maximum winds near  (130  km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Sea of Cortez. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category 1 hurricane for most of that day. The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms."
Preparations.
"The formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks. The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31 hours before it became a tropical depression, and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13 hours prior to genesis."
"On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone of alert from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It requested the public to take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges in the south and southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4 meters (13 ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea as a result of the port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600 famiilies might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20 families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido."
"In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense informed that the first of 13 temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000 people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not to leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft."
Impact.
"In 1946, at the request of the GHQ, the Shōwa Emperor (Hirohito) proclaimed in the Humanity Declaration that he had never been an akitsumikami (現御神), divinity in human form, and claimed his relation to the people did not rely on such a mythological idea but on a historically developed family-like reliance."
"Since the enactment of the 1947 constitution, the role of emperor has been relegated to a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers."
"The Deming Prize is the longest-running and one of the highest awards on TQM (Total Quality Management) in the world. It recognizes both individuals for their contributions to the field of Total Quality Management (TQM) and businesses that have successfully implemented TQM. It was established in 1951 to honor W. Edwards Deming who contributed greatly to Japan’s proliferation of statistical quality control after World War II. His teachings helped Japan build its foundation by which the level of Japan’s product quality has been recognized as the highest in the world, was originally designed to reward Japanese companies for major advances in quality improvement. Over the years it has grown, under the guidance of the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) to where it is now also available to non-Japanese companies, albeit usually operating in Japan, and also to individuals recognized as having made major contributions to the advancement of quality. The awards ceremony is broadcast every year in Japan on national television."
"European visitors to Japan observed that the lower classes owere a simple, crude, and child-like people. Public nudity was widespread amongst all ages with little shame, as was public spitting and urination. Bawdy jokes were uttered in public without batting an eye. This was in considerable contrast to the aristocracy with their fine clothing and elaborate etiquette."
"Following the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese ruling class sought to tame the commoners so Europeans might not think they were little more than savages with a bone in their nose. Public nudity and urination were banned in the bigger cities, where foreigners were most likely to visit, and various backward, barbaric, and disgusting religious rituals were outlawed. The upper class took to wearing Western clothing. For the commoners, traditional garb continued to be the norm."
"During the post-WWII occupation, Douglas MacArthur further took it upon himself to civilize Japan. The wearing of Western clothing for everyone was encouraged--for women, blouses, skirts, brassieres, and panties instead of kimonos, and for men, shirts, trousers, and boxer shorts. It may be noted that while Japanese men traditionally wore a loincloth known as a fundosi, women generally went commando under their kimonos--it was observed that on windy days they would ""often be blown open, presenting quite an eyeful."
Post-Occupation Japan.
"Post-Occupation Japan means Japan after its occupation and control by a group of nations had ended. This is the period after the Second World War. The Second World War had damaged Japan very badly. It has almost lost its industry and economy was in a very bad shape. After the war, Japan received assistance and technology from the US and several other countries of Europe. The progress was very rapid. For about 30 years, from around the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan grew very fast. It became one of the major economic powers of the world."
"When the UN forces were fighting in Korea during the Korean War, Japan was one of the major suppliers. This also helped Japan’s economy. By 1980s, Japan had become the world’s second largest economy, after the USA. At first, there was very close relationship between Japan and the USA. But, Japan’s economic might resulted into trade deficit for the USA. A trade deficit results when imports are more than exports. Thus, USA was importing more than it exported to Japan."
"For various reasons, this phase of rapid development ended in the 1990s. Some historians have described this decade as the lost decade of Japanese economy. About 5 to 10 persons in 100 persons could not find any work."
Political life.
"By 1952, Japan had become free from most of the controls of the occupation period. It got its own democratic system. Various political parties came into being and Japan’s political life became active."
Modern Life (Heisei Era).
"Historians and sociologists call the recent era modern life. In Japanese, this is called the Heisei period. By 1989, Japan’s economy had become very large. Much development had taken place. In the Gulf war of 1991, Japan gave billions of dollars."
A 1973 article in the New York Times reported that Indonesians hated Japanese businessmen due to their practices and attitudes towards them.
The Jewish American engineer Jerome Lemelson developed the camcorder and walkman audio recorder for the Japanese company Sony.
"Japan also faced some problems. In 1995, a big earthquake took place in Kobe. Another earthquake took place on 23rd October 2004 in Niigata Prefecture, and a very destructive tsunami damaged the north east coast in March 2011, causing a nuclear accident in Fukushima Prefecture."
"On 8 July 2022, former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe was assassinated while giving a speech in Nara at aged 67."
History of Saudi Arabia
"The beginning of the modern history of the state of Saudi Arabia is argueably when an Islamic reformer named Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and a local ruler named Muhammad bin Saud founded the Emirate of Diriyah in the year 1744. It was founded in the area of Nejd, the central part of the Arabian Peninsula. The Sa'udi emirate's leadership can be viewed as a traditional form of rule within communities of Arabia in the 18th century. Over the next century and a half the family went through a lot of opposition and hurdles. The family faced opposition from powerful families of Arabia but also rulers of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire."
"In 1902 Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, also known as Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, took over the city of Riyadh from another family named Al-Rashid. He continued to win more areas, and on 8 January 1926, he became the King of Hejaz and the Sultan of Nejd. On 20 May in 1927, the government of the United Kingdom accepted him as the King of those areas ruled by him (the Nejd and Hejaz). His kingdom now became a sovereignty. The modern nation state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932 as 'the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia' declared by King Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud. Petroleum oil was found in Saudi Arabia on 3 March in 1938, which made the country rich since the export of oil started to bring in a lot of money."
"But the history of the Arabian Peninsula contains more history, which led to the development of the Saudi state. Inhabitants and cultures can be traced back 63,000 years ago. The most significant event that happened in the Peninsula is the rise of the Islamic religion presented by Prophet Muhammad. The Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate and Fatimid Caliphate all occupied the Arabian Peninsula and thus helped it develop to how we know it today. More dynasties were there in history, but the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina were under the protection of the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca from the 10th century onwards."
Early history.
Pre-Islamic Arabia.
"When discussing pre-Islamic Arabia, we refer to the time before 610 CE. This is the year when the Prophet Muhammad started propagating the religion of Islam and thus when the religion of Islam started to form. The term ‘pre-Islamic Arabia’ is useful because it signals the importance of Islam and its influence in forming the Peninsula as we know it today with all its religions and cultures. But it also shows a relation between the rise of Islam and the native Arabs conquering the world through conquest, trade and innovations."
"This era covers thousands of years with a lot of different cultures and communities. The oldest evidences that point to inhabitants of the Peninsula are estimated to be 63,000 years old. There are inhabitants that had trading relations with many parts of the ancient world, but the hot and harsh climate had made large settlements difficult. So bedouin groups were naturally also present. Some settlements had always existed around oases; these are places in the deserts where growth and water are available. For instance there was a culture called the Dilmun culture among them, which was very old and existed along the Persian Gulf. It was as old as the ancient civilizations of the Sumerians and Egyptians. But also the Kindite kingdom and other ancient communities were present."
It is better to refer to the History of Arabia Wiki page when discussing the Pre-Islamic era. This page (History of Saudi Arabia) will cover more of the Post-Islamic era because of its strong relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Post-Islamic Arabia.
The birth of Islam.
"The Hejaz area became an important center as Islam rose in the 620s. After Prophet Muhammad of the Quraysh tribe started calling to Islam in 610, the already existing cities of Medina (formerly called ""Yathrib"") and Mecca eventually became the holiest places of Islam and thus most of Muslims. The number of followers rapidly began to grow after the migration (or Hijra) of Muhammad and his companions in 622 from Mecca to Medina. During the completion of the religion, both these cities became the holiest places in the Muslim World. Masjid al-Haram and Al-Masjid al-Nabaw I am the main locations of pilgrimage where Muslim hopes to visit the Kaaba primarily in Masjid al-Haram and the Prophet's tomb in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at least once in their lifetime."
Muhammad and his companions went through the Arabian Peninsula in the following years and united the divided tribes of Arabia under one flag. This led to Medina becoming the capital of the newly established Islamic state ruled by the Prophet Muhammad.
"Adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology. Through the process of adaptation, an organism becomes better suited to its habitat."
Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis). A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African rivers and lakes.
"When people speak about adaptation they often mean something which helps an animal or plant survive. One of the most widespread adaptations in animals is the evolution of the eye. Another example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Camouflage is another adaptation; so is mimicry. The better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully (natural selection)."
"An internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex."
Limitations.
"Not all features of an organism are adaptations.p251 Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become useless, and eventually become a dwindling vestige."
"Adaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations."
Genetic drift and its effect.
"In populations, there are forces which add variation to the population (such as mutation), and forces which remove it. Genetic drift is the name given to random changes which remove variation from a population. Genetic drift gets rid of variation at the rate of 1/(2N) where N = population size.p29 It is therefore ""a very weak evolutionary force in large populations"".p55"
"Genetic drift explains how random chance can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways, but only when populations are quite small. Overall, its action is to make the individuals more similar to each other, and hence more vulnerable to disease or to chance events in their environment."
Species.
"How species form is a major part of evolutionary biology. Darwin interpreted 'evolution' (a word he did not use at first) as being about speciation. That is why he called his famous book ""On the Origin of Species""."
"Darwin thought most species arose directly from pre-existing species. This is called ""anagenesis"": new species by older species changing. Now we think most species arise by previous species splitting: ""cladogenesis""."
Species splitting.
"Two groups that start the same can also become very different if they live in different places. When a species gets split into two geographical regions, a process starts. Each adapts to its own situation. After a while, individuals from one group can no longer reproduce with the other group. Two good species have evolved from one."
"A German explorer, Moritz Wagner, during his three years in Algeria in the 1830s, studied flightless beetles. Each species is confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean. As soon as one crosses a river, a different but closely related species appears. He wrote later:"
This was an early account of the importance of geographical separation. Another biologist who thought geographical separation was critical was Ernst Mayr.
"One example of natural speciation is the three-spined stickleback, a sea fish that, after the last ice age, invaded freshwater, and set up colonies in isolated lakes and streams. Over about 10,000 generations, the sticklebacks show great differences, including variations in fins, changes in the number or size of their bony plates, variable jaw structure, and color differences."
"The wombats of Australia fall into two main groups, common wombats and hairy-nosed wombats. The two types look very similar, apart from the hairiness of their noses. However, they are adapted to different environments. Common wombats live in forested areas and eat mostly green food with lots of moisture. They often feed in the daytime. Hairy-nosed wombats live on hot dry plains where they eat dry grass with very little water or nutrition in it. Their metabolic rate is slow and they sleep most of the day underground."
"When two groups that started the same become different enough, then they become two different species. Part of the theory of evolution is that all living things started the same, but then split into different groups over billions of years."
Modern evolutionary synthesis.
"This was an important movement in evolutionary biology, which started in the 1930s and finished in the 1950s. It has been updated regularly ever since."
"The synthesis explains how the ideas of Charles Darwin fit with the discoveries of Gregor Mendel, who found out how we inherit our genes. The modern synthesis brought Darwin's idea up to date. It bridged the gap between different types of biologists: geneticists, naturalists, and palaeontologists."
"When the theory of evolution was developed, it was not clear that natural selection and genetics worked together. But Ronald Fisher showed that natural selection would work to change species. Sewall Wright explained genetic drift in 1931."
Some areas of research.
Co-evolution.
Co-evolution is where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of one or more other species.
"New or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species. The life and death of living things is intimately connected, not just with the physical environment, but with the life of other species."
"These relationships may continue for millions of years, as it has in the pollination of flowering plants by insects. The gut contents, wing structures, and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous. The evolution of nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenoptera and angiosperms."
Tree of life.
"Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in biology. The ""evolutionary tree"" shows the relationships among various biological groups. It includes data from DNA, RNA and protein analysis. Tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy, and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research."
"The major figure in this work is Carl Woese, who defined the Archaea, the third domain (or kingdom) of life. Below is a simplified version of present-day understanding."
"At the end of the wash cycle, the machine starts a rinse cycle wherein the garment load is rinsed with fresh distilled solvent from the pure solvent tank. This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the ""dirty"" working solvent."
"After the rinse cycle, the machine begins the extraction process, which recovers dry-cleaning solvent for reuse. Modern machines recover approximately 99.99% of the solvent that was used. The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350 to 450 rpm, causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric. Until this time the cleaning is done in normal temperature, the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process. When no more solvent can be spun out, the machine starts the drying cycle."
"During the drying cycle, the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air (60-63°C/140-145°F) that circulates through the basket, evaporating any traces of solvent left after the spin cycle. The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments. The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank. Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated. This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution. In the early days of dry cleaning, large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless."
"After the drying cycle is complete, a deodorizing (aeration) cycle cools the garments and removes even more of the solvent, by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins. After the aeration cycle, the garments are clean and ready for pressing/finishing."
"In fact, dry cleaning does not remove all of the solvent. There are no government standards for how much solvent is allowed to remain in the fabric. Detectable amounts of the solvent remain in clothes, with wool clothes retaining the most solvent."
Solvent processing.
"Working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a button trap, which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump."
"Over time, a thin layer of filter cake (called muck) accumulates on the lint filter. The muck is removed regularly (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck. Many machines use ""spin disc filters,"" which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent."
"After the lint filter, the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter. This filter is made from activated clays and charcoal and removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues, along with dyes from the solvent. Finally, the solvent passes through a polishing filter, which removes any soil not previously removed. The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank."
"To enhance cleaning power, small amounts of detergent (0.5%-1.5%) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality. These detergents help dissolve hydrophilic soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments. Depending on the machine's design, either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used."
"Since the solvent recovery is less than 100%, and because dry-cleaning does not remove water-based stains well, entrepreneurs have developed the wet cleaning process, which is, in essence, cold-water washing and air drying, using a computer-controlled washer and dryer. In general, wet cleaning is still being improved and developed, although low-tech versions of it have been used for centuries."
Symbols.
"People who make clothes have special symbols to say how they should be cleaned. The international GINETEX laundry symbol for dry cleaning is a circle. It may have a letter P inside to indicate perchloroethylene solvent, or a letter F inside to indicate a hydrocarbon solvent. A bar underneath the circle means that only mild cleaning processes should be used. A crossed-out empty circle means the clothes should not be dry cleaned."
Dry-cleaning wastes.
Cooked muck.
"Cooked Powder Residue — the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck. Cooked powder residue is a hazardous waste and will contain solvent, powdered filter material (diatomite), carbon, non-volatile residues, lint, dyes, grease, soils, and water. Laws say how this material can be discarded."
Sludge.
"The waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent, water, soils, carbon, and other non-volatile residues. Material removed from the bottom of the stills at chlorinated solvent dry cleaning operations are hazardous wastes."
Environment.
"Perc is classified as a hazardous air contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and must be handled as a hazardous waste. To prevent it from getting into drinking water, dry cleaners that use perc must take special precautions against site contamination. Landlords are becoming increasingly reluctant to allow dry cleaners to operate in their buildings. When released into the air, perc can contribute to smog when it reacts with other volatile organic carbon substances. California declared perchloroethylene a toxic chemical in 1991, and its use will become illegal in that state in 2023."
"Some alternatives such as CO2 avoids the toxic risks of perc. But, CO2 does not clean some forms of grime as well as perc."
Home dry cleaning.
"Various commercial products on the marketplace today, such as Procter &amp; Gamble's Dryel, allow elements of the dry cleaning process to be performed in the household using home laundry machines. Though not the complete process that would be performed by a professional dry cleaner, they allow the convenience of home laundry and work for certain types of garments."
Evolution of cetaceans
"The Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are mammalian marine descendants of land mammals. Their terrestrial origins are indicated by:"
The question of how land animals evolved into ocean-going leviathans was a mystery until recent discoveries in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.
DNA sequence analysis.
"After many years when palaeontologists thought whales had evolved from mesonychids, DNA sequence analysis showed the closest relationship was with artiodactyls, the even-toed ungulates. A new clade was created to include Cetacea and their nearest relatives, the hippopotamus family. This clade is called the Cetartiodactyla."
Fossil record.
"Hippo fossils are not found until the Miocene, but whale ancestors have been found from the Eocene. This leaves a gap of nearly 30 million years where no hippo ancestors are found. The most recent hypothesis is that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor which branched off from other Artiodactyls around 60 million years ago (mya). This ancestral group probably split into two branches around 54 mya. One branch evolved into cetaceans, possibly beginning with the proto-whale ""Pakicetus"" from 52 mya. These early cetaceans gradually became adapted to life in the sea. They became the completely aquatic cetaceans."
"""Indohyus""."
"Heisenberg's rule of multiplication left me no peace, and after a week of intensive thought and trial, I suddenly remembered an algebraic theory...Such quadratic arrays are quite familiar to mathematicians and are called matrices, in association with a definite rule of multiplication. I applied this rule to Heisenberg's quantum condition and found that it agreed for the diagonal elements. It was easy to guess what the remaining elements must be, namely, null; and immediately there stood before me the strange formula"
"Later on, Heisenberg put his discovery into another mathematical form:"
"The math is a way of describing things that happen in the real world. You might imagine that it would be easy to get both the exact position of something and its exact mass, path, and speed at the same time. However, in reality you have to do two things to get your answer. If you are measuring the position and momentum of a bullet that is stuck in a cliff of a great mountain somewhere, it is a simple matter. The mountain does not appear to be going anywhere, and neither is the bullet. So its position is known and its velocity is 0, so its momentum is also 0. But if the bullet is somewhere between a gun and a target, it will be difficult to get its position at any given time. The best we may be able to do is to take its picture using a camera with a very fast shutter. But a single squeeze of the shutter would give you only one thing, the bullet's position at time t. To get the momentum we might put a block of paraffin in the bullet's way and measure how the block of paraffin moved when it stopped the bullet. Or, if we knew the bullet's mass, we might take a sequence of two pictures, compute the velocity by knowing the difference between the two positions of the bullet and the time between its two appearances. However we do it, we need to measure mass and position and time between appearances. We end up making at least two measurements to get to x and p. In that case we have to choose which measurement to make first, and which to make second. It seems to make no difference which order our measurements are made in. Measuring the bullet's mass and then measuring its positions twice, or measuring the bullet's positions twice and then recovering the bullet and measuring its mass would not make any difference, would it? After all, we have not done anything to the bullet when we weigh it or when we make photographs of it."
"On the very small scale when we are measuring something like an electron, however, each measurement does something to it. If we measure position first, then we change its momemtum in the process. If we measure the electron's momentum first, then we change its position in the process. Our hope would be to measure one of them and then measure the other before anything changed, but our measuring itself makes a change, and the best we can hope to do is to reduce to a minimum the energy we contribute to the electron by measuring it. That minimum amount of energy has the Planck constant as one of its factors."
Uncertainty goes beyond matrix math.
"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was found in the earliest equations of the ""new"" quantum physics, and the theory was given by using matrix math. However, the uncertainty principle is a fact about nature, and it shows up in other ways of talking about quantum physics such as the equations made by Erwin Schrödinger."
"Indeterminacy in nature, not uncertainty of humans."
"There have been two very different ways of looking at what Heisenberg discovered: Some people think that things that happen in nature are ""determinate,"" that is, things happen by a definite rule and if we could know everything we need to know we could always say what will happen next. Other people think that things that happen in nature are guided only by probability, and we can know only how things will behave on the average—but we know that very precisely."
The physicist John Stewart Bell discovered a way to prove that the first way cannot be correct. His work is called Bell's theorem or Bell's Inequality.
Popular culture.
"The expression ""quantum leap"" or ""quantum jump"" has been taken to mean some great and transformative change, and it is often used in hyperbolic expressions by politicians and mass media sales campaigns. In quantum mechanics it is used to describe the transition of an electron from one orbit around the nucleus of an atom to any other orbit, higher or lower."
"Sometimes the word ""quantum"" is used in the names of commercial products and businesses. For instance, Briggs and Stratton manufactures many kinds of small gasoline motors for lawn mowers, rotary tillers, and other such small machines. One of their model names is ""Quantum."""
"Because the uncertainty principle tells us that certain measurements at the atomic level cannot be made without disturbing other measurements, some individuals use this idea to describe instances in the human world where the activity of an observer changes the thing that is being watched. An anthropologist may go to some far away place to learn how people live there, but the fact that a strange person from the outside world is there watching them may change the ways that those people act."
"Things that people do while observing things that change what is being observed are cases of the Observer effect. Some things that people do cause changes on the very small level of atoms and are cases of uncertainty or indeterminacy as first described by Heisenberg. The uncertainty principle shows that there is always a limit to how small we can make certain pairs of measurements such as position and speed or trajectory and momentum. The observer effect says that sometimes what people do in observing things, e.g., learning about an ant colony by digging it up with garden tools, can have big effects that change what they were trying to learn about."
Anthony Henday
Anthony Henday (fl. 1750 – 1762) was one of the first white men to explore the interior of the Canadian northwest. His explorations were for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) who were worried that La Vérendrye and the other western commanders were taking furs from the northwest to their forts.
"Henday volunteered to undertake an expedition into this territory. He came from the Isle of Wight, and was a convicted smuggler and joined the HBC in 1750 as a net-maker and labourer. Henday had gained some experience in inland travel after arriving at York Factory. On June 26, 1754, he set out with a group of Plains Indians. They passed the French Fort Paskoya where he may have met La Corne, the western commander at that time."
"In October of 1754 he and his group came to what is now Alberta from York Factory with a mission to meet the Blackfoot and perhaps trade with them. The Blackfoot did not give a clear answer, but Henday decided they meant “no”, so he travelled back to York Factory with news that he had explored the area and had met with the Blackfoot. Since the answer had been unsure, there was no more expeditions to Alberta."
"This trip, and later ones, took Henday across much of the prairies of what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta and his journal shows that he brought a lot of trade to York Factory. Records show that some of the trade also went to the French at Fort Saint-Louis (Fort de la Corne) and Fort Paskoya which were on the route to Hudson Bay. He left the service of the HBC in 1762 largely because his efforts for the company, at least in his estimation, had not been properly recognized."
"Anthony Henday Drive, a large ring road in Edmonton is named in his honour."
Disney's Hollywood Studios
"Disney's Hollywood Studios is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida, United States. Its theme is show business, based on Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the third park built at the resort. It opened on May 1, 1989, as Disney-MGM Studios."
"In 2009, the park had around 9.7 million guests, ranking it the fourth-most visited amusement park in the United States, and seventh-most visited in the world."
"The park symbol is The Sorcerer's Hat, which is based on the magical hat from ""Fantasia;"" it replaced the Earful Tower as the park's icon in 2001 but now both have been removed."
Attractions.
"The park has six themed areas. Unlike the other Walt Disney World parks, Disney's Hollywood Studios does not have a defined layout; it is more a mass of streets and buildings that blend into each other, much like a real movie studio would. The park used to have a large Hidden Mickey in the plaza at the end of Hollywood Boulevard which could be seen in aerial photographs of the park and on the park's early guide maps. However, construction and other changes to the park have gotten rid of much of this image."
Hollywood Boulevard.
"Hollywood Boulevard is the park's main entrance and is lined with stores selling Disney merchandise. Parades such as the Pixar Block Party Bash travel down Hollywood Boulevard on their route through the park, and live street entertainment can be found here throughout the day. Michael Eisner, who had a major part in the park's creation ever since the earliest development, demanded the opening land operate on the same principle as Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom, but in a style more fitting to the Studios."
"At the far end of Hollywood Boulevard is the Sorcerer's Hat, the icon of Disney's Hollywood Studios. Behind it, inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theater, is The Great Movie Ride, a dark ride with scenes from several classic movies, including ""Casablanca"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""."
Echo Lake.
"The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy, though students now study a broad range of secular subjects."
"A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman and lawyer from Brecon in Wales. The college continues to be associated informally with Wales to this day."
"The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford."
"The life of the college was disrupted by the English Civil War. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards."
Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions in the latter half of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships. This meant the college was no longer mostly Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects. Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.
"There are about 475 students. The Principal of the college is Lord Krebs, the son of the Nobel Prize winner Hans Krebs. Former students include Harold Wilson (twice British Prime Minister), Norman Washington Manley (Chief Minister of Jamaica) and T.E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"")."
The university's Chair (professorship) of Celtic is attached to the college.
Nosferatu
"Nosferatu eine Symphonie des Grauens (translation: ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror"") is a 1922 German silent horror movie by F. W. Murnau. It was based on the ""Dracula"" novel by Bram Stoker."
"The movie was shot in 1921 and was released in Germany in 1922 and in the US in 1929. It is about a vampire or ""Nosferatu"" named Count Orlok (starring Max Schreck) who lives in a castle on top of a hill. The movie is in the public domain in America but not in Germany."
The movie was a commercial failure and caused the company Prana Film to be shut down due to copyright infringement. The movie was the only movie by Prana Film.
"The movie got a strong cult following. Not only this, the movie has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it got a ""Certified Fresh"" label: 98% of critics gave the film a positive review with a ""fresh"" rating, based on 46 reviews."
"In 2010, it was ranked twenty-first in ""Empire"" magazine's ""The 100 Best Films of World Cinema""."
Plot.
"In 1838, Thomas Hutter lives in the fictional German city of Wisborg. His mysterious employer, estate agent Herr Knock, sends Hutter to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok who plans to buy a house in Wisborg. Hutter entrusts his loving wife Ellen to his good friend Harding and Harding's sister Annie, before embarking on his long journey. Nearing his destination in the Carpathian Mountains, Hutter stops at an inn for dinner. The locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name and discourage him from traveling to his castle at night, warning of a werewolf on the prowl."
"The next morning, Hutter takes a coach to a high mountain pass, but the coachman declines to take him any further than the bridge as nightfall is approaching. A black-swathed coach appears after Hutter crosses the bridge and the coachman gestures for him to climb aboard. Hutter is welcomed at a castle by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away."
"Hutter wakes up to a deserted castle the morning after and notices fresh punctures on his neck which, in a letter he sends by courier on horseback to be delivered to his devoted wife, he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house across from Hutter's own home in Wisborg and notices a photo of Hutter's wife, remarking that she has a ""lovely neck."""
Production.
"""Nosferatu"" is Prana Film's only production. Prana Film was founded 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau. Grau had the idea to shoot a vampire film; the inspiration arose from Grau's war experience: in the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the Undead."
"Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen a job to screenplay inspired from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ""Dracula"", despite Prana Film not having rights to the film. Galeen was an experienced specialist in Dark romanticism ; he had already worked on ""Der Student von Prag"" (""The Student of Prague"") in 1913, and the screenplay for 1920's ""Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam"" (""The Golem: How He Came into the World""). Galeen set the story in a fictional north German harbour town named Wisborg and changed the character names. He added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. He left out the Van Helsing vampire hunter character. Galeen's German Expressionism screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as """" (""full of poetry, full of rhythm"")."
"Dieckmann and Gray won the director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, who made movies until 1919, but had made ​​his first seven productions a reputation as a talented filmmaker. Gray, who had studied at the Art Academy in Dresden, took over as artistic director and designed sets and costumes. For the soundtrack of the musical director of the Prana-Film Hans Erdmann was responsible. The unknown stage actor Max Schreck from Munich, was committed for the title role. Other roles took on expressionist theater of Max Reinhardt trained actors like Greta Schröder, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Alexander Granach, a former classmate at Murnau Reinhardt's acting school at the Deutsches Theater."
"Filming began in July 1921. Exterior shots were filmed in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor, the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard from Aegidienkirche served as Hutters and down the Depenau ""coffin bearers"" beared coffins. Many walks of Lübeck took place in the hunt of ""Knock"" who ordered Hutter in the ""Yard of Füchting"" to meet the earl. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The film team travelled to the Carpathian Mountains, where Orava Castle served as backdrop for Orlok's half-ruined castle. Nearby locations also served: Hutter's stay at Dolný Kubín; the river journey with the coffins filmed on the Váh River; and the panoramas of the High Tatras mountain range. The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality. and further exteriors in the Tegel forest. Parts of the film set in Transylvania were also shot in Slovakia."
"For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative. The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters. Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the Sun. Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting."
"Since the camera was mostly static and immobile to Nosferatu, Murnau used movement and differentiation within the rigid cadre in order to energize the scene. As Orloks ship slowly moves from right to left through the movie screen, Murnau used this so Eisner's ""powerful effect[s] of the impression of transverse motion."" would stress education. This served the same purpose subjectifications of the camera view, such as when the vampire filmed on the ship from the frog perspective or stand looking out of windows, parts of the frame and shoots into view . The highlight of the subjectivated gaze are the scenes in which the vampire character - directly facing the camera - turns to the audience and thus the fourth wall is broken: ""The vampire seems by its immensity, the dimensions of the screen to blow up and the viewers to directly threaten """
Release.
"Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue 21 of the magazine ""Bühne und Film"", with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports and essays including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau. Nosferatu's preview premiered on 4 March 1922 in the ""Marmorsaal"" of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening called """" (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's ."
"This was Prana Film's only movie because the movie was a financial failure as a limited release. The UFA refused to take the film in the program of their large movie theaters, and so Nosferatu was only shown in a few small theaters. This was also because Bram Stoker had an estate, acting for his widow, Florence Stoker, sueing for copyright infringement and winning. The court ordered all existing prints of ""Nosferatu"" burned, but one purported copy of the film had already been distributed around the world. These prints were duplicated over the years."
Reception.
"Despite the movie's failure and Prana Film's bankruptcy in 1922, the film received critically positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes says that 98% of critical reviews were positive (53 out of a total 55 reviews) with an average rating of 3.9/5, stating, ""One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel -- and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire -- set the template for the horror films that followed."""
"Roger Ebert called it ""more effective for being"" a ""silent"" film. He concluded,"
"Ulrich Gregor and Enno Patalas evaluate ""Nosferatu"" as a quantum leap in Murnau's cinematic work for being ""visible for the first time in any setting."" Thomas Elsaesser says the appeal of the film from the conflict between technical perfection and its mainly psychological acting subject: ""Murnau's poetry, the result was a detached, almost clinical application of technical mastery German photography and camera work in an emotionally charged, with deep-seated fears and feelings related topics"". The dream-like, the subconscious appealing presentation give the film a ""shadow only decipherable, hidden logic"", they keep the film ""still strong appeal character,"" says Thomas Koebner. Also Kreimeier Klaus picks up on this film ""Nosferatu"" effect and certify an ""authenticity of the dream - and the fictional (the means based on conventions) character of what we call reality."""
"In chemistry, yield (also called chemical yield or reaction yield) is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction. The ""absolute yield"" gives the weight in grams, and the ""molar yield"" gives the number of moles."
"The ""fractional yield"", ""relative yield"", or ""percentage yield"" shows how completely a synthetic procedure worked. It is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the ""theoretical yield"" (the unit of measurement for both must be the same):"
formula_1
"To get the ""percentage yield"", one must multiply the fractional yield by 100% (e.g., 0.673 × 100% = 67.3%)."
"The ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100%, but it cannot be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate. Yields around 100% are ""quantitative"", yields above 90% are ""excellent"", yields above 80% are ""very good"", yields above 70% are ""good"", yields above 50% are ""fair"", and yields below 40% are ""poor""."

Dry cleaning
"Dry cleaning (or dry-cleaning) is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent (a chemical that can dissolve certain compounds) rather than water. The solvent used is usually tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene). The solvent is called ""perc"" in the industry and ""dry-cleaning fluid"" by the public. It is often used instead of hand washing delicate fabrics. People use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing."
History.
"The ancient Romans used a chemical called ammonia (derived from urine) and fuller's earth (a clay that can absorb grease and oil.) to clean their woolen togas. ""Fullonicae"" were very famous, with at least one in every town of any notability, and frequently the largest employer in a district. These laundries got their urine from farm animals, or from special pots situated at public bathrooms. The workforce made so much money that fuller's guilds (a group that works in solely one job, in this case, making fuller's earth, this special clay.) were an important political force. Also, the government taxed the collection of urine and sent people to jail for wetting their pants."
"Modern dry cleaning uses solvents that do not use water to remove dirt and stains from clothing. Jean Baptiste Jolly discovered that petroleum-based solvents (chemicals based on fuel like gasoline or kerosene.) can be used for dry-cleaning in the mid-19th century. Jolly was a French dye-works owner. He noticed that his tablecloth became cleaner after his maid spilled kerosene on it. Because of this, he developed a service cleaning people's clothes this way, which became known as ""nettoyage à sec,"" or ""dry cleaning""."
"Early dry cleaners used petroleum-based solvents, such as gasoline (petrol) and kerosene. Fire concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop Stoddard solvent as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The government started to control dry cleaners because the highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions."
"After World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power. By the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), widely called ""perc,"" as the best solvent. It has excellent cleaning power and is stable, nonflammable, and gentle to most clothing. However, perc was also the first chemical to be classified as a carcinogen (a chemical that can cause cancer.) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (a classification later withdrawn). In 1993, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations to reduce perc emissions from dry cleaning operations. The dry cleaning industry is in the process of replacing perc with other chemicals and/or methods."
"Traditionally, the actual cleaning process was carried out at centralized ""factories""; high street cleaners shops received garments from customers, sent them to the factory, and then had them returned to the shop, where the customer could collect them. This was due mainly to the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry-cleaning was carried out in two different machines — one for the cleaning process itself and the second to dry the clothing."
"Machines of this era were called ""vented""; their fumes and drying exhausts were sent into the air, in the same way as with modern tumble dryer exhausts. This added to environmental contamination. Also much potentially reusable perc was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed. No solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled. So, it can be reused to clean further loads, or safely thrown away. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically feels when most traces of perc have been removed from the load during the drying process. This system ensures that only the smallest amount of perc fumes will be released when opening the door at the end of the cycle."
Process.
"A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine, and clothes dryer. Garments are placed into a washing/extraction chamber (referred to as the basket, or drum). The chamber is the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the clothing. The basket can hold between about 10 and 40 kg (20 to 80 lb)."
"During the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber is filtered and then fed back into the chamber. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit that has both a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is one gallon of solvent per pound of garments (roughly 8 litres of solvent per kilogram of clothing) per minute, depending on the size of the machine."
"Operators also check clothing for foreign objects before placing them into the machine. Items such as plastic pens will dissolve in the solvent bath and may damage textiles beyond recovery. Some textile dyes are ""loose"" (red being the main problem), and will release dye during solvent immersion. Operators will dry clean red clothing separately from lighter-color textiles to avoid color transfer. The solvent used must be distilled to remove impurities that may transfer to clothing. Operators checked clothing for dry-cleaning compatibility, including fasteners. Many fasteners that decorate clothing either are not dry cleaning solvent proof or will not withstand the mechanical action of cleaning. Operators will remove them and restitched them after the cleaning. Or, operators will wrap them in a small padded protector. Fragile items, such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings, may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag. The density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm³ at room temperature (70% heavier than water), and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support."
"Many people believe that all marks or stains can be removed by dry cleaning. Not every stain can be cleaned just by dry cleaning. Some need to be treated with spotting solvents; sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain remover liquids before garments are washed or dry cleaned. Also, garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture. Natural fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk of lighter colors should not be left in dirty or soiled condition for long amounts of time as they absorb dirt in their texture and are unlikely to be restored to their original color and finish."
The main reason that washing in water has a different result than dry cleaning is that water is a polar solvent while dry cleaning uses a non-polar solvent.
"A typical wash cycle lasts for 8–15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes approximately ten to twelve minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry-cleaning surfactant ""soap"" may also be added."
"Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room,"
but our cat would sleep with us
and he hated that.
Did he?
Uh-huh.
"He just thought that they belong,"
and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that.
Uh-huh.
"So, I guess it's probably, probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats."
"I think it would probably be a dog,"
and it would definitely be an outdoor animal.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I think that's one of the reasons our,"
"because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old."
And so he was becoming incontinent.
"And so then I would just have messes in the house,"
"and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, and it was new carpeting"
"and, you know, it just really, you know, upset me no end."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that would, Greg, uh,"
my husband's grandparents have a dog
"and they just,"
it needs to be put to sleep
"but it's grandpa's dog,"
"and, uh, he's really getting too old to take care of it."
But the dog messes all over the carpet
and my daughter is just nine months old
I'm jealous.
"and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,"
"it's a three eighty-six,"
"I guess it's twenty-five,"
"yeah,"
three eight six twenty-five C maybe
"I don't know,"
no we don't have the
we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
"and,"
What kind of consulting do you do?
"Um, well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,"
Uh-huh.
and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
"Um, well, it depends,"
"it's very different in the different places,"
"but,"
Is it programming related?
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Program related, research related,"
"and I work in the speech field,"
"and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,"
Uh-huh.
"and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,"
"and we, like here we use the P C to do that."
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
Word processing.
"Well, more, uh,"
"do you know Latek? Word text processing,"
No I'm not familiar with that.
uh-huh.
"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you."
"But each of these had an annual fee also, right."
Exactly.
"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,"
I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up
Uh-huh.
"but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, five dollars a year."
"Yeah,"
forty five.
"Right, uh,"
"I,"
"Which was a lot,"
"because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month."
"Exactly, you know,"
"I, that's it,"
"I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,"
"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,"
"and here, most of the stores will accept those,"
and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had a Discover,"
"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing."
"Um, it really wasn't my choice, though."
"I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards."
Oh.
"Um, I ended up going through a credit counseling service um, because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And if you're alienated,"
"I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems, that, you think this isn't sinking in."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I've seen more graduates from M I T"
"and that,"
Uh-huh.
"being,"
"I work in a, in a an Air Force laboratory"
"and so we've got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there"
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Even, even more so, uh, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too,"
"I, I mean I have to confess to that."
"Yeah,"
"it's sort of a, a rare select environment."
"Yeah,"
"and they have their own quirks and tolerances and, you know, certain things that don't bother us at all, that would drive other people nuts"
Yeah.
and then certain things that
"ways, things we do,"
"the way we do it that drive other people nuts that,"
"Right,"
"right,"
sure.
"But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world."
"It, it's a,"
"I, I have more I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh, degrees,"
Yeah.
It's a top rated institution
"and now I,"
"but they're undergrads are like,"
"I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,"
"but not,"
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
"and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches."
Um
"At this time of the year,"
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
"and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer."
"Yeah,"
"well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas."
Right.
"But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,"
but we have our share of cold weather as well.
"The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing."
"It didn't stay there,"
"but it was right at,"
"Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?"
Um.
"We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,"
but this year it wasn't bad at all.
I guess that's because we had so much rain.
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
"He said it was just,"
"and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,"
"Oh, yeah."
"and, uh,"
"Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston"
"and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,"
"and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course."
"Oh, boy."
"They have a, uh, lake cabin"
"I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time,"
and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music.
"Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes."
"I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues,"
"and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,"
"Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even."
"Right,"
right.
"Uh, well, that gets,"
"some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music,"
"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,"
"but the, the actual,"
"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even"
"Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music"
"Yeah,"
I guess.
"um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it"
Uh-huh.
Um.
Do you like rap?
"Um, some of it, um,"
it depends.
"I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um,"
and they usually do a lot of satire
Yeah
um.
that kind I kind of like.
Right.
"Some of it is kind of pointless,"
"Right,"
"and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease"
Uh-huh.
so she doesn't remember anybody
Right.
"and, uh, she remembers things,"
but they are things back whenever she was real young
Right.
"and so, with,"
she was living by herself
"but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her"
Uh-huh.
and it's creating a lot of problems.
"Right,"
especially for your uncle I bet.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.
Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
"In Dallas,"
"uh, yeah."
"I've, I've heard of several things"
"and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,"
"but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up."
Right.
So they are pretty limited.
Right.
"Oh, another interesting thing,"
"another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities."
Oh really.
Uh-huh.
"I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
"And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern."
"There's always something, no matter how young,"
and then that helps develop that attitude.
"Um, I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more."
"You know, I think this is certainly a possible way, um, to handle it"
"but I wish,"
that's something that I think that has been lost in families
and I think that's a good place to start again.
Yeah.
"I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for anybody else."
Yeah.
"And I do think, um, the schools,"
"if you're trying to do something, even with food drives"
"and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both,"
I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, that's, uh,"
"gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas"
"and, uh  it's,"
That's probably true.
That's probably true.
"I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young"
but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia  area every year.
Uh-huh.
They've done this for fourteen years now.
"Oh, that's great."
"Um, and it is, it's, uh,"
"and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close."
"Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it really,"
"Oh, I see."
"Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a residential area."
Um.
"And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know,"
"this dog, being a small dog it's, uh, more you, more acceptable"
Yeah
"but again,"
it's not that big of a problem.
"With Domino, she was full grown,"
I would estimate seventy pounds.
Yeah.
"And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town,"
it's a suburb of Orlando
Uh-huh.
"but there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around,"
"and she was a dog that loved to run,"
"so that was the biggest problem I saw,"
"and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around,"
"or, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats."
"Me and cats don't get along too well, uh"
"but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns."
"It's like, uh,"
"there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,"
"but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"that, that,"
"and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise."
"Sure,"
"and that's all part of of keeping your part of the relationship. You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh, those issues."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law teaches at, uh, Northern Illinois University"
"and they were in China, here a couple of years ago,"
"and he was over there at, uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching ..."
"So, uh, describe your family budget."
"Well, I've, uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one,"
"and, uh, just recently, uh, we, we set up a budget,"
"and, and we're trying to stick to it."
We just bought a new house.
"So we've got everything, you know, pretty much we know what our, uh, our fixed expenses are per month,"
"and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range,"
"and then, uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about,"
"and that's, that's the food"
"Well, yeah,"
"and to some extent, utilities, I imagine."
"well, the utilities are pretty much,"
"you can pretty much figure what they're going to be,"
and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you.
"They have that to some extent here,"
but it's not quite as good.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, transportation expenses,"
I guess you own a car.
Yes
sir.
And you know how much you're going to drive every week?
"Well, I used to, um, I used to know, uh, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, uh, nine tenths of a mile from work."
Huh.
"So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day to and from work."
So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.
"But now I've just bought a new house,"
"and I'm a half hour,"
"And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money."
"As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars."
Yep.
Right.
"And it was just,"
"I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,"
Yeah.
"so. So it gives you idea that,"
Yeah.
Definitely
I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
"Sure,"
sure.
"So,"
"I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think."
Than we think.
Sure.
Sure.
"But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure."
Uh-huh.
It sure is.
"The, you know, as far as,"
I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days
"and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing"
"but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this,"
and it was something more than just the conferences.
"They were using it as eating out, uh,"
"when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress."
Uh-huh.
"Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling."
Uh-huh.
"We don't, we don't do enough."
I know we don't so
"Uh, although lately I've been, uh,"
a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit
"and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does"
"and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups"
and I don't do that anymore.
"I don't know why,"
"I just don't I just, just from socializing with her"
so.
"How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?"
"Is,"
"It really, it, there's not a whole lot,"
there really isn't.
"Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,"
"they're, they're given three baskets"
Uh-huh.
and they put them out on a certain day of the week
Right.
"and each, uh, home does participate"
"but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything."
"And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense."
Oh.
Right.
"Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to."
"But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off."
That's what I do.
"Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.
Uh-huh.
"He's very, very skeptical of the news media,"
and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also.
"But he's, I don't know, uh, he's much, much more so."
"It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, um."
"He was always speaking in terms of, you know, American imperialism reasserting itself."
"Um, I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country."
Uh-huh
"Well I, I, uh, I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize."
Uh-huh.
"True, um,"
"the,"
I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't.
"They, um, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story."
Uh-huh.
They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
"Sort of like the, uh, what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story."
"But they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories."
"They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town."
"No,"
no.
It's very much national interest news.
Yeah.
"A lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts"
"and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions"
"and sometimes that,"
"I don't know the value of that, because I saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals, making a living during the, the Gulf War."
I've been getting a kick out of those lately.
Uh-huh.
"or,"
"Uh, we've got a house,"
"let's see,"
we moved in about four years ago
"and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,"
but it had existed for three years.
Okay.
"This is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of them"
"and, I guess he, he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal"
So the whole block was all foreclosed.
Oh.
"And, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many."
"Well, your, was your house in good shape,"
was it damaged?
"Yes,"
"no,"
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open
"Oh, it was?"
"But,"
yeah.
Oh.
"So we just, you know, we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that."
I see.
"And, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems"
"and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything."
But the prices are much lower here
"and this was definitely not a fix up special,"
"but I'll tell you,"
it takes all my time
"Between, we put in our own sprinkler system"
"and I just finished repainting the exterior and, you know, making drapes and buying furniture,"
it's just a money pit. Really is.
"Well, it has been."
"Although the new president and C E O of the company is from a much more formal eastern, uh, background."
Oh.
"And so the result is that, uh,"
so anyway I wore this suit
"and I went over to, uh, uh, to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it"
Uh-huh.
"and it, and I, I was almost converted because, uh, the effect of that suit on the way people reacted and responded to me as opposed to the,"
"uh, just to kind of,"
"how shall I say it,"
they know you're there
but they don't
"uh, you don't,"
there's no notice at all.
"But when I wore a suit that day, uh, it was obvious that people didn't know whether I was a worker bee or a manager."
Wow.
"So people, uh, how shall I say it, made a, made much more effort to notice you, acknowledge your presence, say hello and, uh, things like that,"
so.
That's interesting.
"It's like a mini, little study there"
Yeah.
That's really interesting.
"And so this dress for success thing, I think is, uh,"
"by and large I've, I'm kind of, uh, convinced that, uh, by that, just that one, uh, uh, experience and then having talked to several other people that, that, uh, unless you're in a, an environment where they're going to make fun of, of, of better clothes, that better clothes always pay off."
Right.
Huh.
That's interesting.
"Doesn't mean they have to be, uh,"
"how shall I say it,"
"they don't have to be the, the most, uh, the absolute best"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, a little dressing a little bit above the standard, I think, would, uh, pay off"
"I suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,"
I guess that's true.
"But, uh, I never had bad experience in that respect"
"Of course, you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents,"
"and they, you know,"
pretty good people
"Um. Well, the thing I really worry about is, uh, the sexual abuse cases you read about."
Uh-huh.
And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened.
Yeah.
I never really worry very much about it.
I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public
"so, I  never really worried too much about that being, uh, uh, the case with my boys."
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Uh, I, you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them"
but
Uh-huh.
"I don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe"
Uh-huh.
And another thing is cost.
"Oh, yeah"
"I mean that,"
I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now
"and they finding, in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare."
Right.
Um.
"Well, in our case, we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were, uh, in school."
"And I'm really happy we did it, although it was very, very difficult."
And  I think it was the right thing to do
Um.
"and we were, uh, we just decided that we would do it"
"so I don't, I don't use, I mean,"
"you can call it word processing,"
but I don't usually use a word processor to do it
Uh-huh
and we don't have too much standard software.
"Like I haven't bought, we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all."
So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.
"We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal,"
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.
"So, you've got, you've got a modem in it then."
"Uh, neither one has a modem,"
but we have a modem.
At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them?
"Neither one,"
Right.
"Uh, and so it's an external modem."
"Yeah,"
we have
"I got, when I got mine I had an internal modem in it"
Uh-huh.
"I used it, uh, quite a bit when I was, uh, uh, looking at, uh, information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a, in Fort Worth"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, went out of town for a while,"
"and, and sort of got off the, uh, bulletin board and off of my micro completely"
Uh-huh.
"and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without, uh, even without using it on the computer,"
"I could turn a computer on,"
it'd start squawking.
So I finally opened up the box and took it out.
So that was it.
I think that's the thirty second warning.
"Oh, I didn't hear it."
"Yes,"
I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago.
"I wanted to see it, uh, because there was, uh, much recommended, for months and months and months"
"and it was a, a genre that I wasn't in the least bit interested in,"
"and I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre I don't like,"
Uh-huh.
"I figure, well, I should go see it, because if this is, you know, the best of the genre and I should know about it, or something like that"
"Yeah,"
"right, uh-huh."
"and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show"
"Yeah,"
"I, I, I, I feel that way when movies are like blown up, out of proportion, you know"
Yeah.
"usually people tell you how good they are,"
"and you always, you know, end up with expectations too high or whatever,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Right.
"Well, the, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of, uh, I guess, Hollywood movies which is they are, it's a formula movie,"
Uh-huh.
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula
Uh-huh.
"but they seem to fall short of, of being really creative with a lot of things,"
"I mean here's the situation of this kid at home, you know,"
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
Right.
"and, you know, he did some clever things,"
"but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was, it seems to me they could have done a lot more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain"
Yeah
and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.
"so, that's one, one way he looked at it."
Yeah.
"that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them."
"I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars"
"and I couldn't, you know,"
"I just like, you know,"
"you sure you're a boy,"
"I mean, your not interested in cars,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them."
"And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing."
"I mean, he couldn't even check the oil."
"I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested."
Uh-huh.
"And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know,"
"I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing"
and maybe we could have communicated better.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"I, I think that's great."
"Yeah,"
it didn't always work.
"Well, I felt, um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it."
"I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things."
"I'm, I'm happy to let them run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um,"
"so, I haven't tried to do a lot myself."
"Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the in, in doing things,"
"in fact, uh, when I, uh, first transferred down to, uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven, um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car because she was up here for a month or so, after I was"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it was an interesting experience for her."
"I mean, she'd always assisted me and done some other things"
"that can, that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day, or more in school"
"and so any other part of your life, that's going to definitely affect your school life, because you spend so much time there."
Yeah.
"And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you, from the minute that you walk in until, until you leave, your, your competing against somebody else"
"or your competing against, uh, a system or, or something, you know,"
Right.
"and then, a lot of"
there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive.
"They're cooperative rather than competitive,"
Uh-huh.
"and when they get into a real competitive system they just say, oh well, what the heck, and, uh, tend not to, you know, do too awful well ."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"I talked to, a guy the other day"
"and he is now in, in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he, he fell back several years ago"
"and he's going to, he, he will have gone to school five years."
Yeah.
"Um, and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died,"
Uh-huh.
"and he was having to, uh, support his entire family, take care of his brothers and sisters, you know,"
Uh-huh.
and all that had an adverse affect on his school life.
"I would think so,"
yeah.
"And, yeah,"
"and that, and that's a perfect example of how your home life, you know, plays a definite part."
"And, you know, any other aspect of your life,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"an, but now, now, that he's in this program and, you know, he's, I guess okay,"
Yeah.
"and I don't have that in my current operation,"
"but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule"
"and that's, that's good."
Yeah.
"And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?"
"Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that's true.
"I just prefer to worry about today,"
probably not a practical attitude
but that's who I am
"so,"
"Well, and that's an individual thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package"
"and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times"
Right.
"and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,"
"Okay, uh,"
"some of the T V shows I like to watch are, uh, mostly evening, evening shows"
"and, uh, like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY."
I usually watch those prime time programs.
Right.
"Uh, I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS."
"Never miss that and, uh, sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE."
"Uh, and then the week goes by"
and I don't think I ever watch anything else.
"You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. But, uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's going on and that kind of thing."
"I I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss."
"Yes,"
"I understand that,"
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
"Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and, and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems."
"So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country."
"Oh, absolutely."
Over a very long period of time.
"Right,"
absolutely.
"Uh, and, uh,"
We only see the tip of the iceberg only.
Right.
"You know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, uh, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture."
Yeah.
"Well, you may be right."
"What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, uh, we as a society deal with it"
"and I, and I think it is, what you say, it's, it's a,"
"Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are, that are an invasion of your privacy?"
"Well, the, uh,"
"what I really, I don't like is the the constant calls, people selling things people telling me I want things. You know, people trying to solicit for different, you know, organizations."
Oh.
Right.
"You know, that's what I really."
"Yeah,"
"I think that's, that's the only thing I wrote down also,"
"because that's just a, it's terrible today,"
"I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes."
"Never stops ringing,"
right.
That's right.
"Well, you know, the, the great, uh, thing for that, it's, uh, is, is an answering machine"
"Yes,"
"I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world."
Do you really not?
"I, I, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know."
"Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment"
"and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years."
"Yeah,"
that's true.
That's very true.
"We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas"
"and, uh, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know,"
"they work up this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do."
"And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education."
"We have a two year old, you know,"
"and, and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,"
we have to do that now.
"And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,"
"and he's two now,"
"in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,"
"and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to,"
"it's, what it costs now is ridiculous,"
what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.
"And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college."
"And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year."
"So, I guess it, you know,"
"in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know."
"We, we can worry about other things"
"so,"
"I understand, that approach."
Yeah.
and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision.
"Well, I hadn't, uh, thought of it from that point of view before."
How do you feel about that?
"I have been in a fairly important trial,"
"and, uh, what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and, uh, accurate decision."
Right.
That's the part that bothered me about it.
"Um, I really think that the, the, the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not."
"But I also think that the jury should be, uh, very, very, uh, carefully, more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate decisions."
Right.
"I hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff,"
"and, and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time."
Right.
That's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem.
Right.
"Well, what if they used, you know,"
I just had a thought come as you were talking.
What if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials?
That would be certainly nice
let's say
"we, we would have fifty percent of them law students,  anyway .   Yeah."
"Yeah,"
at least.
"At least,  on the jury."
Yeah.
"And that would give them,  experience in the courtroom,"
Uh-huh.
and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major.
"That's a very neat idea,"
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial.
Right.
That's right.
"Units of the 5th Bombardment Group based at Palikulo included the 23d Bombardment Squadron operating B-17Es and later B-24s from 1 December 1942 until 3 January 1944, and the 72d Bombardment Squadron and 394th Bombardment Squadron both operating B-17s.

The Happy Valley Football Club is an Australian rules football club that competes in the Southern Football League.
"The club first formed in 1952 playing in the former Hills Central Football League. In 1964, Happy Valley transferred to the Glenelg-South-West District Football Association and adopted the colours Black and Gold to avoid a clash with the Glandore club (having previously worn Blue and Gold)."

"In 2003, Cabinet approved the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, who said that new regulations were needed to cater for changes in the aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes in the last few years to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). These included Certification of Service Providers; Regulatory Functions; Airworthiness of Aircraft; Licensing; and Flight Operations and Rules of the Air. A transition period of six months from the date of promulgation was provided to allow stakeholders to comply with the amended Regulations."

"More than 420 feature-length film versions of Shakespeare's plays have been produced since the early 20th century, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever. Some of the film adaptations, especially Hollywood movies marketed to teenage audiences, use his plots rather than his dialogue, while others are simply filmed versions of his plays."
"For centuries there had been an accepted style of how Shakespeare was to be performed which was erroneously labeled ""Elizabethan"" but actually reflected a trend of design from a period shortly after Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare's performances were originally performed in contemporary dress. Actors were costumed in clothes that they might wear off the stage. This continued into the 18th century, the Georgian period, where costumes were the current fashionable dress. It was not until centuries after his death, primarily the 19th Century, that productions started looking back and tried to be ""authentic"" to a Shakespearean style. The Victorian era had a fascination with historical accuracy and this was adapted to the stage in order to appeal to the educated middle class. Charles Kean was particularly interested in historical context and spent many hours researching historical dress and setting for his productions. This faux-Shakespearean style was fixed until the 20th century. As of the twenty-first century, there are very few productions of Shakespeare, both on stage and on film, which are still performed in ""authentic"" period dress, while as late as 1990, virtually every true film version of a Shakespeare play was performed in correct period costume. The first film in English to break this pattern was 1995's ""Richard III"" which updated the setting to the 1930s but changed none of Shakespeare's dialogue."

A shape with the same exterior appearance as the dodecadodecahedron can be constructed by folding up these nets:
"12 pentagrams and 20 rhombic clusters are necessary. However, this construction replaces the crossing pentagonal faces of the dodecadodecahedron with non-crossing sets of rhombi, so it does not produce the same internal structure."
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common), and with the great dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common)."
This polyhedron can be considered a rectified great dodecahedron. It is center of a truncation sequence between a small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron:
"The truncated small stellated dodecahedron looks like a dodecahedron on the surface, but it has 24 faces: 12 pentagons from the truncated vertices and 12 overlapping as (truncated pentagrams). The truncation of the dodecadodecahedron itself is not uniform and attempting to make it uniform results in a degenerate polyhedron (that looks like a small rhombidodecahedron with {10/2} polygons filling up the dodecahedral set of holes), but it has a uniform quasitruncation, the truncated dodecadodecahedron."

In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign. The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC."
"As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis. One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
The company currently employs 100 individuals.
"The company filed for bankruptcy on September 4, 2019 in Delaware (case number 19-11938).

"Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set. In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California. In 2016, uBiome received accreditation from the College of American Pathologists."
", the company first amplifies a portion of the bacterial gene that encodes 16S ribosomal RNA using PCR, then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in order to categorize the bacteria at the genus level. The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons. A 2014 report in ""Xconomy"" said the company outsources the sequencing. The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer."
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.

"Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval. The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues."

They are pillboxes, a type of defensive fortification, built by the 48th Independent Mixed Brigade; 29th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army during 1941-1944, between Japan capturing Guam on December 8, 1941 from the United States and the U.S. recapturing Guam in 1944."
"""As Sombreru Pillbox I"" has also known been known as As Sombreru Point Japanese Fortification. Its precise location is not disclosed by the National Register; it is listed as ""Address Restricted""."
"""As Sombrero Pillbox II"" is a pillbox located in from the high tide line on the south shore of Tumon Beach in Tumon Bay. Its roof slab is about thick."
"""As Sombrero Pillbox III"" is located on Matapang Beach west of Matapang Park, about in from the high tide line. It is a two-room pillbox with a ""complex configuration"" of six walls; its west-facing wall is thick and has a gun port commanding the center of Tumon Bay. Entrance and an air vent come through the east wall. It was built of steel-reinforced concrete including beach rubble, and, as of the NRHP listing date, was in ""excellent"" condition. There are ""impressions of tabi prints and a possible Japanese character"" in the cement roof, which is about thick."
"It is not clear whether any of these pillboxes engaged directly in the 1944 battle for Guam. These pillboxes were clearly designed to repel invaders coming from the sea. The U.S. invasion beginning on July 21, 1944, however, was further to the south and west; the area of these pillboxes was over-run by U.S. forces coming from the south, on about August 2, 1944."

"The Nelson Diversity Surveys (NDS) are a collection of data sets that quantify the representation of women and minorities among professors, by science and engineering discipline, at research universities. They consist of four data sets compiled by Dr. Donna Nelson, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma during fiscal years (FY) 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. These surveys were each complete populations, rather than samples. Consequently, the Surveys quantified characteristics of the faculty which had never been revealed previously, drawing great attention from women and minorities. Furthermore, the Surveys initially came at a time when these underrepresented groups were becoming concerned and vocal about perceived inequities in academia. At the time the Surveys were initiated, (1) the MIT Study of 1999, expressing the concerns of women scientists (including Nancy Hopkins), had just been issued, and (2) underrepresented minority (URM) science faculty noticed URM students increase among PhD recipients without a corresponding increase among recently hired professors. Because the NDS were complete populations, which disaggregated faculty by race, by rank, by gender, and by discipline, URM faculty had the documentation to support their concerns."
"The NDS quantified the degree to which women and minorities are underrepresented on science and engineering faculties at research universities. Because the surveys were complete populations and disaggregated, the degree of underrepresentation was revealed, in ways it had never been revealed previously. For example, the FY 2002 survey showed that there were no Black, Hispanic, or Native American tenured or tenure track women faculty in the top 50 computer science departments. It also revealed that there were no Black or Native American assistant professors in the top 50 chemistry departments. Analogous surveys were carried out for top 100 departments in each of 15 science and engineering disciplines in fiscal years (FY) 2005, 2007 and 2012."
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys made it possible for the first time to know the level and rate of faculty diversification, disaggregated by race, by rank, and by gender. Researchers in the 15 areas of science surveyed were enthusiastic to use these disaggregated faculty data, in order to compare against analogous student data, which had been available from NSF for decades. Many new programs to increase the representation of women and minorities among professors were implemented and PhD and MS research was based on data revealed by the NDS. The NDS were utilized by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, US Congress, Sloan Foundation, the National Organization for Women, universities, and many other organizations interested in diversity in academics. A new area of research was spawned – the Science of Broadening Participation."
The Vicesima hereditatium was a Roman 5% tax on inheritance money.
"No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The ""vicesima hereditatium"" (""twentieth of inheritance"") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign."
= = = Alice Mary Baldwin = = =
"Alice Mary Baldwin (born January 24, 1879, Lewiston, Maine; died 1960) was a historian and educator, noted as the Dean of the Woman's College of Duke University from 1923 until her retirement in 1947."
"Baldwin was born in 1879 in Lewiston, Maine, the eldest of five children of a Congregationist minister. She moved with her family at the age of nine to East Orange, New Jersey, where she was educated in private school before entering Bates College in 1896. After one year, she transferred to Cornell University where she was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1900."
"Baldwin remained at Cornell to receive her master's degree in history in 1902, and then went to Europe on a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and research in Sweden. (The subject of her master's thesis had been ""Gustavus III of Sweden: A Study in Enlightened Despotism."")"
"Returning from Europe in late 1903, Baldwin took a series of teaching positions culminating in a position as Instructor of History, and later head of the Department of History, at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at the Baldwin School, she pursued graduate studies in history at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as studies in education at the Teachers College of Columbia University."
"In 1921, Baldwin left the Baldwin School to attend the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate degree."
"In 1923, Baldwin took the job as Acting Dean of Women at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (later to become part of Duke University). Seeing little opportunity for a woman in the 1920s to become a full professor at the University of Chicago, Baldwin remained at Trinity to become Dean of Women and Assistant Professor of History. While at Trinity, Baldwin completed her doctoral thesis (on the topic of New England clergy and the American Revolution) in time to receive her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1926."
"Baldwin's responsibilities as dean and as an active teacher (which she believed necessary to remain effective as an administrator) left her no time for research, and she produced no further scholarly historical material after this time. She did, however, maintain active memberships in various women's educational organizations and North Carolina historical organizations. She also encouraged student participation state and national women's organizations as well as the formation of a number of student-led organizations on campus; under her guidance and example, students launched organizations such as a Forum Committee to invite speakers to East Campus, DISTAFF, a monthly magazine edited entirely by women, the Nereidians, a synchronized swimming club, and numerous honorary and leadership societies such as Ivy, Sandals, and the White Duchy, a counterpart to the Order of The Red Friars."
Baldwin retired from Duke University in 1947.
"As an historian, Baldwin is best remembered for her doctoral dissertation ""The New England Clergy and the American Revolution"". Her other writings include:"
"Baldwin has been held up as an example of the key issues in the intellectual life of women in the early twentieth century. Upon her retirement, she ordered that her papers and notes be sealed for twenty years. Upon their unveiling, it was revealed that Baldwin had struggled bitterly with her role as a female educator and on the education of women in general. She had found little documentation of interest in her research in the lives of women in colonial times, and left unfinished many papers and treatises in which she expressed the disdain she uncovered for the education of women in America."
"Baldwin remains a much-beloved figure at Duke University and is credited with advancing the prestige of the Woman's College at Duke and the education of young women. One of the most prominent buildings on Duke's East Campus, the auditorium anchoring the campus, is named in her honor in recognition of her dedication to the institution."
"Recognizing Baldwin's contributions to the University, Duke has created the Alice Mary Baldwin Collection within their library, wherein all of Baldwin's papers are available for review and research."

"LSI conducts Quick Counts during General Elections and District Head Elections (Pilkada.) The vast and geographical nature of Indonesia tend to cause delayed announcements of election results—typically, those results can only be known around 2 weeks or even 1 month after the election. Once, people required a significant amount of time in order to finding out the victors of such elections, and this can cause a less than conducive atmosphere on the political situation on areas where those elections are held. Participants of the elections may take numerous visits to the office The General Election Commission (KPU) demanding the results—visits that are often accompanied with violence and demonstration, which in turn will cause a domino effect on the stability of the region (either economically or socially.) These undesirable possibilities of outcomes can be mitigated by using Quick Count: a rapid counting method using scientifically collected results from voting locations (TPS) during elections Done correctly, Quick Count can achieve a result with less than 1% margin of error compared to the official results announced by the General Election Commission (KPU). Through Quick Count, result calculation can be finished very rapidly—at the very least, only 4 hours after the votes are officially collected and counted the results can already be summarized and concluded."
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted hundreds of Quick Counts and made the results available via press conferences and national television channels TV One and Metro TV. The Indonesia Museum of Record (MURI) gifted LSI with various awards such as (1) The Quick Count Accuracy for Sumbawa Election on November 2010 with 0% margin of error when compared to official results. .

In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents’ characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible—from job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes not only the selected respondent but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the selected respondent a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset—all answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it."

"Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990) was an American civil rights lawyer.

He contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union's efforts to fight the internment, and after World War II resigned from the Department of Justice to join the ACLU, where he rose up through the organization and eventually served as its president from 1969 to 1976."
"Ennis graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1932, and went on to work for the Department of Justice for fourteen years. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild in the 1930s, but withdrew from the organization, believing it to be under the influence of Communists. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign travel control. His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States."
"In 1946, Ennis did resign from the Department of Justice, and joined the board of the ACLU himself. He became the ACLU's general counsel in 1955, and was elected chairman of the ACLU in 1969, succeeding Ernest Angell who was retiring after 19 years with the organization. He served as ACLU president until 1976, during which time he called for the resignation of President Richard Nixon and an end to the property tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. Notwithstanding the former, he was critical of the zealousness of opposition to Nixon shown by Charles Morgan, Jr. of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office. He was succeeded as ACLU president by Norman Dorsen. He remained a member of the ACLU executive committee until 1985."

"BroadR-Reach technology is an Ethernet physical layer standard designed for use in automotive connectivity applications. BroadR-Reach technology allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cable. Benefits for automotive manufacturers integrating the BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard include reduced connectivity costs and cabling weight, according to Broadcom Corporation, now Broadcom Limited, inventor of the BroadR-Reach standard."
"Using BroadR-Reach technology in automotive enables the migration from multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view parking assistance, rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive-qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective."
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit and receive (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements."
"The OPEN Alliance SIG is a special interest group formed by BMW, Broadcom, Freescale, Harman, Hyundai, NXP and STMicroelectronics to establish BroadR-Reach as an open standard and to encourage wide scale adoption of automotive Ethernet as the connectivity standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception in late 2011, membership has reached more than 140 members as of May 31, 2013."
IEEE 802.3 has standardized 100BASE-T1 in IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96.

Motorcyclists may use specialized hand signals to both greet and warn oncoming riders:
"The use of specific gestures may be culturally or regionally dependent. Some observers have commented that waving is common amongst riders in North America but uncommon in some European countries, like Germany."
"French riders will stick their foot out when overtaking another motorcycle, and while lane splitting when a car facilitates it..

"Country Place is a residential neighbourhood near the geographical centre of Ottawa, Canada and part of the former city of Nepean. It is a mature residential subdivision with about 400 houses located just inside the Ottawa greenbelt near the Rideau River, and about 11 km from downtown Ottawa. It is bordered by the Black Rapids Creek and the greenbelt to the south, Prince of Wales Drive to the east, Merivale Road to the west, and the Pineglen community to the north. Amberwood Crescent meanders through the community, exiting onto Prince of Wales and Merivale. Tennyson Drive links Country Place to Pineglen."
Houses in Country Place were built mostly in the early 1970s and are similar in size and design. The only exceptions are houses on Campfield Ct. which was built in the 1980s on land that had originally been set aside for a possible school.
"The community has an active community association that runs events several times a year, maintains an outdoor rink in the winter, and helps promote the interests of the residents. Country Place is within the Knoxdale-Merivale Ward of the City of Ottawa."
"Genetic data indicate the ""molestus"" form in the London Underground appear to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest above-ground population. Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London once only – many hurdles must be overcome to become adapted to the subterranean environment, and understandably it would occur rarely. This hypothesis implies that local adaptation would be expected in different locations around Europe and beyond, as each local population evolved an offshoot that overcame the problems of living underground."
"However, more recently collected genetic evidence reported by Fonseca and others suggests a single ""C. molestus"" form has spread throughout Europe and beyond, since populations over a large area share a common genetic heritage. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest the underground form developed recently; a single mtDNA difference is shared among the underground populations of 10 Russian cities, and a single fixed microsatellite difference occurs in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, and the Atlantic islands. This worldwide spread might have occurred after the last glaciations or may be even more recent, due to the insects hitchhiking on world trade routes; one possibility is the international secondhand tire trade. The tires retain water in which the larvae can survive, and completely removing water from an old tire can be difficult."
"Now, the persistence of hybrids in northern climates apparently may be another evolutionary problem that can be solved, but only rarely: the Fonseca paper obtained genetic evidence that the recent colonization of America by ""Culex"" mosquitoes actually involves a strain derived from a rare successful hybridization between ""C. pipiens"" and ""C. molestus"". They suggest hybridization may explain why the American form bites both birds and humans (this interpretation is controversial, see letter from Spielman ""et al."" and the response that follows it in ""Science""). The consequences of this more indiscriminate feeding hit the news in 1999 with the outbreak of human encephalitis in New York, caused by West Nile virus. It was the first documented introduction of this virus into the Western Hemisphere; perhaps because in the longer established populations, the Old World northern above-ground ""C. pipiens"" almost exclusively bites birds, with the human-biting ones being incarcerated below ground."
"""Culex molestus"" has been observed in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Its country of origin is thought to be Egypt, although it has likely spread via trade and colonial passages over the past centuries."
"In the summer of 2011, an invasion of ""Culex molestus"" appeared on the Upper West Side in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The mosquito is well known for being commonly found in sewers of New York and thriving throughout the year feeding on humans. Residents of older brownstones found the mosquitoes coming from the underground into basements and then through air vents and other openings into their homes. The city government did not make this infestation of the pest a top priority because they tested negative for West Nile virus and because of the high cost of mosquito control."
"In Australia, ""Culex molestus"" was first recorded in the 1940s, and has since spread across all southern states, causing a significant biting nuisance in urban areas. Unlike most Australian urban mosquitos, ""molestus"" is active through all 12 months of the year. Its introduction was likely through military movements into Melbourne during World War II, and genetic studies have indicated its most likely passage was from eastern Asia and Japan. It has also been identified as a potential vector for several Australian blood-borne diseases, such as Ross River virus."

= = = State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 = = =
"State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 (), officially named Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas (), is an order from the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the People's Republic of China's agency charged with keeping religion under state control. Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as tulkus (reincarnated teachers)."
"Tibetan Buddhists believe lamas and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These tulkus are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as ""living Buddhas"". In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, based on the prior Religion Work for Some Questions《中共中央、国务院关于进一步做好宗教工作若干问题的通知》published in 1991, that reincarnated lamas must be approved by the Central Government."
"On August 3, 2007, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are ""illegal or invalid"". The decree states, ""It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country."" It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be ""legally-registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha."""
"Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council."
"The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law."
"The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, ""The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs""."
"The official Xinhua News Agency said the new rules are ""an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas"". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power."
"The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas ""against religious ritual and historical convention"", according to the Chinese government. The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 Panchen Lama, whose influence in Tibetan Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama. Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991."
"The Golden Urn was established by the Qing Qianlong Emperor to allow the Qing dynasty Emperor of China to determine the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in Yonghe Temple in Beijing for choosing Mongolian Jebtsundamba Khutughtu reincarnations. The 7th Panchen Lama, Palden Tenpai Nyima, used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso."
"In 1936, Golden Urn was also institutionalized in the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas《喇嘛轉世辦法》 by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government."
"Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name Qoigyijabu (Gyancain Norbu) as the 11th Panchen Lama. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the Government of Tibet in Exile. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso had named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama."
"The Khalkha Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols."
"The 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai, to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in Lhasa (who had selected a boy from Xikang) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. Guan Jiyu, the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, joined Kuomintang Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at Kumbum Monastery. The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen."
"The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be ""liberated"" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic. In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the 17-Point Agreement and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement. He was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama when they met in 1952."
"The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as ""the real 6th Dalai Lama"" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama. He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12."

Many of today's English-language translations of Breslover works were only made possible because of the Tcheriner Rav's meticulous research and elucidation."
"He collected and published Noson's eight-volume magnum opus, ""Likutey Halachot"", as well as an expanded version of Noson's ""Likutey Etzot"" (Advice) with additional material from Rebbe Nachman's teachings, under the title, ""Likutey Etzot HaMeshulash"".

= = = Alameda Terminal = = =
"Alameda Terminal (a.k.a. Alameda Wharf) was a railroad station and ferry wharf at the foot and west of present-day Pacific Avenue and Main Street in Alameda, California, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay with ferry service to San Francisco. It was built in 1864 and operated by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. In 1869, it served as the original west coast terminus of the U.S. First Transcontinental Railroad, until the opening of Oakland Pier two months later. The western terminus was inaugurated September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus completing the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast."
"The Pacific Railroad Act passed by the United States Congress in 1862 authorized construction of the First transcontinental railroad and telegraph line, which included connecting the Central Pacific Railroad in the west with the Union Pacific Railroad in the east. In 1863, the first construction activity took the Central Pacific line eastward from Sacramento. In October 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad assigned all the rights of the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 to the Western Pacific Railroad for the route between Sacramento and San Jose, including land grants. The plan was that the transcontinental railroad would follow the Western Pacific to San Jose and then connect with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ), completed in 1864, to San Francisco."
"By 1866, the Western Pacific had built of track north and east from San Jose, reaching halfway into Niles Canyon, to about Farwell near MilePost33. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Construction was then halted because of disagreements between the railroad’s contractors and its financiers."
"In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point in 1868, restarted work on the railroad line through Niles Canyon, also using Chinese laborers, and added a new line from the mouth of the canyon northwest towards the city of Oakland and Oakland Point. The new plan was to connect with Oakland with its ferry service to San Francisco. In June 1869, J. H. Strobridge came to Niles (then Vallejo Mills and now part of Fremont) to oversee the construction of the new line heading towards Oakland. In September 1869, a temporary connection was made at the bay side of San Leandro with the old tracks of San Francisco and Alameda Railroad, which led to the SF&A Alameda Wharf with ferry service to San Francisco."
"On September 6, 1869, the first Western Pacific train reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus achieving the transcontinental ""Pacific Railroad"" envisioned in the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act. According to the ""Daily Alta California"", this first through train left Sacramento at 10 am, got delayed by some construction trains, exited Niles Canyon late at 9:30 pm, and an hour later arrived at Alameda Terminal to a cheering crowd. Two months later, Central Pacific Railroad switched the western transcontinental terminus to its expanded Oakland Pier, which was inaugurated on November 8, 1869, in another round of celebration."
Alameda then went back to local train service only. In 1870 the SF&A was absorbed into Central Pacific and in 1873 the original SF&A pier was abandoned.
The railroads and their wharfs are gone from Alameda. The last rails were removed in 1960 from Lincoln Ave (formerly Railroad Ave and along which the SF&A rails ran).
"The achievement of the first transcontinental railroad reaching Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869 is marked by a plaque in the Naval Air Station Alameda and a California Historical Landmark (CHL #440) nearby. The GPS coordinates of the two markers are given respectively by ""37.786779,-122.30292"" (plaque); and ""37.77535,-122.276891"" (CHL #440)."
"On 6 September 2019, a ""golden spike"" ceremony was held in Niles Canyon, where the Western Pacific tracks laid in 1866 met the Central Pacific tracks laid in 1869, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 6 September 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad to the original Pacific coast terminus at Alameda Terminal. Also, the mayor of the City of Alameda issued a proclamation recognizing ""the outstanding contributions of the many Chinese immigrants who helped make the Transcontinental Railroad a reality""."

= = = Route poisoning = = =
"Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within computer networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. Unlike the ""split horizon with poison reverse"", route poisoning provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network."
"When the protocol detects an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are informed that the bad route has an infinite (∞) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, preventing any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid route."
"Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use a maximum hop count to determine how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. Route poisoning is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform route poisoning on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent."
"If these updates are lost, some nodes in the network would not be informed that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is used in conjunction with holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network."

"John Baker White (August 4, 1794 – October 9, 1862) was a 19th-century American military officer, lawyer, court clerk, and civil servant in the U.S. state of Virginia."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark."
"During the American Civil War, White was concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury."
White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759–1831) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833–1915) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839–1917).
"John Baker White was born on August 4, 1794, near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White (1759–1831) and his wife Arabella Baker. Among his other relations, White was a great-great-nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738–1804) and a great-nephew of another United States House Representative, Francis White (1761–1826)."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign."
"Following his service in the War of 1812, White settled in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814. On March 20, 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County, and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757."
"As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White conducted the teaching of jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P. White, and Philip B. Streit."
"In addition to his law instruction, White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society. When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1839, White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board ""occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability"", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats."
"By 1839, White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney. During the absence of the board's president, David Gibson, White served as president ""pro tempore"" from November 29 until December 13, 1839. The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White's tenure on its board of directors."
"Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E. M. Armstrong."
"White's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America, after which White supported the defense of Virginia's states' rights and of the United States Constitution. White's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army, and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause. Because of his Confederate sympathies, White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest."
"No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864, and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war. In 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White ""kept close watch over"" the county's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces. Later in the fall of 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney."
"Upon learning of this, White was again concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping. White selected for transport only the bound volumes of records which included ""deed books, wills, and settlements of estates"" and kept the unbound paper records in the courthouse, thus separating them so that the entirety of the county's records could not be destroyed by Union forces. White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records, as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together."
"In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed."

= = = Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources = = =
Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources is a 1983 biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by Martin Lings.
"The book provides a new account of the sira or the life of Muhammad, with details that had not been elaborated in other accounts. It is based primarily on old Arab sources that go back to the 9th century, of which some passages are translated for the first time. It is not contradictory to other accounts but rather offers new insights and new details. The book also includes excerpts from original English translations of speeches by men and women who lived close to Muhammad, heard him speak, witnessed his actions, witnessed the way he interacted with situations and witnessed events he encountered throughout various stages of his life."
"References used are Ibn Ishaq (references here are to Ferdinand Wüstenfeld's edition of Sirat Rasul Allah, a life of the Prophet by Muhammad ibn Ishaq in the annotated recension of Ibn Hisham). Also Ibn Sa’ad (the references are to John Leyden's edition of Kitab al-Tabaqat al Kabir by Muhammad ibn Sa’d). Also there is Al-Waqidi (and the references are to Marsden Jones' edition of Kitab al Maghazi, A Chronicle of the Prophet's Campaigns, by Muhammad ibn Umar al- Waqidi)."
"It is a narrative of the history of Arabia and the birth and the life of Muhammad. The biography consists of 85 short chapters, some as short as just two pages in length. Each chapter deals with an important event in the history of Islam and provides chronological context for the advent of the religion, as well as detailed information about Muhammad."
"The biography has gone through many reprints in English and it has been translated and published into many languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Malay and Tamil."
"A distinctive element of the biography is the vivid, approachable narrative style, which is fast moving and flows fluently. The book reads more like a novel and was written in a style, which is easily readable, comprehensible and it uses language, which reflects both simplicity and grandeur."
"Lings uses a more archaic style of English to depict conversations and translations of the Qur'an, which helps slows down the rapid flow of the narration. The focus in the book is less about the teachings of Islam and more about Muhammad."
"In 1991, a second revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, containing additional details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavours as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighbouring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Before Lings died in 2005, a newly revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, which included final updates made on the text and incorporated into its contents, containing extra details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavors as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighboring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."

The party's provincial governments faced attacks from leftists and Maoists who advocated armed conflict to take land from landlords and feudals. These attacks were allegedly on the behest of leftists within the Pakistan People's Party.
"On March 23, 1973, the Federal Security Force, a paramilitary force under the alleged orders of Bhutto, attacked a public opposition rally at the Liaquat Bagh in the town of Rawalpindi and killed a dozen people; many more were wounded by their automatic gunfire. Wali Khan narrowly escaped a bullet during the attack. Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies on the streets in Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly with their bereaved families."
Following the massacre the Federal Security Force launched a crackdown against the party that led to many senior leaders including Ajmal Khattak to flee into exile to Kabul.
"The Balochistan government immediately faced multiple crise,s the first of which was when the Balochistan police department, mostly officered by people from Punjab or Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving. Despite this fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister, moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile as a qualification and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar."
Unable to exercise any effective authority Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organization to assist in security.
The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra-tribal conflict. The Baloch nationalists declared that it was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan but without evidence to prove the statements issued.
"However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government, fresh from the humiliation of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to dismember Pakistan and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973, in protest against the decision the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government resigned in protest. Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders."
"In the face of an increasingly strong national campaign led by the NAP against the government, Bhutto banned NAP on February 8, 1975 after the murder of his close colleague Hayat Khan Sherpao, throwing thousands of its workers and much of its leadership, including party President Khan Abdul Wali Khan, in jail for alleged anti-state activities."
"Invoking the 1st amendment of the 1973 constitution the government charged Wali Khan and his colleagues under the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case in 1976, although they were acquitted of the charge of the murder of PPP stalwart Hayat Khan Sherpao, the decision to ban the NAP was upheld by the courts. In addition to Khan Abdul Wali Khan, the case also implicated two governors, two chief ministers, scores of national and provincial parliamentarians, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Kaswar Gardezi, Habib Jalib (Urdu revolutionary poet) and Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Balochi Revolutionary Poet/Leader) and even some of Bhutto’s former colleagues, many of whom were later re-elected and became federal or provincial ministers."
"With the NAP leadership largely imprisoned, a new political party was formed on the wreckage of the NAP in 1976 by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. Named National Democratic Party (NDP), it was headed by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Hyderabad case was withdrawn after General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law in July 1977. Wali Khan left party affairs to Sher Baz Mazari after his release from jail in 1979. The party faced a split at that time between far left elements led by Khair Bakhsh Marri advocating outright separation and armed struggle and those advocating political struggle led by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The split ended the alliance between Pashtun Nationalists and Baloch Nationalists that Wali Khan had formed in 1969 and led to the formation of the Pakistan National Party."
Sherbaz Khan Mazari led the NDP into joining the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. The alliance with former rivals the PPP did not go down well with Ghaffar Khan who encouraged by Governor Fazle Haq warned Ghaffar Khan of what would happen if the PPP returned to power.
This move led to a split between Mazari and Wali Khan which were aggravated after Wali Khan in a statement rejected the 1973 constitution and Wali Khan's election as NDP President.
The NDP was merged with other nationalist parties from Balochistan and Sindh in 1986 in Karachi to launch a new political party named Awami National Party with Wali Khan as its president and Rasul Bux Palejo as its general-secretary.

"Mihailo Marković, PhD (; 24 February 1923 – 7 February 2010) was a Serbian philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the Praxis School, a Marxist humanist movement that originated in Yugoslavia."
"A co-author of the SANU Memorandum, Marković was a prominent supporter of Slobodan Milošević in the late 1980s and 1990s."
"Marković was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He became a member of the youth organization of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a partisan he actively participated in the struggle for liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II."
"Marković took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on ""The Concept of Logic"". In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966–1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Marković was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975–1985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983."
"In his honour, a collection of articles entitled ""Philosophy and Society"" was published in Belgrade in 1987."
"After the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Marković took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ""Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR"", published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia."
"In the 1960s Marković became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal ""Praxis"". Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Marković was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Marković worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986."
"As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Marković, together with Vasilije Krestić and others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation."
"Marković was vice-president of the Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party."
= = = Small rhombihexahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small rhombihexahedron (or small rhombicube) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 18 faces (12 squares and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is an antiparallelogram."
This polyhedron shares the vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the convex rhombicuboctahedron (having 12 square faces in common) and with the small cubicuboctahedron (having the octagonal faces in common).
It may be constructed as the exclusive or (blend) of three octagonal prisms.
= = = Small cubicuboctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 20 faces (8 triangles, 6 squares, and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"The cubicuboctahedron is a faceting of the rhombicuboctahedron. Its name comes from that the square faces lying on the planes corresponding to the rhombic dodecahedron, has been replaced by six octagonal faces parallel to the square faces of the cube."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the small rhombihexahedron (having the octagonal faces in common)."
"As the Euler characteristic suggests, the small cubicuboctahedron is a toroidal polyhedron of genus 3 (topologically it is a surface of genus 3), and thus can be interpreted as a (polyhedral) immersion of a genus 3 polyhedral surface, in the complement of its 24 vertices, into 3-space. (A neighborhood of any vertex is topologically a cone on a figure-8, which cannot occur in an immersion. Note that the Richter reference overlooks this fact.) The underlying polyhedron (ignoring self-intersections) defines a uniform tiling of this surface, and so the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform polyhedron. In the language of abstract polytopes, the small cubicuboctahedron is a ""faithful realization"" of this abstract toroidal polyhedron, meaning that it is a nondegenerate polyhedron and that they have the same symmetry group. In fact, every automorphism of the abstract genus 3 surface with this tiling is realized by an isometry of Euclidean space."
"Higher genus surfaces (genus 2 or greater) admit a metric of negative constant curvature (by the uniformization theorem), and the universal cover of the resulting Riemann surface is the hyperbolic plane. The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane has vertex figure 3.8.4.8 (triangle, octagon, square, octagon). If the surface is given the appropriate metric of curvature = −1, the covering map is a local isometry and thus the ""abstract"" vertex figure is the same. This tiling may be denoted by the Wythoff symbol 3 4 | 4, and is depicted on the right."
"Alternatively and more subtly, by chopping up each square face into 2 triangles and each octagonal face into 6 triangles, the small cubicuboctahedron can be interpreted as a non-regular ""coloring"" of the combinatorially ""regular"" (not just ""uniform"") tiling of the genus 3 surface by 56 equilateral triangles, meeting at 24 vertices, each with degree 7. This regular tiling is significant as it is a tiling of the Klein quartic, the genus 3 surface with the most symmetric metric (automorphisms of this tiling equal isometries of the surface), and the orientation-preseserving automorphism group of this surface is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), equivalently GL(3,2) (the order 168 group of all orientation-preserving isometries). Note that the small cubicuboctahedron is ""not"" a realization of this abstract polyhedron, as it only has 24 orientation-preserving symmetries (not every abstract automorphism is realized by a Euclidean isometry) – the isometries of the small cubicuboctahedron preserve not only the triangular tiling, but also the coloring, and hence are a proper subgroup of the full isometry group."
"The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane (the universal covering) is the order-7 triangular tiling. The automorphism group of the Klein quartic can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the polyhedron, namely ""exchanging the two endpoints of the edges that bisect the squares and octahedra) to yield the Mathieu group M."

= = = Manchester Square = = =
"Manchester Square is an 18th-century garden square in Marylebone, London. Centred north of Oxford Street it measures internally north-to-south, and across. It is a small Georgian predominantly 1770s-designed instance in central London; construction began around 1776. The north side has a central mansion, Hertford House, flanked by approach ways; its first name was Manchester House — its use is since 1897 as the Wallace Collection (gallery/museum) of fine and decorative arts sits alongside the Madame Tussauds museum and Wigmore Hall concert rooms as single-greatest tourist attractions of Marylebone. The square forms part of west Marylebone, most of which sees minor but overarching property interests held by one owner (through lease reversions managed as the Portman Estate) among which many buildings have been recognised by statutory protection (as listed buildings)."
Among residents figured:
"This six-house long approach fronts the east side of Hertford House (or its small public front lawn with steps, benches and paths). The first five buildings of Spanish Place are those listed, in the mainstream, initial category of Grade II. They were built c.1780-90, associated with the Duke of Manchester's development of the square, on Portman land. Their materials are brown brick, recessed slate roofs above five varying-prominence storeys with 3-window wide fronts. They have semicircular arched doorways to right; panelled doors with sidelights and fanlights; one a stuccoed Doric porch. Their windows are recessed sashes, in stuccoed reveals, under flat gauged arches. Reaching out below the first floor is a stucco plat band, painted stone or stucco cornice over the next, then a stucco cornice and blocking course marking the attic storey. Original, cast iron, geometric patterned balconies adorn the first floor. Cast iron area railings with urn finials enclose the front. №3 has a blue plaque as the home of Captain Marryat and George Grossmith."
"In 1814 and 1815 the square was the chosen setting for cheaper newspapers and, above all, their inner page articles to perpetuate a fresh round of the urban myth of a pig-faced woman."
"The cover photograph for ""Please Please Me"", the first LP by The Beatles, was taken by Angus McBean in 1963. It showed the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House here, EMI's London headquarters (now demolished). A repeat photo was taken in 1969 for the cover of their then-intended ""Get Back"" album; it was not used when the project saw release as ""Let It Be"", but was eventually used on the retrospective albums ""1962–1966"" and ""1967–1970""."

= = = BBC National Programme = = =
"The BBC National Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced the earlier BBC radio station 5XX – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company (later to be nationalized as the British Broadcasting Corporation) began transmissions on 14 November 1922, the technology for both national coverage and joint programming between transmitters did not exist – transmitter powers were generally in the region of 1 kilowatt (kW)."
"From 9 July 1924, however, the company began experimenting with higher power longwave transmissions from the Marconi company's site near Chelmsford in Essex, using the call sign 5XX. The experiments proved successful and on 27 July 1925 the Chelmsford longwave transmitter was relocated to a more central site at Borough Hill near Daventry in Northamptonshire. This provided a ""national service"" of programmes originating in London, although it remained somewhat experimental and was supplementary to the BBC's locally based services, including its main London station, 2LO."
"Initially the national programme was transmitted on 187.5 kHz longwave but this was later changed, with the opening in 1934 of a new high-power longwave transmitter site at Droitwich, to 200 kHz, which was to remain the BBC's longwave frequency until 1978, when it was moved slightly to 198 kHz. Mediumwave transmitters were used to augment coverage."
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high power mediumwave transmitter at the Daventry 5GB site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service programmed from London for the majority of the population. This came to be called the BBC National Programme."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme"", and eventually resulted in the gradual extension throughout the 1930s of a separate BBC Regional Programme."
"The local stations were gradually either converted to regional relays or closed entirely and replaced by high-power Regional Programme transmitters. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX, initially these were on three separate frequencies in order to minimise interference, but by 1939, as the Regional Programme network expanded, the National Programme's three remaining mediumwave transmitters – at Brookmans Park (for London and the South East), Moorside Edge (for The North), and Westerglen (for Central Scotland) – were all using 1149 kHz."
"The National Programme's broadcasting hours were from 10.15am until Midnight Mondays to Saturdays, with Sundays commencing broadcasting at 3.00pm, however by the mid 1930s broadcasting on a Sunday was extended to commence at around 10.30am."
"BBC News on the National Programme would not air until at least 6.00pm each day. This was in agreement with the newspapers, so to ensure people would buy a morning newspaper. The national programme did not have a dedicated news department until 1934, and only then was it used to edit and broadcast news material from other wire agencies in the country and around the world. The start of the second world war in September 1939 would see the start of a proper news service on the new BBC Home Service with morning news bulletins commencing at 7.00am each day."
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The main transmitter network was synchronized between just two groups, using 668 and 767 kHz, each of which could be turned off during air raids to prevent its signals being used as navigational beacons (with listeners required to retune in such an event to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz)."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but retained the name ""BBC Home Service"". On the same date, the BBC Light Programme was launched, taking over the style and much of the function, as an entertainment channel, of the BBC Forces Programme (which had begun broadcasting in 1940), as well as the Droitwich 200 kHz longwave frequency which had been used by the pre-war National Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light music than its successor, the Home Service."
= = = H. B. Halicki = = =
"Henry Blight Halicki (October 18, 1940 – August 20, 1989), most commonly known as H. B. ""Toby"" Halicki, was an American director, writer, stunt driver, actor, and filmmaker. Halicki directed the 1974 film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" as well as producing and starring in several other action films. He was killed in an accident while filming ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" in 1989. Wishing to preserve his legacy, his widow, Denice Shakarian Halicki, produced a remake in 2000 along with Jerry Bruckheimer."
"Halicki was born in a Polish-American family in Dunkirk, New York in 1940 and was one of thirteen children. All thirteen children were given nicknames; his was ""Toby"". Toby started to develop his fascination with cars while working in the family towing business, which was established back in 1919. His father was also a second-hand car dealer. Halicki started driving at a young age and developed a wide knowledge of automobiles by the age of ten. When he was a teenager, after the loss of two of his brothers, Halicki decided to move to California and live with one of his uncles."
"Halicki moved from New York to California and worked on vehicles, eventually owning his own impound and towing business. H.B. Halicki Mercantile Co. & Junk Yard was known for its extensive antique automobile and toy collections."
"Halicki wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in 1974."
"There was no official script for the movie, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Halicki supplied most of the cars and used repeated footage of the same vehicles and shots of public incidents to increase the footage. The scene in which a train derailment is observed was not part of the original shooting script; it is in fact a real train that derailed. When the director heard about the wreck, he wanted to incorporate it into the film."
Halicki compacted 10 vertebrae performing the film's jump finale and walked with a limp afterwards.
"Halicki married Denice Shakarian in 1989, shortly before he began filming his 1989 sequel, ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"", in which both of them would star. Halicki bought over 400 automobiles to destroy in the film, which was to feature improved car chases and storyline."
"On August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Toby was preparing for the most dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly. The accident occurred in an area behind the former J.H. Williams Tool factory at 400 Vulcan Street in Buffalo."
"In 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki began work with Jerry Bruckheimer and Touchstone Pictures to produce a 2000 remake of the original 1974 film. The remake included the Fastback Mustang ""Eleanor""."
"In its opening weekend, the remake grossed $25,336,048 from 3,006 US theaters, leading all films that weekend. By the end of the film's theatrical run, it had grossed $101,648,571 domestically and $135,553,728 internationally, comprising a total gross revenue for the film of $237,202,299 worldwide. The popularity of the 2000 remake resulted in illegal copies of the custom ""Eleanor"" car being produced. Denice Halicki successfully sued to stop trademark and copyright infringement."

"Nico Stehr (born 19 March 1942) was ""Karl Mannheim Professor for Cultural Studies"" at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen / Germany and Founding Director of the European Center for Sustainability Research."
"Stehr received a PhD in sociology from the University of Oregon in 1970. Between 1967 and 2000, he taught at American and Canadian universities. His last appointment in Canada was that of fellow in Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Study der University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. During the academic year 2002-2003 he was Paul-Lazarsfeld-Professor (a visiting appointment) at the University of Vienna. He is Senior Research Fellow of the Sustainable Development Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, a fellow of the Fellow the Center for Advanved Study of the Humanities, Essen, Germany, editor of the Canadian Journal of Sociology (until 2006), a Fellow of the Royal Society (Canada) and the European Academy of the Sciences and the Arts."
"In 2011, Stehr created the European Center for Sustainability Research (ECS) at Zeppelin University."
"His research interests center on the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies and associated developments in different social institutions of modern society (e.g. science, politics, and the economy) and is focused on these field of attention:"
Knowledge: Knowledge is not merely a model of reality but a model for reality. Knowledge represents a capacity to act.
Knowledge and information: The substance of information primarily concerns the properties of products or outcomes while the stuff of knowledge refers to the qualities of process or inputs.
"Post-industrial society: Innovation are increasingly derivative from research and development; there is a new relation between science and technology because of the centrality of theoretical knowledge, and the weight of the society—measured by a larger proportion of Gross National Product and a larger share of employment—is increasingly shifting toward the knowledge field."
Knowledge society: The foundation for the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies is based on changes in the structure of the economies of advanced societies. The source of economic growth and value-adding activities—increasingly relies on knowledge. The significance of knowledge grows in all spheres of life and in all social institutions of modern society.
"Common sense and scientific knowledge: The growing significance of science and its manifold social utility has led to its having a virtual monopoly on the production of new socially, economically and politically relevant knowledge in modern societies; knowledge that rarely can be contested by religion, nor by politics, and in particular not by daily experience. But this does not mean that ordinary citizens are now the slaves of scientific experts."
Stehr is one of the authors of the Hartwell Paper: A new direction for climate policy after the crash of 2009. The Hartwell Paper arises from a meeting convened by Professor Gwyn Prins of the LSE in February 2010 to consider the implications of developments in climate policy in late 2009.
"Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years. The underlying reason for this is that the UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009. However, the currently dominant approach has acquired"
immense political momentum because of the quantities of political capital sunk into it. But in any case the UNFCCC/Kyoto model of climate policy cannot continue because it crashed in late 2009. The Hartwell Paper sets and reviews this context; but doing so is
not its sole or primary purpose.
The Paper proposes that the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential
"functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be. It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy. It explains the political prerequisite of energy efficiency strategies as a first step and documents how this can achieve real emissions reductions. But, above all, it emphasises the primacy of accelerating decarbonisation of energysupply. This calls for very substantially increased investment in innovation in noncarbon energy sources in order to diversify energy supply technologies. The ultimate goal of doing this is to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less"
than those using fossil fuels. The Hartwell Paper advocates funding this work by low hypothecated (dedicated) carbon taxes. It opens discussion on how to channel such money productively.
"Counter-terrorism in Singapore is a series of detection and prevention measures to minimize the damage caused by terrorism. These measures involve the participation of all levels of society, including defence, internal security, border and infrastructure security, civil defense, and gives special focus on areas such as medical readiness and psychological preparedness."
Singapore's main counter-terrorism strategy includes cooperation with regional and international partners to achieve a transnational landscape of security. Singapore is instrumental in the passage of international initiatives such as the landmark United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 which established the legal basis for international action against terrorism. It is also at the forefront of the Southeast Asian counter-terrorism efforts and a United States partner in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) that aims to combat the illicit trade and spread of weapons of mass destruction.
"In recent years, Singapore's counter-terrorism initiatives have created political criticism from the country's Muslim population. This was particularly pronounced when Singapore joined the international community's call for Iraq's disarmament, which eventually led to the American invasion of the country."
These are the events related to terrorism and counter-terrorism in Singapore. Also listed are major terrorist incidents in the world and in Southeast Asia that have influenced counter-terrorism policies in Singapore.
"The main terrorist threat to Singapore is from Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which has links to al-Qaeda and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah is known to have carried out the Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, as well as the Jakarta bombing in 2004 outside the Australian embassy, killing 11 people."
"After the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, an informant revealed information to the Singapore Internal Security Department regarding Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent, who was a member of a group partnered with Al-Qaeda. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan was placed under surveillance by Singapore Internal Security Department, after which he left for Pakistan on 4 October. This man was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. His interrogation led investigators to more Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore."
"On 9 December 2001, 13 suspects were arrested. Soon after that, a video found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan showed a narrator in Singapore describing how to attack Americans using explosives. Investigators found similar tapes at the residences of the arrested men. In all, 33 men were arrested in relation to this plot."
"In August 2002, another 21 members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, demolishing JI's Singaporean cell. Arrests were also made in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. As of 11 November 2005, 36 alleged members of JI or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were being detained under the Internal Security Act."
"However, Singapore believes that Jemaah Islamiyah remains active in Southeast Asia and is recruiting new members."
"On 25 August 2005, French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière singled out Singapore along with Tokyo and Sydney as potential terrorism targets of the Al-Qaeda. The Ministry of Home Affairs later responded that it had not received any specific information on imminent terrorist threat against Singapore, but added that security measures have been taken to strengthen security at borders, key infrastructure and iconic buildings."
The Singapore Police Force has in recent years enhanced security at various locations in the country.
"On 15 August 2005, the newly established Public Transport Security Command began operational patrols on the Mass Rapid Transit network to protect the public transportation system. Personnel from the Special Operations Command (SOC) and the Gurkha Contingent (GC) have also been deployed to complement other police officers on patrol. In addition, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) stepped up its effort to inspect ferries and other vessels in Singapore territorial waters."
"On 26 October 2005, Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence S Jayakumar announced that Singapore was developing an early warning system, called the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning, to identify and assess new emerging threats to national security. The system, developed by the National Security Coordination Secretariat, will be put in place by mid-2007."
"At the forefront in the fight against terrorism are specialised military, law enforcement, and civil defence units, namely:"
"In May 2007, the parliament passed an amendment to the SAF Act, giving additional powers to the Singapore Armed Forces. A select group of about 2,000 SAF personnel will be trained to perform security operations in designated areas. These personnel, identified by a Military Security identification card, will be able to search, detain and use reasonable force against terror suspects."
"On 8 January 2006, a large scale emergency preparedness exercise was conducted. Codenamed Exercise Northstar V, it involved 22 agencies and 2,000 emergency personnel. An additional 3,400 commuters also participated in the exercise. The exercise involved a simulated terrorist bomb attack on four MRT stations (Raffles Place, Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh and Marina Bay) and one bus interchange (Toa Payoh). There were 500 mock casualties suffering from ""injuries"" caused by the ""explosions"" as well as chemical agents. The exercise is the largest civil emergency exercise ever staged in the country."
"The exercise started at 6:25 am local time on 8 January 2006, a Sunday, and lasted about three hours. To avoid public panic, announcements were made at the affected train stations as well as on television and radio, just before the exercise began. Prominent signages were also displayed."
"Mock explosive devices, such as thunderflashes were detonated near-simultaneously in subway trains and station platforms at four MRT stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay) and in a double decker bus at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. A chemical agent attack was then simulated at Dhoby Ghaut at 6:45 am. An undetonated mock bomb was also placed at the Raffles Place. About 3,400 commuters who were on board the subway trains were evacuated during the drill. Services at 13 MRT stations were temporarily disrupted and roads within the vicinity were also closed to traffic. Shuttle buses were used to ferry commuters affected by the exercise."
"Thunderflashes, smoke generators, and fire simulators were used to simulate the explosion and 500 simulated casualties were deployed to test emergency rescuers at the scene. These mock casualties carried tags to provide paramedics information on the extent of their injuries and this includes injuries related to bomb blasts, such as open wounds and burns. There were also some with injuries related to chemical agents. Dummy mannequins were also used to simulate casualties. 7 hospitals and 2 polyclinics were also involved in the drill as they received the mock casualties. In two hospitals, Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, healthcare workers donned decontamination suits as they prepared to treat victims of chemical agents suspected to be sarin gas."
"Officers from the London Metropolitan Police and the British Transport Police, including Chief Constable Ian Johnston, were present to observe the exercise and to provide feedback to the authorities."
"Following the crackdown on the local Jemaah Islamiyah cell, then-Deputy-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong held dialogues with the leaders of the Muslim community. Details of the investigation were shared to explain that the arrests were not targeted at the Singapore Muslim community, or Islam. In schools and workplaces, inter-racial confidence circles were formed to promote inter-racial and inter-religious understanding between the different racial and religious communities, while Islamic scholars and counselors in Singapore participated in the rehabilitation of the detained JI members."
= = = Apple Island (Massachusetts) = = =
"Apple Island was an island in Boston Harbor in Massachusetts, one of five islands that were integrated with landfill over the years to form East Boston and Logan International Airport. Noddle's Island, Hog Island, Bird's Island and Governor's Island were the others."
"Distinguished in its early years by waving elms but hard to access because of its expansive flats at low tide, the 10-acre Apple Island was initially part of the town of Boston, used for sheep and cattle grazing. It fell into the private hands of Thomas Hutchinson, father of Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, in 1723. Hutchinson the elder willed the island to an English mariner in 1802 , and a gentleman named Mr. Marsh purchased it for $550 in 1822. Marsh died in 1833 and was buried on the island's western slope, and his home burned down two years later."
"Abandoned for years, Apple Island was reacquired by the City of Boston in 1867 and sold to private citizens. Inhabitants were known to haul wrecked steamships onto the island and burn them for their copper and iron parts. These ships included the James Adger, the Baltic (the last steamship in the Collins line), and the Ontario, built in Newburyport for the Transatlantic trade."
"In the 1940s, Apple Island was subsumed into land reclamation for the extension of Boston Airport, which added of landfill in Boston Harbor, taken from Apple, Governor's and Noddle's Islands. In 1943 the state renamed the airport as General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport after a Spanish–American War officer from South Boston."

"After graduating, Follmer worked for KASE-FM in Austin, Texas. In 1961, he moved to KXYZ in Houston. In 1963, he began hosting the ""After Hours Show"", a 2 to 3 am jazz program on KTOK in Oklahoma City. He then worked for WSVA AM, WSVA-FM, and WSVA-TV. In 1965, he left Harrisonburg to become sports director at WTVM-TV in Columbus, Georgia. He then moved to WLEX-TV in Lexington, Kentucky where he was the sports director and play-by-play announcer for Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball. In 1970, he joined WSMW-TV in Worcester, Massachusetts as sports director and play-by-play announcer for Boston Celtics and New England Patriots games. He left WSMW in 1971."
"After broadcasting, Follmer worked as a stockbroker. In 1993, he was fined $50,000, required to pay $53,000 in restitution to customers, and barred from working for any National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) member by the NASD after it found that Follmer had solicited and accepted $53,000 from customers for the purchase of securities but instead used the money for his own benefit. He later worked as a business consultant and did voice-over work."

= = = Venezuela during World War II = = =
"The history of Venezuela during World War II is marked by dramatic change to the country's economy, military, and society. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Venezuela was the world's leading oil exporter, and subsequently one of the main beneficiaries of the American Lend-Lease programs. Economic assistance from the United States, as well a booming oil industry, led Venezuela to become one of the few Latin American countries that was able to finance its own modernization in the post-war era. Furthermore, through skillful diplomacy, Venezuela was able to gain territory, increase its share in oil profits, and also reduce its reliance on foreign oil companies."
"Although Venezuela was officially neutral for most of the war, it secretly supported the Allies, and eventually declared war on the Axis powers in February 1945, a few months before the end of the conflict."
"According to author Thomas M. Leonard, Venezuela's oil garnered ""intense interest"" from the Allies and the Axis, both before and during World War II. Thus, Venezuela's main strategic goal from 1939 to 1945 was to protect its oil from being seized by a belligerent nation. Closely related to this goal was the need to market oil, which had become the mainstay of the Venezuelan economy. Leonard says that the war could, ideally, have resulted in an ""economic boom"" if Venezuela could maintain a policy of strict neutrality and sell oil to both sides. However, neither the Axis or the Allies were likely to tolerate such a situation, and in the end, Venezuela sided with the Allies."
"Even though Venezuela was decidedly pro-Allied, the government attempted to increase its hold on the oil market, which was dominated by American-owned petroleum firms. One option was to nationalize the oil industry, like Mexico did in 1938. This option, however, was never seriously considered, because nationalizing the oil industry meant seizing American-owned oil, which would have likely resulted in a military intervention. Although Mexico's nationalization of its oil industry did not result in an American military intervention, just the possibility of one was enough to keep the Venezuelan government content with seeking a mere increase in its share of profits, rather than taking all of it."
"Subsequently, the United States, eager to maintain its access to the oil, agreed to increase oil revenues for Venezuela. Profits were split fifty-fifty between the Venezuelan government and the oil companies, such as Standard Oil and the British-owned Shell Oil. As result, in 1944 Venezuela's oil income was 66% higher than it was in 1941, and by 1947 total income had increased 358%. This ""largesse,"" as Leonard calls it, allowed Venezuela to become one of the few Latin American countries that was able to finance its own modernization in the postwar era, unlike many of the other states in the region, which relied on American economic assistance."
"Nazi efforts to increase their influence in Venezuela, and thus access Venezuelan oil, date back to 1933, when Arnold Margerie formed the Venezuelan Regional Group of the Nazi Party, or ""Grupo Regional de Venezuela del Partido Nazi"". After that, the Germans began ""courting"" the Venezuelan military through its military mission. On the ""cultural front,"" according to Leonard, General Wilhelm von Faupel, head of the Ibero-American Institute, attempted to gain influence by sending his wife, Edith, to Venezuela to ""extol the virtues of fascism."" Germany was also active in countering American economic influence, by expanding its holdings in mining, agriculture, and railroading."
"During the war, there were nearly 4,000 German immigrants residing in Venezuela. As result of which, there was fear among certain Allied leaders of a ""fifth column"" forming to commit sabotage and other acts against the Venezuelan government or oil-related infrastructure. The nearby British, French, and Dutch colonies also presented security concerns: If any were to fall under Axis control, they would certainly become bases for the interdiction of the Caribbean sea lanes, which carried Venezuela's crude oil to be refined in Aruba, and thence to market. They could also be used as staging areas for the invasion of neighboring countries, or for commando operations to interrupt oil production."
"In the 1930s there was a small Italian community in Venezuela with some links to fascist Italy: founded in 1923, the ""Partito Nazionale Fascista"" -with over two hundred members- had organizations in four cities: Caracas, Valencia, Puerto Cabello and Barquisimeto (Duaca). President Eleazar López Contreras (and later, president Isaías Medina Angarita) showed sympathy toward Mussolini and in 1938, the Venezuelan Navy purchased two ""Azio""-class minesweepers from Fascist Italy. Then in September 1939, Contreras declared the country's neutrality: Venezuela continued to trade with Japan and Italy for another year."
"Moreover, trade with Imperial Japan reached an all-time high in 1939. After the war in Europe began in September 1939, and after President Eleazar López Contreras declared the Venezuela's neutrality, he maintained a huge commerce with Japan and Italy, but trade with Germany ceased due to the British blockade. It was because of these circumstances some observers concluded that Venezuela would join the Axis if it were forced to take sides. However, the fear of Venezuela aligning itself with Germany, or any of the other Axis powers, was mostly unwarranted, because the sentiment of your average Venezuelan was ""bitterly anti-German."""
"When World War II began, the Venezuelan military was badly in need of modernization, and the United States was eager to help in return for Venezuela's support in the war. However, the United States was concerned about a possible enemy attack on Venezuela, in order to disrupt oil production, if it did openly join the Allied cause and declare war. As result, the Venezuelan government broke relations with the Axis powers on December 31, 1941, but it did not declare war until February 15, 1945, when the threat of an attack against the oil was gone. Therefore, the Venezuelan military never met the enemy on the battlefield, although under the Operation Neuland a few Venezuelan merchant ships were sunk; the first of which called ""Monagas"" occurred during the German attack on Aruba in February 1942."
"Because Venezuela was officially neutral for most of the war, the task of guarding the Venezuelan coast for enemy activity and escorting Venezuelan ships was left to the Americans. Accordingly, after the attack on Aruba and Curazao where refineries processed venezuelan oil, the United States Navy established the Fourth Fleet, which was responsible for countering enemy naval operations in the Caribbean and in the South Atlantic. The United States Army also sent aircraft and personnel to help protect the oil refineries and bolster the Venezuelan Air Force. To support the mission, Venezuela granted American ships and planes access to the country's ports and airstrips."
Since 1942 the government freezing the assets of German citizens based in Venezuela and the restriction of the economic activities of these groups within the country.
"It was achieved, through investigations to detain at least 800 citizens of German nationality who had activities to support the Nazi party. They were confined in concentration camps in Lara, Mérida and Trujillo. On the other hand, the German School of Caracas was closed after it was proven that it had pro-Nazi activities."
"Operation Bolivar was a German espionage operation in Latin America during World War II. It was under the operational control of Department VID 4 of Germany's Security Service, and was primarily concerned with the collection and transmission of clandestine information from Latin America to Europe. Overall, the Germans were successful in establishing a secret radio communications network from their control station in Argentina, as well as a courier system involving the use of Spanish merchant vessels for the shipment of paper-form intelligence."
"However, Argentine authorities arrested most of the German agents operating in their country in mid-1944, ending all effective ""Bolivar"" activity. Furthermore, the information collected during the operation is believed to have been more useful to the Allies, who intercepted much of the secret transmissions, than to Germany."
"The SS ""Koenigstein"" and the SS ""Caribia"" were a pair of German steamboats that were used to carry about 300 Jewish refugees from Europe to Venezuela between February and March 1939. The ""Koenigstein"", with eighty-six Jews on board, left Germany in January 1939 for the British colony of Trinidad, but when it arrived, the British refused to accept the passengers because of a recent prohibition on the admission of refugees. As result, the ""Koenigstein"" sailed to Honduras, but again the passengers were denied entry. With nowhere else to go, the ""Koenigstein"" then sailed for Venezuela, and arrived on February 17, 1939. The SS ""Caribia"", carrying 165 Jews, went through a very similar ordeal. After sailing to British Guiana, Georgetown authorities refused to allow the passengers to land, and so the ""Caribia"" sailed to Venezuela, arriving on March 16, 1939."
"At first, the Venezuelan government of the General Eleazar Lopez Contreras gave the refugees special permission to stay in the country temporarily, until new homes could be found for them in other Latin American countries, but they were banned from finding employment in any industry other than agriculture. Furthermore, the Venezuelan government made it clear that it would not accept any more refugees, unless they came through the proper channels. Later, President Contreras gave the refugees permission to remain in the country permanently. As result of which, the passengers of the ""Koenigstein"" and the ""Caribia"" became some of the founding members of Venezuela's Jewish community, as most Jewish emigration to Venezuela would occur after the war, in the 1950s and 1960s."

"Suffolk University Law School (also known as ""Suffolk Law School""). Suffolk University Law School is a private, non-sectarian law school located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Suffolk University Law School was founded in 1906 by Gleason Archer Sr. to provide a legal education for those who traditionally lacked the opportunity to study law because of socio-economic or racial discrimination. Suffolk is the fourth-oldest New England law school in continuous existence."
"The law school currently has both day and evening, part-time divisions. Suffolk University Law School has been accredited by the American Bar Association since 1953 and the Association of American Law Schools since 1977. The school is located in Sargent Hall on Tremont Street in downtown Boston. Suffolk offers over 200 upper-level electives, the most of any law school in the country, and is consistently ranked one of the most technologically advanced schools in the nation. Suffolk publishes six law reviews, to which students, faculty, and other scholars contribute. Suffolk University Law School alumni are found in high-level judicial, political, and private positions throughout the United States. With over 25,000 alumni, Suffolk is the fourth largest law school in the United States."
"According to Suffolk Law's 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 148 members of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation."
"One of New England's oldest law schools, Suffolk was founded in 1906 by lawyer Gleason Leonard Archer as the ""Suffolk School of Law."" The school was named after its location in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Archer's goal was to provide immigrants and the working class with the opportunity to study law. In 1907, Archer moved the school from Roxbury, Massachusetts to downtown Boston. Suffolk Law School's first student passed the bar in 1908. By 1930, Archer developed Suffolk into one of the largest law schools in the country, and the law school received full accreditation from the American Bar Association (ABA). Originally an all-male school, with the New England School of Law serving as a sister school, Suffolk became co-educational in 1937. In 1999, Suffolk Law School opened its new building at 120 Tremont Street, near the Boston Common."
"Suffolk Law School has a 3-year day program and a 4-year evening program offering a broad selection of courses. The law school maintains a traditional first-year Juris Doctor curriculum which includes the year-long courses of Civil Procedure, Contracts, Property, Torts, and Legal Writing, in addition to the semester-long Constitutional Law and Criminal Law courses. A course in Professional Responsibility is required, and each student must also fulfill legal writing and legal skills requirements prior to graduation. Until 2008 Fiduciary Relations, a class concentrating on the law of Agency and Trusts, was required. Upon completion of the required curriculum, students at Suffolk choose from over 200 upper-level courses, many of which focus on learning practical skills, including several legal clinics. Students may also receive credit for diverse internships and clerkships, including those at various courts in the Boston area. Academic concentrations are available in Civil Litigation, Financial Services, Health/Biomedical, and Intellectual Property."

"Development of C Wear Interactive Glasses began in January 2006, the first proof of concept prototype of the C Wear Interactive Glasses BM10 was released for beta testing in January 2009 and sold as a 0-series to the market 4 months later. It was developed to significantly improve the use of information in a mobile environment for users with the need of Augmented Reality (AR) data without the ability to use hands or users having their hands occupied."
"On 4 April 2009, the company announced that it signed a contract with BAE Systems Hagglunds in which the companies will jointly work on the integration of the Interactive Glasses BM10 in the BAE Systems Hägglunds products. BAE Systems Hägglunds tested the glasses in its tanks."
"In September 2010, the development of the next version BM20 was initiated and the first 0 series was planned to be released in December 2012. In October 2011, the company introduced the C Wear Interactive Glasses BM20 during the Innovative Sweden event at Stanford University in Silicon Valley. The first complete series manufactured of the C Wear Interactive Glasses are to be released during 2014."
The C Wear Interactive Glasses BM20 comprises a see-through retina projection unit with an 873 x 500 full-color resolution OLED display with diagonal field of view of 47 degrees giving the impression of a ≈70-inch display at 2 meters. The transparency enables the image to be shown in the user direct line of sight.
"Navigation in the user interface is performed by a head tracking device based on 3D MEMS gyros and click commands by a soft sensor applied toward the user's own jawbone muscle. By pressing the jaw together the user ""clicks""."
"In September 2013, Fraunhofer Society announced that Penny and C Wear Interactive Glasses has been chosen as one of the partners in the LIAA project with aims creating and implementing a framework that enables humans and robots to truly work together in assembly tasks."
"At Expo 2005, Brother Industries demonstrated a stationary-type of its Imaging Display, a projection technology that focuses light, of an intensity harmless to the eyes, onto the retina and then moves the light at high speed to create afterimages that give the user the impression of viewing a 16 square inch screen from a distance of 1 meter. The company developed the system by applying optical system technologies based on their laser printing technology, and piezoelectric technologies based on their ink-jet printing technology. It was developed in order to enable users to read documents such as operation manuals at the narrow spaces, or to be hands-free when they want to use both hands."
"In 2008, Brother succeeded in developing a spectacle-type wearable RID prototype that's able to show SVGA resolution (800×600) with a 60 Hz frame rate and weights only 350 g. On 21 July 2010, it announced the AiRScouter and exhibited the device at ""Brother World JAPAN 2010"" in Tokyo on 15 September. On 24 August 2011, it announced the commercialization of the AiRScouter."

In September 2009, the company revealed that it is developing a small, lightweight optical see-through eyewear display based on its Clear-Vu technology at the cost of less than $200 per unit. The eyewear display was scheduled for release by the end of 2010 by Japanese maker."
"At Augmented World Expo 2013, Optinvent demonstrated a prototype of their ORA see-through mobile AR display platform. The demonstrator included a monocular see-through display with the patented ""Flip-Vu"" feature allowing two positions for the virtual image. The display can be positioned directly in the wearer's field of vision or below it. One position is the ""AR mode"" whereby the image is directly superimposed on the wearers central field of vision; then by flipping the display down (mechanically), the wearer can have a ""dashboard mode"" whereby the virtual display is below the wearer's field of vision. This gives the possibility of having both true AR and a ""glance at"" capability in one device. A developer's version of the device running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean called the ORA-S including an SDK was said to be released soon and will include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, a nine-axis orientation sensor, a camera, a microphone, loudspeaker, and battery in the form of photochromic sunglasses."

= = = Samskara (film) = = =
"Samskara (English title: Funeral Rites) is a 1970 Kannada-language film written by U. R. Ananthamurthy based on his eponymous novel, and directed and produced by Pattabhirama Reddy. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was executive director for the film. It is considered a path-breaking film that pioneered the parallel cinema movement in Kannada. ""Samskara"" won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film (1970)."
"The word ""samskara"" means ""ritual"" in Kannada. The Madras Censor Board banned ""Samskara"" because it was felt that the strong anti-caste message of the film could spark tensions among the public. The ban was revoked by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The film was released and it went on to win awards at national and international levels."
"The story is set in a street in a small village called Durvasapura in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. A majority of the people who live in the street belong to the community of Madhwas (a Brahmin community). The people who stay here have a traditional mindset and strictly follow the rules defined by their religion. Two of the main characters in the story are Praneshacharya (Girish Karnad) and Narayanappa. Praneshacharya is a devout Brahmin who has completed his Vedic education at Varanasi and has returned to Duravasapura and is considered as the leader of the Brahmin community of his village and the surrounding ones. His main goal is to attain liberation (""moksha"") and he is willing to go to any length to achieve it. To remain focused on his goal and as an act of self-sacrifice, he marries an invalid woman and hence remains celibate."
"The other main character, Narayanappa, a Brahmin by birth but one who has rejected the set rules of Brahminism by eating meat and by keeping the company of a prostitute named Chandri. Once Narayanappa and his friends catches the sacred fish in the temple tank, cooks, and eats them. This causes the Brahmins in the villages to rise up against him. They approach Praneshacharya to throw him out of the village. Praneshacharya decides against taking this extreme step and he believes that Narayanappa can be convinced to get rid of his immoral acts. Once Narayanappa visits Shimoga and he returns to Duravasapura with high fever and dies. The Brahmins are left in a piquant situation because, according to Brahmin principles, a person who dies should be cremated as early as possible. None of the Brahmins wants to cremate the body — they feel that by cremating Narayanappa's body, they will become polluted as he was against the Brahmin principles during his life."
"However, the Brahmin principles also stipulate that a non-Brahmin cannot cremate the body of a Brahmin. Praneshacharya, being the leader, is responsible for finding the solution to this difficult problem. He reads the holy books, but they do not provide any solution. He then goes to a temple to pray to God and spends a whole day there. Disappointed at not being able to solve the problem, he trudges back home. On his way, he encounters Chandri. He is mesmerised by her beauty and when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he finds himself lying on Chandri's lap. Chandri rushes home, finds that Narayanappa's body has started to rot, gets it cremated in secrecy, and leaves Durvasapura. Praneshacharya is left in a piquant situation on whether he has to reveal his immoral act to the people of the village or keep quiet about it. Feeling guilty, he leaves the village but the guilt never leaves him. Finally deciding to own up to his act, he returns to the village and the story ends there. It's left to the imagination of the viewer on whether Praneshacharya owns up or not."
"The story was written by U. R. Ananthamurthy in 1965, while a student at the University of Birmingham for his Ph.D. He saw the film ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957) by Ingmar Bergman and was deeply moved by it. His tutor Malcolm Bradbury suggested he write about his experiences in India concerning the multilayered structure of time in Indian society."
"After completing the story, he sent the manuscript to Girish Karnad in India who got in touch with Pattabhirami Reddy and S. G. Vasudev, a painter, both with Madras Players, a Madras-based amateur acting group. Impressed by the theme of the story, Reddy decided to produce and direct it. Vasudev became the art director and also brought in Tom Cowan, a photographer with the Commonwealth Documentation Division, Australia, as the cinematographer. Cowan, in turn, brought his friend Steven Cartaw as the editor. The initial casting for the film was done from the Madras Players before choosing the rest in Bangalore."
"The film required a localized dwelling of Brahmins as the setting and Vasudev found one in Vaikunthapura, near Sringeri in Mysore State (now Karnataka). Despite intervention from the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, the makers received cooperation from the locals during filming. In an interview with ""The Times of India"" in 2014, Ananthamurthy said, ""Vaikunthapura had a population of pure Brahmins. But the women of the agrahara where we shot the movie let Tom [Cowan] enter the kitchen. If the locals had known the theme, they would have never allowed the shooting to take place. They must have regretted it after the film's release. But the place became famous after the movie"". Cowan worked for 30 days, shooting 900 shots at an average of 30 shots per day, before the film was completed in a paltry 90,000."
"""Samskara"" was the first Kannada film to be directed and produced by Pattabhirami Reddy who had mainly dealt with Telugu films. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was the executive director of the film. The film was also notable for it was the first Kannada film to not use excessive use of cosmetics for the artistes, music and dance, and for being made entirely with an amateur cast, most of whom were poets, writers and journalists. ""Samskara"" was initially banned by the Madras Censor Board in late 1969. It was the first Kannada film to receive a ban. The Board however gave no reasons for the ban in its letter to the makers. It was later revoked by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting."
= = = Democratic and Republican Left group = = =
The Democratic and Republican Left group ( or GDR) is a parliamentary group in the National Assembly including representatives of the French Communist Party (PCF).
"The electoral record of the French Communist Party (PCF) in 2007 was marked by dismal performances, first in the presidential election in which the party's national secretary Marie-George Buffet stood as a candidate supported by the PCF within the framework of an anti-liberal alliance; she was routed in the first round, receiving just 1.93% of the overall vote, a result deemed ""catastrophic"" for the party. The party's result in the subsequent legislative elections was similarly middling: though it outpaced the projections of pollsters, which placed it between only 5 and 15 seats, it still fell short of the threshold of 20 deputies, then required for the formation of a parliamentary group in the National Assembly. As a result, Alain Bocquet, outgoing leader of the preceding communist group in the assembly, demanded on 18 June that the requirement for the number of deputies to form a political group be lowered to 15 from 20 then needed, with a total of 15 deputies elected under the PCF label in the legislative elections (not counting PCF dissident Maxime Gremetz or PCF associate deputies Jean-Pierre Brard and Jacques Desallangre). Bocquet, referring to the recent election of Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential election, added ""if the president of the Republic is a democrat, he will prove it"", further arguing that ""contrary to all predictions, the conditions for the constitution of a communist group in the National Assembly have been met, and their recognition is only a regulatory formality""."
"During the evening of 17 June, the second round of the legislative elections, Buffet issued an appeal to form an ""open"" group to carry the ""people's voice"" in the National Assembly, singling out the Greens (VEC) as a potential target. PCF spokesperson Olivier Dartigolles speculated that the party could secure an alliance ""with the non-inscrits, with the elected officials of the DOM-TOM, with the progressive elected officials of the left"", believing that the other forces on the left were sufficient to constitute a parliamentary group. Recognizing the predicament of the PCF, ecologist deputy Noël Mamère proposed that evening that the four members of the Greens elected in the legislative elections join the communist deputies in order to provide the necessary support to form a political group in the National Assembly, saying that he believed that the Green deputies accept the opening proposed by Buffet, hoping to sit along the PCF and others on the left in an ""autonomous group"" in the National Assembly, independent of the Socialist Party (PS); he later added that his invitation was also extended the Movement of Citizens of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the Radical Party of the Left (PRG), and miscellaneous left. Bocuqet on 18 June indicated that ""the group was open to the world"" but did not signify that it would accept the support of the Greens in order to establish a group."
"Despite this initial outreach to the Greens, however, Buffet's initiative to form a common group with the Greens was ultimately rebuffed, ending the possibility of a ""communist, republican and ecologist"" group as envisaged by Mamère. Discussions between Mamère, PCF deputy Patrick Braouezec, and miscellaneous left deputies including Gérard Charasse were briefly initiated with the apparent support of the leadership of the PCF, which sought to strengthen its position in the assembly and diminish troublemakers within it ranks; however, these ultimately came to no avail, with Bocquet believing that an alliance with the Greens would be unfeasible during the debates of the Grenelle de l'environnement and legislation proposed as a result. Maxime Gremetz, ousted from the communist federation in the Somme and antagonistic towards the national party, made conditional his membership of a parliamentary group contingent on his demand that he and the other communists in the Somme excluded from the departmental federation be permitted to rejoin. With 18 total communist deputies, it was therefore necessary to seek two additional deputies for the formation of the group."
"Unable to pass the threshold of 20 deputies on their own, however, the communists – Bocquet in particular – were eventually forced to reopen the door to the Greens and PRG, with Mamère proposing a ""radical, communist, and green"" group. Though the PCF continued to petition for a lowering of the bar for a parliamentary group from 20 to 15 deputies, the necessary change of regulation required the assent of a majority of the National Assembly, then controlled by the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). There being no guarantee that this would happen, Bocquet said that the communists needed to act with ""pragmatism"". The Democratic and Republican Left group (""groupe de la Gauche démocrate et républicaine"") was ultimately formed on 26 June with 24 deputies, Jean-Claude Sandrier becoming its first president; it included the deputies of the PCF (with the exception of André Gerin, who refused to join), four Greens, and two miscellaneous left deputies: Alfred Marie-Jeanne for Martinique and Huguette Bello for Réunion."
"After leaving the PS along with Jean-Luc Mélenchon to co-found the Left Party, Marc Dolez left the Socialist, Radical, Citizen and Miscellaneous Left group to join the GDR group as an associate deputy before becoming a member on 27 January 2009. On 11 July 2010, Anny Poursinoff of the Greens was elected in a by-election in Yvelines's 10th constituency, defeating Jean-Frédéric Poisson, thus becoming the 26th member of the GDR group. On 1 September 2010, the Green deputy Yves Cochet took over the presidency of the GDR group. Maxime Gremetz was expelled from the group on 12 April 2011 after interrupting a parliamentary meeting about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and subsequently resigned from his seat on 16 May. Cochet left the GDR group on 6 December after being designated as an MEP, and was replaced by Roland Muzeau; this decision reflected the dissatisfaction of the Left Front at the decision of their ecologist partners, now known as Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), to present a common candidate with the PS against incumbent François Asensi in Seine-Saint-Denis's 11th constituency. The four ecologist deputies subsequently left the GDR group, Cochet departing on 6 December to take his seat as an MEP and the three others quitting on 7 December. Jacques Desallangre left the group on 17 February 2012."
"Following the 2012 legislative elections, André Chassaigne was designated by the 10 deputies of the Left Front to form a parliamentary group, with only 15 deputies now required to form a parliamentary group, again raising the possibility of seeking support from ""progressive"" deputies representing Réunion, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. With the support of two such deputies already confirmed, as previous members of the group, the support of two newly elected deputies in Martinique, Jean-Philippe Nilor and Bruno Nestor Azerot, was sought out. The search for the fifteenth deputy proved difficult; though Ary Chalus of Guadeloupe, another newly minted deputy, was expected to join the group, the situation was complicated by Chalus's statement on 21 June that he would associate with the Socialist group. The continued existence of the group was finally assured with the confirmation that Gabriel Serville of the Guianese Socialist Party (PSG) would sit with the GDR in the assembly, the group now reduced to 15 deputies."
"In the 2017 legislative elections, the PCF and la France Insoumise, the movement founded by Jean-Luc Mélenchon prior to the presidential election, failed to establish an alliance to run common candidates in the legislative elections. Both subsequently decided to form separate parliamentary groups; Chassaigne declared that the GDR would continue on 21 June, including 11 of its own deputies and 4 from overseas France, but would not oppose the initiatives of the la France Insoumise group. Mélenchon's insistence on voting discipline respecting his movement's program proved an obstacle in any potential alliance between the two. At the time of its formation on 27 June, the parliamentary group included 16 deputies."
= = = Robert Ferro = = =
"Robert Ferro (October 21, 1941 – July 11, 1988) was an American novelist whose semi-autobiographical fiction explored the uneasy integration of homosexuality and traditional American upper middle class values."
"He was born in Cranford, New Jersey and graduated from Cranford High School. He went to college at Rutgers University and received a Master's Degree from the University of Iowa. In late 1965 Ferro met Andrew Holleran at the Iowa Writer's Workshop. He later lectured at Adelphi University."
He was a member of The Violet Quill.
"He died of AIDS a few months after his partner, Michael Grumley, in 1988 at his father's home in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, age 46. Grumley and Ferro are buried together under the Ferro-Grumley memorial in Rockland Cemetery, Sparkill, New York."
"Following their deaths, the Ferro-Grumley Foundation, which manages their estate, created and endowed the annual Ferro-Grumley Award for LGBT fiction in conjunction with Publishing Triangle."
"Although Hicks never fully attained her stardom goals, and although she later distanced herself from her goals on the matter, Singaporeans broadly took note of the nature of her early attempts at becoming famous. Few people found themselves able to respond to Hicks with a mere shrug, a fact that fueled not only her popularity among her supporters but the controversy that so doggedly followed her among her critics. While tasting the intense and transitory flavor of fame, Hicks' limited life experience could not have led her to anticipate the intensity of the negative reactions that would accompany her attempts under the spotlight, could not have allowed her to surmise the toll that the negative words and societal shunning would take upon her psyche over time. In many ways, her move to Indonesia, which coincided with her plea for greater public understanding as released in her second book, ""Discuss Disgust"", was an attempt to escape the intense controversy she had experienced in Singapore over her first book, ""Excuse Me, Are You a Model?"" Whether her departure was something of a victory for traditionalists, a mere admission to herself of her limited constitution to withstand societal disapprobation, an outcome of simply her own maturation, or some combination of the three, cannot be known with certainty. What is clear, however, is that her hope through her move was to find a reprieve from the societal shunning she had been experiencing from traditionalists in Singapore; to move to a place where she could deepen and further redefine herself and perhaps undertake a larger and much wiser relaunching of herself in Singapore. It was never to be due to her untimely death."
"Part of Hicks' plan was to attend university. Although Hicks publicly downplayed her lack of higher education, she privately expressed regret that she had not studied past her A-levels, a fact traditionalist critics had used against her and her writings with no small frequency. During the year leading up to her 1997 death, Hicks applied to numerous universities in Britain and the United States, including Harvard. During her application processes she called upon her Harvard mentors to exert influence on her behalf, which certainly helped overcome any negative effects that remained from Hicks' unremarkable academic record during her youth. At the time she applied, Hicks could present herself as an exceptional candidate to any university she wished to attend, a veritable shoo-in. Here was a young woman who had overcome a very difficult upbringing to become a nationally known model-turned-author, and whose mind, spirit, and insights had authentically impressed the two high-level academicians who had become the predominant mentors of her life transition and letter of recommendation writers. Hicks soon reported through the Singaporean press that she had received one university acceptance, refusing to say where, stating that she was awaiting other possible acceptances before ultimately deciding where to attend."
"In keeping with traditionalist Singaporean pressures placed upon her, Hicks had begun to mature her image regarding her personal relationships and sexual reputation, whether her actual deeds fully deserved the reputation or not. She made plans to marry, settle down, and have children. Shortly before her death, Hicks became engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Richard ""Randy"" Dalrymple, an American architect of some regional prominence because of his unique structures in Singapore and Jakarta, once featured in ""Architectural Digest"". It was to celebrate Christmas with Dalrymple's family that Hicks and Dalrymple boarded SilkAir Flight 185 in Jakarta en route to Singapore, probably their first such visit to the home of Dalrymple's parents as an engaged couple. The young couple never arrived, died en route, as their flight crashed into the Musi River."
"Less than thirty minutes into SilkAir Flight 185 with Hicks aboard, the flight began a sudden, radical, high-speed nosedive at 35,000 feet toward the Musi River. The plane reached such a high velocity that it broke into pieces in the air before being scattered across the river's surface. Local fisherman immediately scoured the crash site for survivors, even though by all accounts the scene appeared devastatingly hopeless. Both Hicks and Dalrymple perished along with all of the rest of the passengers and crew. No one ever found even a single intact body."
"Hicks' personal effects, including her wallet and credit cards, were found by divers at the crash site and confirmed her death. SilkAir Flight 185 had crashed with such tremendous force that only six of the one hundred and four victims could be identified from the scant partially intact body parts."
"The crash investigation revealed that Hicks' ex-husband was a Republic of Singapore Air Force friend of Tsu Way Ming, the Singaporean captain of SilkAir Flight 185. According to the recovered flight recorder, Tsu had walked into the first class area of the plane's cabin just minutes before the crash. It would have been hard for him to miss Hicks and Dalrymple seated together. Tsu was thought to have disabled the plane's flight recorder to prevent it from providing a clear record of the actions he was about to take. Additionally, investigators discovered that Tsu had longstanding personal problems and a string of troubling incidents as a pilot. Leading up to the time of the crash, he had been experiencing serious family and financial problems, in part due to gambling debts. A month earlier, Tsu had taken out a large life insurance policy on himself that went into effect just hours before the crash."
"Indonesian authorities concluded that the crash had occurred for unknown reasons, resulting in nearly universal criticism that they had politicised the report so as not to strike fear into potential passengers of its fledgling national airline industry. An official investigation by the Singapore Police Force found ""no evidence that the pilot, copilot or any crew member had suicidal tendencies or a motive to deliberately cause the crash of [the aircraft]."" U.S. authorities, whose painstaking research had become the main basis of criticism of Indonesia's and Singapore's findings, took a confidently different view. Employing uncharacteristic brushes of rhetorical force and critical statements in their final report, they ruled the crash a suicide/homicide caused by the deliberate actions of SilkAir Flight 185's Captain Tsu Way Ming. He deliberately murdered everyone aboard while committing suicide, according to the U.S.'s investigation."
"As a result of Indonesia's findings, survivor benefits were paid in full to Captain Tsu Way Ming's wife and children."
"Hicks' death at age twenty-nine shocked Singaporeans, as well as others around the globe, and prompted a swirl of activity as people sought to interpret the meaning of a life that had been suddenly cut short. Hicks' traditionalist critics as well as her allies both looked afresh, deeper, more carefully, and perhaps with a level of nuance she had prior deserved all along."
"Hicks is a transitional yet often still-controversial figure who lived and died a tragic death amid an important period of debate over changes between traditional and globalised Singapore. Both in life and in death, her status as a writer came to eclipse her status as a model. Today she is most recognised for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature that spoke out on subjects not normally broached in her society, and the anthropic philosophy contained in her writings. Describing the consensus of Singaporean literary scholars in 1995, two years before Hicks' death, Ismail S. Talib in ""The Journal of Commonwealth Literature"" stated of ""Excuse me, are you a Model?"": ""We have come to realize in retrospect that Hicks's autobiographical account of her life as a model was a significant milestone in Singapore's literary and cultural history"". This recognition preceded Hicks' death, and in light of the controversy, and even the societal shunning she faced because of her early writings, took her and many around her by surprise. It also helped fuel the life transition she underwent prior her death."
"As answers and unanswered questions continued to trickle out from the flight investigations, literary scholars, both in Singapore and elsewhere, began their own investigations of Hicks' writings. Some did so anew, while others did so for the first time."
"Tu Weiming characterized Hicks' life and philosophy as providing a ""sharp contrast to Hobbes' cynic[al] view of human existence"", and stated that Hicks was ""the paradigmatic example of an autonomous, free-choosing individual who decided early on to construct a lifestyle congenial to her idiosyncratic sense of self-expression"". More than anything, Tu said, ""She was primarily a seeker of meaningful existence, a learner""."
"Singaporean post-colonial author Grace Chia interpreted Hicks' life with a poem, ""Mermaid Princess"", that parodies the traditional Scottish folk song, ""My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean."" An excerpt of the poem characterises Hicks as one who:"
"Richard Lim, the editor of ""The Straits Times"", interpreted Hicks in a eulogy by recalling her life and contributions to the paper, and by publishing an excerpt of the famous essay ""Whistling of Birds"" by D. H. Lawrence. Lim began his piece with a line from the famous folk/rock song ""Fire and Rain"" by James Taylor. ""Sweet dreams and flying machines, and pieces on the ground,"" as if sung into his readers' memories in Taylor's highly somber tone, seemed to perfectly encapsulate much of the retrospective feeling across Singapore about Hicks' life and sudden death."
"On the first anniversary of her death, in December 1998, Tal Ben-Shahar published ""Heaven Can Wait: Conversations with Bonny Hicks"", in which he wove together his and Hicks' year-long correspondence with his own philosophical musings. The book is an extended postmodern ""conversation"" between two seekers journeying intensely together in a quest for meaning and purpose. It takes its title from an article Hicks submitted to ""The Straits Times"" just days before her death, which ever after took on a hauntingly prophetic air. In it she wrote: ""The brevity of life on earth cannot be overemphasized. I cannot take for granted that time is on my side—because it is not ... Heaven can wait, but I cannot"". In an earlier ""Strait Times"" piece that memorialised her grandmother, Hicks confessed that she believed in life after death."
"Especially among Singaporean youth, who in the years since Hicks' death have become increasingly uncomfortable with their country's traditional backdrops of racialism, Hicks is recognized as a person who learned to cross cultural boundaries, who found a comfortable niche in the betwixt-and-between of contesting cultural traditions, and who lived as one who was race-blind to see people for who they really were."
"A memorial in honour of the victims of SilkAir Flight 185 stands beside the Musi River crash site in Indonesia. Another is at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery, Singapore."

Valuev or Valuyev () is a Russian surname. Notable people with the surname include:
= = = Kevin Kilbane = = =
"Kevin Daniel Kilbane (; born 1 February 1977) is a former professional footballer who played as both a left back and a left winger. Born and raised in England but of Irish parentage, Kilbane won 110 caps for the Republic of Ireland national team, third behind only Robbie Keane and Shay Given as the most capped Irish player of all time."
"Kilbane played for several English clubs, including Everton, West Bromwich Albion, Sunderland, Wigan Athletic, Huddersfield Town and Derby County (the last two on loan from Hull City) and Coventry City."
"Towards the end of his career Kilbane concentrated on forging a media career. He now works as an analyst for Virgin Media Television (Ireland), BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC ""Match of the Day"", ""Football Focus"", Final Score and Ireland's ""Newstalk"" Radio Off The Ball Football Show."
"Born in Preston, Lancashire, Kilbane made his professional debut at his hometown club, Preston North End, after making his way through the youth system at Deepdale. It was not long before his performances began to attract attention from other clubs, and he was sold to West Bromwich Albion for a fee of £1 million in 1997. Kilbane was Albion's first £1 million player, breaking a club transfer record which had stood since 1979."
"In December 1999, Peter Reid's Sunderland paid £2.5 million for the left winger, making him the third most expensive club signing at the time. His impact was immediate; coming off the bench on his debut against Southampton, Kilbane crossed for Kevin Phillips to score the match winner. However, this was to be Sunderland's last win until March 2000, a loss in form which came to be known as ""The Curse of Kilbane""."
"In spite of his best efforts on the pitch, he soon became a target for the Black Cats fans to vent their frustrations, as the team's drop in form under Peter Reid continued and the team were relegated from the Premiership. In the summer of 2002, he gave the travelling Sunderland fans a two-fingered salute on a pre-season tour of France. His days at the Stadium of Light seemed numbered."
"On the last day of the transfer window at the start of the 2003–04 season, Kilbane moved to Everton for just under £1 million, where he was reunited with David Moyes. The Goodison Park fans would appreciate his commitment and re-invigorate Kilbane as a player. In return, he displayed great versatility which resulted in him being deployed right across the midfield, at left back or even as a support striker, as well has his preferred left-wing position. On 26 August 2006, during his last game for Everton against Tottenham Hotspur, he was sent off by referee Mark Halsey for two bookable offences."
"Yoshi Amao hosts, with Masayuki Hashimoto as ""Judge Masa"". The show's characters include a group of ninjas led by the English-translator ninja Shinobi; and Glasses Man, who is one of the audience members."
"""Japanizi"" is an adaptation of the ABC reality show ""I Survived A Japanese Game Show"", originally called Big in Japan, and was created by David Sidebotham. The studio-based kids game show will make use of zany costumes, conveyor belts, dizzy chairs, giant fans and velcro walls with themed competitions and more. The Japanese language is incorporated with the show, but it is mostly English."
"""Japanizi"" is produced by Toronto-based marblemedia, the production company behind the game shows ""Splatalot"" and ""The Adrenaline Project"", creates award-winning children’s programs for television, web and mobile."
"On 20 August 2014, YTV & Disney XD dismissed increasing rumors that ""Japanizi: Going, Going, Gong!"" had been cancelled, reporting rather that renewal of the series is undetermined as of the present."
"About the show: 4 teams take on 3 courses, but only 1 team can win the impossibly large trophy. Ninja Shinobi also gives them a prize, which is not real, but makes the audience laugh."
The contestants for the show are teens aged 12–16 from across Canada. Marblemedia's kids game show adaptation will feature four teams of two contestants moving through three elimination rounds of physical gags and over-the-top stunts to reach a final winner. Casting is now closed for the show.
This is a listing of the various challenges performed on the show.
= = = Optical head-mounted display = = =
"An optical head-mounted display (OHMD) is a wearable device that has the capability of reflecting projected images as well as allowing the user to see through it, similar to augmented reality technology. OHMD technology has existed since 1997 in various forms, but despite a number of attempts from industry, has yet to be commercialised."
"Various techniques have existed for see-through HMDs. Most of these techniques can be summarized into two main families: ""Curved Mirror"" (or Curved Combiner) based and ""Waveguide"" or ""Light-guide"" based. The curved mirror technique has been used by Vuzix in their Star 1200 product, by Olympus, and by Laster Technologies. Various waveguide techniques have existed for some time. These techniques include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, and reflective optics:"
"Augmented reality systems guru Karl Guttag compared the optics of diffractive waveguides against the competing technology, reflective waveguides."
"Head-mounted displays are not designed to be workstations, and traditional input devices such as keyboards do not support the concept of smart glasses. Input devices that lend themselves to mobility and/or hands-free use are good candidates, for example:"
"In June 1995, MicroOptical was founded by Dr. Mark Spitzer to develop advanced micro-optical devices reduced to the size of integrated circuits. The company was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency through a contract with the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Command for the development of optical micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). In 1997, MicroOptical demonstrated the eyewear display in which the viewing optics were incorporated in the eyeglass lens. The eyeglasses display provided a 320x240 pixel resolution with 8 bit greyscale and a field of view of approximately 8 degrees (horizontal)."
"On 16 June 2003, MicroOptical announced the availability of the SV-6 PC Viewer, the first eyewear-mounted display specifically designed for use with mobile personal computers. It was small, ultra-lightweight and highly ergonomic and could connect to mobile computing devices via a VGA output. Its initial price tag was US$1995. In March 2007, MicroOptical changed its name to MyVu and at CES 2008 it demonstrated the Crystal 701, video eyewear which lets the user watch a large virtual screen from 6 feet away and It featured MyVu's patented SolidOptex® optical system, a VGA (640x480) resolution, a cables that allow the user to connect it to MP4 players, DVD players, camcorders, or gaming systems with composite video output and a battery that provides up to 4 hours of video viewing. In May 2008, the Crystal was launched at Amazon and Best Buy with the price tag of $300."
"However, the company did not survive the 2008 recession, and in 2010 it was dissolved. Its assets, including patents, were sold to Foxconn which then formed subsidiary View Link Technology in Singapore, with the mission to establish a new line of wearable near-eye systems for industrial, medical, and consumer use. In August 2012, Mark Spitzer, formerly a principal scientist at Kopin Corporation and the founder and CEO of MicroOptical/MyVu, was hired by Google as a Director of Operations at Google X. In April 2013, Google acquired several of MicroOptical/MyVu patents from Foxconn, who is in contract with Google to manufacture the Google Glass in Santa Clara, California."
"In 1997, Sony released the Glasstron, an HMD which included two LCD screens and two earphones for video and audio respectively. It also had a mechanical shutter to allow the display to become see through"
"At SID 2008, Sony unveiled a holographic-based see-through eyewear display that shows full-color video images at a transmissivity of 85% and a luminance of 2500 cd/m2. On 14 November 2012 Sony filed a patent for a binocular eyewear display which features a camera, battery packs, a 2D interface and customizable screens by allowing the user to move the lens several millimeters. This recent filing is a continuation on patents filed in 2008 and 2009."
"In September 1998, IBM Japan demonstrated a wearable PC. Its components included a lightweight monocular head-mounted display with a monochrome resolution, headphones for sound and video, a controller / microphone for control and a control unit. It ran Windows 98 and featured a 233 MHz Pentium MMX, 64 MB of RAM, a 340 MB IBM MicroDrive and USB interface. It could be controlled by voice commands or through a hand-held tracker ball. It was intended to be marketed for maintenance, repair and system installation staff by allowing the user to call up information from reference manuals and reference books on the eye level display, keeping their hands free."
"In December 1999, IBM Japan and Olympus Optical demonstrated the PC Eye-Trek, a wearable PC that comprises the IBM-developed small PC unit and a monocular, eyewear display developed by Olympus (in replacement of IBM's monochrome eyewear display). Olympus's eyewear display used a free-shaped prism and a high-performance optical filter to allow it to be lightweight and an optical see-through. It featured a 0.47-inch reflective-field sequential LCD display with 800×600 full-color resolution supplied by Colorado Micro Display and gave the impression of looking at a 10-inch screen from a distance of 20 inches. By using reflective-type LCD, the power consumption was kept to a minimal 1.6 watts. Independently. Olympus showed a prototype finger-set input device. In a demonstration, the index finger movement was assigned as slow cursor movement, an index and middle finger together were assigned as quick cursor movement. When a finger bends quickly, the movement is interpreted as a ""click"". Combined with the PC Eye-Trek, a user can select an icon by just moving and tapping a finger in the air. In 2000, IBM launched the ""Park Bench"" TV commercial, which featured its vision for voice-activated wearable PCs."
"At CEATEC 2010, NTT DoCoMo demonstrated the AR Walker, an augmented reality glasses which were developed by Olympus in 2008."
"On 5 July 2012 Olympus announced the MEG4.0, a Monocular eyewear display that contains a QVGA (320 x 240) resolution display and can connect to devices through Bluetooth 2.1. No announcements regarding the launch date or the price were made."
"In 1998, the Israeli company Mirage Innovations was founded by Yair David and Yariv Ben-Yehuda. In 2001, the company R&D team transferred multicolor still images by diffractive planar optics and developed monocular displays. In February 2001 the company started negotiating with Nokia to develop the technology for use in Nokia's mobile phones and other mobile devices, but in September 2003 Nokia broke off the discussions. In September 2007, Mirage discovered that Nokia had filed three patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for technology that Mirage developed by itself or helped Nokia develop. The company tried to settle the matter but Nokia responded by accusing the company of infringement. Following Nokia's threat, Mirage was unable to secure key financing and was shut down in early 2008."
"At Nokia World 2009, Nokia Research Center demonstrated an optical see-through eyewear display. It included eye-tracking capabilities, thus allowing the user to navigate and control the glasses just but focusing on the images or looking up or down. On 21 October 2011, Vuzix announced that it has entered into a technology license agreement with Nokia to develop and produce see-through waveguide optics for use in eyewear displays based on Nokia's proprietary see-through (Exit Pupil Expanding) EPE optics technology. At CES 2012, Vuzix demonstrated the SMART Glasses, a see-through eyewear display technology based on integrated HD display engines and waveguide optics that were licensed from Nokia. Vuzix also announced plans for a line of both monocular and binocular SMART Glasses with integrated head tracking and options for multiple camera technologies for the commercial, industrial and consumer market."
"In June 1997, DigiLens was founded by Jonathan D. Waldern with the mission to develop and market Switchable Bragg Grating nano-composite materials for the optical telecommunication and wireless microdisplay markets. On 11 January 2000, the company demonstrated the DL40, a compact, lightweight monocular eyewear display with a see-through and RGB color capabilities based on holographic polymer-dispersed liquid crystals technology. Later DigiLens changed its business model to focus its R&D on fibernet switching chips rather than HMDs. In October 2003, DigiLens was acquired by SBG Labs. Nowadays SBG Labs produces head-up displays based on their switchable waveguide technology for the United States Army and the People's Liberation Army. It also develops the VIRTUALITY HMEyetrack, a binocular see-through eyewear display."
"In 2000, the Israeli company Lumus was founded by Dr. Yaakov Amitai to develop and market its Light-guide Optical Element (LOE) technology for eyewear displays (see-through wearable displays). The LOE is a patented optical waveguide that makes use of multiple partial reflectors embedded in a single substrate to reflect a virtual image into the eye of the wearer. Specifically, the image is coupled into the LOE by a ""Pod"" (micro-display projector) that sits at the edge of the waveguide—in an eyeglass configuration, this is embedded in the temple of the glasses. The image travels through total internal reflection to the multiple array of partial reflectors and are reflected to the eye. While each partial reflector shows only a portion of the image, the optics are such that the wearer sees the combined array and perceives it as a single uniform image projected at infinity."
"The transparent display enables a virtual image to be seamlessly overlaid over the wearer's real world view. This is especially true when the source image comprises a black background with light color wording or symbology being displayed. Black is essentially see-through color, while lighter colored objects, symbols or characters appear to float in the wearer's line of sight. Conversely, full-screen images like documents, internet pages, movies which are typically brighter colors can be displayed to look like a large virtual image floating a few meter's away from the wearer."
"After years of R&D and building its patent portfolio, the company started officially selling product in 2008 with the PD-18: a top-down, transparent monocular display with SVGA resolution 32 degree FoV, and full color. The PD-18 and its derivative, the PD-14, were aimed at professional and military markets. In 2010 Lumus' technology received high-level validation when the US Air Force selected Gentex's Scorpion Helmet Mounted Cueing System (which employs the Lumus PD-14), with Raytheon as the primary contractor, for the HMIT program for A-10 and F-16 Aircraft. This display and contract win marked the first time a full-color HMD was selected for combat aviation."
"Subsequently, Lumus' display as part of Thales Visionix's (formerly Gentex) Helmet Mounted Cueing System has been selected for the CHMDS / Air Soldier program. Once the roll out has been completed on this program, Lumus displays will represent the majority of HMDs deployed in the worldwide combat aviation market."
"Lumus also has been working behind the scenes for years with a handful of Tier 1 consumer electronics manufacturers and tech companies. The company aims to be the Intel or the Qualcomm of the wearable display market—selling its optical engine modules as OEM components, while the Tier 1 companies will make the final products. Lumus is very quiet on its activities in this space citing confidentiality limitations, and barring rare trade show appearances (CES 2014,2012,2008, 2007, and a couple SID shows) the company exerts minimal marketing effort. Furthermore, Lumus' sparse website only shows a portion of its offerings to the consumer market. Other products or optical engine modules it makes for OEM customers will remain veiled until such customers launch their Lumus-based products."
"In 2002, Microvision launched the Nomad Personal Display System, a head-worn, monochrome red, see-through virtual retinal display and in March 2004 it introduced the Nomad Expert Technician System, which was about 40% smaller, lighter, and costs less to manufacture than the prior version. However, following the poor ergonomics and eye strain of its products, the company decided to discount the product line in 2006."
"During the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, there were major disagreements on the treatment of ex-Confederates and of former slaves, or freedmen. Johnson broke with the Radical Republicans and formed a loose alliance with moderate Republicans and Democrats. A showdown came in the Congressional elections of 1866, in which the Radicals won a sweeping victory and took full control of Reconstruction, passing key laws over the veto. Johnson was impeached by the House, but acquitted by the Senate."
"With the election of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, the Radicals had control of Congress, the party and the army and attempted to build a solid Republican base in the South using the votes of Freedmen, Scalawags and Carpetbaggers, supported directly by U.S. Army detachments. Republicans all across the South formed local clubs called Union Leagues that effectively mobilized the voters, discussed issues and when necessary fought off Ku Klux Klan (KKK) attacks. Thousands died on both sides."
"Grant supported radical reconstruction programs in the South, the Fourteenth Amendment and equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen. Most of all he was the hero of the war veterans, who marched to his tune. The party had become so large that factionalism was inevitable; it was hastened by Grant's tolerance of high levels of corruption typified by the Whiskey Ring."
"Many of the founders of the GOP joined the liberal movement, as did many powerful newspaper editors. They nominated Horace Greeley for President, who also gained the Democratic nomination, but the ticket was defeated in a landslide. The depression of 1873 energized the Democrats. They won control of the House and formed ""Redeemer"" coalitions which recaptured control of each southern state, in some cases using threats and violence."
"Reconstruction came to an end when the contested election of 1876 was awarded by a special electoral commission to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, who promised through the unofficial Compromise of 1877 to withdraw federal troops from control of the last three southern states. The region then became the Solid South, giving overwhelming majorities of its electoral votes and Congressional seats to the Democrats through 1964."
"In terms of racial issues, Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins argues that in Alabama: White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican Party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically."
"Social pressure eventually forced most Scalawags to join the conservative/Democratic Redeemer coalition. A minority persisted and, starting in the 1870s, formed the ""tan"" half of the ""Black and Tan"" Republican Party, a minority in every Southern state after 1877. This divided the party into two factions: the lily-white faction, which was practically all-white; and the biracial black-and-tan faction."
"In several Southern states, the ""Lily Whites"", who sought to recruit white Democrats to the Republican Party, attempted to purge the Black and Tan faction or at least to reduce its influence. Among such ""Lily White"" leaders in the early 20th century, Arkansas' Wallace Townsend was the party's gubernatorial nominee in 1916 and 1920 and its veteran national GOP committeeman. The factionalism flared up in 1928 and 1952. The final victory of its opponent the lily-white faction came in 1964."
"The party split into factions in the late 1870s. The Stalwarts, followers of Senator Roscoe Conkling, defended the spoils system. The Half-Breeds, who followed Senator James G. Blaine of Maine, pushed for reform of the Civil service. Independents who opposed the spoils system altogether were called ""Mugwumps"". In 1884, Mugwumps rejected James G. Blaine as corrupt and helped elect Democrat Grover Cleveland, though most returned to the party by 1888."
"As the Northern post-war economy boomed with industry, railroads, mines and fast-growing cities as well as prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to keep the fast growth going. The Democratic Party was largely controlled by pro-business Bourbon Democrats until 1896. The GOP supported big business generally, the gold standard, high tariffs and generous pensions for Union veterans. However, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself."
"Foreign affairs seldom became partisan issues (except for the annexation of Hawaii, which Republicans favored and Democrats opposed). Much more salient were cultural issues. The GOP supported the pietistic Protestants (especially the Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Scandinavian Lutherans) who demanded prohibition. That angered wet Republicans, especially German Americans, who broke ranks in 1890–1892, handing power to the Democrats."
"Demographic trends aided the Democrats, as the German and Irish Catholic immigrants were mostly Democrats and outnumbered the British and Scandinavian Republicans. During the 1880s, elections were remarkably close. The Democrats usually lost, but won in 1884 and 1892. In the 1894 Congressional elections, the GOP scored the biggest landslide in its history as Democrats were blamed for the severe economic depression 1893–1897 and the violent coal and railroad strikes of 1894."
"From 1860 to 1912, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with ""Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion"". Rum stood for the liquor interests and the tavernkeepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element. ""Romanism"" meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in every big city and whom the Republicans denounced for political corruption. ""Rebellion"" stood for the Democrats of the Confederacy, who tried to break the Union in 1861; and the Democrats in the North, called ""Copperheads"", who sympathized with them."
"Demographic trends aided the Democrats, as the German and Irish Catholic immigrants were Democrats and outnumbered the English and Scandinavian Republicans. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Republicans struggled against the Democrats' efforts, winning several close elections and losing two to Grover Cleveland (in 1884 and 1892)."
"Religious lines were sharply drawn. Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other pietists in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats more bottom-heavy."
"Cultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants (Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Disciples of Christ) who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking."
"Liturgical churches (Roman Catholics, German Lutherans and Episcopalians) comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of the morality business. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade as national prohibition was finally passed in 1919 (repealed in 1933), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP."
The election of William McKinley in 1896 marked a resurgence of Republican dominance and is cited as a realigning election.
"The Progressive Era (or ""Fourth Party System"") was dominated by Republican Presidents, with the sole exception of Democrat Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921). McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the Panic of 1893 and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit. He denounced William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee, as a dangerous radical whose plans for ""Free Silver"" at 16–1 (or Bimetallism) would bankrupt the economy."
"McKinley relied heavily on finance, railroads, industry and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans as the party of business. His campaign manager, Ohio's Mark Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. This emphasis on business was in part mitigated by Theodore Roosevelt, the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in trust-busting. McKinley was the first President to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups."
"Theodore Roosevelt, who became President in 1901, had the most dynamic personality of the era. Roosevelt had to contend with men like Senator Mark Hanna, whom he outmaneuvered to gain control of the convention in 1904 that renominated him and he won after promising to continue McKinley's policies. More difficult to handle was conservative House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon."
"Roosevelt achieved modest legislative gains in terms of railroad legislation and pure food laws. He was more successful in Court, bringing antitrust suits that broke up the Northern Securities Company trust and Standard Oil. Roosevelt moved to the left in his last two years in office, but was unable to pass major Square Deal proposals. He did succeed in naming his successor Secretary of War William Howard Taft who easily defeated Bryan again in the 1908 presidential election."
"By 1907, Roosevelt identified himself with the left-center of the Republican Party. He explained his balancing act:"
"The tariff issue was pulling the GOP apart. Roosevelt tried to postpone the issue, but Taft had to meet it head on in 1909 with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act. Eastern conservatives led by Nelson W. Aldrich wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods (especially woolens), while Midwesterners called for low tariffs. Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by George Norris revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened."
"In 1912, Roosevelt broke with Taft, rejected La Follette, and tried for a third term, but he was outmaneuvered by Taft and lost the nomination. Roosevelt led his delegates out of the convention and created a new party (the Progressive, or ""Bull Moose"" ticket), in the election of 1912. Few party leaders followed him except Hiram Johnson of California. Roosevelt had the support of many notable women reformers, including Jane Addams. The Roosevelt-caused split in the Republican vote resulted in a decisive victory for Democrat Woodrow Wilson, temporarily interrupting the Republican era."
"The Republicans welcomed the Progressive Era at the state and local level. The first important reform mayor was Hazen S. Pingree of Detroit (1890–1897), who was elected governor of Michigan in 1896. In New York City, the Republicans joined nonpartisan reformers to battle Tammany Hall and elected Seth Low (1902–1903). Golden Rule Jones was first elected mayor of Toledo as a Republican in 1897, but was reelected as an independent when his party refused to renominate him. Many Republican civic leaders, following the example of Mark Hanna, were active in the National Civic Federation, which promoted urban reforms and sought to avoid wasteful strikes."
"The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s, running on a platform of opposition to the League of Nations, high tariffs, and promotion of business interests. Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were resoundingly elected in 1920, 1924 and 1928, respectively. The breakaway efforts of Senator Robert La Follette in 1924 failed to stop a landslide for Coolidge and his movement fell apart. The Teapot Dome Scandal threatened to hurt the party, but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him as the opposition splintered in 1924."
"The pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity—until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded the Great Depression. Although the party did very well in large cities and among ethnic Catholics in presidential elections of 1920–1924, it was unable to hold those gains in 1928. By 1932, the cities—for the first time ever—had become Democratic strongholds."
"Hoover was by nature an activist and attempted to do what he could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the Depression, but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government. The Depression cost Hoover the presidency with the 1932 landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican Dwight Eisenhower. The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections, giving them congressional parity (though not control) for the first time since Woodrow Wilson's presidency."
"Historian George H. Nash argues: Unlike the ""moderate,"" internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the ""Roosevelt Revolution"" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anticollectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and ""me-too"" Republicans from within."
"The Old Right emerged in opposition to the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hoff says that ""moderate Republicans and leftover Republican Progressives like Hoover composed the bulk of the Old Right by 1940, with a sprinkling of former members of the Farmer-Labor party, Non-Partisan League, and even a few midwestern prairie Socialists""."
"After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress at lightning speed. In the 1934 midterm elections, ten Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives was also split in a similar ratio. The ""Second New Deal"" was heavily criticized by the Republicans in Congress, who likened it to class warfare and socialism. The volume of legislation, as well as the inability of the Republicans to block it, soon made the opposition to Roosevelt develop into bitterness and sometimes hatred for ""that man in the White House"". Former President Hoover became a leading orator crusading against the New Deal, hoping unrealistically to be nominated again for President."
"Most major newspaper publishers favored Republican moderate Alf Landon for President. In the nation's 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed Landon represented 70% of the circulation, while Roosevelt won 69% of the actual voters in those cities, ignoring the press and using the radio to reach voters directly."
"Roosevelt carried 46 of the 48 states thanks to traditional Democrats along with newly energized labor unions, city machines and the WPA. The realignment creating the Fifth Party System was firmly in place. Since 1928, the GOP had lost 178 House seats, 40 Senate seats and 19 governorships, though it retained a mere 89 seats in the House and 16 in the Senate."
"The black vote held for Hoover in 1932, but started moving toward Roosevelt. By 1940, the majority of northern blacks were voting Democratic. Roosevelt made sure blacks had a share in relief programs, the wartime Army and wartime defense industry, but did not challenge segregation or the denial of voting rights in the South."
"Minority parties tend to factionalize and after 1936 the GOP split into a conservative faction (dominant in the West and Midwest) and a liberal faction (dominant in the Northeast)—combined with a residual base of inherited progressive Republicanism active throughout the century. In 1936, Kansas governor Alf Landon and his young followers defeated the Herbert Hoover faction. Landon generally supported most New Deal programs, but carried only two states in the Roosevelt landslide with his moderate campaign. The GOP was left with only 16 senators and 88 representatives to oppose the New Deal, with Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as the sole victor over a Democratic incumbent."
"Roosevelt alienated many conservative Democrats in 1937 by his unexpected plan to ""pack"" the Supreme Court via the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. Following a sharp recession that hit early in 1938, major strikes all over the country, the CIO and AFL competing with each other for membership and Roosevelt's failed efforts to radically reorganize the Supreme Court, the Democrats were in disarray. Meanwhile, the GOP was united as they had shed their weakest members in a series of defeats since 1930. Re-energized Republicans focused attention on strong fresh candidates in major states, especially Robert A. Taft the conservative from Ohio, Earl Warren the moderate who won both the Republicans and the Democratic primaries in California and Thomas E. Dewey the crusading prosecutor from New York. The GOP comeback in 1938 was made possible by carrying 50% of the vote outside the South, giving GOP leaders confidence it had a strong base for the 1940 presidential election."
"The GOP gained 75 House seats in 1938, but were still a minority. Conservative Democrats, mostly from the South, joined with Republicans led by Senator Robert A. Taft to create the conservative coalition, which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964."
"From 1939 through 1941, there was a sharp debate within the GOP about support for Britain in World War II. Internationalists, such as Henry Stimson and Frank Knox, wanted to support Britain and isolationists, such as Robert A. Taft and Arthur Vandenberg, strongly opposed these moves as unwise, if not unconstitutional. The America First movement was a bipartisan coalition of isolationists. In 1940, a total unknown Wendell Willkie at the last minute won over the party, the delegates and was nominated. He crusaded against the inefficiencies of the New Deal and Roosevelt's break with the strong tradition against a third term."
"The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 ended the isolationist-internationalist debate. The Republicans further cut the Democratic majority in the 1942 midterm elections. With wartime production creating prosperity, the conservative coalition terminated most New Deal relief programs."
"Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio represented the wing of the party that continued to oppose New Deal reforms and continued to champion non-interventionism. Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, represented the Northeastern wing of the party. Dewey did not reject the New Deal programs, but demanded more efficiency, more support for economic growth and less corruption. He was more willing than Taft to support Britain in 1939–1940. After the war the isolationists wing strenuously opposed the United Nations and was half-hearted in opposition to world communism."
"As a minority party, the GOP had two wings: The left-wing supported most of the New Deal while promising to run it more efficiently and the right-wing opposed the New Deal from the beginning and managed to repeal large parts during the 1940s in cooperation with conservative Southern Democrats in the conservative coalition. Liberals, led by Dewey, dominated the Northeast while conservatives, led by Taft, dominated the Midwest. The West was split and the South was still solidly Democratic."
"In 1944, a clearly frail Roosevelt defeated Dewey for his fourth consecutive term, but Dewey made a good showing that would lead to his selection as the candidate in 1948."
"Roosevelt died in April 1945 and Harry S. Truman, a less liberal Democrat became President and replaced most of Roosevelt's top appointees. With the end of the war, unrest among organized labor led to many strikes in 1946 and the resulting disruptions helped the GOP. With the blunders of the Truman administration in 1945 and 1946, the slogans ""Had Enough?"" and ""To Err is Truman"" became Republican rallying cries and the GOP won control of Congress for the first time since 1928, with Joseph William Martin, Jr. as Speaker of the House. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 was designed to balance the rights of management and labor. It was the central issue of many elections in industrial states in the 1940s to 1950s, but the unions were never able to repeal it."
"In 1948, with Republicans split left and right, Truman boldly called Congress into a special session and sent it a load of liberal legislation consistent with the Dewey platform and dared them to act on it, knowing that the conservative Republicans would block action. Truman then attacked the Republican ""Do-Nothing Congress"" as a whipping boy for all of the nation's problems. Truman stunned Dewey and the Republicans in the election with a plurality of just over twenty-four million popular votes (out of nearly 49 million cast), but a decisive 303–189 victory in the Electoral College."
"Before Reconstruction and for a century thereafter, the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party's dominance in the Southern states was so strong that the region was called the Solid South. The Republicans controlled certain parts of the Appalachian Mountains and they sometimes did compete for statewide office in the border states."
"Before 1948, the Southern Democrats saw their party as the defender of the Southern way of life, which included a respect for states' rights and an appreciation for traditional southern values. They repeatedly warned against the aggressive designs of Northern liberals and Republicans as well as the civil rights activists they denounced as ""outside agitators"", thus there was a serious barrier to becoming a Republican."
"In 1948, Democrats alienated white Southerners in two ways. The Democratic National Convention adopted a strong civil rights plank, leading to a walkout by Southerners. Two weeks later, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981 ending discrimination against Blacks in the armed forces. In 1948, the Deep South walked out, formed a temporary regional party and nominated J. Strom Thurmond. Thurmond carried the Deep South, but the outer South stayed with Truman and most ""Dixiecrats"" returned to the Democratic Party, and there were no permanent membership losses."
"In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist allied with the Dewey wing, was drafted as a GOP candidate by a small group of Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. in order that he challenge Taft on foreign policy issues. The two men were not far apart on domestic issues. Eisenhower's victory broke a twenty-year Democratic lock on the White House. Eisenhower did not try to roll back the New Deal, but he did expand the Social Security system and built the Interstate Highway System."
"After 1945, the isolationists in the conservative wing opposed the United Nations and were half-hearted in opposition to the expansion of communism around the world. A garrison state to fight communism, they believed, would mean regimentation and government controls at home. Eisenhower, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force Commander, defeated Taft in 1952 on foreign policy issues."
"To circumvent the local Republican Party apparatus mostly controlled by Taft supporters, the Eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grass-roots clubs, ""Citizens for Eisenhower"". Independents and Democrats were welcome, as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings. Citizens for Eisenhower hoped to revitalize the GOP by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting moderate and internationalist policies. It did not endorse candidates other than Eisenhower, but he paid it little attention after he won and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum. Instead the conservative Republicans became energized, leading to the Barry Goldwater nomination of 1964. Long-time Republican activists viewed the newcomers with suspicion and hostility. More significantly, activism in support of Eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause."
"Once in office, Eisenhower was not an effective party leader and Nixon increasingly took that role. Historian David Reinhard concludes that Eisenhower lacked sustained political commitment, refused to intervene in state politics, failed to understand the political uses of presidential patronage and overestimated his personal powers of persuasion and conciliation. Eisenhower's attempt in 1956 to convert the GOP to ""Modern Republicanism"" was his ""grandest flop"". It was a vague proposal with weak staffing and little financing or publicity that caused turmoil inside the local parties across the country. The GOP carried both houses of Congress in 1952 on Eisenhower's coattails, but in 1954 lost both and would not regain the Senate until 1980 nor the House until 1994. The problem, says Reinhard, was the ""voters liked Ike—but not the GOP""."
"Eisenhower was an exception to most Presidents in that he usually let Vice President Richard Nixon handle party affairs (controlling the national committee and taking the roles of chief spokesman and chief fundraiser). Nixon was narrowly defeated by John F. Kennedy in the 1960 United States presidential election, weakening his moderate wing of the party."
"Conservatives made a comeback in 1964 under the leadership of Barry Goldwater, who defeated moderates and liberals such as Nelson Rockefeller and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. in the Republican presidential primaries that year. Goldwater was strongly opposed to the New Deal and the United Nations, but rejected isolationism and containment, calling for an aggressive anti-communist foreign policy. In the presidential election of 1964, he was defeated by Lyndon Johnson in a landslide that brought down many senior Republican congressmen across the country. Goldwater won five states in the deep South, the strongest showing by a Republican presidential candidate in the South since 1872."
"By 1964, the Democratic lock on the South remained strong, but cracks began to appear. Strom Thurmond was the most prominent Democrat to switch to the Republican Party. One long-term cause was that the region was becoming more like the rest of the nation and could not long stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Modernization brought factories, businesses and larger cities as well as millions of migrants from the North, as far more people graduated from high school and college. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco basis of the traditional South faded away as former farmers moved to town or commuted to factory jobs. Segregation, requiring separate dining and lodging arrangements for employees, was a serious obstacle to business development."
"The highly visible immediate cause of the political transition involved civil rights. The civil rights movement caused enormous controversy in the white South with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors Orval Faubus of Arkansas, Lester Maddox of Georgia, Ross Barnett of Mississippi and, especially George Wallace of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and supported segregation."
"After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most Southerners accepted the integration of most institutions (except public schools). With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed, Southerners joined the new middle class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues. In 1963, the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African-American voters from the Democratic primaries, which had been the only elections that mattered in most of the South. Meanwhile, the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85–90% level, a shift which further convinced many white segregationists that the Republicans were no longer the black party."
"The New Deal Coalition collapsed in the mid-1960s in the face of urban riots, the Vietnam War, the opposition of many Southern Democrats to desegregation and the Civil Rights Movement and disillusionment that the New Deal could be revived by Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Nixon defeated both Hubert Humphrey and George C. Wallace in 1968. When the Democratic left took over their party in 1972, Nixon won reelection by carrying 49 states."
"Nixon's involvement in Watergate brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any long-term movement toward the GOP was interrupted by the scandal. Nixon's unelected vice president, Gerald Ford, succeeded him and gave him a full pardon, giving Democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 off-year elections. Ford never fully recovered. In 1976, he barely defeated Ronald Reagan for the nomination. First Lady Betty Ford was notable for her liberal positions on social issues and for her work on breast cancer awareness following her mastectomy in 1974. The taint of Watergate and the nation's economic difficulties contributed to the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976."
"Ronald Reagan was elected President in the 1980 election by a landslide vote, not predicted by most voter polling. Running on a ""Peace Through Strength"" platform to combat the communist threat and massive tax cuts to revitalize the economy, Reagan's strong persona proved too much for Carter. Reagan's election also gave Republicans control of the Senate for the first time in decades."
"Ronald Reagan produced a major realignment with his 1980 and 1984 landslides. In 1980, the Reagan coalition was possible because of Democratic losses in most social-economic groups. In 1984, Reagan won nearly 60% of the popular vote and carried every state except his Democratic opponent Walter Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia, creating a record 525 electoral vote total (out of 538 possible votes). Even in Minnesota, Mondale won by a mere 3,761 votes, meaning Reagan came within less than 3,800 votes of winning in all fifty states."
"Political commentators, trying to explain how Reagan had won by such a large margin, coined the term ""Reagan Democrat"" to describe a Democratic voter who had voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 (as well as for George H. W. Bush in 1988), producing their landslide victories. They were mostly white, blue-collar and were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism on issues such as abortion and to his hawkish foreign policy. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as being a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans and social liberals."
"Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue: ""The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s""."
"Reagan reoriented American politics and claimed credit in 1984 for an economic renewal—""It's morning again in America!"" was the successful campaign slogan. Income taxes were slashed 25% and the upper tax rates abolished. The frustrations of stagflation were resolved under the new monetary policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as no longer did soaring inflation and recession pull the country down. Working again in bipartisan fashion, the Social Security financial crises were resolved for the next 25 years."
"After Doomdark the Witchking was destroyed in the first game, word reaches his daughter, Shareth the Heartstealer, the dreaded Empress of the Frozen Empire of Icemark who is as evil as she is beautiful and powerful. Enraged by the news, she decides to take revenge on the chief architect of her father's downfall, Luxor the Moonprince, by bewitching and kidnapping his son Morkin. The game revolves around Luxor and his companions Rorthron the Wise and Morkin's beloved Tarithel the Fey, and their attempts to rescue Morkin and defeat Shareth."
"Canoncially, Tarithel found Morkin and broke Shareth's spell with a single kiss. Shareth's armies have been defeated and she herself has been slain in the great final battle. However, Shareth's and Morkin's union has created a son named Anderlane, who was later born from a surrogate mother."
"The game's publisher Beyond Software offered a prize—models of the major characters in an Icemark setting—to the first player who revealed the ""Watchwords of Midnight"", an inscription on Luxor's Moon Ring that would be shown upon ultimate victory. The conditions for this to happen was if the player could bring all the major characters including Morkin to the Gate of Varenorn and eliminate Shareth. The first to do so was then-15-year-old Richard Harris from Lowestoft in November 1984. Harris, however, had to wait for the models for 14 months—until January 1986—because the publisher had not expected anyone to ""finish the game so quickly""."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" was adapted into a ""Fighting Fantasy""-style gamebook type game by Beyond Software's Clive Bailey and Terry Pratt that was serialized in three parts in ""Computer and Video Games"" magazine. The first part, published in the December 1984 issue, follows Luxor to the Frozen Gates that lead into Icemark. In the second part, Tarithel makes her way through Icemark to the pit of Alazorne, where Morkin is held captive. In the final part, the freed Morkin sets on his own quest to find and kill the evil Shareth."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" was very well received by game critics and public alike. ""Amstrad Action"" gave it a review score of 95%, making it their ninth best game of all time. In 1993, readers of ""Your Sinclair"" voted it the 71st best game of all time."
"Originally the series was conceived as a trilogy, with the third part titled ""The Eye of the Moon"". The sequel is even mentioned in the game's manual: ""The third part of the trilogy, possibly the most exciting yet, is still to come, when Mike will send Morkin down to the warmer lands which lie below Midnight itself, to find the Eye of the Moon."" The Eye of the Moon was to be a magical crystal, or jewel, that allowed its owner to look into the future. According to Singleton ""Luxor is dying, it's some years on and he's reached the end of his tether, and he wants to see what is going to happen to Midnight in the future. So Morkin goes off in search of the magical jewel called the Eye of the Moon which enables people to see into the future, so that Luxor can then rest in peace."" Some of Singleton's plans included a game canvas four times bigger than the original ""Lords of Midnight"", divided into twelve kingdoms set south-west of the original game, dynamic full-color graphics with black masking to hide any color clashes, unique graphics for all castles, unique, generated, full-scale facial graphics for all characters, a more convincing name generator, interior scenes of keeps and citadels, et cetera. There were even tentative plans to implement a multiplayer mode, using the already existing mic/ear sockets to exchange data. Despite having already created a substantial amount of new game code, Singleton was involved in numerous other game projects at the time and thus put the game on hiatus."
"In a July 1985 article published in July 1985 in ""Computer Gamer"", Singleton disclosed quite a lot of details of the game. The game was to have 16,000 locations and 131,000 unique views, created with a new technique called Randscaping. The Randscaping engine made every view unique. In multiplayer mode, the two players would each control either Morkin or Tarithel on their quest to find the fabled jewel. His new Midnight Identikit could create personalized faces for all the 256 NPCs roaming the canvas. Some of the NPCs were to have unique capabilities; for instance, one character would have the magic ability to flatten mountains, and was to be a critical recruitment for one of the mini-quests, allowing the player access beyond an impassable mountain range to retrieve an item. Another NPC could control the weather, and so on. At the start of the game, the player(s) would only be able to control Morkin and Tarithel, recruiting more characters to their cause as the game progresses. The recruited characters could be made part of teams headed by a character chosen by the player, making moving the characters around the playing field a lot easier. The last attempt by Singleton to get the game released was in April 1989."
"Today there exists no authentic material for ""The Eye of the Moon"". Some presentation mock-ups were created by programmer Singleton; all still available screenshots—if any—are from these faked mock-ups. While the most serious intention of both Singleton and publisher Domark indeed ""was"" to create this third part, the sequel was later indefinitely shelved, partly due to Mike Singleton's other commitments and partly due to the original publisher being bought out by Telecomsoft. Because of this, the new management wanted to change the terms of agreement, demanding two distinct versions of the game—8-bit and 16-bit versions—instead of one. Singleton refused the new agreement. ""The Eye of the Moon"" has since been mentioned for a possible upcoming release. With Mike Singleton again involved, a significant amount of work had already taken place. However, with the death of creator Singleton, all developments on the possible sequel have ceased, with the consensus that ""it shall always remain a myth or a legend"". ""Doomdark's Revenge"" would, however, be followed many years later by another sequel, """"."
= = = Public records = = =
Public records are documents or pieces of information that are not considered confidential and generally pertain to the conduct of government.
"For example, in California, when a couple fills out a marriage license application, they have the option of checking the box as to whether the marriage is ""confidential"" (Record will be closed, and not opened to public once recorded) or ""public"" (record will become public record once recorded). Essentially, if the marriage record is public, a copy of the record can be ordered from the county in which the marriage occurred."
"Since the earliest organised societies, with taxation, disputes, and so on, records of some sort have been needed. In ancient Babylon records were kept in cuneiform writing on clay tablets. In the Inca empire of South America, which did not have writing, records were kept via an elaborate form of knots in cords, quipu, whose meaning has been lost."
"In Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages public records included census records as well as records of birth, death, and marriage; an example is the 1086 ""Domesday Book"" of William the Conqueror. The details of royal marriage agreements, which were effectively international treaties, were also recorded. The United Kingdom Public Record Office Act, which formalised record-keeping by setting up the Public Record Office, was passed in 1838."
"Although public records are records of public business, they are not necessarily available without restriction, although Freedom of Information legislation (FOI) that has been gradually introduced in many jurisdictions since the 1960s has made access easier. Each government has policies and regulations that govern the availability of information contained in public records. A common restriction is that data about a person is not normally available to others; for example, the California Public Records Act (PRA) states that ""except for certain explicit exceptions, personal information maintained about an individual may not be disclosed without the person's consent""."
"In the United Kingdom, Cabinet papers were subject to the thirty-year rule: until the introduction of FOI legislation, Cabinet papers were not available for thirty years; some information could be withheld for longer. the rule still applies to some information, such as minutes of Cabinet meetings."
"Some companies provide access, for a fee, to many public records available on the Internet. Many of them specialize in particular types of information, while some offer access to different types of record, typically to professionals in various fields. Some companies sell software with a promise of unlimited access to public records, but may provide nothing more than basic information on how to access already available and generally free public websites."
"Each year news media, civic groups, libraries, nonprofits, schools and others interested groups sponsor ""Sunshine Week."" Sunshine Week occurs in mid-March, coinciding with James Madison's birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th. The purpose of the week is to highlight the idea that ""government functions best when it operates in the open."""
"In many states, state legislatures are often exempt from public-records laws that apply to state executive officials and local officials. In 2016, the Associated Press made a request for the emails and daily schedules of state legislative leaders (speakers of state Houses and presidents of state Senates) in all 50 states; a majority denied the request."
"Of particular significance was the evolution of the common-law right ""to access court records to inspect and to copy"". The expectation inherent in the common law right to access court records is that any person may come to the office of the clerk of the court during business hours and request to inspect court records, with almost instantaneous access. Such right is a central safeguard of the integrity of the courts. Any decision to conceal court records requires a sealing order. The right to access court records is also central to liberty: There is no conceivable way to exercise the Habeas Corpus right, deemed by the late Justice Brennan as ""the cornerstone"" of the United States Constitution, absent access to court records as public records."
"In the United States the common law right to ""access court records to inspect and to copy"" was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in ""Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc"" (1978), where the court found various parts of the right to access court records as inherent to the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In the United States access to court records is governed by Civil Rights in the Amendments to the United States Constitution, not by the Freedom of Information Act."
"As court records become increasingly more accessible online, concerns about the undermining of private information has become a significant issue. In the past, obtaining court records required people to physically go to a courthouse and request documents, making privacy concerns essentially obsolete. However, with the relative ease at which people can now access these records, highly sensitive information (i.e. victim names, social security numbers, etc.) are at risk of being publicly exploited."
"Access to U.S. national public records is guided by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Requests for access to records pursuant to FOIA may be refused by federal agencies if information requested is subject to exemption, or some information may be redacted (deleted)."
"In addition to the national FOIA, all states have some form of FOI legislation. For example, Colorado has the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA); in New Jersey the law is known as the Open Public Records Act (OPRA)."
"There are many degrees of accessibility to public records between states, with some making it fairly easy to request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to public records requests is New York, which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests. A state that was fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is Pennsylvania, where the law formerly presumed that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise. This was changed by a 2008 bill that went into effect in 2009.. The California Public Records Act (""California Government Code"" §§6250-6276.48) covers the arrest and booking records of inmates in the State of California jails and prisons, which are not covered by First Amendment rights (freedom of speech and of the press). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty."
"With the advent of the Internet and the information age, access to public records in the United States to anyone who wishes to view them has dramatically increased. Third parties such as the information broker industry make regular use of public records to compile readily accessible profiles on millions of people, and may make a profit from the service of recompiling and mining the data."
"Public record data is used for multiple purposes, such as ensuring that child support payments are made as determined by the courts, assisting credit bureaus in keeping accurate data and helping to pay pension benefits to retirees."
"Individual criminal histories are generally considered to be public records in the United States and are often accessed via criminal history background checks, but ""access and use of FBI-maintained criminal history record information has been traditionally limited and controlled in large measure to protect the privacy of the individuals to whom the records pertain."" The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes ""fair information-practice requirements by consumer reporting agencies that report public record information, such as criminal history records, for employment purposes,"" and some state consumer-protection laws impose more restrictive regulations."
"According to the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press, in the United States, arrest records ""are generally open to the public unless they concern an active or ongoing investigation. A few states restrict the information that can be obtained from an arrest record, especially when it concerns individuals who were never charged, were acquitted or had their records expunged. Again, the determination will often result in a balancing test comparing the public's interest in disclosure against the individual privacy interest."" By contrast, protective custody and juvenile delinquency records are exempted from most state open-records laws, such that access is ""limited to the juvenile, his or her parents or guardians, or other parties directly involved in a legal matter."""
"In early 2018, the National Archives put up a webpage, ""Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records,"" to publish all instances of investigations into possible unauthorized destruction of records."
"They reflect Colombo's main goal, variability."
"His futuristic designs were integrated micro-living-worlds. His ""Visiona-Livingroom of the future"" was exhibited at the Visiona-Exhibition of 1969. This room consisted of ""Barbella-like"" space interiors where furniture became structure elements and ""vice versa"". Traditional furniture was replaced by functional elements like the sitting cubes ""Night-Cell"" and ""Central-Living"" as well as the ""Kitchen-Box"", to create a dynamic, multifunctional living space. The kitchen-box (1963), on wheels and measuring 90x75x75cm, containing a two-burner stovetop, oven, grill, refrigerator, cutting board, pull-out worktop, and storage for cookbooks, knives, and other tools, has recently been reissued, slightly enlarged (96 cm(h)x107cmx65cm), manufactured by Boffi Spa."
"For his own apartment Colombo designed the units ""Roto-living"" and ""Cabriolet-Bed"" (both 1969), followed by ""Total Furnishing Unit"", which was presented at the exhibition ""Italy: The Domestic Landscape"" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1972. It presented a complete ""living-machine,"" comprising kitchen, wardrobe, bathroom, and sleeping accommodation, on only 28 square meters."
"His work has been exhibited at museums, among them the Museum of Modern Art in New York.:)"
"In 1964 Colombo received the ""IN-Arch prize"" for his room conception of a hotel in Sardinia (1962–1964). In 1967 and 1968, he was awarded ""ADI"" (Associazione per il Disegno Industriale) prize. In 1970 he received the ""Compasso d'Oro"" award."
= = = Bonny Hicks = = =
"Bonny Susan Hicks (5 January 1968 – 19 December 1997) was a Singapore Eurasian model and writer. After garnering local fame as a model, she gained recognition for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature and the anthropic philosophy conveyed in her works. Her first book, ""Excuse Me, Are You A Model?"", is recognised as a significant milestone in the literary and cultural history of Singapore. Hicks later published a second book, ""Discuss Disgust"", and many shorter pieces in press outlets, including a short-lived opinion column in a major Singaporean daily that was pulled due to public dissent from Singaporean traditionalists."
"Hicks died at age 29 on 19 December 1997 aboard SilkAir Flight 185 when it crashed into the Musi River on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. All 104 passengers aboard the flight died. After Hicks' death, numerous publications including the book ""Heaven Can Wait: Conversations with Bonny Hicks"" by Tal Ben-Shahar featured her life and thought."
"Although Hicks was deemed controversial by many during her lifetime because of her willingness to openly discuss human sexuality, Singaporean literary scholars today deem her voice as a pivotally important one for interpreting contemporary Singaporean society. Hicks' legacy today is one of an important transitional social figure between old and new Singapore during its period of broad-scale societal changes under the forces of globalisation. Her death resulted in the loss of a Singaporean national voice that was both growing and important yet internally conflicted. Criticisms by Singaporean traditionalists during her modelling and authoring careers continually vexed Hicks' conscience and helped drive her to re-evaluate her life. Hicks ultimately made a sustained series of traditionalist choices during the latter years of her life."
"Hicks was born in 1968 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to a British father, Ron Hicks, and a Cantonese-speaking Singaporean-Chinese mother, Betty Soh. Her parents separated shortly after her birth and Soh relocated to Singapore in 1969 with her infant daughter. There, Hicks' formative social environment was multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and included Malays, Indians, and Chinese of various dialect groups. Although Hicks was biracial, she identified as Chinese during her early childhood, speaking Cantonese and watching Chinese-language television at home."
"When Hicks was twelve, her mother accepted a job as a caretaker of a bungalow in Sentosa, Singapore, and they relocated to the island away from a Singaporean Housing and Development Board flat in Toa Payoh. Throughout her teens, Hicks lived with her mother on Sentosa Island, and intermittently with her (grandmother) with whom she enjoyed a particularly close relationship."
"Hicks never met her father. At aged sixteen, she traced his whereabouts through the British High Commission, with whom he was stationed on Singapore during Hicks' conception. Married with children from his new arrangement, and likely keeping his past muffled from his new family, Hicks' father returned word via fax to her that he wanted nothing to do with her. Despite Hicks' superficial joking whenever publicly questioned about it, her father's rejection of her remained deeply hurtful to Hicks throughout her life."
"Hicks' early years were marked by ""few friends"". She stated she made no real friends after age 15—that is, until she met Patricia Chan Li-Yin, a person who would become a pivotally important person to Hicks' life and career. Now a magazine editor and talent agent, Chan had retired from being a Singaporean sports hero, a decorated female swimmer."
"Chan ""discovered"" the nineteen-year-old Bonnie Hicks shortly after Hicks completed her A levels at the Hwa Chong Junior College. Hicks and Chan enjoyed a close, multi-leveled, complicated relationship that was both professional and personal. Hicks referred to Chan as ""Mum"", and some surmised that there was perhaps more to the relationship. Stemming from ambiguous statements Hicks later made in her first book, (e.g., ""I was in love with Pat Chan""), Singaporeans widely speculated whether the two were involved in a lesbian relationship. While the statements in Hicks' book could be interpreted as indicating only an intimate mentoring relationship with Chan, whom Hicks clearly idealized and greatly admired, she continued to be ambiguous on the subject whenever questioned. This created a sense of mystery about herself, and contributed to ongoing buzz and publicity."
"Hicks' modelling career began with the September 1987 cover of a now-defunct Singaporean fashion monthly, ""GO"". She followed this with multiple appearances on other covers, print advertisements, catwalk appearances in designer clothes, and in a music video for a top-10 hit by the Singaporean band The Oddfellows. A year into her modelling career, Hicks began writing about her life experiences and ideas stemming from her modelling. By age twenty-one she had completed her first book, ""Excuse Me, are you a Model?"" She continued to model for five more years and in 1992, at the age of twenty-four, released her second book ""Discuss Disgust"". Hicks then left modelling to take a job as a department lead and copywriter in Jakarta, Indonesia. At the time, Hicks reiterated a statement she had made in her first book: that she had never wanted to be a model in the first place. Instead, her dream since age thirteen had been to be a writer. It was then that she had begun keeping a diary of her feelings and experiences, a practice she continued throughout her life."
"Before her move to Indonesia, Hicks was married briefly to a former member of the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Hicks left him for Richard ""Randy"" Dalrymple, an American architect, by whose side she died aboard SilkAir Flight 185. Hicks' first husband was a former colleague of the pilot of the plane in which Hicks perished. This connection would later become a troubling focus of the investigation into the crash that took Hicks' life."
"Hicks published her first work"" Excuse Me, Are You a Model?"" in Singapore in 1990. The book is her autobiographical exposé of the modelling and fashion world and contains frequent, candid discussion about her sexuality, a subject that was not traditionally broached in Singaporean society at the time. The work stirred significant controversy among Singaporeans who held traditional literary and moral standards. Traditionalists considered Hick's work a ""kiss and tell"" book that disclosed ""too much too soon"" from an independent woman still in her early twenties. Singaporean youth, on the other hand, had a starkly different view; twelve thousand copies were sold within two weeks, prompting the book's publisher to boast Hicks' work as ""the biggest book sensation in the annals of Singapore publishing""--an accurate claim."
"During the years leading up to her death, Singaporean English literature scholars had begun to recognise more than just a simple generational divide in the reactions to Hicks' book, and were describing it as ""an important work"" in the confessional mode of the genre of post-colonial literature. Well before Hick's book was deemed ""a significant milestone in Singapore's literary and cultural history,"" Singaporean young people had already established a localized literary movement, following Hicks' lead. Local markets soon became inundated with the autobiographies of fame-seeking youth, many not yet in their twenties."
"In 1992, two years after Hicks' controversial entry into Singapore's literary scene, she published her second and last book, ""Discuss Disgust."" The novella, literarily more sophisticated but never as popular as her first book, portrays the world as seen through the eyes of a child whose mother is a prostitute. In it, Hicks continued to openly discuss sexuality and in veiled terms even broached the taboo of sexual abuse, both subjects that were not normally spoken of openly in Singapore during the time. Adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Hicks, a widely read local traditionalist columnist dubbed it ""another one of those commercial publications which pack sleaze and sin into its hundred-oddpages"" (sic). While public understanding was greater than let on, traditionalist social pressures meant that few people publicly accepted the novella for what it actually was: Hicks' semi-autobiographical account of ""her own"" troubled childhood years, an only partially veiled yet immediately unsuccessful cry for the public to reinterpret her early adult years through the trauma-lens of her childhood."
"Hicks was also a frequent contributor to Singaporean and regional press outlets. Her frankly-written bi-monthly column in ""The Straits Times"", ""The Bonny Hicks Diary"", in which she often discussed her childhood on Sentosa Island, further incited traditionalists' feelings that Hicks was an improper role model for young, impressionable girls, whom traditionalists felt were being morally corrupted by Hicks. Yielding to public pressure, spurred initially by a letter writing campaign to the paper, the ""Times"" pulled her column within a year. The paper's esteemed editor, Richard Lim, subsequently voiced regret over what he considered a politically motivated decision by the paper. Pushing back as far as practicable, Lim began running frequent ""special"" columns by Hicks. Having taken a mentoring interest in Hicks' development as a writer since her first publication, Lim was uniquely authoritative when he publicly noted the deepening of Hicks' writings as she matured."
"At the time of ""Discuss Disgust""'s release, Hicks reported to ""The Straits Times"" that she had been working on a third book, one that centred on correspondence between herself and an unnamed female housemate. Hicks wrote of her social observations of the United States during a two-month visit, using it as a springboard to social commentary about Singapore. While the book idea further revealed Hicks' preference to write with a certain person in mind it never materialised, not even in draft form or as personal papers released posthumously ."
"During Hicks' heyday, few had begun to adequately situate her life and works within the larger societal changes that had enveloped Singapore at the time under forces of rapid globalisation—changes that, by then, were simply far to advanced and powerful to altogether stop the clock upon by the traditionally successful means of shaming and ostracising. For the most part, traditionalists simply reacted from gut-level fear against Hicks, or a simplified characterisation or straw man of her, whom they perceived as a ""notorious"" moral threat willing to degrade Singaporean society for personal fame and financial gain. Even though the criticisms were not entirely fair—they certainly contained at least a kernel of truth—their accumulation had long been taking a toll upon Hicks' perseverance, eroding away at even her senses of identity, purpose, and wholeness, and thus her basic senses of faith, hope, and peace about the future. While she yet continued to milk opportunities for self-promotion, as Pat Chan had taught her to do, it was becoming clearer and clearer that Hicks had for some time been deep within a season of personal introspection, and had been laying plans for a significant life and career transition that appeared to be informed by the values of Singaporean traditionalists. Whilst she was perhaps conceding a victory to her traditionalist critics amid her life transition, her life change was caused at least as much by her own personal maturing away from the years and seemingly unrestrained values of her youth, although there was certainly an interplay of both external and internal forces that prodded her along."
"I experienced great happiness and great sorrow in my life. While the great happiness was uplifting and renewing, the sorrow ate at me slowly, like a worm in the core of an apple. I realised then that stable happiness was not mine until I could eliminate the sorrow too. The sorrow which I experienced was often due to the fact that my own happiness came at a price. That price was someone else's happiness."
"Despite Hicks' confession that she had harmed others along her path to fame, and her intention to reverse the trend, she all along had her supporters—those who comprehended her on a level deeper than the mere fandom she had so often sought to instigate toward herself, and who saw in Hicks a young lady not trying to offend but to initiate critical conversations within a culture that was often far too resistant to anything beyond the familiar. To them, Hicks' anthropical philosophy of life that featured loving, caring and sharing was not only refreshing but important, perhaps more than even Hicks herself could appreciate at the time. A growing voice appeared to emerge clearly in her writings, and it attracted many Singaporeans and others, including some scholars. Two of the scholars would become pivotally influential new mentors to Hicks during her major traditionalist life transition, the ultimate result of which, as things would turn out, would be cut short by her untimely death."
"One of Hicks' new mentors was Tal Ben-Shahar, a positive psychologist and popular professor of psychology at the time at Harvard University. Hicks reached out to Ben-Shahar after being exposed to his writings, and the two corresponded about philosophical and spiritual matters for approximately one year, on up until Hicks' 1997 death. The correspondence later became basis for a 1998 book by Ben-Shahar, in which he narrated Hicks' profound growth during the year."
"Hicks had also became a student of Confucian humanism, and she was particularly attracted to the thought a second Harvard professor, Tu Wei-Ming, a New Confucian philosopher, who became a second new mentor to Hicks. Hicks attended Tu's seminars and the two corresponded over some months. With Tu's influence added to that of Ben-Shahar's, Hicks began to exhibit an increased New Confucian influence upon her thinking, and she soon turned in her occasional ""Straits Times"" columns to criticising Singaporean society from the theme. In one piece, she expressed dismay about the ""lack of understanding of Confucianism as it was intended to be and the political version of the ideology to which we [as Singaporeans] are exposed today."" Just before Hicks' death she had submitted what Editor Richard Lim recognised as her most mature column ever to ""The Straits Times"". The daily posthumously published ""I think and feel, therefore I am"", on 28 December 1997. In it Hicks argued,"
"Thinking is more than just conceiving ideas and drawing inferences; thinking is also reflection and contemplation. When we take embodied thinking rather than abstract reasoning as a goal for our mind, then we understand that thinking is a transformative act.<br>      The mind will not only deduce, speculate, and comprehend, but it will also awaken, will enlighten and inspire.<br>      Si, is how I have thought, and always will think."
"Tu asserts that Hicks' use of the Chinese character ""Si"" was ""code language,"" readily understood by her Chinese-speaking English readers, to convey New Confucian thought. The piece, Hicks' last, reflects the maturing and deepening engagement in philosophy and spirituality that she had clearly been enveloped in under tutelage of her new mentors during her last year of life."
"When Hicks penned ""Excuse Me, are you a Model?"", her intent was to write a first book to which people would ""react"". Whether those reactions were positive or negative was not her young mind's first concern. Only public ""indifference"", the antithesis of public ""reaction"", would impede her achievement of fame and popularity, she believed—a message Pat Chan had surely instilled in Hicks from the start. Hicks described her own early motivations:"
"I wanted to be something all young girls aspired to be, I wanted to be that model that men lusted after, I wanted to be that model that people would recognise on the streets. I wanted to be that model that clients would never stop demanding for, I wanted to be that model, that face, that would launch a thousand ships. I wanted to be a star."
"When it was founded, the KAPD included some tens of thousands of revolutionaries. However, it had broken up and practically dissolved within a few years. This was because it was founded on the basis of revolutionary optimism and a purism that rejected what became known as frontism. Frontism entailed working in the same organisations as reformist workers. Such work was seen by the KAPD as unhelpful at a time when the revolution was thought to be an imminent event and not merely a goal to be aimed at. This led the members of the KAPD to reject working in the traditional trade unions in favour of forming their own revolutionary unions. These ""unionen"", so called to distinguish them from the official trade unions, had 80,000 members in 1920 and peaked in 1921 with 200,000 members, after which they declined rapidly. They were also organisationally divided from the beginning, with those unionen linked to the KAPD forming the AAU-D and those in Saxony around Otto Rühle who opposed the conception of a party in favour of a unitary class organisation being organised as the AAU-E."
"The KAPD was unable to reach even its founding congress prior to suffering its first split when the so-called National Bolshevik tendency around Fritz Wolffheim and Heinrich Laufenberg appeared (this tendency has no connection with modern political tendencies in Russia which use the same name). More seriously, the KAPD lost most of its support very rapidly as it failed to develop lasting structures. This also contributed to internecine quarrels and the party actually split into two competing tendencies known as the Essen and Berlin tendencies to the historians of the left. The recently established Communist Workers International (KAI) split on exactly the same lines as did the tiny Communist Workers Party of Bulgaria. The only other affiliates of the KAI were the Communist Workers Party of Britain led by Sylvia Pankhurst, the Communist Workers Party of the Netherlands (KAPN) in the Netherlands and a group in Russia. The AAU-D split on the same lines and it rapidly ceased to exist as a real tendency within the factories."
"Left communists generally supported the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917 and entertained enormous hopes in the founding of the Communist International, or Comintern. In fact, they controlled the first body formed by the Comintern to coordinate its activities in Western Europe, the Amsterdam Bureau. However, this was little more than a very brief interlude and the Amsterdam Bureau never functioned as a leadership body for Western Europe as was originally intended. The Vienna Bureau of the Comintern may also be classified as left communist, but its personnel were not to evolve into either of the two historic currents that made up left communism. Rather, the Vienna Bureau adopted the ultra-left ideas of the earliest period in the history of the Comintern."
"Left communists supported the Russian revolution, but did not accept the methods of the Bolsheviks. Many of the German-Dutch tradition adopted Rosa Luxemburg's criticism as outlined in her posthumously published essay entitled ""The Russian Revolution"". In this essay, she rejected the Bolshevik position on distribution of land to the peasantry and their espousal of the right of nations to self-determination which she rejected as historically outmoded. The Italian left communists did not at the time accept any of these criticisms and both currents would evolve."
"To a considerable degree, Lenin's well known polemic """" is an attack on the ideas of the emerging left communist currents. His main aim was to polemicise with currents moving towards pure revolutionary tactics by showing them that they could remain based on firmly revolutionary principles while utilising a variety of tactics. Therefore, Lenin defended the use of parliamentarism and working within the official trade unions."
"As the Kronstadt rebellion occurred at a time when the debate on tactics was still raging within the Comintern, it has been wrongly seen as being left communist by some commentators. In fact, the left communist currents had no connection with the rebellion, although they did rally to its support when they learned of it. In later years, the German-Dutch tradition in particular would come to see the suppression of the revolt as the historic turning point in the evolution of the Russian state after October 1917."
"After 1926, Italian left communism took shape in exile and without the participation of Bordiga. Contacts between the Italians and the Germans had been made and were developed in France, but the Italian left saw the KAPD's stress on factory organisation as being similar to the ideas of Gramsci's ""L'Ordine Nuovo"" and therefore rejected closer contact. Attempts to work with the group around Karl Korsch also failed. The left faction of the PCd'I was formally established in July 1927 by a number of young militants. This new group had members in France, Belgium and the United States and published a review entitled ""Prometeo"". It was estimated in 1928 that it had at most 200 militants, but it would seem that while it never had more than 100 militants active at any one time its influence was actually far greater. However, the control of the PCd'I apparatus by the Stalinists meant that attempts to reach other exiles was almost impossible and they were driven back into small circle work."
"The Italian left faction was for the rest of the 1930s led by Ottorino Perrone (also known with the pseudonym Vercesi), although it was fiercely opposed to the cult of the personality which was developing in the Comintern around Joseph Stalin in these years and resisted similar pressures in its own organisation. The faction had members in France, Belgium and the United States, but how many in Italy looked to it cannot be ascertained since all communist activities there had been driven underground by the fascist government. The main activity of the faction through these years was the publishing of its press, which consisted of the paper ""Prometeo"" and the journal ""Bilan"". With its establishment as a group, the fraction also looked for international co-thinkers. Seeing the International Left Opposition led by Leon Trotsky as central to the non-Stalinist Communist movement, they sought contact with it. However, these contacts were to be severed when agreement on basic principles proved impossible."
"The political distance between the faction and other communist currents would deepen throughout the 1930s as the faction declared itself opposed to the tactics adopted by the Left Opposition to broaden its support (i.e. the faction affirmed its opposition to fusion with centrist groups, opposition to entryism and so on). Always opposed to the united front tactic of the Comintern, the fraction now declared itself firmly opposed to the popular front after 1933. Like the Trotskyists, it saw the failure of the German Communist Party in the face of fascism as its historic failure and ceased to consider itself a fraction of the party from the date of its 1935 Congress held in Brussels."
"Isolated, the left fraction sought to discover allies within the milieu of groups to the left of the Trotskyist movement. Typically, these discussions came to nothing, but they were able to recruit from the disintegrating Ligue des Communistes Internationalistes (LCI) in Belgium, a group which had broken from Trotskyism. A loose liaison was also maintained with the council communist groups in the Netherlands and in particular with the GIK. However, these discussions were pushed into the background as the attempted fascist coup in Spain led to revolution and civil war."
"Immediately after the civil war began, a minority emerged within the left fraction whose members sought to participate in the events in Spain. This minority, including longtime members of the fraction, numbered some 26 militants mainly belonging to the Parisian federation of the Fraction. They travelled to Barcelona to enlist in the workers militias and after a fruitless meeting in September with a delegation from the Fraction back home, they were expelled. The problem for the fraction was that the military support given to the Republican forces by this minority was accompanied by political support (in that the minority wished to halt strikes among loyalist workers in the name of military victory against fascism). According to the fraction, no support could be given to a bourgeois state even in a struggle against fascism."
"The question of Spain forced the Belgian LCI to clarify its positions and a split ensued as a result of debate within its ranks. At its February 1937 conference, a minority of the LCI led by Mitchell defended the positions of the Italian left and were expelled. Although less than ten in number, they formed a Belgian Fraction of the Communist Left. It was at this point that the Italian left learned of a group called the Grupo de Trabajadores in Mexico with very similar positions to their own. It was led by Paul Kirchhoff and had left the Mexican Trotskyist movement. Kirchoff had formerly been a member of the Communist Party in Germany, then a Trotskyist in the United States, but his tiny group would seem to have disappeared at the outbreak of war in 1939. In early 1938, the Italian and Belgian fractions formed an International Bureau of the Left Fractions which published a review called ""Octobre""."
"During this period, the Italian left also reviewed a number of positions which it thought had become outdated. They rejected the idea of national self-determination and began to develop their views on the war economy and capitalist decadence. Much of this was carried out by Vercesi, but Mitchell from the Belgian fraction was also a leading figure in the work. Perhaps most dramatically, they also reviewed their understanding of the Russian Revolution and the state that had emerged from it. Eventually, they came to argue that the Russian state was by the late 1930s state capitalist and was not to be defended. In short, they believed there was need for a new revolution."
"Many small currents to the left of the mass communist parties collapsed at the beginning of World War II and the left communists were initially silent too. Despite having foreseen the war more clearly than some other factions, when it began they were overwhelmed. Many were persecuted by either German Nazism or Italian fascism. Leading militants of the communist left such as Mitchell, who was Jewish, were to die in the Buchenwald concentration camp."
"Meanwhile, the final council communist groups in Germany had disappeared in the maelstrom and the International Communist Group (GIK) in the Netherlands was moribund. The former centrist group led by Henk Sneevliet (the Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party, RSAP) transformed itself into the Marx–Lenin–Luxemburg Front. In April 1942, its leadership was arrested by the Gestapo and killed. The remaining activists then split into two camps as some turned to Trotskyism forming the Committee of Revolutionary Marxists (CRM) while the majority formed the CommunistenBond-Spartacus. The latter group turned to council communism and was joined by most members of the GIK."
"In 1941, the Italian fraction was reorganised in France and along with the new French Nucleus of the Communist Left came into conflict with the ideas which the fraction had propagated from 1936, namely of the social disappearance of the proletariat and localised wars and so on. These ideas continued to be defended by Vercesi in Brussels. Gradually, the left fractions adopted positions drawn from German left communism. They abandoned the conception that the Russian state remained in some way proletarian and also dropped Vercesi's conception of localised wars in favour of ideas on imperialism inspired by Rosa Luxemburg. Vercesi's participation in a Red Cross committee was also fiercely contested."
"The strike at FIAT in October 1942 had a huge impact on the Italian fraction, which was deepened by the fall of Mussolini's regime in July 1943. The Italian fraction now saw a pre-revolutionary situation opening in Italy and prepared to participate in the coming revolution. In 1943 the Internationalist Communist Party was founded by Onorato Damen and Luciano Stefanini, amongst others. By 1945 the party had 5,000 members all over Italy with some supporters in France, Belgium and the USA. It published a ""Manifesto of the Communist Left to the European Proletariat"", which called upon workers to put class war before national war."
"In France, revived by Marco in Marseilles, the Italian fraction now worked closely with the new French fraction, which was formally founded in Paris in December 1944. However, in May 1945 the Italian fraction, many of whose members had already returned to Italy, voted to dissolve itself so that its militants could integrate themselves as individuals into the Internationalist Communist Party. The conference at which this decision was made also refused to recognise the French fraction and expelled Marco from their group."
"This led to a split in the French fraction and the formation of the Gauche Communiste de France by the French fraction led by Marco. The history of the GCF belongs to the post-war period. Meanwhile, the former members of the French fraction who sympathised with Vercesi and the Internationalist Communist Party formed a new French fraction which published the journal ""L'Etincelle"" and was joined at the end of 1945 by the old minority of the fraction who had joined ""L'Union Communiste"" in the 1930s."
"One other development during the war years merits mention at this point. A small grouping of German and Austrian militants came close to Left Communist positions in these years. Best known as the Revolutionary Communist Organisation, these young militants were exiles from Nazism living in France at the start of World War II and were members of the Trotskyist movement but they had opposed the formation of the Fourth International in 1938 on the grounds that it was premature. They were refused full delegates' credentials and only admitted to the founding conference of the Youth International on the following day. They then joined Hugo Oehler's International Contact Commission for the Fourth (Communist) International and in 1939 were publishing ""Der Marxist"" in Antwerp."
"With the beginning of the war, they took the name Revolutionary Communists of Germany (RKD) and came to define Russia as state capitalist in agreement with Ante Ciliga's book ""The Russian Enigma"". At this point, they adopted a revolutionary defeatist position on the war and condemned Trotskyism for its critical defence of Russia (which was seen by Trotskyists as a degenerated workers' state). After the fall of France, they renewed contact with militants in the Trotskyist milieu in Southern France and recruited some of them into the Communistes Revolutionnaires in 1942. This group became known as ""Fraternisation Proletarienne"" in 1943 and then L'Organisation Communiste Revolutionnaire in 1944. The CR and RKD were autonomous and clandestine, but worked closely together with shared politics. As the war ran its course, they evolved in a councilist direction while also identifying more and more with Luxemburg's work. They also worked with the French Fraction of the Communist Left and seem to have disintegrated at the end of the war. This disintegration was sped no doubt by the capture of leading militant Karl Fischer, who was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he was to participate in writing the ""Declaration of the Internationalist Communists of Buchenwald"" when the camp was liberated."
"The closing stages of World War II marked a watershed in the history of left communism as was true for every other political tendency. Like the Trotskyists, left communists expected the war to end with at least the beginnings of a revolutionary wave of struggle similar to that which had marked the end of World War I. Therefore, strikes in Italy from 1942 onwards were of intense interest to them. Many left communists formerly in exile, in jail or simply inactive due to repression returned to active political activity in Italy. This had the result that new organisations identifying with left communism came into being and older ones dissolved themselves."
"If for the Italian Left the end of war marked a new beginning, it also did so for the German-Dutch left. Although in Germany it was the case that the communist left tradition was all but extinguished, surviving only in the form of a few scattered groups holding councilist views, by comparison France saw an interesting development with the beginning of a conscious attempt to develop a synthesis of the two strands of left communism in the form of the ""Gauche Communiste de France"", which built on pre-war contributions."
"The year 1952 signalled the end of mass influence on the part of Italian left communism as its sole remaining representative, the Internationalist Communist Party, split in two sections: the group led by Bordiga took the name International Communist Party, while the group around Damen retained the name Internationalist Communist Party. The Gauche Communiste de France (GCF) dissolved in the same year. Left communists entered a period of almost constant decline from this point onwards, although they were somewhat rejuvenated by the events of 1968."
"The uprisings of May 1968 led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Battaglia Comunista initiated a series of conferences of the communist left to engage those new elements, also attended by the International Communist Current. As a result of these, in 1983 the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party (later renamed as the Internationalist Communist Tendency) was established by Battaglia Comunista and the British Communist Workers Organisation."
"Prominent post-1968 proponents of left communism have included Paul Mattick and Maximilien Rubel. Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party, the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. In addition to the left communist groups in the direct lineage of the Italian and Dutch traditions, a number of groups with similar positions have flourished since 1968, such as the workerist and autonomist movements in Italy; Kolinko, Kurasje, Wildcat; Subversion and Aufheben in England; Théorie Communiste, Echanges et Mouvements and Démocratie Communiste in France; TPTG and Blaumachen in Greece; Kamunist Kranti in India; and Collective Action Notes and Loren Goldner in the United States."

"Vernon L. Walker (May 2, 1894 – March 1, 1948) was an American special effects artist and cinematographer. He was nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Special Effects. He worked on more than 220 films during his career, starting out as a head cameraman for Otis B. Thayer's Art-O-Graf Film Company in 1919."
Walker was nominated for four Academy Awards:
"Infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to public health; an example of this is rabies. Genetic disorders also affect dogs, often due to selective breeding to produce individual dog breeds. Due to the popularity of both commercial and homemade dog foods, nutrition is also a heavily studied subject."
"Some diseases and other health problems are common to both humans and dogs; others are unique to dogs and other animals. Dogs are susceptible to various diseases; similarly to humans, they can have diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, or arthritis."
"An infectious disease is caused by the presence of organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (either animalian or protozoan). Most of these diseases are spread directly from dog to dog, while others require a vector such as a tick or mosquito. Certain infectious diseases are a concern from a public health standpoint because they are zoonoses (transmittable to humans)."
"Viral diseases in dogs can be serious, especially in kennels. Timely vaccination can reduce the risk and severity of an infection. The most commonly recommended viruses to vaccinate dogs against are:"
"Bacterial diseases in dogs are usually not contagious from dog to dog; instead they are usually the result of wound colonization, opportunistic infections secondary to decreased resistance (often the result of viral infections), or secondary to other conditions (pyoderma secondary to skin allergies or pyometra secondary to cystic endometrial hyperplasia). These examples are not considered infectious diseases because they do not satisfy Koch's postulates - for example ""Staphylococcus intermedius"", a commonly isolated bacteria from skin infections in dogs, would not cause pyoderma when introduced to a healthy dog. In all likelihood that type of bacteria is already present on the skin of a healthy dog."
"There are some bacteria that are contagious from dog to dog. The most notable of these are ""Bordetella bronchiseptica"", one of the causes of kennel cough, ""Leptospira"" sp, which cause leptospirosis, and ""Brucella canis"", cause of brucellosis in dogs. There are also common tick-borne bacterial diseases, including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever."
"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus ""Leptospira"". Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin. In dogs, transmission most commonly occurs by drinking puddle, pond, or ditch water contaminated by urine from infected wildlife such as squirrels or raccoons. The liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by leptospirosis. Vasculitis can occur, causing edema and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Myocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, and uveitis are also possible sequelae."
"Brucellosis in dogs is caused by ""Brucella canis"". It is a sexually transmitted disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (uveitis), and inflammation of the testicle (orchitis) and prostate (prostatitis) in males."
"Tick-borne diseases are common in dogs. Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by ""Borrelia burgdorferi"" and spread by ""Ixodes pacificus"" on the West coast of the United States and by ""I. scapularis"" (deer tick) in the rest of the U.S. Signs and symptoms include fever, joint swelling and pain, lameness, and swelling of the lymph nodes. It has been diagnosed in dogs in all 48 states of the continental U.S. ""Ehrlichia canis"", which causes canine ehrlichiosis, and ""Rickettsia rickettsii"", which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are both spread by the American dog tick, ""Dermacentor variabilis"", and the brown dog tick, ""Rhipicephalus sanguineous""."
"One of the most common fungal diseases in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. About 70 percent of infections are caused by ""Microsporum canis"", 20 percent by ""M. gypseum"", and 10 percent by ""Trichophyton mentagrophytes"". Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the clinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. Infection can spread to humans."
"There are several fungal diseases that are systemic in nature, meaning they are affecting multiple body systems. Blastomycosis, caused by ""Blastomyces dermatitidis"", is a fungal disease that affects both dogs and humans. It is transmitted through the inhalation of fungal spores. It is found mainly in the United States in the Mississippi River and Great Lakes areas. It has also been reported in four Canadian provinces; Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, draining skin lesions, eye inflammation with discharge, blindness, and lameness. Because dogs are ten times more likely to become infected from the environment than humans, they are considered to be sentinels for the disease. Treatment requires a minimum 60-90 day course of oral antifungal medication or in severe cases intravenous antifungal injections."
"Histoplasmosis, caused by ""Histoplasma capsulatum"", is a disease with a worldwide distribution. In the United States it is mainly found in the Mississippi and Ohio River areas, most commonly in bird and bat feces. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Coccidioidomycosis, caused by ""Coccidioides immitis"", is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America, Mexico, and southwestern United States. Signs include weight loss, fever, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and lameness."
"Veterinary parasitology studies both external and internal parasites in animals. External parasites, such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal parasites."
"Genetic conditions are a problem in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For this reason many of the national kennel clubs require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some of the most common conditions include hip dysplasia, seen in large breed dogs, von Willebrand disease, a disease that affects platelets that is inherited in Doberman Pinschers, entropion, a curling in of the eyelid seen in Shar Peis and many other breeds, progressive retinal atrophy, inherited in many breeds, deafness, and epilepsy, known to be inherited in Belgian Shepherd Dogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards."
"Subaortic stenosis, or SAS, is a genetic ailment that causes a narrowing of the passage of blood between the heart and the aorta. This leads to heart problems and sometimes sudden death. It affects larger breeds such as the Newfoundland Dog and the Golden Retriever. In some dogs, such as collies, the blue merle or harlequin coloring is actually the heterozygote of a partially recessive gene preventing proper development of the nervous system; therefore, if two such dogs are mated, on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in their nervous systems and sensory organs ranging from deafness to fatal flaws."
"Skin diseases are very common in dogs. Atopy, a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs. Other skin diseases related to allergies include hot spots and pyoderma, both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, food allergy, ear infections, and flea allergy dermatitis. Canine follicular dysplasia is an inherited disorder of the hair follicles resulting in alopecia (baldness). Mange is an infectious skin disease caused by mites. Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of integumentary malady is hygromas, a swelling typically on or near the elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin.(See dog skin disorders for specific nutrients that impacts skin)"
"Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems, such as wrinkled skin or excessive skin folds. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection more prevalent in breeds such as the bulldog, cocker spaniel, and English Springer spaniel."
"Orthopedic diseases in dogs can be developmental, hereditary, traumatic, or degenerative. Because of the active nature of dogs, injuries happen frequently. One of the most common of these is an anterior cruciate ligament injury, a condition which often requires surgery. Bone fractures are a frequent occurrence in outdoor dogs due to trauma from being hit by cars. Degenerative joint disease is common in older dogs and is one of the most likely reasons for prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."
"Hereditary orthopedic diseases are mainly found in purebred dogs. Hip dysplasia is a common problem that primarily affects larger breeds. Hip dysplasia is a defect in the shape of the hip joint which can, depending on the degree of hip luxation, be quite painful to the dog as it ages. Over time it often causes arthritis in the hips. Dysplasia can also occur in the elbow joint. Luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds. It can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs."
"Developmental orthopedic diseases include panosteitis and hypertrophic osteodystrophy. Panosteitis occurs in large and giant breed dogs usually between the age of five and fourteen months and manifests as fever, pain, and shifting leg lameness. Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is also seen in young large and giant breed dogs and is characterized by pain, lameness, fever, and swelling of the long bone metaphysis."
"Both benign and malignant tumors are seen in dogs. Common benign tumors include lipomas, non-viral papillomas, sebaceous gland adenoma, and perianal gland adenomas."
"Frequently seen cancers include lymphoma, melanoma, mast cell tumors (which are considered to be potentially malignant, even though they may have benign behavior), and osteosarcoma (bone cancer)."
"Certain breeds are more likely to develop particular tumors, larger ones especially. The Golden Retriever is especially susceptible to lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 8. Boxers and pugs are prone to multiple mast cell tumors. Scottish terriers have eighteen times the risk of mixed breed dogs to develop transitional cell carcinoma, a type of urinary bladder cancer."
"Due to the indiscriminate nature of a dog's appetite, gastrointestinal upset is a frequent occurrence in dogs. The most common symptoms are anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Foreign body ingestion can lead to acute obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, a very dangerous condition. Acute pancreatitis can also result from dietary indiscretion."
"Gastric dilatation volvulus, or gastric torsion and bloat, primarily affects breeds with deep, narrow chests, such as Great Danes, St. Bernards, German Shepherds, Standard Poodles and Irish Setters. The stomach twists on its supporting ligaments, sealing off the exits, and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is very painful and rapidly causes shock and necrosis of large areas of stomach tissue. It can be fatal within a few hours. Dogs who have experienced bloat are very susceptible to recurrences. Treatment involves stabilization and abdominal surgery to tack the dog's stomach down to prevent recurrence (gastropexy)."
"Eye diseases are common in dogs. Cataracts, canine glaucoma, and entropion are seen in dogs. Canine-specific eye diseases include progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. Injury to the eye can result in corneal ulcers."
The frequency of bilateral glaucoma with a genetic base in purebred dogs is higher than in any species except humans. Cataracts in dogs either have a genetic base or can also be caused by diabetes. Nuclear sclerosis resembles a cataract but is actually a normal age-related change.
"Signs of vestibular disease include head tilt, circling, nystagmus (an abnormal movement of the eyes), and difficulty or inability to stand. These clinical signs are similar to those seen in humans experiencing vertigo. Vestibular disease may have many causes. Elderly dogs are susceptible to an idiopathic (meaning due to unknown causes) form of vestibular disease commonly called ""old dog vestibular disease"" or idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. The signs may improve rapidly or take a few days. Less commonly, vestibular signs can also be caused by inner ear disease, a brain tumor, a stroke, or other causes. The major risk with idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease is that the dog is often unable to eat, drink, or go outside to urinate or defecate. These cases must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is sometimes administered, as the dog may be very stressed by the experience."
"Older, small breeds of dogs are prone to congestive heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition is known to be inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Degenerative valve disease is the most common form of heart disease in dogs. Mitral regurgitation leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, blood vessel constriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. It also results in an increase in diastolic pressure and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan - which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator - is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently. Within the past decade, a new surgical technique has been developed for mitral valve repair that replaces or strengthens the mitral valve chords with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prostheses and tightens the mitral valve ring to reduce or eliminate regurgitation."
"Cardiomyopathy, or disease of the heart muscle, is also seen in dogs and is associated with large breeds (the exception being Cocker Spaniels, a medium-sized breed). Dilated cardiomyopathy is seen in Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds, St. Bernards, Dobermanns, Boxers, and other large breeds. Dobermanns, in addition to heart muscle failure, are prone to ventricular arrhythmias. Boxer dogs are predisposed to a unique cardiomyopathy with clinical and histological changes analogous to human arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The disease has been termed “Boxer cardiomyopathy” or “Boxer ARVC”, and is characterized by development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Affected dogs are at risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death. Myocardial failure and congestive heart failure are rare manifestations of this disease."
"Other diseases affecting dogs include endocrine diseases, immune-mediated diseases, and reproductive diseases. Diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and hypothyroidism are the most common endocrine diseases. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a devastating disease that causes severe anemia in dogs through red blood cell destruction by the immune system. It has been associated with vaccinations and certain drugs, although many cases are idiopathic. A similar but less severe immune disease is immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, characterized by destruction of platelets by the immune system. Clinical signs include bruising and petechiae (pinpoint bruising, often seen in the mouth). Common reproductive diseases include pyometra (distension of the uterus with pus), mammary tumors, and benign prostatic hyperplasia."
Psychological anxieties affecting dogs include noise phobia and separation anxiety.
