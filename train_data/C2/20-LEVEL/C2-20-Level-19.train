Yes
"you see, a diagonal, the"
"raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,"

"cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in"
Yeah
"this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced"
Yeah
"because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard"
"I wouldn't of thought so, it was"
I wouldn't of thought so
the
I'll have to find out of this
"Yeah, I might do"
your handwriting's quite nice and neat
"Erm, oh I've got another piece back that I've  twenty nine, twenty nine  as it goes"
That's a C innit?
"Yeah, but that goes, that goes in the lit file, so I got rid of my er with the thirty five I managed to get rid of erm"
Who's got all these things?
They're at school in a box
Thank goodness for that
"but er, so now I've got a thirty six, thirty five, thirty four, thirty four, thirty four, thirty two and thirty, so that's a B count in B file, so there's no hassle with that, but if I can get on and get rid of the er, I've got twenty eight, twenty nine in there as well, er twenty eight in there as well, so I want to get rid of the twenty eight and twenty nine  but it is a guarantee that a B file, so there's"
Mm
"no real worry about it, but erm I want to do better"

"Yeah, he still keeps far faffing around with the erm  whatever detail, yeah, he still hasn't given it to us"

"Something, something"
Science
well well whatever it was you
No

No
Why not?
"Because I didn't have time, but er they started geography course work today and I was out the lesson"
Why were you out the lesson?
"The drama thing, so I'm a se a section hand already on that and I've even got a, well we're supposed to listen to it tomorrow, we've got a tutor period instead, so it means that we miss another lesson"
"Can't you copy out what you, what you missed?"
"Yeah, I'm out tomorrow night, I'm out school, selling books again  so should be at home"
When you gonna get all this work done Richard?
"Yes I'm trying to get it done, but I am getting pressure from the year group as well, it was, and so I've got that, back out at Wednesday, so I'm gonna have to have my hair done last"
Gonna Wednesday what?
"Erm, got a rehearsal haven't I?"
oh can I remember that far back
erm
loss of memory?
yes definitely that erm
loss of common sense certainly.
"would you agree the ninety three of you, is that what characterises being in love, temporary madness?, any other, no well what then?, yes"
"Er yeah, sorry, I write romantic fictions not just lust"
yes
"Being in love I think erm its not something that you have to end it happens to you, its not because er a terribly admire the person I er, your only achievements, its just something that happens and common sense goes out the window."
so you suggest that Sandra might be right?
something like
and
there might be something in it yes
"erm, yes, up there"
"Well I don't agree with that, I think that when your in love with someone you want to be with them all the time, you think about them during the day, you think about them at night, you just want to be with them and usually you like how they look, you like how they talk, they like, you like how they treat you and er to me that's, its wonderful, just"
has
wonderful
how many times has this happened to you?
many times
"many times, at one time I thought it would never happen again, I thought this was it forever, but life isn't like that, things happen and it does change."
yes
"It, it is a form of an obsession and it is an excitement and there's a warmth and there's a funniness about it and it just wonderful, better being in love than not being in love surely."
"mm, yes"
"No I feel er kind a be lost, it depends on what relationship your looking for."
"I think if its the right one its definitely not lust its every minute admiration for them, just to be with that person."
"so, so lust is what you feel for the wrong one?"
That's afterwards
"yes, I, first meet them, then you can say its lust."
there
Can you not start with being in love with someone and end up by loving them?
Yes
it isn't always a drastic ending is it?
"Right then  could we have the minutes from the previous A G M, please."
The minutes of the annual general meeting held at  Labour Club   on Monday the seventh of December  nineteen ninety two.
"There were thirteen members present,in the chair  apology er apologies from Joe and Emily  and Robert who were injured in a car crash on the way here."
Minutes of the A G M on the second of December nineteen ninety one were read  proposed Jack   and seconded    that they be accepted.
All in favour  there were none against  and no abstentions.
Matters arising  there were no matters arising  unusually.
Secretary's report  the secretary thanked Joan and Reg  for the club during the year  especially for donating items for the open show for the  and Christmas social.
It was a very hard job holding everything together  and it required tremendous dedication from everyone concerned.
Difficulties had arisen over the Globe Hotel in February last year  and we have been forced to move yet again.
We were once more experiencing difficulties  hopefully  they would all be  out before too long.
We hadn't managed to get any speakers this year  but had all enjoyed the previous meeting in Oc in October.
"There had been a trip to Yorkshire in April  and another to the British Aquarist Festival  in November, both of which had been enjoyed by all."
This concluded the secretary's report.
"Brian  proposed  Wilf  seconded that the be, the, seconded that the report be accepted  all in favour, there were none against and no abstentions."
Show secretary's report  in the show secretary's absence  due to the accident  on route tonight  the chairman said  Mrs  had done a fantastic job over the year  and he wished to record his thanks to her.
The fish on the bench have increased over the year  and he asked everyone to bring out just one fish  every meeting.
The secretary would phone to find out if they were alright  after the accident and if nec necessary  contact the chairman.
"Treasurer's report  the balance sheets were circulated to all and the treasurer went through each item  of expenditure, explaining in detail."
There was a healthy balance  for nineteen ninety three  and this was mainly due to members supporting raffles  and the fact that we have not put the show stand off  at the British Aquarist Festival for a couple of years.
This had built up the present balance to what it now was.
Mr  proposed  seconded that the report be accepted.
All in favour  none against and no abstentions.
This concluded the reports.
There was no librarian's report  due to Mr  being absent.
The chairman thanked all those who had worked hard and tirelessly over the last year  for the benefit of the club and its members.
Election of the committee.
"Now I don't propose to go through  erm the proposers and seconders, I shall just go through  the nominees  er  and there was no opposition."
"So  er presumably  er you understand that it was, they were all elected."
"The chairman  Peter   vice chairman, Bill    secretary, H    treasurer  A B   show secretary, E   assistant show secretary, R   librarian, Jane   committee  J   M   W   and J ."
All these members were elected unanimously and unopposed.
"Now, any other business."
We were asked to try to arrange an inter-club table show  with Hulton Aquarist Society.
"le pool de javelle horse dirt, mm"
I don't know if we're supposed to be talking er French
We weren't
Ah at last home
"So that's basically, I now got a B grade for and that gives"
Mm
"so that's English, and I've gotta get, er he reckons he'll get a B grade for the er lit, but I was so cheesed off with that erm  piece I got today, thirty five and thirty five, one mark off being er an A, he put at the bottom aargh, if only you'd seen the lousy ending, cos he said if I'd got the, an extra couple of sentences it er would of been forty eight, forty, so that's, so annoying, but I've now gotta write an informal letter, I don't know how that comes under informal letter"
"You write to an imaginary friend, you're inviting him down for the summer holidays and you say all that, all about the sort of things that you're planning to do with them, make it up"
Can you put bad spellings in those as it's informal?
"No you cannot, you'll write it like a normal, a formal letter, like you would write to Melanie"
That's not formal
It's informal
it's that use of formal
No an informal letter
You said write like a formal letter
"Well you do, but you don't put, don't put like heading for a business thing and"
Oh
just the normal address and date and dear wh whatever it is
Er
"and then you write, just write a set paragraph just as you would normally."
"see if I can get a grade A for this one, that, if I can get a grade A for the er next two pieces that I'm doing, which I've got to hand in, that could take me to a B grade after that."
"Did you erm, give in a formal letter?"
"No he said don't give them in yet, but do the informal first, so I'll do the informal, we've got to do an informal"
"Well don't talk about it, go and do it"
Yeah I'll do it later
Well do it now you're not doing anything before dinner
Dinner's now
No dinner's in at least twenty minutes at least if you rough
Twenty minutes
"Probably, if you just rough out"
"Yes it's easy enough those  so, I hope they don't get bitchy because most of mine are on, on the computer"
"well then write the song through, write the informal letter by hand"
"Er, I have an example of"
Right.
"Could be, certainly quite old, erm, and a socialist, of course."
Yeah.
You ought to point out.
Right.
Not completely true.
"Ah, let me just say what  leaders of peacetime  Margaret  was after   early life was that  a cold mother who was erm, full of  personality  People of London  biography of the leader of the Conservative, because at least half the book is about"
That's where it belongs.
Erm.
"at least not fully in command of ourselves, let alone the social and political world around us."
"It's certainly wrong though,I think erm, there was erm, the question"
Mm.
"Er, but I do believe that  made very important  the reason, er, the first question is  and people weren't  reading about that."
"Erm,"
Well
"Well done, that was absolutely first rate, I mean erm, it was a difficult er, task you had, especially as the book wasn't in the library, of which I am deeply apologetic, because I thought it was, and er, I thought you er, you coped with a very difficult assignment extremely well, and I think you can have an extra  and I'm sure everyone else thinks so too."
"Er, as I have said, I haven't done Woodrow Wilson before in the past, so, so it was an experiment, and erm, I must admit,yo you rose to the occasion excellently."
"The choice of literature, as you realize was meant to be contrasting, and I put  book down as an example of what I thought was the worst possible, er, use of  use of psychoanalysis, kind of gutter journalism, erm and  which you didn't look at, and it's, it's no criticism of you erm, because er, you had your work cut out with what you did do, but the reason I put down Gandhi's Truth, if anybody's ever read that, have they?"
"This is the exact opposite from , because it's erm, it idealizes Gandhi."
"It kind of builds Gandhi up into a great er figure, as it were, ignoring his feet of clay, erm, which he definitely had."
"So erm,book on  which is kind of a character association by a pop cycle analysis and Gan erm, book on Gandhi, which is  using cycle analysis, of, of, of, of tremendous contrast."
"And er, er, the question is of course, where does Freud's book on Woodrow Wilson belong?"
"Does it belong in the kind of  erm, camp or not?"
"Well, erm, what do other people think?"
"But isn't, isn't that the quote at the beginning of your book, er, unsigned quote, erm, doesn't that say something about how, how, you know, long aired radio biography of someone is very political or  sort of er, disregard all of the important things they really done, and I don't know, I don't know if it's er, pertinent erm, but obviously, in Freud, Freud wanted to set out to criticize Wilson erm, so he, you know, he went in with it."
"I mean, he was"
Yes.
obviously going to buck out of the
He was.
biographical allegiance which made him look bad.
Yes.
I think erm  yo e you know you asked about the support and I think having identified that there was a gap in the support in
Mhm.
"times of  I mean, I actually think it's a  an awful lot of ask of a friendship, or of a family situation  and also, indeed, if you  I mean I think sometimes they can be very supportive but th the true understanding may not be there  and erm  I think that's what led me to start up a self- help group in Edinburgh  erm which is, has been erm  running for the last two years now."
"And, I think that  level of real understanding that you do get from fellow sufferers, and indeed, it's a su , it's a support for erm  families as well who are  able to come along and, and share that kind of  support."
Mhm.
"After my own experiences I wo I wouldn't advice someone not to go to their G P, but firstly, I would advice them to contact the Eating Disorders Association  er, because they are very helpful and they're more supportive than any G P I've ever come across."
Okay.
Yes?
"You mentioned er, earlier about yo , the fact that you were surprised that it was fifteen year olds, and that was quite young"
Yeah.
"and yet, in fact, that's the time when you're most vulnerable  yo , it's time of puberty, your"
Mhm.
"interested in fashion, your interested in the opposite sex and th the ages between fifteen and eighteen teenagers ar , tend to be faddy, if it's not  er, their body shape th th , it's vegetari , vegetarianism."
"I think there's a third fact that you touched on earlier that I think it's just worth mentioning  and that is that we know it's also a genetic  pre-disposition to anorexia nervosa, in other words, we know that in certain families it is a disorder that will run from one generation to another."
"Na , yes?"
"Erm, I'd consider myself to have an eating disorder but I don't have anorexia or bulimia."
"And er, I first started feeling I was overweight when I fourteen and I was, I was twelve stone  and I went to the doctor  and got black capsules to take  which had me as high as a kite  for a long time!"
And then there were the  the dose was reduced and then I had to come off them altogether  and after twenty nine years of dieting unsuccessfully  I gave up dieting and I haven't put on any weight since I gave up dieting!
"And, and what sto , why did you stop?"
"Erm, a friend started a  a self-help group which I went to."
"And I realised, well I had realised for a long time that dieting wasn't the answer for me."
And erm
"Oh so, over twenty nine years you're saying that food was controlling your life, in a way?"
Oh yes!
Very much so!
"I mean that was , that was the dominant thing, was wha what you"
"I could have told you every single item of food I had in the cupboard  every, down to the last bean!"
And now I don't know.
"I have sweets lying on the counter, I don't have to take them if I don't want to."
"I'm not controlled by food any more, and I don't feel guilty any more."
I think the lady who said earlier when you go to your G P you can't express yourself
Mm.
"I, I've never really heard of women attacking lesbian women or women attacking gay men, its usually if there's a if there's a row something or other because the male of the species seems the one who's been, feels very, very threatened at the"
by there own people
"masculinity or, or the lost of a er female companion or something."
Jacky
"Can I er, compound the issue more?"
"mm, mm"
"and, and say there is again disrespect or whatever for, I don't know what to call them transracial relationships"
"mm, mm"
because that's another problem and I think maybe people haven't you know like addressed that.
"can, can I just move on to one other issue that I'd like to look at er, because I think we've covered that reasonably for the moment which is, how, how will you find love?, ninety three people said their, their were in love, seven said they weren't, of those seven were, you've never been in love, was it, have, have you wanted to be?, would any of the seven who voted no at the beginning, yes"
Not really
ah
you didn't fancy it?
"no, I'm too in my, I like my independence too much, yes."
any one else  yes
"I think I was er, I thought I was in love a few times, but erm in retrospect it was lust"
"so that's, that's,"
"thought that half of you being in love was, was lust any way."
"Where, where do you find love?, if their are people out watching this programme tonight who would actually rather be in love"
Love finds you
eh?
love finds you
don't give up hope it finds you
thank you
"Also like, why, why, do people want to find love?, like is it maybe lulling them into a false sense of si security erm and I think that it is really important as like one woman said earlier on that its really important to love yourself first, cos how can you give any body any thing"
"mm, mm"
"I think love is like, when somebody loves you, loves you for just being yourself"
aha
"I, I think to me that would be the greatest"
respects you also
"yeah, no matter who you are."
Sadie
Yeah.
get the
Yeah.
things reprographicated and
Yeah.
and er
it usually takes about three working days and er
Okay.
and away you go.
How  subjects are you ?
"Erm  with a thing like this, I mean what I usually say to people it depends on erm if you've got a lot of numerical data, oh you might as well have this back for the time being so"
sweaty hands soaking into it or anything
"erm er then it does help, if you're looking for P less than point O five, and aren't we all these days, erm"
"you know  er it helps if erm it helps if the groups that you're comparing between there's about sort of at least twenty people in each sort of thing, erm  and the same goes for things like, things that you might want to do  squares on or something like that erm so I mean if you were interested in comparing people who attended very regularly with people who only attended once in a while erm you know it would help if there were about sort of  more than forty people altogether so that there was sort of, you know"
Mm.
"you could median split them at  whatever the medium was and then you've got two groups to compare erm because it usually looks quite nice if you've got something comparative as well as looking at the average sort of, you know, pattern of responses on the questionnaire."
Equally if you've got erm  I don't know what other kinds of differences you might want to erm  er  look for but again if you're looking for differences it helps if there's about sort of twenty people in each of the groups sort of thing.
"Or if you're comparing people with themselves as it were, that is looking for differences between how they answer one question and how they answer another question, then sort of , you know, kind of twenty or more people and you've got a reasonable chance of showing up some, some P less than point O fives."
"Erm  I don't know that's, this is not in any official stats books but it's just my experience with students' projects that if you get more than, there's a sort of critical mass of about, about forty respondents and then you're much more likely to start showing some interesting statistically significant findings for some reason, erm I don't quite know why but er   it's one of life's little mysteries but er so that's  usually if there's a lot of numerical data what I'd try and advise people to er to get."
Oh that's
"So you know I mean more than that by all means, you know, er so much the better, you know y the more the merrier but erm certainly you know kind of it's a good idea to at least try and get that many erm"
Yeah.
so er
"I've got, I've got in touch with a football supporters society"
Mm.
and erm they've got eighty members so
Oh right.
Mhm.
"so they're like sending me a list, well they sent me back a  half list"
Mm.
I said to them can I have a list they said oh yeah sure she went we'll put it in your
Mm.
"Okay, how does that affect trade?"
Well it's easier to transport things overseas or wherever.
"Also storage is easier, improving"
"Right, super, anything else?"
Population growth.
"Yes, populations have, have increased."
Technology.
"Yep, I mean that might in a sense"
"Yes, we're gonna get"
"Transport technology has er, certainly er, certainly improved."
"Right, okay, so, in ge in general, we can say that world trade has risen over time due to essentially, well, is that, is there anything else that?"
"more countries have er, a big surplus, and more countries having a big deficit in food supply"
Yes
so therefore
"so that says something about specialization of production possibly, that countries are now more highly specialized than they once were."
"Yep, I mean, that in a way is a function of, leagues with which international trade can be conducted."
"You know, if you, if international trade is very difficult as it was, say two hundred years ago, then you've got to be self sufficient."
"Whereas, erm, you can now exploit individual countries comparative advantage of this trade erm, is, is rel is relatively er, is relatively easy."
"Are there any other factors, that might have increased, for an incre might have led to an increase in world trade?"
"Rising population, improving transport and technologies."
"I know this might sound obscure, but erm, I read somewhere when  that erm, if you actually bring in protectionism, it sounds like it could actually increase trade."
If you bring in protectionism?
"Don't know how it worked, as in"
"As of, liberalize, or if you increase"
"No, if you actually, you know, if you have a little protectionism, it does actually lead to an increase in trade, but I don't know how that works."
Neither do I.
"No it doesn't, you know it doesn't."
I really didn't expect
"Right, okay, let's say that's a new one on me."
Okay.
"Well, we'll come onto protectionism in er, in a minute."
"What other factors, there's a big, this fact that we're missing, alright, rising population, improvements in transport and technology, what else has happened over the last hundred years?"
"but you, you've, you build up the strength in yourself and believe that your, your in vulnerable and then to find out that you are vulnerable, it really scary"
"yeah I think that's a very good point that, that the fact that you've lost control whether its of your, your own personal safety"
yeah
"or, or your, or your property or, or the people you care for, yes"
"I was actually flashed at er in the library and what I thought of I would of done was completely different to what I actually did, erm, I thought I would of been quite calm about it, but in fact I ran out the library and I ran straight back to my flat erm, I was at that point I think about twenty one"
mm
"and I'd just finished training as a nurse and I thought I was really cool and calm and I would of reported it, but I didn't"
you didn't?
no
why was that?
I think I was about twenty one several years ago now
"oh, I see"
"well its interesting that you've remembered it, I mean do you wish you had reported it?"
"yes, yes"
yeah
and its lasted the memory of it and I do wish I had reported it or at least gone to the library staff.
there
"I am a victim support counsellor and why is it that criminals get all the help you know when they don't give help to the, the victims of crime?"
"is that your feeling that, that criminals get more help than victims?"
well they get lawyers and all the supports
"what's, what's , what's the general view on that?"
"to because we've got the Legal Aid system, but I mean my son was also a repeated robbed in his car and what shocked me was the, the police they said to me you shouldn't have a pretty car any way, he had a brand new X R three"
"you shouldn't have a pretty car, I mean that is nonsense"
"mm, yes"
"so he's got an old banger now, you know, they don't break into it."
"As a police officer, any woman who do decide to report a crime to us they are offered quite a lot of advise"
"mm, mm"
"we refer victims onto victim support groups, if its a case of rape then their passed on to the rape counsellor's and also"
"survivor's, we will be with er a victim all the way through the enquiry and if at the end of that enquiry they will also be given details of the criminal injury's compensation board."
"In your experience is there er, er a distinct failure on the part of people, I don't know whether you'd say men or women to report a lot of crime, I mean I don't, I don't know whether you can assess what proportion of crime's aren't reported?"
I think there's always a fear to come forward and bring the details of a crime out into the open
mm
"Well the  miners er were middle of the road, as lots of miners are now, but er probably more middle then because, well, the Colliery Chapel and the Co-op were a way of life."
Mm.
What about ?
", of course, was a chapel man and er I think they saw, or some of them saw him er a in him a way round, out of things, and, of course , he did deals with the collieries to get people back to work, and whilst  families had enjoyed six months in the gardens and doing all sorts of strange things, erm the men mainly wanted to get back to work, because they saw time running out."
Mm.
W was the Strike a period of hardship particularly?
"It was hardship in this, that er, perhaps the hardest time came after it when er, well it was called public assistance then, social security payments had to be payed back."
"All the things that you'd had during the Strike, but things did get left, and er tradesmen were very considerate, there was no chasing for m hard for money and er I know we had an insurance that wasn't paid and we used the book to have an imaginary shilling on a horse each day."
"Which put me off gambling for good, because whilst we won every day, it seemed, we'd lost a lot of money at the end of the year."
"Theoretically we hadn't done, but, of course, we hadn't played anything, but it was good exercise."
Mm.
"Well moving onto social life, what are your childhood memories of of playing and  with your your father and playmates, etc?"
"Well, of course, er f er Fathers and grandfathers er took er the youngster a walk ."
"Er there was walking, there was cricket and er billiards, erm street games, things you can't do now because of traffic."
"But a lot more, I feel sorry for my grandchildren, where they can't have as much fun as I used to have, kicking a tin."
Mm.
Did did church figure as prominently in your early life ?
"Oh cha chapel Later on, I mean er you know when you got to ten, eleven,ch there were so many things at chapel, I mean from learned dissertations, I mean the gentlemen from the University, here."
"Er Prof  and , used to come and talk to the Guilds and things, er the men's meeting."
And er then there were the concerts or the pantomimes or the operettas.
"I always finished up as a bandit, or a pirate, I don't know quite why."
I couldn't sing.
"But equally they did Silas Marner and er Merchant of Venice, a good standard, too."
So is th is a idea of a chapel being more in the community than just religion?
Is that  ?
"Oh yes, it was a very much a community centre, I mean,we played billiards at chapel, and various chapel people had billiard tables un under their dining table and er we u just go and play billiards."
"Going back to the your mining background, erm after the Strike were were your father and grandfather members of both the Nottingham Miners Associa Association and the industrial union?"
"Erm, yes."
My grandfather became involved because  's union er made a big thing out of compensation cases.
"Compensation had to be fought for, it wasn't a matter of right, and a piece of a very small piece of coal fell down the shaft, the onsetter's the man at the bottom, and it  through his hand and he got compensation and then my father was sacked for  the shovel."
"Too much of a coincidence,I'm afraid, to  our minds."
"Do you think the two were connected, then?"
You were born in India on the mission field  and through your family's experience and your own you've brought to the convenorship of the Board a great personal interest in the overseas church and in international affairs.
For several years here in Edinburgh  you have been the presbytery's World Mission and Unity convenor and then you became the convenor of the Board's local involvement committee which links our congregations to people who work overseas in churches there with whom they serve.
"As the convenor of the Board since nineteen eighty eight you have visited the European work of the Board in Rotterdam, in Paris, in Budapest and in Prague  also in Israel and Egypt  and you have represented the Board at meetings of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches ."
Hugh you have shown throughout all of your work a deep concern for the people working abroad  for our partner churches  and for our ecumenical relations  and the need to keep these matters to the fore of the church and also of our country.
Hugh you and I share the gift of a very unusual christian name.
I understand it's the only way in which these letters are arranged in the anglosaxon language and is often used as an example of such.
It's a very difficult name at times to live up to I'm sure because the word Hugh literally means mind or soul  and it is important that we seek indeed to live up to what our names mean.
You have certainly applied your mind to the work of the Board and you have encouraged its vision and its direction through your intellectual gifts and perceptions and insights.
And you've also brought your soul to bear on the work of the Board and the work of the church.
Within the assembly council I personally valued your contributions  the very courteous and thoughtful way in which you presented these  and the courage with which you expressed at times the stand that you had to take for the interest of the Board.
"And yet above that and beyond that what you were seeking to do was not just to serve the Board of World Mission and Unity, it was to serve what you believed was the good and right for the church of god which you have sought to serve and to support and to take further."
"For that contribution, and for that depth of spirituality within yourself which you have brought to bear for the benefit of the work of this Board and for that of our whole church, we want to thank you very much indeed this morning."
I'm delighted and I'm sure you'll be delighted to hear the advice of the business convenor that we suspend at this point in time.
"And we, we recons we, we, we  we come back to continue our meeting at two o'clock this afternoon."
We adjourn until two o'clock.
She's been dead four years.
Oh!
"It was, it was bad that  she used to  those draws that bad that after so long  you'd see him go all white and then you'd gradually see round the crutch  then so, more"
Yeah but
Right!
I
And then all of a sudden after so long you saw a new Alf.
Mm.
"But, you never  there's never a pair of underpants."
"You might see a pair of  long johns, then long johns, and a pair of socks, but Paul said they've opened windows and Trevor said  it's nearly knocked him off the ladder."
"He said to Paul, you've done, cos, I think first time he painted it, Paul, he had to paint it wi windows shut, they wouldn't open window."
No?
No.
"So I said to Paul, well you've done well getting windows open."
And even nets are down.
"But ah, I've gone in and opened it, it  stinks."

"yeah, look yeah, I'm just  yeah, yeah"
"The next item is the election of vice chairman  erm, do you wish to defer this item?"

That is deferred.
Next item is apologies
no apologies
"Item five chairman's announcement, there are two."

Mr  in respect of item seventeen the environmental strategy
Thank you.
"Item seven, members allowances, cash limits."
"erm I'll like to deal with this in a if possible in a number of separate motions so that we can deal with the various bits of work that need to be done, but I'll call Mr  first"
"Thank you chair, erm, in likelihood that I, I mean you may wish to these separately as well but I'll  group wish to see, is to, a is to approve an extension of the maximum aggregate by five per cent, b officers continue to monitor expenditure reporting to group leaders monthly and c officers and group leaders look into the allowance scheme to see if any suitable alterations need to be made."
"Yes, erm, I had in mind that, is there a seconder to that?my own view is that erm, and that goes for most of the way for dealing with the problem, but I think it would be appropriate for this committee to make it clear that erm, any extension of the maximum aggregate for the current financial year will be met by an appropriate reduction or a corresponding reduction in the expenditure for ninety four ninety five, erm and I'm not certain that that's absolutely clear to the public or indeed to all members of"
Chair
as you say it is legally required
"I mean if, if, if, if the principal of the five per cent is acceptable then if you wish to qualify the  being put in  from the words you said then that is acceptable by the labour group."
"Erm, and er, on other hand he got everything, got his own book out biography"
"Of course, I think if, if, if Freud were here, he would defend himself, by saying I was quite open about my prejudice against Wilson at the beginning of the book, as  reminds us, Freud says quite clearly, how he felt about all this."
"But I think Freud would have also gone on to say that he had very good reason for resenting Wilson, because he blamed Wilson personally for the unjust peace, after er Versailles, but er, was indirectly, many people would argue, going to lead to the Second World War, and er, so Freud's defence I think would be, this man really was responsible."
"Because after all, the situation in my, I don't know, I mean, I don't know how well you know your modern history."
"I'm not certain, I'm not a great expert on it, but erm, the situation seems to be, that after the First World War, the central power was Germany and Austria, were defeated."
"Er, France, er was, er battle ravaged and its economy in ruins."
"This country was bankrupt, and had to borrow money from the United States of America to keep going, and er, Russia had just had a revolution and was still in chaos."
"So the United States was really the only world power erm, erm, as were able to do anything."
"In, in some ways, the situation you know, was a bit like, like what it is now, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, only more so, I would say, because the, the other powers were more, were even more prostrate than is, is, is the situation today."
"So  for a while, the President of the United States effectively had world power, there was no other power in the world who could stand up to the U S, er, after, after, World War One for one argument anyway, and I think Freud's er, defence disposition would be, Woodrow Wilson was the man who came to Europe, saying he would bring a just peace for all, and went away leaving a total mess, and, and, Freud's er argument in his book is, told us was, well, the mess er, was really Wilson's own doing, and if it was his doing, what was it in his character that allowed him to er,si to  on some Lloyd George, who bullied him into getting most of what they wanted."
"So, that would be Freud's defence, now, I suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history, to, to know, if this was really true or not, but erm, the  the er, question that Freud was really asking himself, really was, why did Wilson let us down, because Freud admits that he regarded Wilson, when he came to Europe as a saviour."
"You know, here, here was somebody coming from outside Europe who would bring, you know, peace and justice for all."
"Let's hope, I quoted the American Constitution correctly, did I?"
"Erm, you know, perhaps the kind of way people look on President  today."
"You know, which is only day one of his inauguration."
"We'll see what happens to him, President ."
"But erm, that would be for its, for its er,defence, I suppose."
"Is it fallible  I mean how do, how do modern America let's ask er  and erm, er and ."
How do modern Americans see Woodrow Wilson?
Erm
What's your image of him?
"er, I don't know, I think he forgot  you know,"
Yeah
"I don't, I don't"
I remembered him having  in my school library
Mm.
he was regarded as a very very smart man
Mm.
"and er, one of our most intellectual presidents."
Yeah.
"And I don't think, I don't think most people considered him vulnerable, very vulnerable."
"I mean, they know that  working"
"And when Mrs Thatcher, when Lady Thatcher, talks about the Thatcher inheritance, that much more sincure being that much more secure ."
I I have always been worried about the personalization of er what I believe is the great traditions in the Tory party.
"I know I've worked for Churchill, Eden, MacMillan, Hulme, Heath, Thatcher, we never had this personalization of the great traditions until very recently."
"And frankly I think it and I hope to God that John I d I know he doesn't want to see it happen to him, I hope to God it doesn't."
"Because it it's it's it's a I mean frankly it it gives the impression that this remarkable political force which has governed a democracy longer than any other political f party in history, has somehow or other created a new philosophy in the last ten years."
Mi
What have we been doing all this time?
"Michael Heseltine I'll have to stop you there, thank you very much indeed."
Thank you.
Michael Heseltine talking to me a little earlier today.
And now to the government's plan to sell off British Rail.
"Before the summer holidays, the House of Lords carried an amendment moved by Lord Peyton a former Conservative minister, which allows British rail to bid against private companies for franchises to operate services."
the transport secretary John Macgregor has been totally opposed to that because it would mean nothing changing in effect.
"B R would still run B R. However, as David Walter discovered, he may not have enough troops in the Commons to reverse that amendment."
"The Gatwick express, on the fast track to the private sector."
"today this becomes the first railway shadow franchise, its operations hived off into a separate company ready to be sold."
"These plans are running to schedule, the rest of rail privatization is not."
The problem is Lord Peyton's amendment in the Lords last Summer.
"That allowed British Railways itself to bid for franchises, something the original bill rules out."
"The government fears that it wrecks the bill, that b R with an unfair advantage over its competitors, could keep lines like this in its clutches."
But lord Peyton has many fellow travellers in the Commons.
"Since we had the debates in June, we've had the unfortunate experience er of stagecoach."
Which basically found it couldn't make a railway service run and dropped it.
"We've had the winter timetable which er proposes some quite serious cuts in services, and we've had of course, the constant rumour off fairs increases."
"So for all those reasons, I think my colleagues may be more inclined to go for a cautious approach that's enshrined in the Peyton approach, than they were back in er June."
"I think the government should slow down on all its activities at the present time and concentrate on getting the economy right, and everything else put on the back burner."
And that should apply also w with the railways.
There's no great enthusiasm in in this country for railway privatization.
The railways must be kept together say on the on the Peyton amendment and they could raise money on the private market.
"but it keeps together The idea that they're going to broke up br broken up into competing er items, worries people in my constituency and it also alarms me."
"Tories who feel rebellious about the railways, may not have to push their protest to the point of voting against the government."
"A humiliating defeat which he suffered at the hands of Lord Peyton in the house of Lords, has concentrated John Macgregor's mind."
".. And er this was one of things that my old boss, when people came into name their children, he said Now remember, these initials will go on case, perhaps, one day, and you don't want S A P, or something like that."
"And if they came in a with name that was unusual, er Now, are you sure?"
Do you want a moment  to think about it ?
"You know, when somebody came up with Mehetabelle, or something like that."
"Er but no, er Robin  and the local dramatic club was er very, very good, you're in the market for money, putting on things in the chapel, or in the Co-op hall, at ."
"Hit-the  was usually done in the Co-op hall, and er they were good."
Mm.
"I mean, people didn't pay money just  out of,you know, loyalty, completely."
What about the Spanish Civil War?
Do you remember?
"Well, at that time my best pal went to the pit, his mother wouldn't let him enter in th for scholarship, but he did happen to come here for, Well, he seemed to always get a day's day release from the year dot, I think, and er eventually he got some A levels."
"He got his trade unions things, and his deputy's certificate, and that."
"But then, he got some A levels and he's finally got an Open University degree, good luck to him."
"And er we used to go occasionally to W E A meetings, in the library at , and er I wasn't a member of his class, but I did once go and hear Hugh , when he was at Nottingham."
"And er then er we had er a tutor who was very, very keen and we nearly all went to er the Spanish Civil War, and we took er the er paper for ages, erm and er But one of the group did go, Frank  from , went, but the  were always Communist, they never claimed to be Labour."
"But er they were always er well-remembered, and er w Spanish Civil War through, I suppose nowadays, you call them fringe newspapers, but there was this paper we used to get at the tim at the time It wasn't the er Morning Star, or even it's predecessor, erm but you got a paper and you sort of heard the other side."
"Erm er, very concerned as to what it was going to lead up to up, and hoping, you know, against hope that's you weren't going to be involved in anything like that."
Mm.
And my Grandmother certainly wouldn't have wanted me going She had er her feet very firmly on the ground.
"I hadn't realized till long, long afterwards, until she after she was dead, that er she and her brother came to work, when the Midland Railway came to Nottingham, they left Norfolk, and he's got a horse, as a carter, and they walked from Holt, in Norfolk, to Nottingham, in search of a job."
"And they went to live at , and"
Wh what about the Sec Second World War?
The Second World War?
"Well, originally er I was involved in er registration, because there, with this very loose connection with the registrar, by now I was full time with the council, as rating assistant and rent collector."
"And er I got involved on national registration and er, on one occasion, we were working, we'd got a deadline and we were working through the weekend, and my wife came to pick me up at what she thought was a reasonable time, at one o'clock on Saturday, found she was given a cup of tea and set to work, and we finished, going home about midnight.."
So would you would you work overtime a lot ?
"Oh yes, you worked overtime, for which there was no pay, I mean, it didn't count er You see things , you know, there was less structure about it, then, erm and you could have ti if you wanted time off for something, you'd probably have got it fairly easily, but er it didn't seem to be the great arguments that you've had since."
"And of course, er by nineteen forty erm well, Christmas thirty nine, I'd got my calling up papers."
Were you on th ?
"You were on the point of getting married, by that time,?"
No.
"I We'd talked about it and said Well, we're not going to get married whilst war's on, as er probably the generation before, had said in nineteen fourteen, and er we got married eventually on the first of December, nineteen forty."
"There will be the closures and mothballing of pits, there will be a reduction of Apex jobs under the reorganization now taking place and steps towards privatization will begin."
"Colleagues, the government's inertia in tackling the crisis in industry stems from the fact that it has convinced itself, if not the general public, that there is no problem."
This must be remedied.
I commend my report.
Thank you very much Duncan.
"Page forty, forty one, forty two, forty three, forty four, forty five, yes."
"President, congress."
"Mike , Midlands and East Coast Region."
"Duncan, two things."
First a note of caution on your report on Aerospace.
"You mentioned the Saudi deal has been announced, but so far it's only for the Tornado and not the full go ahead to ."
Excuse me.
Also there's been no announcement so far on the Hawk Trainer which involves most of the four and a half thousand at  as many more in British Aerospace and other companies.
Secondly  for your efforts in putting for the recent joint Delegates Conference on the out-sourcing and that's a company's way and not mine.
"Of the Information and Technology Department by British Aerospace,and that thanks is not used from Apex, it's also from M S S at  or acknowledged it was your efforts and not their  that brought that conference about."
This out-sourcing could put the software technology for the defence of the country into the hands of a foreign-controlled company and it could cost another two thousand British Aerospace jobs.
Thank you Duncan.
"Forty six, forty seven, yes."
"President, congress, Ron , Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, at the moment, as far as I'm aware still employed by British Coal."
"Duncan, Salary and Conditions claim I quote  due to the turmoil within the industry at the time of compiling this report, we have not as yet presented a claim ."
"Duncan, we have now gone seven months without presenting a claim, during which time our members have continued to work hard for the Corporation."
"We are doing our jobs, it is not our fault that the Board Members and the government cannot do theirs, but as usual it is always the workforce who are suffering."
"Don't let us lost a year, if we let them use turmoil in the industry as an excuse for not meeting us, we will never sit round a table with them again."
"We are going to be asking our members to pay a further ten pence a week to maintain front-line services, but they feel they are not getting any."
"Simply Duncan, when are we going to get in there and negotiate before we start losing membership for reasons other than redundancy?"
Thank you.
And forty eight.
Yes.
"President, congress, Ed , Westminster trade union and Political Staffs Branch for the London Region."
"Congress, I think it's only right to draw to your attention that in item five B USDAW that at the last USDAW Conference there was a motion passed saying that there should be recognition for the independent trade union within USDAW which is ourselves, G M B Apex."
"However since that time, there has been no recognition granted by USDAW, the main reason for which is the General Secretary, who allegedly had said that because his organization is not a profit making organization, there is no reason to have a trade union there."
Now these are the kind of people we have to deal with and I know Duncan has a problem in USDAW there's Gerry  the negotiator for the London Region.
"So the first point is if you're going to show something show it, let everybody deal with it let everybody look at it then when you've finished with that turn it off because you want the centre of attention to come back to you, presumably."
Even if you've got a series of slides I recommend that you turn it off between each one so that you know the audience don't see the things being put into position or moved about because that can be a bit distracting so er it does mean that you'd obviously need to know where the on off switch is and and this is a nice one because it's it's right there.
"Now, this this material that we use technically called acetate and the nice thing about is that you can write on with if you get acetate pens so you can freehand to produce sketches, diagrams etcetera."
"Obviously you can have photocopies or laser prints copied on to this material, but I have here some pens and a box of blank acetates which you will have the opportunity later to use if you so wish."
Now we've got a variety of colours there.
"We've got two four six eight colour, okay."
If you want to make a point if something's you want to make more emphasis than others then there is a hierarchy to these colours on this transmitted light.
Okay this is light being transmitted through these colours and up on to the screen.
So I have a list here now it isn't in the notes so you might just want to make a note of this.
The hierarchy of colours
What's the theory behind that?
It's it's the brain right brain response to colour and it's the response through the eye to the colour.
Some things have more they have more emphasis and they appear more important than others.
You'll be interested in some of these colours I I find the order of these quite interesting.
"So the hierarchy of colour, I'm going to just kneel down there I hope you can all see."
"Right at the top of the colours I have here are is purple, I often wonder whether that is the reason why royalty is asso or purple is associated with the royalty, purple robes etcetera."
I don't know interesting.
Interesting question.
"But of the colours we've got here in this list purple is the one that has the most impact, followed by blue"
"Erm, a number of issues will come through in a moment or two, but first of all can we start this morning's business by calling on the Chair of the Standing Orders Committee John , to give report number three."
John.
Thank you.
Standing Orders Committee report number three.
Settle down colleagues please.
"President, congress."
I wish to move a short report on behalf of Standing Orders Committee.
"London Region have withdrawn motion fifty two, due for debate on Wednesday afternoon."
"Northern Region have withdrawn motion eighty two, due for debate on Wednesday morning."
The Committee has accepted an emergency motion Proposed Redundancies at A B B Transport Limited to be moved by Midlands and East Coast Region as emergency motion number three.
We would ask national officers to respect a time limit allowed for their reports.
"President, congress, I move this report."
"Modern archaeology is much more scientific and it's, it tends to excavate entire layers, layer, by layer and every little thing is relevant, you know, they, the little pot shard, erm, even bits of excrement, apparently are very interesting to archaeologists, because they're sure people were eating, and things like this, er, you know, remnants of fire was charcoal, everything."
"All of this is, is just good as well as bits of gold and er and, and you know metal objects, that have always traditionally been interesting to archaeologists."
"And that's rather like modern analysis, everything is interesting."
"It's not just what is repressed, it's the structures of the ego that bring about these repressions, the identifications and so on."
"So it's a more complete er picture, of, of, of the personality, and of course it lends itself to this kind of historical portraiture ."
"Because as  says, er, the unconscious is, as a sense, is always hidden, so how do you possibly find out about the unconscious of historical figures that are dead and gone?"
"Well, the answer is with very very great difficulty."
"But if you were looking at their egos as well, er their whole personality had its defence disrupted, then of course , you may be able to see a bit more, because you are now looking at areas which are co both conscious and manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways."
"Does that answer your, your point?"
"Yeah, I suppose I was thinking, I, I always get mixed up when you say psychoanalysis"
Mm.
"I just want to  you know modern days was just confusing me and er, all this sort of thing."
"Whereas I think it easy, you know sometimes I get confused about what's what"
Right.
"So, when, when I talk about psychoanalysis in this course, I mean mainly Freudian classical, because it's Freud's writings we're looking at."
"Admittedly, another aspect of the whole thing, as you rightly say, is that there's been a burgeoning and a lot of different schools, and of course different schools give emphasis to different, different kinds of things."
"And that's a further complicating factor, of course."
"Well, it's just coming up to eleven o'clock, who haven't we heard from, er, right, you've been very very quiet there."
There.
"Have you got anything, any comments you want to say about this?"
"I mean, I didn't read the book."
No.
No.
"Er, I must admit I   point Freud makes,slightly arrogant erm, I mean it, he's, he's, he's a"
Yeah.
Mm.
His father's  you know there's  peace conference in nineteen eighteen
Yeah.
"Did you think that, that, that, that their approach was arrogant and their, the, the affect was trivializing?"
"Well, not really, no."
that weren't the impression that I got.
"The actual book, arise that book anyhow, mm."
I've tried to make them a little bit longer.
Any plans?
"Well I, obviously want to try and attend meetings if and when possible, er I've been to one last week, which basically was er  because I don't feel I'm qualified to get up and  David  got up and spoke very well actually, he was always, at the police not neighbourhood watch, er to do with the cascade telephone system which we found out afterwards, after a three quarters hour debate a man came up to Dave afterwards and showed him a memo which said this cascade system has now ceased in November nineteen ninety-two and that was the the abuse on that particular meeting."
I do intend to er to attend inaugural meetings with each of the C P O s er with a view to looking I mean obviously at some stages you said to me that I would probably have to attend at short notice
Mm
probably by going to these meetings I can pick up the be best practice for ideas which can be passed on to the others
"If anybody hears of any neighbourhood watch group meetings, I think make sure Paul knows about it so he can attend where possible"
Yeah
Like him to go and look at the one at er the at er  which seems to be a successful one
"Well I went to the  last week and I did say that I'd like to go to that one, I'll go to as many as I can"
Yeah
"what I would like and I'm sure it happens with the previous C P O er and I have been notified by telephone and I keep saying to them let me know, but I would like probably a memo from each C P O to say that there is a meeting on this particular night."
Do you mean inaugural meetings
Well an any meetings really because I think if I can er show my face at these meetings it might er I mean I think whether or not it's because of the increase in burglaries or whether it's because of the publicity via David we seem to have had er a hell of a lot of er enquiries about the schemes.
More than normal Tracy ain't it?
Yeah I think so
Yeah
Okay er
It's amazing that he's
"What you saying that for Jed, how long you been saying that for?"
"Yeah I know, but there has ain't there, you know but I say that and I live in an area where there's not a neighbourhood watch scheme and I ain't setting one up to until I retire"
"As crime goes up, people see it as a way of protecting their property don't they"
Yes
seventeen per cent of reported crime is up
mm
"Erm, may I make a comment on neighbourhood watch, I went to er a job the other day, it was a theatre, I was off duty and er I got tapped on the shoulder by my local neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who said, nine months ago I resigned, I wrote a letter to headquarters, I wrote a letter to the divisional commander, and I wrote a letter to the local constable, and nobody's replied to me and they still keep sending me papers are you gonna get your act together, now I I have brought this up before, we never ever have let a neighbourhood watch scheme lapse, it's nothing to do with you, this is all before you came"
no
Er we just kept them on and there's I know quite a few schemes have stopped working but we've still got them written down somewhere
probably now we started it might be well worth while g getting rid of some of these schemes that aren't operating
Are you saying then that when one's lapsed for six months or over a given period of time we should actually go out there and remove the signs
Yeah

Thank you award winners and thank you all  for your contribution to Save The Children Fund.
Now I have some er  parish notices for you all.

"These meetings are  Making the most of the seventy fifth in shops, Involving young people in singing for the seventy fifth, Branches sharing fund raising ideas for the seventy fifth and Small World Theatre extracts from  Moving, a play on the theme of refugees."
Now these are taking place between one and two this afternoon.

A colour coded system will be in operation to help you find your way around those fringe meetings.
Now I just want to end this morning session by reminding you to be in your seats by two twenty.
We have a speaker  er  Patricia Routledge in her guise as Mrs Bucket or Mrs Bouquet she would not be very pleased if you were late.
For one of her candle-lit after-lunch speeches.

"interesting as well as a er  edible lunch  er we're very pleased now to start away the afternoon session  and I'm particularly pleased to be able to introduce Patricia Routledge, she's an actress with so many parts in so many media that I'm not going to make any further introduction, but merely to ask her to come up and speak to us."
"When she has finished Sally Barker, branches advisory committee chairman, will make her presentation."
Thank you very much.
"Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen."
It is a particular privilege for me to be here today and part of me feels not totally qualified.
I have over the years  sent my postal order regularly and it wasn't until  two years ago that I became more actively involved in the work of Save The Children fund raising.
"I was invited to give an entertainment at the Bristol Old Vic theatre, the wonderful old Theatre Royal, the oldest extant theatre still being used in the country and one of the oldest in the world, a very beautiful place  erm and I was asked if I would do an entertainment that I have called Come for the Ride which I was persuaded to concoct by my home town of Birkenhead in the North West of England."
I did it there originally and then did it at festivals all over the country.
"I have a particular affection for Bristol and the West country, I'd like you know that, those of you who've come all the way to London from the West and I so I was very happy to have this evening and be able with er an accompanist and musical director, to provide entertainment that would raise money."
I was told early on that it was possible that your Royal Highness would be able to be there and indeed you were and it gave us all  one of the most unforgettable nights.
"I remember after the show you spoke  for twelve minutes without a note and not only that but you came round afterwards and spent eight or ten minutes with us, the artists, which absolutely made our evening."
It seems to me that that attention to the moment is significant of the great work that you do for this particular charity.
"Now I recently have accumulated unto myself, a notoriety that I didn't originally seek."
And certainly didn't expect  but everywhere I go it comes at me.
It gives me great pleasure because people are extremely kind and extremely generous.
Thank you.

Sharon Watson Craven District Council.
Er I think from Craven's point of view erm we couldn't really see any justification for a strategic exceptions policy in Craven's case.
Erm Craven's economic development strategy is based on  growth amongst small local businesses erm and we have very few large employers.
Erm mos mostly our economic base is through small businesses and that's where we see er the future growth of employment needs being satisfied.
Erm I perhaps do have some sympathy for Harrogate's position.
"Erm they perceive a need for this policy, er they have a a perceived structural changes in their economy and er there is resultant fear erm that perhaps they would not be able to respond flexibly enough er with the policies that are in place and see a need for this additional one."
"From a purely selfish point of view, if the policy were to indicate specific areas of the county erm where this policy would er be appropriate and would apply erm and as long as it excluded Craven , then I think"
clearly you know we've er  it being in.
"How however, I mean from a a broader point of view I think I would have some general reservations as have been confessed previously by Mr Earle and and Mr Jewitt."
Erm but I do have some sympathy with Harrogate's position and indeed Selby's position er to some extent.
But certainly in the Craven context I do not feel there is any justification for this policy.
No I think your neighbours to the south have a different perception to Craven's strategic role.
Yes they do.
If only in housing.
Mr Rudd.
Julian Rudd Ryedale District Council.
It's obviously time for all the districts to nail their cause to the mast.
"If I could make clear that should the panel consider applying the exceptions policy to particular districts within the council with the county in fact, then Ryedale stands alongside Hambleton and Craven and Scarborough and Richmondshire have enormous misgivings about the application of this policy certainly to our district."
Thank you.
Mr Saunders.
Thank you sir.
S Saun Les Saunders D O E.
In in making our representations about erm a major exceptions policy erm the regional office had thought of it very much as a a facilitating policy to deal only with exceptional cases.
Erm certainly we'd not anticipated that it would outweigh existing structure plan policies or outweigh existing Policy E two.
Erm it would be for the the policy itself to define the criteria such that it did only refer to exceptional circumstances and the occasional one or two cases.
I'd I'd submit the erm Humberside Policy E four erm not exactly as a as a model policy or even as best practice.
You may get one example of of what in a joint local authority have done.
Perhaps if we if we looked a little at Humberside's experience.
Erm to the best of my knowledge erm Policy E four has been utilized only one since this structure plan was approved in in nineteen eight seven er enabling erm one the districts and myself back to the Humber to to acquire an an international erm company.
Erm but it hasn't to the best of my knowledge it has not resulted in a rash of of developments and motorway intersections.
"Right, okay."
"Why might we, we be in big trouble if it's a problem?"
"What, what you going to eat?"
"Well, could we not import?"
"Exactly, and then if the world broke, world war breaks out?"
"Okay, so there, there is this strategic argument."
"Okay, but why do we get the, the main thrust of erm, to the economic argument seems to be that we ought to be liberalizing, we ought to be facing that erm, that problem."
"You know, that problem isn't the most important one."
"Why, why do we want to liberalize world trade?"
So we can reduce the prices that we have to pay for everything.
"You know, beef and things that we have to import from the E C at the moment, we could import from like, New Zealand."
It's far away but it's a lot cheaper to produce.
"Okay, so consumers would benefit erm, from liberalization."
"Presumably, also tax payers would erm, tax payer cost of er, the Common Agricultural Policies is substantial, and most the support comes from er, most of the support under the Common Agricultural Policy is given er, in terms of higher food prices that consumers pay."
"There is a different n there is also however, a tax payer burden in that some of our taxes that we pay to go erm, into agricultural support, I mean V A T for example."
"Virtually all of V A T goes to , you know."
"You know, you pay V A T on everything, er, so consumers would benefit, alright, in er, protecting countries, tax payers should benefit in protected countries."
Any other beneficiaries?
Developing countries may now find a market.
"That's right, so implications there for developing countries, who are typically very dependent on agricultural exports as a source of export earnings."
It's through foreign exchange earnings that they can develop.
"Right, if you're cutting off their, their lifeline to development, you're probably sowing the seeds of er, of disaster further down the line."
"It's not only the developing countries that are dependent upon agricultural exports, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, other what you might not call developing countries, are also erm, reliant upon, is reliant upon agricultural trade."
"So, who, who are the beneficiaries, are there, are there any beneficiaries at the moment of liberalization?"
"Clearly farmers in protecting countries benefit,any anybody else that benefits?"
From protectionism?
"Mm  say if you're on the world, if you, if you're a net importer, right, erm, and you're buying your food commodities from the world market, you must have been rubbing your hands over the last fifty years cos you're getting , you're buying, you're buying a food commodities will lower, lower prices than you would have done in the presence of free trade, cos there's all this dumping and European surpluses, you know   Come in"
Yes he is here
Win
"Yes, erm, Sue's after you, if you going, she wants to know, can you go to lunch in ten minutes?"
"When,"
One o'clock
.
"Right, I hope, we won't be to long now, perhaps if we could just bring up the item you wanted to mention."
"Yeah, erm, right, yeah, that's all the other items, erm  what's been er been going through my head recently is, is er the, looking at the pattern of the meetings and the way the meetings are arranged and, and how, erm, at the last meeting we had a speaker er and that I think, we all found that quite interesting and the one, one from Central America that things  and I feel we ought to have that much more frequently than we do have er, a, either a speaker or a focus of some sort of meetings erm, so I think that's something I'd like to raise and get the A G M at the next meeting I think similar thing we ought to consider there."
"Erm, quite how we arrange cos this, as Margaret says there's a lot of business to get through on occasions, but er, this, this meeting seems to had a lot, but, you know, er whether we could alternate er a business meeting with a, a, a speaker so I thought functional meeting every two months and a speaker attending er, er the other month, erm, I'm really sussing it open for ideas, what, what do other people feel and"
Maybe we should have speaker on a separate night .
"mm, well, this, or is everybody happy with the, the format as it is? er."
Is it not  but er
Yeah.
"Speaker's a very good idea, but difficult to organise,"
Mm.
"I think a, every so often it'll be very interesting, very sort of, we did try this once didn't we?"
"This, this has cropped up before, oh yes this idea of trying to change this ."
"Michael , Michael  started the ball rolling in my mind, er, yes he, he, I, one thing erm  yesterday, erm one thing he, he started to coming to more meetings last year and erm I think he'd seen one or two people come along and not,"
Mm.
"a couple of new people come along and then, not, not follow up"
"Yes, there can be."
"mm, erm, and he wh you know he is thinking well is this, is that the reason erm, so er, I don't know, you know, er, I, I think perhaps it's worth looking at, perhaps we can all thing about it and have a look at it at the A G M."
"I think, I think it would be a good idea to have, as every sort of maybe every two or three meetings to have something a bit different erm, and we do, we do find if we want to get through the business quickly"
We can.
"we can, we can."
We can.
pressure.
"We can do, we've just got to, I mean we've just got to ask everyone to give a very brief report erm on another occasion and then it can be kept very short, I think though, there are, there are times when, when, you know, we do want to hear what's going on with sort of er networks and campaigns, we do need that time as well don't we, er so we can't, I don't think we can always do it."
"Well I'm, yeah, ern I wondered about sort of Executive Committee and er, I know you're not very keen on that idea and it, it does tend to remove information from the ordinary members, if, if, you have a small group of people dealing with the business and, a, a separate lead."
We have had that in the past haven't we?
We
I can't remember.
"Remember we used to have a prisoner group didn't we, when I first came so that the"
"What groups, yeah groups for particular things on, on the, you know like campaigns or prisoners there were special groups dealing only with this those, they met on there own, not  there weren't any"
Schools groups.
"yes, the schools group, yes, I mean, that, that could operate more, in fact we could have, instead of having just talking about the, about the India one, er instead of having one person  at it, it could be a group of, of three perhaps, er ."
But then they'd still presumably report back to the main group about what they'd been doing.
Right.
"So, so there are two bits, there's, one is th that you need the  the, the, the evidence from the north is that you need mobilization in order to get land reform and the way to get mobilization is rent reduction, interest rate reduction and then sort of the, the struggle meetings and that provides the activism  to go to land reforms and the other bit is, is the military one,th that you've learned that if you're going to go through with land reform and keep the support, you've got to make sure you've got your military security first."
"Erm and because in, even in nineteen forty eight, you couldn't guarantee that"
"you were better off to, to play it cautiously."
"If you put the two together erm you  i it becomes understandable  why they, they adopted these policies to the south, even though sort of from what happened the first time particularly in a retrospective way, the expectation would be  you would, this would be the are where you would go for land reform straight away."
"I mean in, in, in retrospect they probably could've achieved it  because they, they got the military er they, they, they did get the military security and  you probably could've afforded actually to, to mobilize the peasants through land reform."
"I if, if you could have got some cadres on the ground, you know, so, so the other bit of this is  is if you are going to go for land reform you've got to have, not just the military presence and military security, but enough trained  honest  highly motivated cadres."
Surely erm part of the problem
Ah right.
obviously
"Right so we, we, we also need a new  land reform document, because we can't use the  because egalitarianism we've, we've recognized from the experience of the north is wrong, that's not gonna work so we need something else."
Right.
Fine.
"So one of the things we're going to, to do is to, to see what that new land reform document might be."
Before we do that can I just take up one other point.
", sorry"
"two reasons  policy, one was the er military secured area"
Erm   what was your question?
"Wouldn't, wouldn't you need the peasant mobilization first?"
Yes.
Before the land re before you could have successful land reform.
Sorry I lost my place.
Erm
"Erm well th th th yeah but th th th there's, there's  the military security you need erm  you, you need  er tt  you've got to have the, the, the personnel to be able to do it"
Mm.
"and you've recognized that there are dangers if you, if you try and mobilize people too quickly i i it, it needs to be done slowly."
"But is there also the, the, the idea of,a and in a sense  one thing you haven't actually got an appropriate land reform"
so you have to actually figure a new one out before we can
?
"Do you have something like a sort of  guide book, you know how to conduct"
"Ca can we, that, that's  after"
break for coffee.
"What else, before we come on to agricultural products,what, are there any other notable features of trade in manufactures?"
"Alright, it has risen, right, risen very dramatically erm  well, let's try and rephrase this, erm, what's another major reason for the growth of manufacturing trade?"
"Manufacturing trade is, seems to have grown very rapidly, not only because we're producing erm, or con consuming more of a, a particular commodity, but also because consumers like"
Opportunities in taste.
"Changes in taste, yes consumers like"
Consumers like to have variety.
"yes, consumers want more, more variety, as well as just more, more consumption, and this is why, you know, although we produce cars just about in, in the U K, we still import a lot of cars to the U K."
"What's that, what's the process of erm, simultaneous import and export of the same commodity, what's that called?"
"Erm, intra, intra-industry trade."
"Yes, intra-industry trade."
And that's the simultaneous import and export of essentially similar products.
"Alright, now, they're not exactly the same products, but they are very similar."
"You know, erm, as far as the statistics might go, you know, a car is a car is a car."
"So you lump them all together, but we know as consumers, that, the Skoda is inherently different to the Lamborghini or something, alright."
Excuse me.
"Hello, Tim  speaking."
Hello Marina.
"Very well thanks, and yourself?"
"Right  Mhm  essentially yeah, use it as a, erm, as a motivation for the, for the tutorial erm,partic particularly the, the first part of it, talking about GATT, sort of erm, the er, sort of characteristics of trade, how it's changed, indication of protectionism."
"No, no they don't."
"Well, yes it should, it should be, and there's some good figures in there that you may want to tell the students about, and then what I would do is recommend that they have a look at it because the current issue."
That came out of the Current Issues in Agricultural Economics book.
"Alright, if you tell them erm, that's where it came from, there are copies in the library, it might be a good idea that they have a look at it."
Alright?
"That's it, that's o that's okay, I don't think there's anything else, okay, yes, okay, cheerio, then Marina, bye ."
"Right,erm, yes, so,inder intra-industry trade is growing very, very rapidly  and that, and this is, sort of the main, one of the main reasons why trade in manufactures has grown rapidly, rapidly."
"Why's intra-indu intra, intra-industry trade grown?"
"Well, as consumers, we like to er, consume differentiated products, right."
"Manufactured goods are easily differentiated, right, you've only got to bung power steering on a car, or a few go, go faster stripes and you have you know, sort of, to the consumer, a different product."
"Right, although it is still a car, it's, it has different attributes."
"Alright, so there's plenty of scope for differentiation, product differentiation."
"And also, erm, there's great scope for economies of scale er, in manufactured goods, therefore consumers can benefit, right from er, exploiting the comparative advantage in particular, in particular countries."
Increased consumption.
"Yes, that's right, or right"
Income.
"Yes, income, that's right, incomes have risen, er, and as a result we're consuming more goods, consuming more goods  it, it followed, well not automatically, but there's a likelihood that trade will also, will also rise."
"Okay, so, that's, they're the reasons to account for the rise in absolute values of er, trade in all commodities, what about erm, why has the er, trade in manufactures er, increased as a proportion of total trade?"
"I mean, it's not divorced from the things that we've just been talking about"
"Well, cos incomes have risen so, there's more consumption"
Okay.
"Specialization as well, er"
"Good  right okay, I mean, what income elasticities of demand for"
"Higher for manufactured goods, or high relative to agricultural goods"
"Okay, so, because income elasticities of demand are generally high for manufactured goods as the world economy gets richer, it will want to consume proportionately more of those."
"Right, now, we could all become self sufficient, alright."
But why don't we be become more self sufficient?
"You know, we can produc we could consume a lot more manufactured goods, but that doesn't necessarily mean that trade will rise."
"It's likely that trade will rise, but it doesn't automatically follow."
What's also happened to trade in manufactures?
It's specialized
"That's right, okay."
"to, well, produce constant"
"Yes, that's right, you've got  because the, the market for er, any one say manufactured goods, in theory could be a, a world market now because there are relatively cheap methods of transporting this er, this particular good."
"What's happened is because the potential market has risen, firms have specialized."
"Alright, and this is why we get, erm, cars are an excellent example of this erm."
"You know, Toyota, Toyota's plant down the road in Derby, massive investment, erm, a huge production capacity."
"That makes all the Toyota Corollas, or whatever, not only for the U K, or for Europe, but for all, all, all sales of car throughout, of that particular type of car, throughout the world."
"You know, and even in erm, Japan, they're importing the, the products that are made, made over in Derby."
Why're they doing that?
"It's because manufacturing production erm, or this great scope in manufacturing production for economies of scale."
"Alright, this is why countries have specialized more, because countries specialize more and consumers want to demand,want to consume erm, higher quantities of er, manufactured goods."
Alright.
Trade automatically follows therefore.
"Right, we need the specialization and er, the sort of demand elasticity erm, in that argument to suggest that world tra to explain why world trade has risen."
That is where most of the increase has gone.
"Now erm, Mr  refers to er, er, privileged funding."
This is a total distortion of the true facts.
"In fact erm, there's been less funding per head in Wiltshire, than many other authorities in the country."
Until eighteen months ago
"Wiltshire, it's no use you keep saying it's not true."
"Until eighteen months ago Wiltshire was the most undermanned force in this country, and that's not our figures, that was the Home Office formula which produced that, and because of that eighteen months ago the Home Secretary actually granted this force an extra sixty- seven policemen and he gave none to anybody else."
"I think he gave one, one other county to be fair."
"And that was the reason why, and in fact the total shortfall, the total unmanning was something like a hundred and thirty-five hundred and forty, which is why the police authority has a bid in at this moment for a, a further sixty-eight policemen, which has in fact been backed by the county council, who are prepared to pay for it."
"Now the Home Office has said, the Home Secretary rather, has said this year that he's not granting any more policemen this year, but he also said that if county councils wished to fund more policemen, he would certainly look at that."
"The true fact is we are no longer prepared to fund them, because we've cut the police budget."
"And erm, looking then at base budget which has been mentioned."
The first session we're gonna look at is called Training and .
It's just literally about a twenty minute session.
"The purpose of the session really is to give this training course an overview and also to, to sort of have a  for training."
"What we want to do in this session as I said it will only take about twenty minutes, there are three key things we want to do."
"One, we're going to look at why well trained staff are, are so important to the C U, secondly we're going to look at things responsibility training is and lastly we want to look at a systematic approach that you can take as training."
Those are the three things we're gonna cover in about twenty minutes.
"Well the first thing that we want to think about is  why well trained staff are so important to the company  and  do this  very much a participated session, ignore the tape, I am, I've forgotten about it already!"
So why are well trained staff so important to the company?
You can just shout out any ideas you have so why do we need well trained people?
Productivity.
Productivity.
Yep?
Cost efficiency.
"Much more cost effective isn't it if things to be done once rather than have to do reading them two or three times and generally the reason that things are repeated a number of times is that perhaps people are not really quite sure or not that that are  systems, yet productivity the better trained people are people who can do things, get it right the first time and they can do more work can't they than somebody else you are not having to pick it up as the manager responsible and put mistakes right."
So productivity and cost efficiency.
It gives a good impression
"Yeah, like so many industries we're competing on good service aren't we and if we do things right it does convey a very professional image of C U to, to, to the company, to the, not to the company, to the, to the market place."
I mean you were gonna say something.
Any more?
Well
"It its a big task, em er the thing is that I think that that the first point of call is one is that we get the questionnaire out and see whether you know the one where can we can the questionnaires  to all the neighbourhood watch is it,w w we prepare the questionnaire and we get on and send it out, right."
"Depending on the replies from them in relation to those that have lapsed we then send a second letter to them saying is there anybody that will take over the scheme, if not, right we we intend to remove the signs from the er from the area and then if there is no reply to this letter within fourteen days we you know we'll come and remove the signs."
I think there's a lot of them
"That trawl will bring out a couple of dozen schemes that have totally lapsed, and people will write snotty letters saying I've told you this once before."
Mm yeah
"So great, let's communicate with any other deputies and say if you're not prepared to take it over we'll close the we're afraid the scheme will have to close down."
And
And remove the signs
"And any claim and and please inform your insurance companies,"
"And depending on the area we'll give a photocopy of the map and Derek will fetch 'em in, Derek can take them down."
Who'll  doing
No
"We have that many er applications I mean I've just gone through A division and I've got er a pile of cards literally an inch thick with people a made an initial inquiry or b they've been furnished with questionnaires and not been returned, so I'm sending those er right through the divisions"
Mm
"That's the task of the moment, in between the everyday work."
"Mm, yeah"
Then of course there's this insurance thing to do as well when David's er free and sorted out
Yeah well it's  a lot of that
"Yeah, at least we'll end up with a scheme that's up-to-date and accurate"
Yeah
Well we could also from that by photocopying the er the addresses erm and sending these letters out we might well get updated on the schemes anyway
That er a scheme isn't operating
What about
computerisation of the system to come back to us every twelve months if no contact
"Eventually, yes."
Eventually yes.
I think we only want to be on the mainframe so that the divisions can access details in the middle of the night.
"I think we still have priority at the moment to computers, in effect Paul is going to"
We might as well
"I still think we have to have the system as such, perhaps not so intricate, but certainly keep the file probably with the bits in"
"We might, cos you won't be able to put maps and things on them"
Mr
Thank you chairman.
If I could just briefly address three or four of the points.
Firstly Miss  's correct.
"It, it isn't being approached very vigorously at the moment, er in a general sense because of two things."
"One is, none of the departments are resourced to give this a lot of attention, and secondly we have been waiting for further guidance from the Government on the outcome, particularly from local government, in respect of agenda twenty-one."
"Now this week the Government are publishing four papers on, and I quote, The U K's Government first strategy for sustainable development."
"So Miss  's point is very appropriate to bring a report back to a future committee in the near future, er, that covers the queries that have been raised by members, and the Government's new policies or new proposals, I will take instructions from the Chief Executive on that, and will, er subject to the Chief Executive's review, also cover matters such as structure plan, and the co-ordination of this er, within, within the local authority."
"And, to try and give options for members, at different expenditure levels of how we may move forward, because it isn't a cheap process, or not if we follow the Lancashire model it isn't a cheap process, but of course we can scale our proposals down."
"So subject to me taking advice from the Chief Executive, er I feel we can do what members require."
Thank you chairman.
"May I just  I think that this has all party support, erm, the actual scheme was produced, erm,f and if the Government is a signatory to that, erm, unfortunately the signatory to it was the environmen ,environmen , environment minister Tim Yeo, who has now departed but"
"it, you know, it does have, it does have Government, Government support, so that it isn't, we're not trying to do anything which erm, the Government isn't supporting as well."
"And, er, you know, that's just, so that Mr  is aware that we're trying to do what John Major agreed at Rio."
"Okay, I er, we've got a motion, let's put it to the vote."
"It's paragraph seventeen, eighteen and the additional item added by Miss  about a report to the April meeting on what action can be taken to implement the District Auditor's recommendations, and from what we've heard I think that report will also contain reference to today's, the correct response to today's Government four papers erm, on the policy with regard to the Rio summit ."
"And I hope that, and indeed the point about the, the er, what might be added from the environmental strategy into the structured plan, which Mr  made."
"Erm, so we'll look forward to that report, er, those in favour of the recommendations please say aye."
aye.
And the against.
They're carried.
Miss .
Thank you.
"Erm, as the person who mo , moved the original motion, I would be very happy to move the recommendations, and to thank Mr , Mrs , Mr  and Mr , who are the only members here present who voted for it at the time."
"Erm, it has actually worked, erm, in that it seems that there's a very fair chance that er, in spite of the very discouraging things that were said by some of the people on my right when I moved this, erm, there is a very good chance now for a reasonable er, settlement in South Africa, which I think should erm, make everyone in this chamber very happy, and it is that, undoubtedly the case that economic pressure had a great deal to do with that."
Thank you chairman.
Miss  moved .
"You have already second, but I was going to second it, and say how very pleased I am to have the opportunity to second it."
"Those in favour, please shout it."
aye.
And the against.
That's carried.
"I, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you."
"Erm, could I go back to what Mr  was saying, of course the main thing is, really that er, the difference in this budget and previous ones is that we are not paying projection costs  million."
"Erm, what Mr  very carefully very carefully failed to mention of course is that the rates of  has in fact gone up by eleven point one percent."
Very conveniently not mentioned.
"Yes, I, I, the"
"Can we erm, can we move on?"
"The, the motion I moved needs to be adjusted because of our decision on the probation committee, earlier."
"Little three, erm, where the reference to drawing from balances is made."
"That figure needs to go up by twenty-six thousand to read nought point two three one million, and what's left needs to go down by twenty-six thousand at ten one one four o million."
"Erm, I'll put the motion to the vote, which consists of the whole of paragraph b of the budget review sub-committee's recommendation, with this being a recommendation to the county council, and with paragraphs c, d and e from the original agenda paper."
Those in favour please show  and the against?
That is carried.
Thank you very much.
"Er, item twelve."
"I'm going to take these two together, that's twelve one and twelve two."
"Twelve one deals with the recommendation for economic developments and tourism sub-committee, er the er  projects, and twelve two with the er, capital budget report from the director of financial services, which is in the budget book, I refer to the recommendation on these items from the budget review sub-committee, which is in their minutes, at agenda item twenty-two one, at the bottom of the third page and going over to the fourth, erm, a number of paragraphs."
"And erm, I'll move those recommendations from the budget review sub-committee, a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h."
"In doing so I would erm, particularly like to say how much I appreciate the success of the  bid, in erm, as, as an example of county, counties working together, erm, and indeed officers working together, and indeed of getting a positive response from the Government."
"I think from time to time, little bits of the Government do work reasonably well, and do respond reasonably well to county council and local authority initiatives, and although I couldn't pretend that a hundred and, that twenty- five thousand pounds is going to solve the unemployment problem in Wiltshire, nor indeed solve the problem being created by the run- down of defence industry, nevertheless, I think credit should be given where credit's due."
"A lot of credit is due to our officers in this respect, for er, securing the success of that bid, and indeed for securing a back-up capital resource facility, in the unlikely event that we don't get the supplementary credit approval, er, for the er, for the  expenditure."
"So, I've moved the motion, anybody wish to speak on this item?"
"Okay, those in favour please show  and the against  ."
"Nobody else, er, agenda item thirteen  treasury report"
aye.
Thank you.
"Agenda item fourteen, I recommend that the county council approve the recommendations of eleven a, b and c."
aye
Those in favour please say aye.
aye
And the against  that is carried.
"Item fifteen, I move to approve the supplementary capital estimate of twenty-five thousand pounds for the  St Mary's infant school special nursery unit."
Those in favour please say aye.
"Then that thirdly, it it would need to help fulfil the economic objectives or the employment needs of the receiving authority which which I guess in in many respects boils down to nominating a particular authority or authorities if if you like."
"Erm where I have to qualify my my support is is, and and I do particularly want to stress that in no way would I accept the exceptions policy as a substitute to an appropriate increase in the employment alloca allocation for Selby District."
"Because clearly an increase in in in the allocation sends a much stronger signal to potential investors and it carries with it a greater degree of certainty as far as the district council's concerned, as far as potential investors are concerned."
And also of course as a far as local people are concerned.
The implication
"So sorry  can I just ask, so in effect you haven't shifted your ground from the view which you expressed in paragraph three point six of your submission where you've just confirmed in fact that you'd rather have a proper or the ability to make a sort of proper measured allocations, part of which would make provision or allow the facility to cater for major inward investment?"
Er Terry Heselton Selby District.
"Well,another way of putting it is that this might be an additional er policy that that would help us as well as er"
Yep.
"as an increase in the all in the allocation, but that the main message is is that I wouldn't like it to be a substitute for that."
No right.
Thank you.
Is the implication of what you've just said to the Chairman that you agree with Mr Allenby that this animal is a different one than anything that might go to an I five site?
Terry Heselton Selby District.
Yes I think I think that that that is the case.
But but equally it may it may be in the in the fullness of time that that we would be able to identify or bring a site forward through the local plan process and we're not at that stage at the moment.
Right.
I have some knowledge of the Lutterworth site to which Professor Lock referred and of the Toyota site at Derby.
Professor Lock will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong but from memory in neither of those cases was there the sort of provision in the development plan which you're now seeking.
"It may be, but I can't remember, that both of them preceded section fifty four A."
Was that true at Lutterworth?
"I'm I'm not competent on, er David Lock, I'm not competent on Toyota."
Erm all I have is the layman's knowledge that it was a gift to Edwina Curry's  constituency .
Er erm and I don't think it had a planning history.
The the erm situation for Lutterworth er Magna Park however I I am familiar with and it certainly preceded section fifty four A and erm in in there were two phases.
"Er the first of erm er three three million square feet, second of four and a half, and erm the er in both cases it triggered the call-in procedure under the departure and in both cases er a public inquiry had to be held er or the Secretary of State chose to call a public inquiry."
And in both cases that took two and a half years.
But hasn't prevented either.
It hasn't prevented either
Going ahead.
"No but the the, sorry you're quite right."
"Erm the difference is that erm it A Magna Park is specifically an exclusively rather, exclusively geared to to B eight and is absolutely slap bang in the middle of the country on the conjunction of the M six M one and the A one M link route and everything else."
"Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up."
"Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City."
Yes.
That's tended to be our line.
"They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question."
"Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications."
"I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that."
So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits?
"That doesn't alter that position, Katherine?"
"No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one."
Quite.
Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross?
"We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with."
"erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire?"
"Yes, they've got a farm in Burford."
Ahh.
"Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why?"
Graham?
"I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days."
"I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street."
"Yes, these are street collections."
"That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing."
"And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year."
"Okay, Betty?"
"I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities."
"And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year."
"It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one"
Thirty-one.
"Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable."
"Well, of course, there's flag days as well ."
"Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds."
"Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities."
I'm  I'm embarrassed about that because
It's alright.
the speech we had about job densities yesterday.
It obviously  wasn't accidental  that it worked out that way.
Yep.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Can I can I, before we go to Mr Potter, erm may be my slightly naive mind here but I distinguish when you start talking about a strategic site approach to planning for and one of provision within North Yorkshire er as being different from an approach based on major exceptions in that in the sense that you would actually plan for the ability to cope with what my colleague calls the ointment coming over the horizon."
"In other words, major inward investment not relocation of major investment within the U K but major inward investment from say Western Europe or Japan or wherever."
Another Nissan or Toyota.
"Erm against that there is this elephant which appears, and you say we might have it and find a zoo for it, and in fact we can't move fast enough to find the zoo."
Now the the problem with the dealing with I I suspect with the major exceptions policy is that if you had it could you move fast enough in order to cope with that sort of animal appearing on your horizon which you wanted to capture.
"Surely in a way I'm answering my own point, you would have to go beyond just having a set of words on paper which says we have a major exceptions policy."
What do
Yes I
what do you do in reaction to that?
You're looking at Mr Potter do want him
I'm just throwing it open.
Because I don't think he wanted to be asked question as his  first question .
Erm it it does like this sir that I would imagine that what what we're after here is a policy which would enable a local authority if it so wished to put into its local plan a strategic site.
So that by the time so that when you're out catching elephants you've already got the the the planning story is straight already as part of your net is that I've got a planning
Yes.
Mr Potter.
Erm David Potter North Yorkshire County Council.
Er in fact you have anticipated one of the questions I was going to ask.
Are we talking here about the principle of major exceptions or are we actually talking about a site.
But the reason  as it were was to address some of the issues er that Professor Lock has raised.
And I think I need to place this issue of inward investment in its proper context in terms of the county council's economic development strategy and the planning strategy for the county.
Erm inward investment in terms of the county council's economic development strategy is recognized as important and I think Professor Lock quotes the economic development strategy.
I have the strategy in front on me but I it also the strategy also places the economy of the county in in that context in so far as we're dealing with er the county of North Yorkshire is reliant upon some twenty five thousand small businesses employing twenty five people or less and has only forty one firms serving one local market employing over three hundred people.
This is an important area of concern obviously.
But the basic essence of the strategy focuses on the small firms which underpins the local economy.
The committee are asked to support this initiative by  to develop the sustainable regional transport policy and to appoint the chairman and two other committee members to attend the  conference being arranged in March nineteen ninety four.
I would suggest that there would be logic in both the other spokespersons attending this conference.
Does that meet with committee's approval?
Agreed
"Right, good, thank you."
"Item seven, shaping the way ahead."
"This is an update on the consultation following the conference which was held in July nineteen ninety two I think, yes, erm and basically seeking the committee's approval to have a follow up conference this July in the  centre in  and to all members of the Council to attend as erm for approved as approved duties."
"Erm, Mr  would like to say a few words about the conference overall, er sorry about, yes the conference."
Yeah.
"Thank you, thank you Chairman."
Er yes both this and the previous item are linked in a way.
"Erm, the, the  regional conference will be a major national and indeed international conference and I think it's important that  are there to participate and influence what goes on in the future."
"We are, as you will be aware, in the midst of a very intensive debate about transport policy in the moment, at the moment, er provoked by various things, the M Twenty Five widening proposals, British Rail privatization, er shortage of runway capacity, a variety of things."
All of these will be dealt with at that major conference so it is important that we are there.
The July conference that we're planning.
"The timing is quite nice really and deliberately so in that this will be the  follow up to that in a way and it also follows the earlier conference, as you've heard."
"What we're talking about,w what we intend to talk about in July is not just whether or not our policies are the right ones but the practicality of implementation, which is actually the hardest bit of all to grasp, and what sort of things we might do, whether it's about spending more money, whether it's about influencing people, whether it's about physically restraining people on where they should go."
So I recommend that conference to you and I hope it will be er an interesting one.
We'll certainly do our best to make sure it is.
"Right, thank you."
So the recommendation on page six of the blue book.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Thank you.
"Item eight, the highways maintenance works programme selection of schemes."
This sets out the draft proposals and erm will after this meeting go to all members of the Council for them to go through with a toothcomb as well as you.
"Erm, if you feel that you are in any way upset by the distribution of schemes in this booklet as it stands, your chance is between now and March to get back to the officers and say, but what about mine."
Fair comment.
Mr .
Not too many of you though I think
Absolutely right.
"I mean, the point about this is that actually I must emphasise it's a needs based assessment, both in allocating the overall amount of money that goes to the various areas and er those of you who've already looked at it will see that area three seems to have a disproportionately high amount of the money."
"So you are about as far away from absolute egalitarianism as you can get, you are actually enshrining"
You are creating a  system within the countryside  which is based on inequality.
"And then there's a, a series of er  oh and they add er er during  the people's governments or at or above the  may in accordance with the local land agency set apart certain land bound to be nationalized and used for the establishment of experimental farms  or one or more county's or model state farms, so there's provision for the creation of so a form of socialism over the countryside but it's, it comes a long way down the list."
Quite token isn't it?
"And very token, mm."
"So our final document when, and this is, this is issued in June nineteen fifty, we are in power, we are a communist government  and our land reform  is one which enshrines inequalities, it protects middle peasants  it in effect minimizes what it can give to the poor."
"There is, there is no egalitarianism whatsoever."
"There is very little provision, there is, there is token provision for the creation of socialism."
"And, and this is what revolution has produced."
"At precisely the point where we could have been at our most radical we are at our least radical, this is the least radical document that we've come across."
Are you happy with this?
"Not particularly but I  understand that er it is, you now have the whole of China which  small areas  erm relatively small areas, you've now got the whole thing, I mean if you start initiating very radical reforms, as you say you don't have the personnel or the resources to erm to prevent a, you know, a big change  disruption."
Yeah
Presumably you've gotta start somewhere haven't you?
"You know  you've gotta start somewhere, you can't just , you've gotta start somewhere"
Yeah but the
establish the principles
This is where you want to start then?
What?
No that's what I'm saying
"I'm saying that you know  you, you should er perhaps try to establish some  underlying principles to your policy."
"But isn't there, isn't there a big difference between  sort of recognizing the faults of past land reforms and advocating something like this?"
Why?
"I mean it's not merely recognizing that past land reforms didn't work, it's a totally different policy."
Th th th this in effect is creating capitalism in the countryside.
Mm.
"You've got private owned , you've got inequalities."
So the
creates capitalism.
"That's only because you're looking at it in a very short- term perspective, they, the way they saw the communist revolution was by a very long drawn out process  and so it wasn't that the revolution had just created this was, this was an important step in order to lead to their ultimate goal."
And it just goes to show that the Communist Party were very forward looking but
"I, I would, I would be very surprised if the communists understood how  deterministic idea of erm some sort of progression, I think     you can't really say in about ten years' time we're gonna be here"
"We're very obsessed with things called viewing figures in television and I worked out quite simply that if everybody among the eleven million people who are supposed to view Keeping Up Appearances every Sunday, popped a penny into a money box for Save The Children Fund one Sunday night, that would raise a hundred and ten thousand pounds within an hour, now why don't we get going and encourage people to do that."
Multiply that by seven  and it's seven hundred and seventy thousand pounds.
"What we are able to do in my job is to do what I was happy to do which is to give a performance in aid of a charity, one soon learns how to expend one's energy and in which direction to focus it."
"Earlier this year, on April the twenty second,her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, entertained various representatives from the world of entertainment and sport and journalism at Buckingham Palace."
"We had the most wonderful evening, it began with a film show, an extremely well er composed film to do with the work that is being done, the variety of work that is being done in the variety of places."
Various reports  a plea for support  a plea for interest particularly for the seventy fifth anniversary year next year and after that we had the most lovely party.
I have a list here of people in my particular part of the profession who have pledged themselves to assist with the great drive forward for the seventy fifth anniversary.
A number of celebrities were appearing in the Cadbury's sponsored pantomimes around the country and supporting the Save The Children fund raising activities.
"These include Lesley Joseph, Jeff Capes, Bobby Davro, Windsor Davies, John Nettles and Gloria Hunniford and Ian Botham."
"Pam Ferris from the Darling Buds of May is actively supporting the fund and will help with publiscation and er fund raising, publicising and fund raising in the birthday year."
"Sandi Toksvig, the comedy actress, has been advising on the seventy fifth birthday plans with television, book and consumer magazine support, she'll be visiting Zimbabwe in October with a B B C television crew to film a documentary and will be visiting and filming Save The Children Fund projects while she's there."
"Lulu  Ulrika Johnson, Tessa Sanderson, Debby McGee and Linda Bellingham all lent their support to this year's Cadbury's strollathon and we look forward to their continued support in our birthday year."
"Next year I am going to be very active in the theatre and I've already this morning, sown the seed er for possibly er giving a particular performance er of one of the plays in this particular season I'm going to do er for Save The Children Fund and I've said"
"I've said move fast, get on with it."
"William Wordsworth  nearly two hundred years ago, wrote this  my heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky."
So it was when my life began  so it is now that I am a man.
So be it when I shall grow old or let me die.
The child is father of the man.
And that is what it seems to me  is the purpose of all our support for this fund.
I've been particularly impressed with the officials and executives and workers that I've met.
"I've been particularly impressed today to learn how people come here every year, particularly for this meeting and of all the various ways in which money can be raised."
"The money is there, we know this."
I always say that we all spend our money on what we really want to spend it on  and put a bit by for what we really desire to achieve.
It is wonderful all the work that you do.
And I applaud and admire it.
I  am here partly because I was fortunate enough to have the happiest and healthiest of childhoods and I see it  as a very happy obligation to try to do my best to ensure that all over the world it is possible for other children to enjoy something of what I had.
God bless you all and I hope to be  walking alongside you during the seventy fifth year anniversary efforts.
In Sri Lanka thousand of families have moved from the countryside to the capital Colombo in search of a better life.
"Instead they find nowhere to live, nothing to eat and poor health and education."
"Save The Children is helping families to rebuild the ghettos, to make a better life for themselves and the next generation."
In the Sudan cities are surrounded by huge camps filled with victims of a five year long civil war.
It's a poor part of Africa but most of its problems are man made.
I'm gonna split the determinants into two.
"On the one hand I'm gonna say you've got the enabling factors, these are things which enable you to actually participate in taking a holiday overseas."
And then here we've got the motivating factors.
If you like the psychological influences.
"So we might in fact simplify this by saying these are the enabling factors  if you like, to leave home  these are the motivating factors  pulling us to a certain destination."
"And,go through the enabling factors first, they're very very straightforward, it's the motivating factors which are more complex."
So what are the things which enable you to leave home?
Firstly  if you've got a supply of holiday products on offer.
If you've got travel agents round every street corner then it's very easy simply to walk into them and buy a package on the spot.
"You don't need, for example, months of preparation and planning in terms of perhaps where you're gonna go."
"This is particularly true in recent years, because more and more people nowadays book holidays at the last minute."
"Very often it's to try and take advantage of price deals, but also it's because we now know there perhaps isn't the urgency to buy a holiday in February because we know there'll be plenty around still in June or July."
Increasingly as well many people are making their own holiday arrangements.
Er some of you I suspect are already into things like bucketshop flights.
How many  how many people are aware of bucketshop flights?
Tried it?
Well not necessarily tried it but you're aware that they exist.
"Yes, well it's a few people."
"These are very very cheap discounted tickets er usually using what we might call the dodgier carriers of the world, not necessarily those which have got a bad safety records or crash records, but where the cuisine isn't quite as good on board, or  you don't get an inflight movie."
"Erm  just to digress, you've got well known airlines er such as Tarob of Rumania where you can get cheap flights with them virtually anywhere except ironically to Rumania"
"erm  you've got other airlines erm  such as erm  er Geruda of Indonesia er Imam of Bangladesh, there's a whole sequence of them."
And if you wanna go somewhere in south east Asia you can pick up flights which are very very cheap.
"Less than half the price of, for example, a standard British Air Apex ticket."
So the supply available is very important.
"Likewise when we go to a country, we need somewhere to stay and over the last decade there have been more and more hotels built in virtually every place in the world."
"Secondly, you need disposable income, obviously."
"A third factor concerns, if you like, the demographic situation, if you've got children erm if you've got elderly relatives to look after, that will obviously determine whether you're enabled to travel and perhaps where to."
You've also got geographical factors  the journey time.
Again last week we talked about the feasibility of going to Australia for a week and the impact it would have on you after things like jetlag.
You've got things like socio-cultural factors in terms of paid holidays.
How many paid holidays do you get a year and when are you likely to be able to take them.
"For example, many people have four weeks' holiday a year, but not many people can take that four weeks all in one go, there are usually restrictions that you can only take maybe a maximum of two weeks."
Er and and this is why we ask for for greater flexibility both in the allocation and in the wording of the policy.
And that's why I think I can give my qualified support to to the proposal for for an exceptions policy.
I I think it it it's clearly a problem for the panel to wrestle with as as to what response can the alteration make to changing circumstances particularly in relation to er to economic development.
I know we've had that debate at length in connection with the housing issue but I would just like to to leave you with that point again.
Thank you.
Mr Earle.
Thank you Chairman.
Patrick Earle Richmondshire.
"First of all I do have some sympathy with my colleagues from other districts who, while not being in sympathy with the policy, wouldn't want to be excluded if there's er certain development opportunities being thrown in."
Having said which er I I've already pointed out that I I see no great potential for fifty hectares in in our area.
But going on I'd like to pick the point made er from the Department of Environment about the exceptions policy and the way they envisage it.
"Because, I mean are we talking about a policy that says these exceptions from other structure plan policies erm may be judged in this way."
In other words would the individual applications still be regarded as a departure from the development plan?
I I that hasn't been made clear and erm you you then end up with getting down to the nitty gritty is this an application you advertise under the new procedures for ad advertising departures from the development plan?
Bearing in mind that this is I suppose now going to be one of the performance indicators er that local authorities have got to er publish every year.
Er so in other words it it muddies the water and it seems to me that it's quite unnoted because it be suggesting a policy which is to counteract the effect of erm section fifty four A.
In other words trying to restore the status quo er the status er that that that existed before section fifty four A er and and restoring flexibility that was perceived to exist then.
"Now it does occur to me to wonder and I, again a personal view, to wonder whether  intended that section fifty four A should be counteracted by the terms of the policies that followed it."
Do you want to answer that one Mr Saunders?
I think the number of er er ex I think the fact that this is merely an exception a major exceptions policy that deals only with exceptional cases and the the Humberside structure plan refers to possibly once or twice over a planned period erm might er indicate it's not intended to open to subvert section fifty four A.
"As for er as for departures, a strategic context in terms of a structure plan policy erm that allows for major exceptions will must surely assist in in considering any application that comes forward as a as a departure under under ."
Chairman.
David Allenby Harrogate
Sorry Mr Allenby I Mr Earle was shaking his head there.
Sorry.
Er is that in puzzlement or disagreement?
Bit of both really Chairman.
Er Patrick Earle Richmondshire.
With with the greatest of respect the the point wasn't really answered.
Er perhaps it is impossible to answer it in this forum but I think it remains an open question sir.
Chairman I was er endeavouring to answer it actually erm
my view is that erm
I ventured.
"No no, he answered, this is Maoist ancestor worship, just the Tory variety."
The crisis only seems to eased because of ruthless conference management and because Tories have looked over the precipice and seen the disastrous consequences of disunity.
At least some of them saw that.
Others on the right saw the fearsome prospect of a Kenneth Clarke leadership.
Clarke himself believes the party simply couldn't bear another leadership contest coming so soon after the Thatcher dismissal.
"Tories are not much given to Freudian analysis, but one minister said, the party remained psychotic after the trauma of three years ago."
"The victor, presumably Ken Clarke, would be like a Goth or Vandal marching into the smoking ruins of Rome."
But what if John Major's party does badly in the European and council elections next year.
"This Loyalist replied, Ah well if John were blamed for that, he'd be in trouble."
"Another major enemy said, with ostentatious sadness, that he feared once the public decided a Prime Minister was not up to the job, he'd find it all but impossible to eradicate that impression."
"One insider speculated whether if party opinion remained against him, Major would like the more sporting of his cricketing heros, walk from the wicket, even before the umpire's dismissive finger went up."
"Those who know him best think, he's more of a fighter than that."
"The received wisdom is that if the leadership crisis does erupt, it'll happen this time next year."
Meanwhile prospective runners move with studied casualness into the saddling enclosure.
Clarke's the unchallenged hero of one nation Tories.
"Michael Howard, the senior right winger now, might not have as much support as the more philosophical Michael Portillo."
Two junior ministers complained to me of Portillo's ideological zeal in cabinet committee.
"When others urge caution for electoral reasons, he argues that it's not worth being in government if you can't do the things you believe in."
"The minister himself recognizes this portrait but delights in the political clout he has as the treasury man on many such committees, able to range over the whole field of policy."
"But Portillo whose Spanish name meaning the narrow gate, is very citable to a man responsible for sanctioning public spending bids, would need a department of his own before he became a serious leadership candidate."
"Oddly, if the P M risks giving him one in the next reshuffle, it might be a sign that his own confidence is returning."
Ministers and whips are worried what the mood of their MPs will be when they get back to Westminster.
"Most fears centre on whether the Maastricht rebels and populists like the Wintertons, Tony Marlowe"
"Good morning, everyone."
I think  we have nearly a full house but there may be one or two more people to come.
"Erm  taking part within the presentation this morning  ah  are Frank  who is the fr managing director of Pearsons, and James   er, who's the finance director."
Er  we're going to take questions at the end  er  the camera there is for internal use only  and at the end we'll hand out copies of the slides to anyone who wants them.
"Our profits are disappointingly small in relation to, er  er, the, er  first half of last year  er then, we had buoyant conditions and we made  more money than we ever had before."
"Recession had already promised a slow start to this year  er, but in January when worry about the Gulf actually gave way to the war itself  erm, the trading climate which was already weak  erm  worsened still further."
"Er, consumer confidence fell away and U K consumers kept more of their cash in their pockets  er, in fact, erm, they saved over two and a half billion pounds more in the first quarter of ninety one  than they had in the same  er, quarter of last year."
there are between  between genders.
"I would certainly  I would certainly hope that men would become much less erm nervous and ashamed about expressing emotion erm and I would certainly hope that erm men learn as much as women do about erm how to look after children and how to bring them up, and I think there's some evidence that that actually is happening."
"So if you are asking me what I would like to happen, I would certainly like that to be the case."
"I think how you do it is very  is a very different matter, particularly when you still have very many schools, for example, who erm take the registers — going back to basic things."
Look at schools in this City.
"There are still schools which take registers separately, the boys and the girls separately, or who have pink library book cards for girls and blue library book cards for boys."
This sort of thing.
"Now that's  that's unthinking, but if that is happening in our education system, then I think there are real questions about how we change."
So I think it'll be slow.
Mhm.
"Ann Mobbs, what is it that you would like to see in terms of change for men?"
"Well I think a lot of women are looking for an equal partnership really erm where the rules are laid down and they know where they stand, you know."
The rules laid down by whom?
Well I think by men and women.
I think  I think it's quite important that there is an equal partnership.
"I mean I have to say for myself, I mean I was married."
"erm enjoy  living on my own, and I wouldn't really want to enter into another what I felt was a very oppressive relationship really erm because erm I don't think there are very many men who do think in terms of equality within erm  within erm partnerships and within relationships  within marriages."
"I  Brenda Thornton, do you think it's that bleak?"
"Yes, I think  I think it is."
"I think it is really because I think what we've got to do, if we are going to have any sort of partnership or equality, I think men have got to become more like women."
"I think they've got to become less competitive, less arrogant and less dominant, seeing that as the macho role, and I think they've got to become erm much more erm feminine and approve the feminine characteristics, so that there isn't so much difference between the two genders, and particularly in marriage and in the home."
"But something I would like to say, which no-one has touched on at all; we've all been talking about the laws that affect women and equal opportunities, and no-one has mentioned anything about the horrendous hours that are worked in parliament making it not impossible, but extremely difficult for women to become politicians working in parliament to be the people who make the laws, to be the people who can actually affect women's roles in society erm everyone seems to accept the fact that our own parliament, totally dominated by men, and the sort of hours that only men can work, making it extremely difficult for women."
Why don't we change that?
"I mean why isn't there a tremendous outcry, saying this must change, we can still have democracy, but let's have reasonable, sensible, working hours in parliament so that we can get more women into parliament."
"This is the sort of thing we've got to do, and that's a very difficult thing to try and change."
If you talk to any male politicians they think you're crazy.
Why are you suggesting that?
It doesn't work?
And anyway this works perfectly well.
That's the sort of attitude that we've got to change in men.
"If I were a woman, and I experienced the problems that you're talking about now, I'd be mad as hell."
"Well, that's how you've got to change ."
"That is   you, you, you're miles away from absolute egalitarianism."
But
to rich peasant economy.
This rich peasant economy ought to benefit the population as a whole because it's increasing production and erm if it becomes more efficient then  the rents won't have to so high  the poor peo poor people benefit.
"Yeah but the only thing you're really doing is, is taking away this nominal erm exploitive relationship, you're still gonna be exploiting the  of existing"
Mm.
"and you might, you might  but there's still gonna be erm be certain divisions in the society  perpetuating."
"I actually think it's, it's, okay it's a more equal society, but it is by no means an equal society you're creating."
So I mean   well let's go on then.
"The  distribution of land, all land under  of production  confiscate  with the exception of those to be nationalized  to be taken over by the  Peasant Association, the unified"
distribution to poverty stricken peasants who  their land .
Production landlords should be given an equal share  so that they can make their living by their own labour and thus reform themselves through labour.
"Er  land should be distributed by taking  village as a single unit, that should be distributed in a unified manner according to the population therein based on the principle of allotting the land to its present tiller and making necessary readjustments in land held by taking into consideration the amount, the quality and location of land."
"So i it, it's the old nous  quantity and quality coming in there."
"Er but basically  you're going to give land back to the people who are tilling it because that's what they, they have an attachment to."
Er  and then going on to article twelve  under the principle
"of allotting land to the present tiller, land owned by the tiller should not be drawn upon for redistribution."
When rented land is drawn upon for distribution proper consideration sh should be given to the present tiller.
Land he acquires through distribution plus his home land  shall be slightly and suitably more than the land held in arbitrary distribution of the peasants who had little or no land.
"should be the present tiller should re retain the approximate average per capita land, land holding in the  in the locality."
So  if you already own land  you would end up with a larger unit than if you owned no land before.
"So  we are looking at creating a society with our  rich peasants  who are going to own significantly more than whatever the average is going to be, and significantly more than middle peasants."
"We've then got well to do middle peasants, we've got middle peasants  who would in turn"
"own more than a part-owner, part-tenant before the revolution, who after the revolution would own more than  a full tenant before the revolution."
Maintaining differentials
"Well basically, apart from landlords and  the"
"peasants, there's er something for everybody."
Yes.
"But landlords, oh no but they"
Lan lan er and landlords get some land.
Mm.
Mm.
Thank you Chairman.
Patrick Earle Richmondshire.
"I also speak with a, a while ago now, but a certain amount of experience in Northumberland working for the county council in bringing development into Cramlington new town, so I am aware of the er the merits of er getting your elephants by having a cage already made."
Find some of them insist on finding their own cage and er so you do then have to er have a flexible approach.
But I think the analogy begins to break down and I'll go on to erm straight forward thinking in Richmondshire erm where we wouldn't recognize an elephant if we saw one.
.
I've just been told er to my right it's a very large sheep.
Erm
.
Shame.
No.
The scale of development that's in Professor Lock's contemplation is plainly not one that I I think that would directly er affect Richmondshire and so to some extent er I'm speaking from that perspective.
Although fifty hectares at thirty per hectare I mean fifteen hundred jobs erm and I think we've got eleven hundred or a thousand on our total unemployment role.
So plainly that wouldn't necessarily apply to us but the the except the exception would be sitting there in policy and I I think it's a it's something we we would find very difficult er to live with.
Erm you see the question is how far how wide to the exceptions go.
Er Mr Broughton's just brought in another one that he he wants er qualification on.
How how many other policies of the structure plan would this apply to?
"Wild life conservation, er and other conservation issues er would be brought into question."
"Erm I I foresee the possibility that erm we would be faced with lesser proposals lesser than the scale that erm Professor Lock contemplates because it would be said, well if fifty hectares is right for Ha er for Harrogate then what twenty hectares for Richmondshire ten hectares."
Er and and and so the the the policy would perhaps be extended.
"Erm the the question would ultimately come out, well why not retail?"
I I the retail's not within what we've been talking about this afternoon but on the other hand it does employ more people per hectare than any industry we've been talking about as as far as as far as I understand it.
"I see a danger that every single motorway interchange in the county, and heavens in the country, will be subject to an interpretation of this er of this sort of exceptions approach."
And it's that in itself has been er er an issue faced by Ministers on the M twenty five.
Erm the the er Professor Lock was saying well you know the way you get your footloose industry is to present them with an absolute guarantee of planning permission.
"Well no ideas have been put forward this afternoon in terms of a structure plan alteration er or an additional policy, will give an absolute guarantee."
I mean obviously the it's a I perhaps it's an exaggeration to the effect that nobody can guarantee planning permission until they've got planning permission.
And this is why I think the approach that Harrogate would perhaps be thinking of and we ourselves would be thinking of if this is the way we wanted to go is simply to go out and get a site and get planning permission on it.
And present it to a prospective developer.
Erm or short of that a firm local plan allocation with all the consultations and environmental impact study already done.
Other other than that you cannot guarantee planning permission.
And what our colleagues in County Durham again in Northumberland we were able to do is was this was all in place.
we're all going out for a drink with yourselves I think.
Good.
That sounds like a good idea.
"Me, I don't drink."
No don't drink  any more
Not at this moment.
starts tonight dunnit?
It was funny
I'll see if he can arrange the old erm
the guy's er filling out the form for the er mortgage and he's er  said non-smoker?
"Yeah, yeah and Lynette yeah non-smoker, you know."
When we got outside I said I couldn't very well offer him one I only had two left in the packet
"That makes quite a difference on your policy, the premium"
Yeah
if you're non-smokers.
"She laughed, she thought it was hilarious."
It's not my day really  earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer  now I'm gonna have to be.
I know it's terrible isn't it  I never thought I'd say that.
Now I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna be grateful to Mr   it's a really bad day.
"No I am grateful to Mr  because he's finally crystallised in my mind something that's been bugging me  the longer I stay on this council  about exactly what the Tories see their role here  as  and it's now very clear to me, more than ever  and that is that if you want to be obstructive  and negative  and if you go on long enough being obstructive and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the Tory strategy."
"When  my colleague to my right here, Roger  and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue  ably led by  our glorious leader to my left   I would like to say  that we've set up."
"Now  what I would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward, in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it."
"I see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and I am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and I shall certainly support this amendment and I shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that I thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project, head of sorry, head of project and having actually worked in a situation where I was a joint manager erm  in the long run I think people will see the the wisdom of of a single  head of project."
But that's up fo that's up to people experience t t t t to conclude.
"But the main there 'ere is, we haven't actually changed our position  we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something, we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best  best thing possible within the resources available  and that things developed on  This amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being negatively obstructive."
Mr
Thanks Chair.
"I just like to start off by saying and just reminding  the council  well in particular Mr  in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what Mr  is on about, well he's never understood the issue of the merger in Highfields."
Mr  has made more publicity on this issue  than any other councillor.
I think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about.
But he's made national headlines  local  and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger.
But I think  in seconding this motion I think it's a way forward and I think it's better late than never  I think what it talks about  that we would not be here today Mr Chairman  if this would have been agreed by what was  put  by the officers two and half years ago.
Many branches have already scheduled a range of exciting events based on the birthday in addition to the events that will be happening nationwide.
Like the thousands of birthday parties that we hope will take place on May the nineteenth.
There will be more on all these happenings later today.
Other fund raising plans are well advanced too.
"I'm delighted that our old friends at Tesco, a founder corporate member of Save The Children, are once again lending their generous support."
In nineteen ninety four they are making us their charity of the year and offering to work with us across the U K to help raise an extra million.
"I would also like to thank another of our corporate members, Cadbury Limited."
"Over the past eighteen months Cadbury and Save The Children have worked very successfully together, staging three strollathons  sponsoring nationwide pantomimes  and running a promotion on chocolate bars."
I think that was probably the most popular.
"As our seventy fifth birthday approaches, Cadbury hopes to stage more events and promotions to help us meet our seventy five million t pound target and meet our commitment to the world's children."
All in all it promises to be an exciting  enjoyable and hard working year for Save The Children and all its supporters.
It is going to be hard work.
Nobody would pretend  that raising an additional twenty five million pounds is going to be easy but time and again you have risen to the challenge.
We must make very sure we know what we're doing it for.
It will help to remind ourselves of the challenge that Eglantine Jebb took up.
"Her clear sighted approach  to bring long lasting help to mothers and children, so that children could benefit, wherever they were  whatever their country, their colour, their situation -urban or rural, their culture, their religion, their society in the sense of its development and their expectations and their infrastructure."
She was frustrated by short term palliatives.
"When knowledge of basic principles might cure for future generations  many diseases and even hunger and that education might set solid foundations for extending and repeating that knowledge, as well as the economic viability of the community and a sense of responsibility."
"A sense of responsibility in the children that we help, that they all grow up to be responsible adults."
In seventy five years the fund has remained true to her principles and yet it is as pioneering as she ever was.
"I hope she would be pleased by our efforts, in spite of the fact that we are still here and needed."
"I know she would be proud of you, the fund raisers, who make it possible."
"As you set about making your plans for next year let me leave you with this thought from Eglantine Jebb If children of any country are physically or morally abandoned the whole world loses by it  and the whole world gains if children grow up healthy, capable and ready to work for the good of their neighbours."
Good luck.
Thank you very much indeed for that  superb key note address.
"And now let us proceed with the next business of the day, it gives me great pleasure your Royal Highness to er invite you to present several Save The Children awards this morning."
These awards are given in recognition of outstanding services to children.
Five people who've been nominated for awards are not available to receive them from her Royal Highness.
"Though absent they are  Ray , Lee , Kim , Cho and Marjorie ."
"Congratulations to them all, they'll be receiving their awards in due course."
We now
Now for those who are present I will call out each name and if each one can come forward and receive  the award from her Royal Highness.
"Lesotho is one of eight countries across the globe in which Save The Children has introduced the riders for health project, working with the ministry of health, a successful programme has been developed which provides primary health care to almost five times as many villages that could have been reached on foot."
The Save The Children Fund programme with the motorcycles has  made a very big difference to the number of visits that health assistants can make to villages.
"Before they had the motorcycles they had to walk which meant a lot of travelling time and then less time at the, each village when they arrived."
Now with the motorcycles they  spend less time travelling and they can spend more time in the villages doing their educational and health work.
We found that the number of visits that  on average that they can do has increased by four or five hundred per cent.
In fact they couldn't really do their job without the motorcycles.
"Previous attempts to start the project before nineteen ninety had failed because of poor maintenance to the bikes, and accidents."
By introducing specialist training and good management the bikes have been used extensively.
"That's good  well forwards  excellent, well done, very good."
The learning process from this project has been invaluable and it's allowed Save The Children to move forward in several other countries.
Recent research into how governments and donors contribute to the provision of health services shows that effective long term systems need to be put into place.
These can be worked through with local cooperation.
Riders for health is a good example of what can be achieved through good planning.
"I think that the  riders for health project has  given us  ah a model that can be used in a great many other situations and we've found here in Lesotho that many other ministries and government departments are interested in what we're doing because the motorcycles, if used properly, can provide a very cost effective form of transport."
It is their work in the villages which is most impressive.
The local health workers are able to spread basic advice on health and cleanliness as well as providing cheap but effective medicine such as immunisations and rehydration salts.
Most importantly the workers help to improve the local water supply.
Clean water saves more lives than any medicine that can be provided by the human race so far.
Degosang is three years old.
"She lives in a remote village, ten kilometres from a paved road."
"She now has clean water from a pump that Mohali her health advisor, helped the village to organise and build."
It is these basic measures which can make a difference to saving lives all over the world.
"Each year five million children die from the lethal effects of diarrhoea, four million from respiratory diseases like T B and bronchitis."
It is through prevention that Save The Children can make the greatest impact on life.
But it's not just in Africa where children are under threat from poverty and disease.
In the U K Save The Children has shown the link between a poor environment and poor health.
Pennywell is a housing estate in Sunderland where one in three adult males are unemployed.
Health is a big issue here.
Sunderland has the fourth highest number of smoking related deaths in the U K. Low birth weights are more common.
Well obviously unemployment is very high in the North East and er all the major health indicators are related directly to income.
So consequently er poor  poor people live shorter lives and they suffer more chronic illnesses.
And this is also er true of the children.
One other thing before that.
"Is, is it possible to argue that the south is fundamentally different in terms of its ?"
"Tt  er if, if, if you go back to some of the things we were looking at last term er er this idea of commercialization  tt  er  argue that the south was a very different type of country to the north, that it is commercialized  at least to a much greater extent"
"and i if, I mean i if you take   's argument, if you take  's argument, they are all to do with, with provinces in the south  and, and the argument is that here we have, we are looking at a commercialized viable economy  and both  and  and for example are all arguing really that landlordism is not the problem  the problem is that you, you, you, you  you need to go further in terms of commercialization and that that, and that's the way to go."
I E you're not really looking at a feudal economy in the south any more  i it may be a much more heavily commercial capitalist economy  and therefore the kind of land reform programme that you might incorporate from a feudal north might not be entirely relevant.
"So there might be something in the argument that, that  it's not just a, a question of what you've learned from the north, but there may be a recognition that  the economy in the south is different, or at least they might be arguing, those who are arguing that the economy in the south is different and that, that reform might not be necessary, it might not even be appropriate in the south."
It's a possibility.
Did the Communist Party know that though?
"Cos surely they'd want to try to make peasants see that exploitation was  I mean cos there was still an agrarian problem in the south, just because it was more commercialized and economically viable there was still  thousands, tens of thousands of people who were starving and stuff so erm  did the Communist Party recognize this difference  in the economy, in the economic structure between the north and the south?"
I mean we can because we've studied it and had all the statistics and stuff.
And would they wanted to have believed it.
"I don't think they s th th they obviously didn't see it in, in quite the terms that"
"but I think there was an awareness that there was likely to be much more opposition to, to land reform in the south."
"Not s in a sense just by individual feudal landlords, but by landlords saying well I'm, I'm not really feudal anyway, that I've moved on from that, I am a commercial landlord rather than a feudal landlord."
This is the difference?
Mm.
You don't have any of this sort of  you have to work
dates that they had sort of like bonds in which they have to work to supply labour for certain dates on their land instead of feudal ties
Exactly.
"yeah,"
Yes.
"as opposed to that was a part of being a tenant, you know, for the honour of  you pay me rent but you also come and work on my land for how many days"
"But as such just because you're hiring people that's still going to be, in Marxist terms, seen as exploitation."
Right.
"But it might be in   but it, it is, it is"
"i i that was right,th th th there is a  i that they could be, if you like, capitalist landlords and feudal landlords."
"Now capitalist landlords might be the  development  certainly in terms of production   you, you might be disrupting a viable, commercial, capitalist orientated economy, and would you really want to do that?"
"Well no if you tried to then you, you'd be in some difficulty  rules which, you know"
Yes.
commercial industrial  society
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well they're a lot of fun and kids love them.
"As I commented a little earlier to somebody, I still haven't quite forgiven my mother-in-law for the chemistry set she bought my seven-year-old."
"He is absolutely amazed by it and spends lots of time in a garage at the back, which actually means that I spend an awful lot of time  in that garage in the cold too!"
"Yes, they are good sets and they do  they are exciting for children."
They do enjoy them and they do make good use of them.
"Quite often they need a lot of erm time spent by the parent with the child, and if the parent's happy with that they're fine."
"None of them, or very few of them, if you buy a good quality one is dangerous."
"It's very important, I think, that erm you match the age of the child to the age which is written on the box, because then the child will actually be handling materials that he can physically handle and ideas that he can physically cope with or intellectually cope with."
"So they are probably very useful erm toys, educational toys, to have in the home, but I think for the child to get the maximum from them they do  he often does require an adult with him."
How about electronic kits and circuits?
"Are they worthwhile, would you say?"
"Yes, they are; they are very much."
"Again, it's a questin of matching the kit to the age of the child because some of them erm — the one we have at home, for example, plugs into the mains and although it only pushes out six or nine volts at the end the child actually does have to plug it in and, well I don't think I'd be happy if my six or seven year old was doing that, although my nine year old could cope with it quite happily."
So they are useful erm children can learn a lot.
"What I like about them and where I think their strengths are is that they do put science, the physical sciences, in that bracket of activity which is fun, excitement and leisure and enjoyment and that it moves away from the notion that it's something you do on a wet Friday afternoon at school."
"Thank you very much, Mike."
That's all that we have time for today.
Next week I shall be talking to Peter Abbs about teaching the arts and he will be reading some very interesting children's poetry.
"Until next week then, goodbye."
Dr Brian Smith from the University Sussex.
Now the Brighton Polytechnic and Mary Donoghue.
Hello.
"Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty, but one that's hard to define and sometimes very hard to cope with."
For the next three weeks on Ideas in Action we'll discuss some practical ways that parents and teachers can help dyslexic children.
"Today we'll hear from polytechnic lecturer Reg James, who's just made a film of the special needs Brickwall School, and from local remedial tutor Dave Pollock, who'll give us some suggestions for teacing dyslexic children."
"Reg, let's start with the most obvious question first."
What is dyslexia?
Well it's something that's very difficult to define in a way I think that's satisfactory.
"What has been taken as kind of definition, which I'll paraphrase I think for this purpose, is that it's a condition that shows itself in children's reading difficulty and erm that they are having this reading difficulty despite the fact that they have had reasonable, normal teaching, that their level of intelligence appears to be normal and that they come from an adequate social cultural background."
"Over and above that we think in a sense that it's a series of disabilities, of intellectual functioning, and although it's not by any means proven, we think that these are probably constitutional in origin."
"Dave, would you agree with that definition?"
"Yes, if I could just extend it a little."
After the first five numbers
"That's it because what you well you either hold on to the first five or six and then you lose the rest or sometimes you remember the beginning and the end and you lose the bit in the middle, ah."
It's like that game that they used to play on Crackerjack for those of you old enough to remember Crackerjack
Crackerjack
Crackerjack
"pencils, yeah, erm that's ."
a cabbage.
There was a game wasn't there that they played
Cabbage
So long as you got the question wrong you got a cabbage if you got it right you got a prize
Right  that's right
"and that's what the brain's like, you've got to try and hold on to"
Cabbages
all these cabbages yeah.
You've got to try and hold on to so much information that something eventually has to drop.
Because some people do get the ten and some people can get to twelve but guess how they do it.
"They chunk it up into pairs or groups of three or something like that so four groups of three or two groups of six or whatever, because what Miller actually found was the span of conception was and is  seven plus or minus two."
People can hold on to seven plus or minus two bits of information and the plus or minus two he called the local factors which are you know whether it's warm out whether you feel warm or cold or whether or what time of day it is have you just had a heavy lunch whatever it might be.
Something that effects even the time of the year all sorts of things.
So the maximum is nine that people can hold on to and the thing about nine of course is  it splits up into three threes and that's why I say some people will group a twelve number into four threes or something like that or three fours because they're all well within this span of conception.
So as it says at the bottom of page eight there's a golden rule for presenting is use three themes.
Okay?
So the number of themes you use to support your objective is three and then for each of those themes you divide it into three subthemes.
Remember what I did there I got three themes and for each one I got three subthemes so that what you put over to them to the audience are those three themes.
They're able to hold on to that for the duration of the talk and be able to understand them as concepts and therefore it helps to put over the ideas.
So we'll have a coffee break and then what I want you to do when you come back is I'll give you an objective for the talk that you're going to give based on that  you've just done and then I want you to select three themes and three sub-themes that will support the objective that you'll then be able to use.
Okay?
Right
Start again
yes.
the Aldershot method
it goes under the nice little saying tell them what you're going to tell them then tell them and then tell them what you've told them.
"Anybody like to guess roughly when this was drawn, fifties, sixties, forties, seventies?"
"Seventies you think, sixties"
fifties to sixties
"Possibly something like that, yeah."
How do we how do we guess that?
Mike I mean
Because knowing London and knowing Tower Bridge those buildings over the far side aren't there any more
"Right absolutely, so it's about the horizon isn't it?"
So we we we recognise by the horizon possibly when when this was drawn.
"If you went and stood in the same place now then obviously it would look different in that sense, wouldn't it so the background if you like would be different wouldn't it with high rise and maybe a different ."
"So the horizon the background would be would be different, but what would be the same?"
the bridge
The bridge itself wouldn't it?
"The two towers and the bridge itself would be the same, and in a way that that's what we can look at an analogy to do with er presentation skills."
We've got two towers two things that are fundamental and don't change.
They're the same now as they were in the fifties when making presentations and that's about the skills you need when you stand up to speak and the skills you need in the preparation phase so the two towers of presentation skills are about the preparation and the presentation itself.
The design and the delivery.
"The background changes and in a way the background is about things like the visual aids, flipcharts and er the use of video and er even these peripherals you can put on a on a overhead projector now that plug into a computer."
I don't know if anybody's ever seen those but you can actually have a computer at the side and a thing that sits on there and you can change and up on the screen it will appear what's on the screen on the computer.
Things like that.
"So those are all if you like the background, the things that do change but the fundamentals that stay the same are the design and the delivery and although we'll look a little bit although we've er I have to say with the numbers we've got here today it will only be a little bit about things like question and visual aids and because of the time factor if you think about it if we've twelve people to make four presentations or we've eight people to make four presentations time is a little bit different and with with twelve we don't perhaps have the luxury of time that we would with eight people which is what the course was originally designed for."
"So but nevertheless we will look at a little bit at those peripheral things, but we're going to concentrate mainly on the design and on the delivery of a presentation so that's what we want to what we want to look at over the next two days."
"But of course if we're going to do that we need somewhere to start and where we're going to start is that I'm going to ask you to each to make a presentation, a very short presentation."
So what I'd like you to do if you haven't got some paper there's stacks of paper here and what I'd like you to do is grab a piece of paper and write down what I'm going to tell you.
Okay  I'm going to ask each of you to speak for three minutes so you might like to jot that down.
A three minute presentation Okay.
Okay here we go then.
Well the first question I want to ask you is how do you feel you got on in those presentations.
Got it over and done with
"Got it over and done with yes, yes somebody somebody dried up did they nobody sort of er"
I wish it was true
Well okay.
"It's cheap price, good deal, that sort of thing."
And finally  perhaps your own personality as well.
"Are you an extrovert person  outgoing, willing to take a chance, willing to take a risk or are you more introverted perhaps?"
What is traits?
Traits means characteristics.
"Just to show you  how this has developed, you don't need to copy this down, it's something that you'll do in the second year of your course, but we mentioned in particular here how you interact with people  and what goes through your head."
"And this has actually been categorized into two tables  and  by , they claim that you can define different types of tourists according to, firstly, the way in which they interact with the local people."
So at one extreme you've got the explorer who simply goes off into the unknown.
"The, the last thing the explorer wants on holiday is to meet people from their own country."
Th they wanna get far away from it.
They don't really like being called a tourist in many places.
"Many of them will use the term traveller because somehow it's less derogatory, it sounds more impressive."
"And these people here will learn languages, they will eat the local food, they will do anything the locals do, they will dress like them, the lot  in order to try and get as full a experience as possible."
"At the other end, you have what we call the charter tourist."
The person who goes there and basically they want to take their home with them.
"In the case of an Englishman they'll want to take their beer, steak and chips, everything over to simply a hot climate and they live in their bubble."
So you have these two extremes.
"In between you have elite, offbeat, unusual, mass and so on but they all lie somewhere between these extremes in terms of totally interacting and totally ignoring in many cases."
The second type is the cognitive normative.
"In other words, defining tourists according to what's actually going through their heads."
"And here for example you might have the recreational  mind, healthy mind and body  the existential, the person who as much as anything may be looking for an experience based on meditation, er religion, this sort of thing."
"Er you've got, also down here, experimental  the person who experiments if you like with different cultures, trying to think of a different way, who's interested in religions."
"Now you may think that the number of people in this category here is very minimal, but there's increasing numbers of people around the world travelling now who are motivated by things like this."
"You only have to look at the number of visitors going to places such as Nepal er to see the increase there, to see how important this connection be."
"Now for our purposes, the kind of thing we're gonna do, is look at a much simpler breakdown of tourists."
"And this is gonna introduce you to a new word called psychographic and psychographic, you think you've got, you can break it in two  you've got the psychological aspects and the graphic or mapping, the mapping of the psychology."
And this has been translated by a gentleman by the name of Stanley Clog
but we don't usually refer to it as Clog's theory or anything like that.
And Stanley Clog identifies four different types of tourist and these are the main ones which we're gonna use.
Two of them you'll of heard before I'm sure.
The first one you won't have done.
Psychocentrics are the first one.
"I, I"
bring up this point about the masses being  were the masses revolutionary or not
Yeah.
"and I remember doing my first, one of my first essays  erm saying that I didn't think they were and all that they were  erm  was the fact that er er of  and you said to me at the end  that's fine as far you've argued it but I think you'll change your views as you go on and I don't know if I have."
Right .
"So erm I don't whether or not I s I still don't think they were ultimately revolutionary, I think they were just erm   people who they think were exploiting them at the time  sort of erm you know in a certain situation"
Just because they weren't revolutionary doesn't mean that they didn't have the potential to become revolutionary
I know.
Sure.
Yeah.
and erm it was
"But they di didn't have the idea of revolution in themselves, they didn't have the idea of overthrowing the landlords themselves."
"But maybe cos there was no opportunity, they didn't see there to be  I mean like they didn't know any better but as soon as, I mean things are rapidly changing they're given the opportunity to erm I mean through the struggles  to actually take charge of the conditions and to gain so some material and  perhaps there was beginnings of them seeing that well  perhaps we ought to look more to this sub-culture and to erm"
Well I mean it's
change their values.
it's very  Party initiated isn't it?
The Party's giving
putting these ideas into their heads of erm  creating a society in which
But then the peasants surely should be able to choose to accept or reject what the Party is trying to  instil  in a way.
Yeah.
"But I mean it's the idea, the idea is coming, is not coming from themselves, it's coming from the Party that, that er that you can create a system without landlords."
"It has to though because if in the pa if they've had this  long-term sort of culture for all this time they need to be given ideas but essentially if their traditional values were so strong they would have rejected what the Communist Party was trying to say, but because they accepted it it meant they ha they did actually have the potential to be revolutionary."
"And  going on from that surely we argue that the May the fourth directive  came about or certainly was, was put out as this is what the peasants  three times the peasants had demanded land return  I E they were in advance of the Party, they were more radical, they, they were, in a way they were saying look this, this rent reduction is not enough  we want a much stronger programme, we actually want the land reform."
And that's what the directive says?
Yes.
Well maybe they
"but that's, that's entirely logical"
"the, the more you argue for this  economy, and the more you argue no this is, this really is how the peasant felt and he  that the peasant really erm  didn't have any ideas of changing society at that  of  the landlord system  the more I assume that  one would support this kind of rent reduction, interest rate reduction campaign which allows you to slowly build up that mobilization which is necessary."
"The,th th th the o the other thing that is  I think, I think there is something in this, is that there was, at least within some sections of the peasantry, erm er a, a kind of erm revolutionary zeal which they were building themselves and they were wanting to go beyond the Party."
"And, and that would derive from cases where landlord exploitation was particularly severe and therefore peasants were saying no  rent reduction, interest rate reduction is not enough, we want to go further than that now."
And I think there is that element there.
Mm.
"The pessimistic thing was, the Hobbesians always looked back to the past, some golden age of order in the past, you know, when, when people knew what to do and er, and er, things were right as it were, and th they tend to want to restore some ideal state of order and authority that existed in the past, which was much better than now, because civilization has gone to the dogs, and been corrupted and so on ."
"And they look back, and er, these pessimistic views are usually reactionary."
"Politically, they're usually reactionary."
The pessimists want to go back.
"I mean effectively, I always wanted to go back to the middle ages er, with, with the history books of English society."
"English society, of course didn't work out that way."
"The realis the opt optimistic theories, on the other hand, also had their utopias, but they look forward."
"For the, for the optimists, the, the utopia is, is always in the, in the future, and these people er, tend to be revolutionaries."
"They tend to say we must overthrow the existing social order and establish a new just social order, when human beings will be liberated from the corrupting erm, alienating er forces, that er, make them bad, and everything will be, everything will be okay."
"The Freudian realistic view it seems to me, couldn't allow you to draw either conclusion, you couldn't, neither conclude, that things were better in the past and therefore we ou ought to go back to the golden age, nor, could you conclude that things will ever be any better in the future."
"Anxiety for example, is something that human beings will always experience, and to think that you can free them from anxiety in some future utopia, or go back to some ordered erm, ideal state in the past, where everyone was so secure, that they would never feel anxiety, is just a myth according to Freud."
"Freud's view is a realistic one of human nature, which says that people will experience anxiety and frustration and er, all kinds of erm, feelings that they may not want to have."
"But they will experience those feelings, because human nature is not at either of these extreme points, it's neither erm, perfectly good, nor perfectly bad, it's a, it's a mixture of both, and consequently, although you can improve the world, for it doesn't deny you can improve the world, or make it worse, of course."
"To think that you could bring about a utopia, and perfect human nature in one way or another, is really a wildly er, optimistic and er, is in itself, er, some kind of illusion."
"Well, at that point I will end what I have to say for today, and er, carry on with this next week."
Thank you very much
"Yes, yes, you can, can catch me now."
Hobbesian theory being
"Yes, that's right,"
"Yes, well, commiserations"
"Er, no, it's a bit tough, I suppose"
You could bring some evolutionary insight to it.
"Oh yes, oh yes yes, that's right"
Oh yeah
Are you keeping that sort of thing that that  in some ways could be  considered to be a system.
"If I let it run away with me, it might, you know"
tie it up
"I mean, if you like me to leave your paper, to write to one, I'll be quite pleased to look at it"
"Okay, alright,"
if you want to discuss it with me.
Okay.
"I mean if you want do a paper for this group, on, you know, on the sociological periods of evolution, and, and how they look from our perspective."
"For the moment we move forward believing that we are going in a direction to which we have already been prompted, and in the confidence that the holy spirit is working among us."
Thank you.
I'm delighted Bishop you took the opportunity to so address us and it underlines our benefit in being able to have our delegates participate in our debates and discussions.
Thank you for your contribution.
I put to the assembly deliverance number twenty three  approved.
Deliverance number twenty four  thank you.
three three five.
"I am s one that has just been recently appointed to one of these er regional  ecumenical teams and at a meeting that was held for the three presbytery areas in the sort of west coast of Scotland, around the Greenoch area, erm  it was, it became apparent that all these people who are being appointed er through their, their churches are  in the main  clergy and the convenor of the local committee himself a ruling elder of the Church of Scotland expressed concern about this, that there is no real er and I would just put it to the, to the assembly, there is  there is no need for these members to be members of the clergy, in fact it would be good if presbyteries remembered when making a nomination  eh that it, er it needn't be, it could be a, a an elder or indeed er a lay person holding no particular office within the church."
"That would sustain what eh Bishop  has just referred to, the grass roots of, of this movement."
Twenty four approved then?
Thank you.
Twenty five  local involvement number twenty six  twenty seven  yes?
Reverend  eleven twenty six.
I've read number twenty seven says draw attention to the possibilities for church members to take part in overseas and exchange visits and I would simply like to do that.
"Yesterday a minister from an urban priority area  er while er welcoming the thought of a an urban priority area fund or urban and rural priority area fund, said that people were at least as important as money in many situations."
None of us can doubt the economic plight of many of the countries where our mission partners work  but the relationship of people is every bit as important and visits play a large part in that.
A small group er  from my own parish went to India two and a half years ago to visit our missionary partner.
She had visited us many times over a nu number of years and said it was our turn to visit her and we just laughed.
Us go to Darjeeling?
But eventually she persuaded us she meant it and we went and it was an invaluable experience  meeting not only our missionary partner but the people among whom she lives and  and works and has done for many years.
The warmth of the welcome from the girls in the school hostel  would have gladdened anyone's heart.
They were not well off and they didn't welcome us because we had brought gifts  they simply welcomed us because we had had the interest to go and see them and talk to them.
We enjoyed their music and shared their worship and we came back changed and enriched and I commend number twenty seven to everyone's attention.
Thank you Moderator.
Number twenty seven approved?
Thank you.
Number twenty eight  approved.
"I've got a new number, twenty nine, and you'll find that on the pale blue papers  page number sixty five  the first notice of   I put number twenty nine to the general assembly  is that approved?"
Number thirty  approved.
"Number thirty one  approved  the deliverance as a whole and as amended, approved."
Now before we  move further I'd like to take this opportunity of expressing on your behalf  our thanks to Hugh  here for the service that he's rendered our church to this point in time but particularly as the convenor of the Board of World Mission and Unity.
"Hugh you've been minister of the parish of Inverleith here in Edinburgh for the past seventeen years, and I understand you were one of the very first vice convenors of the Board when it was set up eight years ago  having already served the church on the former Interchurch Relations Committee."
And he's promised to look again at the case for allowing British Rail to bid for franchises.
The rebels have been conducting intensive negotiations with him behind the scenes.
And they're hopeful that he will give way.
Sweden's railways provide a model of the kind of system that Britain could have if the Peyton amendment stays in the railway privatization bill.
"This line, winding its way between the isolated communities of Erstogoetsland Southeast of Stockholm, was one of twenty one regional railways offered for sale five years ago."
"A private operator won the first five franchises, but after that, the state company S J won all but one of the remaining sixteen."
"On this line, they beat off two private sector competitors."
This line goes to Linnchurping seat of the regional government of Erstogoetsland Which had the task of awarding the franchise.
They chose the state railways because theirs was the lowest bid.
"they gave them a three year trial period, to see how attractive they could make the service."
"We had to see what happened to these railways er is more people going to er to go by train, or are less going to go."
And er we got the results now and er we more than doubled it.
it's more than double as much people who is today going by train than before.
Swedish railways are among the world's market leaders.
"Their pride and joy is the X two thousand, a tilting passenger train that operates at high speed on conventional track."
Britain abandoned a similar project eleven years ago.
"in the five years since they were first subjected to competition, Swedish Railways have transformed both their efficiency and their performance."
Some experts believe that British Rail would respond to competition in the same way.
It is possible to consider a situation where most franchises remain being run by groups of B R managers and a few franchises are run by private sector companies.
"The advantage of that would be that if the private sector does have things to offer in the way of better labour practices, better marketing ideas, then these will be copied by the B R system and in Sweden it's quite evident that although very few franchises have gone to the private sector, it has had a quite drastic effect on the way in which the state railway goes about its business."
Certainly Swedish Railways have taken to acting as toughly as any enterprise in the private sector.
"While improving the quality of their service to passengers, they've cut their staff by thirty percent."
Since they were first expose to competition.
The customers enjoy all the benefits of private sector efficiency from a state company.
We have restructured the whole company and we are working exactly as a private company.
And we have also done introduced the same working methods er as you can find er outside in the private industry.
Cos there are people in Britain who simply don't believe that the public sector can be as efficient as the private sector.
I think we can show that this is possible.
"Er and as you said, the only goal we had to start with was that we should turn the big losses into profit."
This was going on.
"And this was just enough for us, coming from the industry."
"in Sweden, introducing competition's had a dramatic effect on the state run railway system."
In groups of five they each save weekly after which one of their number can take a loan and invest in an income generating project.
"Each group opens their own joint bank account,manages their own money,does some basic budget planning and learns to fill out the forms and paperwork necessary to record all the transactions and keep track of the state of the fund and their management of it."
We saw numerous examples where people bought equipment.
For example Amina  has bought a sewing machine.
This will give her financial independence and a steady income.
She has repaid the debt and now has sufficient money on which to live.
Rebaya and her daughter purchased the materials necessary to men to make incense sticks and again have achieved a degree of financial independence which  six months before could not have been expected.
Some people use the money to buy fishing nets.
Our integrated health programme has provided a catalyst for slum families to have a hand in controlling their environment and working together to benefit each other.
Free of money lenders and learning to save and contribute financially to their own programme is an important step towards long term self sustainability.
Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed Mike for that excellent presentation.
And now I would like to ask her Royal Highness  to come to the platform and address us.
Thank you very much ma'am.
"Chairman, ladies and gentlemen."
"Well I'm delighted to see so many of you have taken the trouble to come and join us today  for yet another annual public meeting and in welcoming you can I give a particular welcome to our new chairman Mike Betts, thank him very much indeed  for joining us."
"He has  an excellent background in support,not involved in in the running but continuous interest and support  and for him to  take on this challenge shows a particular kind of commitment to the work of the Save The Children Fund and we're very grateful to him for taking it on and I sincerely hope that he will enjoy the experience, especially after  meeting all of you today."
Mike thank you for joining us.
Today is an important occasion for the fund.
"It always is er a moment to reflect, to look forward to  renew acquaintances, to recharge the batteries, to get new ideas and that's quite right  and this public meeting marks the eve of a particularly important year for all of us at the Save The Children Fund."
Our seventy fifth birthday year.
"I hope it will be  a birthday year in in every way, er but it's not just a good excuse to have a party  there is  very serious intent behind this birthday."
"When Eglantine Jebb launched the Save The Children Fund in May nineteen nineteen, one of her aims was for the fund to work for its own extinction."
Seventy five years on that day seems more distant than ever.
Eglantine also said that children are always the first to suffer  and that is certainly as true today as it was then which means that the Save The Children Fund's work is needed now as much as it was then.
B but the funds to support this work are harder to come by  and you don't need me to tell you that.
Yet the need is such that our spending at home and overseas has doubled in the last two years  and still vital pieces of work in the U K and overseas await funding.
"The sad reality is that nearly seventy years after Eglantine Jebb drafted the world's first charter of children's rights, the charter which became the foundation for the nineteen eighty nine U N convention."
"Children's rights to health, to a good education, to safety, to a secure childhood  are still threatened."
"In short children across, across the globe are facing pressures and conditions that are no longer considered acceptable to an international community that sees so much suffering around the world."
They want to do something.
I believe with our experience that the Save The Children Fund can do something positive that will last.
"Yes, I think we'd all agree with that."
Patrick?
"Thanks, erm the report refers to East Oxford, which is of course for two wards, East and St Clement's, but the problem extends city-wide, and I think the solution should be seen as a city-wide solution."
Yes.
Do you want to finally come back?
"Yes, I'd like to add one point, matters that the house continues in multiple occupancy and is successful at the present, and the landlord is not prepared to say that he is being now an agent of some hospital or other."
"I'm sure that he is, the people who've come from there, quite clearly recovering alcoholics or mental hospital patients, or possibly people from prison, and I've known enough people in my time to know this."
"And it is working very, very successful at the moment with the current set of tenants."
"However, there's clearly a need for some sort of monitoring and for some support erm other than erm some other support."
The landlord is not prepared to come up front and say that's what he's doing.
"Unfortunately, I suspect because he fears a reaction from his neighbours, and I'm afraid he's right."
He'd be very aware of what's likely to happen.
"He is trying to do something about it, though, I'm sure."
"Right, and this will call for some sensitivity in terms of how we handle this."
"Caroline and Shereen, is there anything else you want to comment on, otherwise I would ask that you'd come back to me on this in more detail."
I think I'd just like to add that I think that this could possibly be a very big piece of work.
Exactly.
"And I think it would actually need, if it's going to be taken on board, somebody appointed to look at this, or it be put in somebody's job brief and I would have thought ideally that it would be placed with the community worker, and I don't know quite how we're placed for community workers in East Oxford, but maybe it's something we could put to that department."
"I hear what you say, and I hesitate to make any further comment on that, given the current climate, but let's set about just examining the shape of the difficulty at the moment, and see what we can as it were immediately deal with ourselves, and what we can try and persuade other people to help us to know ."
"Will you come back to me in terms of who you want to invite, taking on Liz Kermey's point about involving people themselves if they so wish, and we'll consult with the opposition liaison member and the vice-chair."
"But in principle we agree do we not, to back multi-agency meeting, given what we said in the discussion and we will come back to you with something that's maybe a bit more specific, and more easy to discuss, may I say."
Thank you very much indeed for coming.
Thank you.
"Thank you, thank you for bringing it forward."
Thank you very much.
"We're back to the normal agenda, item eight on page thirty-six."
"Will you also while you're looking at this look at page thirty-seven, which is the pollution and nuclear issues control sub-committee."
"You will see there there has been a detailed discussion on this white paper, and members from that sub-committee made comments."
"I would suggest we do not need a second read of the discussion, but that can people keep an eye on , or try and change what is already there on pollution itself."
"Peter, you're introducing this on page thirty-six."
"Yes, I think it's totally clear that what we need is a short message, and it's a white paper, and therefore it's inviting a message, so what we really need is a short message to go with the A B C and the government act on the two S P's and I would give an undertaking at this point that it will go under the chief environmental health officers' name."
"Yes, quite."
"Yes, may please your worships I am satisfied that those documents  to cover the  defendant for the date in question  and will therefore offer no evidence  in relation to the  protest to these premises  but to dismiss them."
Could I ask sir
"Yes, stand up Mr   we listening to those three charges  and maybe you'll  no test certificate in those two  ."
Er
Now unless there's a prosecution we have the facts for the other offenses I understand.
"Yeah so please your worships it was the twenty first of June in the morning when the police officer was on duty  on the Aces Accrington at Worley he had occasion to stop the vehicle which was being driven by Mr   and he noticed that the excise licence which was being displayed had in fact, expired at the end of March."
"Mr  was unable to produce his documents in relation to the vehicle which he indicated was his own and he was therefore given an H R T one to produce those documents  but you will appreciate from the matters that he's pleaded  pleaded guilty to this morning  he in fact, failed to produce  his insurance  driving licence  and test certificate within the required period."
"Your worships, those are the brief facts, I would ask you consider back duty of eight pounds thirty three pence  at being called a month of  May."
I think you'll find
He says .
I would like them both to go back from the month of June.
I know.
I'd also ask you to consider costs of ten pounds.
.
He could have the li you can have your licence back  offenses to endorse it with.
Yeah  and er    .
You're able to help him anyway.
"Yes,"
I wonder if I may
Can I just say before we start but  er  why that he doesn't  call  June  and his licence for seven months.
"Sir, I apologise, I was  going by this figure made by  which indicated  that it expired on the thirty first of March, I think and in fact, that is a  an error on the officer's part  it would appear  from  the licensing authorities  in fact, it expired at the end of May."
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
"Your worships er, these offenses arrived out of er  what was, initially a road  traffic accident which occurred on the twenty first of June  er, when  er, Mr  's vehicle came into collision with  er, a vehicle that was  erm  stationary in the centre of the road waiting to turn right."
"No  er allegations of erm  concerning the  correct, his driving  er, are made by the pro prosecution  er  as a result of the incident but  er, as a result of the  officer's enquiries  er, it came to light that Mr   was  er, in breach of some of the  er, other regulations regarding road uses and  so the summonses which are to deal with this morning have er  have been issued against him."
"Erm, and you will  be aware that  at two of  er, three of the er  summonses that are now left here to de deal with, that's three of the four  er, do in fact, relate to clearly produce the documents."
"Er, failure to produce his driving licence  failure to produce  a  test certificate for the vehicle and failure to produce his insurance documents  and what Mr  says  in respect of er, those three offenses is that  er, the officer, he accepts, did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station  but he says that  he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident  and er  he didn't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time  and, never having had to produce his documents at the police station before  er, he had never  er no , known that that was a procedure that had to be followed  and in the circumstances  he didn't pay any attention to the print on the H R T  er, one form that was issued to him and he  didn't produce the documents."
It was completely ignorance on his part  in that respect.
"Er your worships, the one remaining summonses, the one relating to the fact that his vehicle  er, wasn't taxed at the time of the accident  and, I think er  he he will be aware his tax  er, did run out at the end of May  and this accident happened on the twenty first of June."
"I've asked him about that and what he said is that  er, he was saving up and he was going tax the vehicle as soon he  was able to do so  but he didn't have the funds and  er, to do so at, at that time."
"Erm  he is obviously aware that er  by not having the vehicle taxed  it's going to cost him considerably more than if he had er  taxed the vehicle at the right, correct and proper time."
"She is related to her sister's children, so she has a genetic self interest in me doing things for my, for, for her er, female, er for her relatives and my father doesn't."
So my parents er aren't gonna ag agree about my altruism.
"My mother will want me to be more altruistic to hers, than my father will."
"My father will want me to be more altruistic to his relatives, than my mother will."
And this again will be a cause conflict.
"Sometimes is, and here of course is conflict between  and married partners."
"How do we judge who's gonna be greater than  we can't say that erm, how do we"
"In practice, you mean?"
How do we do it in practice?
"Well, I suppose the simple, the short answer is, we don't know  exactly how we do it."
"The, the longer and more and less precise answer would be presumably, human psychology has evolved in such a way, as to allow us to make those kind of judgments that would normally be reliable."
"Er, I mean, for example, erm, if we  if you made us, well, let's go back to th your example."
Giving up your sweets for your brother.
"Presumably, if you felt sad about that, what you're saying is, you weren't as happy about that as your mother was."
"Your mother presumably, who forced you to do that, was happier than you were about it happening, and that's what made you sad."
"The, in other words, your emotions were reflecting these kinds of calculations."
"You seem to have an emotion, that made you resent making a sacrifice to your brother, and, and presumably, would have stopped you making it, if you'd been free to choose."
"Whereas your mother, presumably, had a different emotion, which made her think this was right and proper, or er, if it pleased her, issuing up this sacrifice."
"So it looks as if you, people's emotions have been tuned in such a way, that mothers look on these situations from their point of view and feel happy about it, and offspring like you look at it from their point of view and feel unhappy about it, and your emotions are the way the evolution has equipped you to deal with these problems."
"So if you'd been given a free choice, you wouldn't have given your sweets to your brother, would you?"
No.
"However,ho how, what was the age disparity between you and your brother?"
Four.
Four.
"My guess is though, that if, if the age difference had been something like erm, seven or eight years, by the time your mother was asking you to give up sweets for your very much younger brother, you would probably have matured sufficiently and perhaps identified enough with your mother to see yourself playing a more kind of maternal role, as, you know the grown up sister."
"You might not have minded  giving up your sweets, because you, you'd have got a different kind of gratification."
"You would have felt oh, I'm being like mummy."
"And, and I think that kind of thing happens, in fact you notice it happening in families."
"Where there's a big age gap, between the children, the older child often will go along with the parental wishes much more, merely because it's much more mature."
It won't be competing for the same resources.
"For example, it may not want the same sweets as, as the little kid, you know little kids like little kids' sweets, and grown up kids like more grown up sweets, they may like bubble-gum and things you wouldn't give to a little baby."
"So the very fact that the offspring are more mature, would reduce conflict, because the degree of value of the sources is going to be much greater, in other words, you could give up the sweet."
"And I had er had given myself a target of five thousand for Leith so I turned up the next  and made my five thousand in fact I made five thousand and fifty signatures for the h and I believe myself if, if every branch were doing the same as I had been doing then we would have no problem at all in getting a hundred thousand signatures which is our aim."
"And they said so at the er at the district council, went up to district and I asked for the support of the district council and er  probably John  immediately said, you have the full support of the district council for it he says and I'll ensure that you get support with the result I also received four posters direct from the Edinburgh District Council with  John  photograph on it and with the caption st stating every old age pensioner should be signing here."
So that in itself was a great boost for me and it er it helped a lot.
I also got support from er Labour  Labour Party in Leith who sent down two volunteers to help me.
"So it's made a lot, a big difference too."
I also had support from Lance house and from er Leith community centre.
"So I wasn't, I wasn't doing it all on my own, you understand my meaning?"
I weren't doing it all  although I sort of organized it.
"And when I took, I had to report back to area control I was immediate I got immediate applause."
"But I just said I don't want any applause for this at all, I feel that every pensioner, every pensioner should sign it whether they belong to the association or not."
Whether they have a senior citizens' club  with the association.
If they want the free bus passes they've got to  something done about themselves and .
"One of my  in fact was I can remember, I went up when I was first er  paying for  paying for an annual ticket with their bus passes and eight pound for a single ticket for us er for our quarterly ticket."
"I was up there three days campaigning, objecting to this that I'm being charged  and believe me for those three days I stood right in Queen Street, just outside the offices there, and at no, any time during, at any particular time of day, you could have come along to me, and there were still one thousand five hundred people standing there, rain, hail, sleet or blow."
"For their tickets, and I said at the area council if they had turned up like they turned up to pay them thirty pound and eight pound, if they'd turned up at the same time with a petition form what a difference it would"
What kind of erm reaction do you get from the different political parties to your campaign?
"Oh well, well er most of us are b even, even the Tories themselves know, they know that we're fighting for the old people, but do they  we get the same old reply from them, where is the money coming?"
"That's the s o o reply, and that is all cos because of the central go government  support grant who are naturally  younger."
"They're responsible for the, for the present  that they keep, they keep sending us this and that minister,and that."
"But they're, they're the gov they're going to end up in the government."
"They're going to govern the country, they cut the money off from  they cut the  support grant from the, the  from the district council, and still are, still are, and there's going to be even bigger cuts the next year."
Going to be even bigger cuts the ne and it's en there no used to  Lothian Regional Council Hall and district council.
"If the Lothian Regional C Council can't get their money from a from, a central government, where are they going to get it from?"
So erm do you get a lot of support from the Labour Party for your campaign?
"Oh every time, without fear  wherever you are er  Labour's Scottish Commons gives full support to the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association's pensions policy."
"That's from our own, we also have the Trades Union Congress  with the same."
"And that's when I say we have a, a campaign which is going to, it's a demonstration and er and rally in the end of March, of next year."
"When we will be marching off probably from Regents Street, proceeding along Queens er Princes Street ."
And then we've got us a  we're going to the  cinema.
"And that's a, and that's them all over the country, not only Edinburgh, all over the country, in north south east and west and you name it."
"And we have branches, but we could have a lot more because the amount of branches we have, although we have a lot of branches of Scottish Old Age Pensions  we are not  old age pensioners are not united, they're not united, the only way they can be united, if it's a national organization, join your national organization and fight the government."
"You can't do so locally, if you're all working separately."
"Now, anorexia is much written and talked about, but perhaps not accurately, how would you define anorexia?"
"I would say that the criteria that's that's sent out at the moment is is far too strict for the lot, a lot of women and  at the moment you're expected to be skeletal, whereas th , you can very well be thirteen stone and anorexic it's, it depends on your attitude towards food."
We have to find criteria for anorexia
Mhm.
"nervosa  which essentially means, er loss of body weight or fifteen percent your normal  preoccupation with weight, and loss of your periods for three months  and a morbid fear of gaining weight."
"And, why, you may argue that those criteria are too strict, those are criteria that are used in a medical sense."
"Well perhaps while we're doing it all, we're talking about anorexia, we should talk about the  er, the associated erm, disorder, bulimia, which is only recently become something that people are generally aware of."
"Wo wo would you like to offer er, a definition of of of bulimia as well?"
Well bulimia nervosa is a disorder of binging.
"Er, these binges take places regularly and they may amount to between three to five thousand calories in one binge."
"What does that mean, three to five thousand calories?"
I mean er
"A normal day you might eat two, three and a half thousand calories so within one  short period of eating  you would take in maybe double that."
"Er, associated with that are  certain behaviours, typically vomiting, laxative abuse, erm, use of diuretics which are water tablets or excessive exercising."
"Again, there are very many over-valued ideas about weight and what that means to the individual and a pre-occupation with weight."
"I believe that  the root cause of anorexia and  people who binge and  in fact, they are failed anorexics really!"
"There's, there's,th the  the aim is the same, the aim is not to  not to gain weight  er and  the control has been lost when th when it's necessary to binge."
"But, I believe that the root cause of ano , is is a  is a deep-seated unhappiness in the individual."
Mhm.
"Erm, I would agree that erm, what you saying about the anorexic thing and the fact that's it's a sort of deep-seated unhappiness, but I think that's far too general."
"You know, I think that  erm, this idea of  anorexics being, erm  sorry, bulimics being failed anorexics is, a wee bit kind of unfair!"
"Erm, I think the sort of emotional erm  sort of like  characteristics of both eating disorders are very, very similar."
"But I think the reasons why bulimics need to binge, erm is completely different from what than, erm"
an emotion that an anorexic could be suffering  from.
"It's er more to do with the feeling of, it's like filling gaps  erm"
Yep.
"erm, emotional gaps  , boredom,go you know, just a whole sort of like range of various emotions."
"Erm, where possibly like the, the anorexic, well I don't know cos I'm not speaking from an anorexic point of view, but I think the, the point we're saying, emotions are there but they're dealt with in a, a different way, you know they  perhaps starve themselves erm, to sort of like, erm  you know ge , get across these emotions, to deal with these emotions."
Mhm.
Yes?
"And one of the differences that anorexia can become much more visible and identifiable, whereas those of us who have experienced bulimia, which I had for thirteen years, can be extremely secret and well disguised because we normally don't change from normal body weight."
What's the difference between bulimia and compulsive eating?
"Okay, not travel."
"For the years ninety-one two, ninety-two-three, ninety-three- four"
Those in favour of that amendment please show.
"., and the against?"
"And that is carried, before taking the motion"
"amendment which I hope will  financial control which is that the  of financial services shall have no discretion to accept claims for the financial year ninety-three ninety-four, submitted after the thirtieth of June nineteen-ninety- four, that effectively means that that two month rule which he does have discretion on he will not have in the case of late claims in this financial year, that means we'll know exactly what the figures are, by the thirtieth of June."
"Can I put that, does anybody want to debate that?"
I thought actually we had a standing order already that claims had to be in within a certain time limit
"yes, yes"
"and I believe that, that three months is the time limit"
Two months
Two months  but he had discretion
"well, oh I see you're removing the discretion,ke"
In this particular case we're removing that discretion to try and tie the year down.
"Right, well, well debated,"
do you want to speak on that?
Yes I would  if I may.
"Can I just reassure Mr  that if actually we were not, er, if we were discussing an increase in members allowances then I would be fair square with him."
"We're in a position where we're going to borrow a bit from next year, that actually puts the pressure on as I see it's about nine or ten thousand extra this year, the allowance is about a hundred and eighty thousand, the total, erm, we're adding nine or ten thousand to that, we're taking it off it for next year, so we've already got ourselves something like an eighteen to twenty thousand reduction in members allowances next year so the pressure is on to resolve the problem, and er, perhaps Mr  might feel that actually that extra pressure might make us resolve it."
"I got the dates wrong, it's the thirtieth of may that's two months after the end, so the amendment I'm moving"
"Thank you, er, Mr"
"On the amendment, on the amendment, as you're seeking to amend standing orders, is this committee able to do that?"
"I think the particular point about the two month rule which may be extended at the discretion of the director, which obvious  taking his discretion away, I don't think that's a standing order"
"Yeah, I, I don't think it's a standing order sir, I think its part of erm, I'm just trying to find it, it's part of the member's allowances, and this committee is charged with dealing with member's allowances."
Can I put that to the vote?say aye
aye
"Well now, I think  and I think we may  I would say that erm, I  improving the qualified budget as well,but there's no doubt , I put the  motion to the vote, those in favour please show"
aye
and the against
.
"Agenda item eight  Mr  's appointment to the sub-committee of the West regional association with deaf, for the deaf, should be an approved duty for the payment of travelling and subsistence allowances only."
"On the grounds that this is erm, now appropriately remote from the county council's work."
Thank you Anne.
Nonnie?
"As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together?"
"Yes, Okay?"
Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can?
"Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages."
"Yes, but at what level?"
Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised?
I don't know.
"You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on?"
"The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues  I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear."
"Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the  to say."
I'm not part of the  organisation.
"They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives."
"I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked."
"In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like ."
"In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense."
I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities.
And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on.
"So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that."
"I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you ."
"Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past."
mhm
I'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were.
"Well, no, but I"
"But of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the"
"Yes, I get that, yes"
"Ian, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again."
"Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out."
I'm sure of it.
Thank you very much indeed.
Bye
"I went to my G P, having avoided her for fifteen years, having getting  the old story every time you went  well you must go on a diet!"
"I had been on diets  and to put it in context, over twenty years I've lost a hundred and twenty stone!"
Which if you break it down is only about a pound and three quarters a week
and I think a lot of people are like that.
"But, when you look at it in that context it becomes very much  erm, part of your life, and it takes an awful lot to break that habit  and there's no help."
Up there.
I think it's very easy to fall into the trap of feeling guilty.
Mm.
"Erm, I went on a diet last year, to one of these  clubs  and, within record time got to the weight I was supposed to be, calorie counting  and then I had to come off  and I found for weeks after  feelings of terrible guilt if I ate"
Mm.
a chocolate biscuit!
"I was mentally calorie counting every time, it took me ages to get back to a sort of normal life."
"Can you identify th that the point at which  worrying about food, we've all agreed we shouldn't be, but there it is we do, er  pitches you into eating disorder and er  I know ca , is is there preventive action to be taken apart from changing society completely?"
Yes?
"I think it's when you become inappropriately absorbed around the areas of food  I think, too, because I work with teenagers"
Mm.
"that early intervention  is  the best way of coping with it, and certainly it demands that parents and friends and teachers, and people concerned  are aware of any change which is sustained over a period  because by early intervention then you're probably coping with the problem rather than the eating disorder, because the problem is there before the eating disorder."
"Erm, can intervention, as you call it, be effective do you think?"
Very!
"If it's early, before the pattern's  really entrenched."
Yes?
"I think it's wrong to underestimate  erm i i it's particularly initially, how, how positively reinforced it can, it can be around you  erm, just this  the idea of losing weight  and that er  you know, people will be  wha , for whatever reasons are, either envious or they want to know how you can do it, they want to know, and particularly if it's linked with exercise then it's all very good things to do and  you know, the media's telling you and  a , everyone's telling that this healthy lifestyle that actually then goes out of control through  being so controlled  erm e e , there's a, well there's a thin line between it, being a very positive experience, and you're suddenly buying smaller jeans and erm  you know, it's just  everything is is feeding, if that's the right word, this idea that it, that that it's tremendous to be"
Mm.
"losing weight, to realising that you can't do anything about it."
I think the advice I would give any mother of an anorexic is to tell them how awful they look!
I wish I'd been told early on  what I looked like  and what I was doing to my body.
Nobody  wanted to be cruel enough to hurt me because they thought I was so vulnerable at that time  and I really wish I'd been told that I looked disgusting!
"But at another level, if we could show love, respect and acceptance for each other in the magnificent diversity that that we show as women, instead of patronising and attacking each other on the basis of our body shapes, that would be a great step forward!"
Hooray!
Yes?
"I'd like, I'd just say that I the the are professionals now that do know more about eating disorders and I do think there are clinics being set up."
"Erm, we do know quite a lot about  erm, why it is that when you diet you start to think about food all the time, and why it is that certain things happen, and I think that there's more and more information and knowledge being gathered  and yes, the  na , the desire to change has to come from the individual but perhaps, having clinics available where people can go when they're ready to change or where they can get help."
Right.
The erm pensioners and the employees have no say whatsoever in that.
Very good.
"That's  that's the present case, but I think er impact would say that with a fifty-fifty split, then those trustees should elect their own chairman and should be free to bring in independent trustees, so if you had a board of say four company members and four elected by the members er of the pension fund, they might decide to have two outside independents, one of which they would choose as the Chairman."
"So you no longer have a fifty-fifty split then, do you?"
"Er  you  er you'd have two outside independents and you couldn't say how they would be, but they would be elected by the whole te whole er Board of Trustees."
Jane?
Er I'm forgive me if this information is already available to the Committee but er are each of your schemes are they money purchase schemes or final salary schemes?
Ours is a finance salary scheme.
"committee did draw distinction between the two different kinds of schemes, erm perhaps if I could just ask you what do you think of the committee the Good reports er conclusion on training for trustees where they er the recommendation was that it was a laudable objective, but should not be made compulsory?"
Er can I answer that.
"We er are fortunate enough in having a training scheme, in fact we were able to elect our first pensioner representative trustee two years ago and he is with us today, we've just had another election and er two this time were elected, they will be trained, they had er Mr Hill had a two-day training by our actuaries er Watsons which are a big company, er but in talking to him about it he felt there was a lot to be said for having continued training, not just at the beginning of a two or three-year stint, but successively later."
"It's a big responsibility which is very much on the trustees shoulders, he is, he is standing on his own there and it's"
We were we were only smiling then because Watsons also trains us
It's one of our advisors.
"No, but we feel that's very important indeed."
"Absolutely, no."
"No, no we understand the value of that don't we."
"Erm well we would like to see training of the trustees, there is no training at the moment er for the trustees in erm either of our schemes er and we very much in our submission came out  we felt there should be er training from the trustees."
Right.
"Yes, we would like to er certainly see er training become compulsory with trustees and we would also like to see er guidelines set er for that particular training, so that train so that the trustees within all schemes would receive similar training, rather than piece-meal by one set of actuaries or another set of actuaries."
"Erm can I just clarify this point, the impression I'm getting from the, from the phraseology in the way you've chosen your words is that your trustees in your particular pension funds which all er former nationalised industries, er haven't received any training."
Is that correct that er
That is correct.
Well the as far as we know the er certainly the trade union
Don't get any.
Don't get any.
"When the management trustees get any training, we don't know."
"Yes, in British Steel they, they do receive training, they do receive training."
Right.
Even if but I'm not saying that it's er the proper type of training that we would like to s
You were saying that in fact you still don't get any training.
erm  this is going to be really  hard work .
"It's got, I mean, surely the, the middle peasants or even the rich peasants  the group of people that are gonna be most productive in the economy erm so you know your reform has to be fairly moderate in that sense that they have to be able to  promote"
Right.
"economic growth and, and"
Right.
"So in a very broad sense agriculture is going to have to con contribute to China's, China as a whole's economic development"
Mm.
"I E to, to, and will contribute to China's industrialization because once we are in control industrialization will be necessary."
"So agriculture will have to play a role in that and therefore we want to increase agricultural output  and  in order to do that you want to protect the middle and rich peasants who are the most efficient producers, or I E managerial farms  if, if they are more efficient, you want to, if  you want   it would not make sense to take land away from rich peasants in order to give to poor peasants when rich peasants might be more efficient producers."
Well it depends how quickly the poor peasants can achieve more efficiency   how quickly they can do that.
Right.
"Yes, so, so, so you're taking decisions in terms of well  which are the most efficient"
within the countryside and how can we create those m those .
"That er that, that, I mean that efficiency thing is becoming an important consideration in a way which  we, we, we've not mentioned before."
Mm.
"Well I mean surely it's, that's  the point now is to try to make a fair erm law and one that is ideologically erm designed seeing we've got to power, or we've got certainty of obtaining power, therefore land ownership has got to be  land ownership which has been  capitalism  Marxist"
So th th is becoming more complex.
"I i in the past our aim with land reform has been very largely erm  we want to end feudalism and we want to maximize mobilization  we, we're now saying okay we, we still want to those, but we, we've also got to ensure that somehow we have a land law which ensures that agriculture will play a role in China's industrialization and so we will get maximum efficiency from the agricultural sector  as well as mobilization, as well as ending feudalism."
Er er we could  say that we've got a much bigger range of aims and does that mean that we are more likely to have
"it's going to be very difficult isn't it, for us to be able to achieve all of those aims  at the same time."
Well er I mean well things like communal ownership  advocate them to be  reforms
"You can move beyond the efficiencies of erm of the erm  managerial systems or the existing systems by erm creating, you could do coll collectives and then using state support to erm bring in erm more capital"
You reckon  state collectives do you?
"Well  well you, you can advocate erm mutual aid and all these sorts of things which erm  which are erm a step towards, I mean I'm not saying they're directly"
You can encourage it without  how the
Right.
agricultural system works.
So you might actually want to put something of that in to your land reform
"Yeah and, and you can have erm through loans etcetera you can start increasing"
Right.
capital which
Yes.
"We  absolutely no, no, you'll find we won't leave  this topic cos there's three people who actually want to come in now and I'm going to bring them in round the table."
Clifford first and then er
"Can I take you back to the er the Good Report er about Trust Law,i it the report er concludes that it should be retained as the  framework for er occupation of pension schemes."
Now  I M P A C say that they believe there should be a dedicated pensions act to replace trust law and the National Federation Post Office and B T pensioners say trust law should continue to be the basis of pension funds.
Could  tell  could each of you tell us why you take a different view?
"One way or another, I'm not quite sure what the  the state of the"
"We believe  now outdated, it was never designed to deal with the current situation the modern situation and when you are talking about"
"debts of some four hundred thousand million pounds, trust law does fall down."
"The only recompe the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts, for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment."
"Now that's a costly business as we know to our cost, we didn't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds, the pension fund did, but we had to risk paying those to go to court."
"Now next year something else might happen and somebody may be forced to go to court, if they cannot go to court they cannot get justice and they have to wait to see what happens."
"Now we have in the Companies Act a Table A which gives you a suggested er model, Memorandum of Association and Articles Association, why not a dedicated pensions act which says in here these are the minimum terms you must contain in your Trust Deed."
"You can better them if you wish, but you cannot go below them."
People would know exactly where they stood then and we wouldn't have to go keep going to the courts to develop the theory of Trust Law.
"So you'd leave the Trust Law in existence, so you wouldn't call cause a total legal revolution, but you would impose on that a spy  of legal requirements which if trusts wish to through Trust Law enhance, they could, but they h all have to bring their agreements up to that minimum?"
Up to that minimum yes
"Yeah, very good."
"A model, model trust deed."
Yeah.
"Yes, B T?"
page two of your submission
Yes.
paragraph
"We felt that erm Trust Law had worked effectively erm you know over the years erm w we were happy with the extra powers that the er committee were recommending and the extra precautions that the committee were recommending that we brought in, but erm we would be happy with that backup to continue with the Trust Law."
"Even in the situation that we find ourselves in with the Maxwell Pension situation, where we find that the  the erm Trust Law didn't prevent the things from happening which did happen."
Do you still take that view?
But they hadn't got the backup of erm like th the regulator  appointed.
"I'm sorry I couldn't hear everything that the Maxwell people were saying, sitting behind me,you you've lost their, their voice and you  you know, I couldn't hear what they were saying."
"But wi with the appointment of er of the regulator and the oth the other erm  recommendations that were made by the report, we think with that backup w w we are still basically happy to continue with Trust Law."
"Well I er er we I wasn't speaking about the, the evidence today, I'm speaking about evidences that have been taken in the past, where we had even trustees before the committee."
"We informed the committee that regardless to the fact that they were trustees, they were in no position to challenge Mr Maxwell  and under those conditions then they felt that the  the law should be changed  that the Trust Law wasn't sufficient  to er look after pensions, because they felt that in certain circumstances in fact gave evidence to the committee, various people gave evidence along those lines, that they were almost powerless against Mr Maxwell and that's ."
"That's why I'm surprised you, you take this"
"Tonight, and during the next two Tuesday programmes, we are going to look at cultural links and influences."
"This evening I have with me Norbert Lynton, who is Professor of History of Art at the University."
"Norbert, is British art influenced at all by what goes on in the Continent?"
"I think British artists, much more than the general public, British artists are pretty aware of what's going on on the Continent."
Influenced is more difficult to say.
I think very often the influence goes the other way.
"Now that's something we in England, in Britain I should say, are not particularly aware of, but a lot of British artists who are very well known on the Continent, that in Britain would seem, you know, too avant-garde to be known to the wider public."
"Could you give me an example, or examples?"
"Well, I could, but they'd be meaningless in a sense."
"I mean, well, by coincidence there's an exhibition at this moment at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London; upstairs there's a show of Tony Cragg."
"Now I'd not seen his work before, that's partly because I'm in Brighton and not in London and don't get up that often perhaps, but he has hardly shown in England, whereas he's very well known in Europe, using Europe for the Continent."
"He's had many one-man shows in European galleries, but this Whitechapel show is his first real sort of public display in this country."
Now this applies to many other artists.
"A man like Richard Hamilton, for instance, who's now pretty well known in this country, was much better known on the Continent of Europe and in America, in Switzerland, in Germany, in Northern Italy — Milan particularly — much better known there than he was for decades."
"Traditionally, I always feel that the influence goes the other way."
"I think of people, grand old British artists, like Turner for example, going on grand tours and coming back to Britain and going through, as it were , a period of painting where he is influenced by what he's seen and heard and experienced in Europe, and then more latterly I think of France as being, Paris as being the centre of art and British artists going and spending their period in Paris and coming back and going through an impressionist or an expressionist phase."
I don't sort of think of it as art going in the other direction.
"Well, you're suffering from, if I may put it that crudely, of a well-known British disease of a lack of self-regard in a sense."
"The British in their quiet way think of themselves as the salt of the earth, and quite rightly too, but where matters of culture are concerned they do have this tendency to think that the best things happen abroad and at best can be borrowed from abroad."
In Turner's time art was very international.
"Rome was, I suppose, the capital of the art world, but Rome was essentially an international place where many a Britisher was famous; where Flaxman, for instance, had established himself as one of the most famous artists in the world."
We hardly mention him nowadays.
"Turner did the grand tour, certainly; he learnt a lot in Italy, but he learnt equally a great deal from English artists and from Dutch artists  and in so far as he used the grand tour, and used what Rome and other countries had to offer, that's what every artist did, every European artist, not just the English."
And of course there have been many moments when English art was very important on the Continent indeed.
"An obvious example is the Pre-Raphaelites, who, whilst still being spurned in England, except that they were collected by, I don't know, Manchester businessmen, spurned in London, let's say, were enormously influential in Brussels, in Paris, and in Germany and Austria."
Can I ask you a rather difficult question?
"As an amateur person, as it were, interested in art, I get very confused about what's been happening in the past fifty to eighty years."
"I think I can more or less understand in general terms what happens up until sort of the impressionist time, maybe just post-impressionist."
After that it all gets rather confusing.
"There seem to be so many different terms — action paintings, abstract impressionisms, realisms, geometrical art, monochromes, dozens of other different terms."
Is there any real development and trend that could be explained perhaps in rather simple language to people like myself?
There's no one dominant trend at the moment I don't think.
I think he'll be m
that there was but the figures are actually not as er as er disappointing as er Mr  may feel.
"We do acknowledge that the fatalities by the end of er by the end of December last year fatalities had increased in the county but that does, but that's not really the figure that goes, go on because the numbers involved are actually quite small."
"Overall during last year, this is to the end of, of November actually because fin figures aren't available for the end of the year, the reduction was four point nine percent, which compares with four point three percent in the previous year, so not only are they still going down, they're actually going down slightly more than they were in the previous year and that must be encouraging."
"And the next point on that is that the amount of road safety in the base budget figures, the amount from various different areas whether it's education, training, publicity, accident investigation or traffic calming, that amount of money is untouched so the same amount will be spent in the coming year a as was spent last year."
"As far as the capital receipt money goes, not all, it's not been possible to spend all of that this year because the development of some of these urban traffic calming schemes is actually very complicated and we've had to re-think some of them."
"The result is of that is not fortunate that they've been delayed but that in fact we have as much money to spend on them next year from the capital receipts as we will have spent this year, so in a sense we, we're not going backwards there either."
And then I would just draw attention to the  proposals.
Several of them there.
"Er, rural traffic calming, speed cameras, provision for cyclists, pedestrian  are all new money with a road safety bias in it, so I think we've done the best that we could this year."
Thank you Mr .
Mr
Oh one sorry one last point.
Mr  asked about traffic calming on new roads.
Er and the answer to that is yes.
"Er when development schemes are put before us, or put before districts, it is possible to er to include a scheme which is designed to be a calmer scheme and in fact we have our own advice notes on roads and res residential areas that we hope to advise developers on that."
"And in fact the  there, most of the traffic calming is actually being paid for and carried out by the developer for that scheme."
Thanks Mr .
Mr .
"Yes er Chairman erm the eighteen point three million that we quoted in last year's report, we actually added into the revenue budget the provision for structural maintenance that was contained in the capital programme."
"Erm, there is a figure of seventeen point two million being quoted in this report."
"As it says, it's just the revenue works programme."
"If you add in the structural maintenance which is in the capital programme, which amounts to two point two million, and add that to the seventeen point two, you get nineteen point four million and that's the figure that needs to be  with last year's figure at eighteen point three."
"So the equivalent figure for, for the last year is nineteen point four, that's an increase of one point one million."
"Now part of that is inflation and part of it is the addition of, of erm proposals which are in the report erm from the Policy and Resources allocation of nine hundred and ninety thousand."
"Right, thank you for that clarification Mr ."
"Right, can I take you to the recommendation on page six."
Agreed.
"Agreed, thank you."
"Right, agenda item number six which is on page one of the blue book."
regional transport strategy.
Who do you see as the sort of holding responsibility for training?
Whoever's got some knowledge to pass on.
"Yeah, who has ever got knowledge to pass on."
"Cos if you were asked as, as, as a person by, by a manager or by somebody else to, to actually do the training, then it's your responsibility isn't it you've been asked, you've been given that task and it's your responsibility to ensure that people are able to do at the end of the session something effectively."
Who else do you see as holding responsibility for training?
Training Officer.
Yeah.
Training Officer.
"That's what they're  they're employed to do at any particular site, but they don't hold total responsibility do they?"
Line Manager's job.
"Yes, yeah."
"Line Managers and Supervisors as well are, are responsible for training because as a Line Manager or a Supervisor you're responsible aren't you for training and developing people."
That is one of your accountabilities to develop others and training falls into that.
"Now you may as a manager think well you don't have to do it all yourself, you can use senior people within your section who have the knowledge or you can use training officers or you can use people like ourselves at the training centre or the C B T or the I Vs or it could be that you bring the marketing department to help you out."
"There are lots of resources available for you, but ultimately if you have a manager or a supervisor in your title, then you are responsible for the training development of others, or in a technical, Louise and Andy the B T As are responsible for the, the technical training, aren't they, of others within, within the section cos you have the knowledge."
"Well what a lot of people say on the course is  I know it's my responsibility, but I always, I don't always have the time to train because there's a lot of backlog, there's a lot of pressure, it's  and we all say to them that training  is like a catch twenty two situation."
"If you don't make the time for training due to the work, pressures or deadlines or backlogs, and if you're not training others they make mistakes don't they?"
"If they're not properly trained it's not their fault, people can only do what they can do can't they?"
If th they don't know  if people are not properly trained they are making mistakes then it does make more work doesn't it?
Because the mistakes have to be rectified  and it puts us under even more pressure because you've got even less time.
So training  we do need to make the time otherwise it does become a catch twenty two situation.
"But as you said if it is your responsibility you'll have to do it all yourself, there are lots of resources and lots of other people who can actually help you out who have the knowledge and you can use  because you can use it as a development tool can't you for some of your members of the section to  to give them some training expertise."
Right so we'll just look at the sort of er the negative side of not making the time that we get more mistakes.
We have to rectify more mistakes and  put more pressure on us.
"What I'd like to introduce lastly now is an approach that you can take to training  to help yourselves and to help make it more effective and more systematic and what I'd like to introduce to you is, is something called the training cycle and the rest of the course is actually based around the training cycle and I know Margaret you've actually seen the training cycle a few weeks ago, I'm not sure if, if any of the others are, any of the others familiar?"
"Yes, I have."
You've seen it before.
Good.
Now for questions in the next session now.
Can't remember it though .
Great.
"We've seen training, there have been four major steps for training and the first of which is actually to identify training needs."
"Bill Hamilton, B B C News."
"Can anybody fail, fail to be moved by those pictures."
"Children really are under fire throughout the world, literally and metaphorically."
"Even in those countries where the, the real firing has stopped, there's the aftermath."
"Many of the wars, most of the wars, are civil wars  and you know the bitterness, the lingering bitterness after a civil war doesn't help the children who have suffered from that war."
"Also just think of the troubles in our own Northern Ireland, right on our doorstep."
Think of the problems that children have there.
"But even where there is no real warfare, man's inhumanity to children has caused serious deprivations of rights  and of benefits generally."
"Food, health  support, education, kindness,care, affection."
These are all  features of a child's life that they need.
"Otherwise children, without those, grow up physically,psychologically  damaged and the purpose of Save The Children Fund  is to work to give children the chance of a better childhood  and the chance to grow up to be adults who won't repeat the sins  of their forefathers."
"Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this annual public meeting in this, our seventy forth anniversary year."
"Some of you er may take it amiss if I were to describe you as veterans  but my by contrast, this is my first annual public meeting and not just as chairman."
I've never had the opportunity to attend one before.
Although I have been a long time supporter.
"Today, her Royal Highness  Nick Hinton and his team will talk about the very impressive work  and the tasks that lie ahead in the fifty countries and the U K in which Save The Children operates."
I I will talk about the fund as I found it in my capacity as a very recent chairman.
A fresh pair of eyes.
A fresh pair of eyes of a relative new boy  and the first thing I noticed was my family's reaction.
"It was as though they were saying to me, at last you're doing something worthwhile and respectable."
My first impression was how well everything runs  and in  saying that I really am paying a tribute  to previous chairmen.
"For whose efforts on behalf of the fund I I really do thank them and I'd like to make a special thanks  to Lady Chandler, Lucy stepped into the breach as acting chair about a year ago and since I was elected has done a tremendous amount to help me settle in quickly and I hope effectively."
"I'm most impressed also with the hard work, the dedication and the, the sheer efficiency of the director general and his top team."
"I was talking, yesterday as it happened, to the chairman of another very large children's charity and I asked him how his, the spend, the annual spend of that charity was distributed between  the work of the charity, the purpose of the charity  and the support functions and he said about eighty twenty."
"Now I have to tell you that last year  we raised a hundred and thirteen million pounds  and of that  over ninety per cent, that's a hundred and four million pounds were actually spent on projects for children and I'm very proud of that ratio indeed  and I think it ought to give you, the raisers of money, a great deal of comfort because for a fund with two headquarters buildings  which operates all over the world  this is a distribution of funds of which to be proud."
"Now I've met  not many yet, but very impressive, a few very impressive field workers."
"I've not had a chance to visit abroad yet but I think I've got two visits booked next year to various remoter parts of the world, but I've met some who are on leave, recuperating  from the circumstances they've been in, sometimes illness, sometimes just the sheer tension of being under fire."
"Each country presents its challenges, some physically demanding, others morale sapping, there is disease, there are primitive conditions in which to live and work."
"I'd just like to mention one, Somalia."
"I'd like to pay a tribute to the courage of our people there, both the indigenous er workers for the fund and the ex-pats who've gone out there to lead that work."
"We're in touch with them every day, they refuse to leave and we're very grateful to them for their efforts."
"But those in the field, the front line  could not continue without  the less than glamorous work that has to be carried out  back here in H Q. They also serve, who work in our offices, collect our money, keep our accounts  make sure the administration is working well."
In Croatia we are supporting an agency which provides direct assistance to refugee families and to young people.
This work in former Yugoslavia will become an established part of our European programme.
In Romania we are planning to work with Romanian Save The Children  and to help the Romanian government in its juvenile justice system which is sadly in need of major development and change.
"We're also engaged with the European Community in discussion over a bid for funding to develop social work, child protection and alternatives to institutional care and to other child care systems within Romania."
This work again will be undertaken in partnership with non-governmental child care organisations in that country.
"Through g contacts already established throughout the U K department, links have been d=established and developed with work in Poland,Russia and Albania and we're working to assess the policy, practice development or programme contribution we might make in those European countries."
I believe our credibility and our strength in these new initiatives in Europe flow from our status as an international development agency and from our high quality work in projects in the United Kingdom.
I'd now like you to hear directly from a young person for whom access to one of our projects in the United Kingdom has made major changes in her life.
"To Caroline  home is a room for her possessions, abandoned by her Mum and Dad as a baby, she spent her life moving from one set of parents to another."
"When you haven't got no one, you have to, sort of like find a way of doing it for yourself and it's much harder."
Today Caroline lives alone in a room in Oxford.
"Without family guidance she sometimes finds it hard to manage, especially money."
"While some of her friends have taken drugs, Caroline's been in trouble with the police for stealing from shops."
"In the beginning I did it to look good, cos I wanted the money, towards the end it was doing it to live, it was literally doing it to live."
I hated doing it.
I used to go into a shop and I'd shake and I'd  know that I was doing wrong and I'd be really scared and I'd just knew I don't want to go to prison so I decide to stop it.
"Now when she needs a hand, Caroline turns to life chance."
"A partnership between Save The Children, social and youth services it helps youngsters help themselves by turning moans into action."
"Really we're trying to give young people a voice, put them in the driving seat."
"Gradually it sort of like brings people out of themselves and do you know what I mean, they learn to do things."
"Whilst as a worker I might see the process, to me very important, I think there's a lot of concrete outcomes for young people feel we have achieved this, we did this for ourselves, it's ours, we own it."
"You've gone and achieved something, you feel like you've done something good, you feel like you're somebody."
This is when I was pregnant  went to put my name down on the housing list and they said to me sorry you can't we've got too many people on there already.
Life Chance workers hope this can  homeless teenagers who will be the next to benefit from the project.
Building up trust and friendship takes time but for hundreds makes Life Chance a lifeline.
I think that Caroline's experience as portrayed in that video is not unusual.
Many children and young people get caught up in crime.
Either through the necessity to obtain items which they believe are essential or through a desire to be one of the gang and valued by their peers.
Interestingly Caroline expressed both those needs at different times during that presentation.
Children who are caught up in crime are getting a lot of media attention lately.
"Many people say that the solution is to take the young person who has committed a crime out of their community and lock them away, that will achieve a solution."
"Save The Children Fund's years of experience shows it doesn't work and indeed that form of incarceration can lead to some of the tragic circumstances of self image, damage and even death which have occurred in penal institutions and been reported recently."
This year
They did for last year.
"I mean, it's for Christmas this year that we want it."
"Well, can you get them together with Katherine fairly rapidly, is that a good idea?"
"I mean, there's enabling and enabling, isn't there for heaven's sake."
"Chair, on the recommendations erm on item D, I'm a bit unhappy about the use of the term ‘natural’ disasters, because I believe that many of the disasters that people in Oxford are actually giving money for are man made disasters, particularly matters of international economics and the unfair burden, erm unfair distribution of wealth which places a whole sector of the world in poverty, and I think, you know, you do get a magnificent response from people in Oxford to these charities, and we must be aware that there are a whole number of greater issues involved, and while I hear what you're saying earlier on about you can't take on the problems of the whole world, I think when people are actually giving money to charities for example, like Oxfam, they are often unaware of these issues, and we do have a wider role in making the, joining with organisations like Oxfam in spreading public awareness on these issues."
"Right, I agree with that, and I think that we'll simply leave out the word ‘natural’ in future, won't we."
Have we agreed that as a committee?
"Indeed, we have all agreed, I take it the recommendations under eight one in order that we can make progress."
Which left the word in?
"So that we can report back, a month before decision time next time round?"
Are you happy with that?
Item seven then is on page twenty-seven.
"This is flag day, which essentially means house-to-house."
"Is there anything you want to say about that, Katherine at this stage?"
"No, it's quite straightforward."
"Right, the only comment I have is members will remember that we got slapped in council last year because we issued a permit to LIFE for a flag day application."
"I sat down with LIFE and worked through their philosophy, erm in line with our own as it were, and they agreed, and I would ask them to agree this year that any paperwork or any leaflets they distribute make it very clear that a choice remains for a woman in terms of whether or not she should have an abortion, because LIFE is fairly, yes, Michael?"
"Did you check their tenancy agreement, because it was a pretty Machiavellian, Dickensian tenancy agreement, if you're found smoking in bed for example, you were out the next morning, those sort of things, and I think you really ought to look at that very carefully."
"We certainly did last year, there's no reason why we can't monitor it again, so they know we are watching them quite carefully."
That might have been for very good environmental and health reasons.
"Yes, I should hope so."
"I think I would commend LIFE to you, but it will be with the same conditions and terms as we did last year, with which they did comply."
Are there other questions of queries on flag days or are you happy to approve them as they stand.
"That's on page twenty-seven, six one, twenty four flag day permits to be approved, and we allow the officer to decide how they will best be distributed across the city."
Are you happy with that?
"And then on six two, do you wish to grant a permit to allow a flag day to take place on one or two days during nineteen ninety-one, for the Royal British Legion?"
"Can I have someone move something on that, please?"
"Yes, I'd move that erm they'd be granted two days."
I'll second that.
"And you'll second that, cross-party approach to this, are you all agreed?"
Thank you very much indeed.
"On the other hand there are some qualifications that technicians may take, we may be lucky, we may get such a person, and I hope so."
"Yes, so it isn't a person."
Right.
"Matthew, are there, erm Diana?"
Thank you.
"It's a, it's a fascinating report and having been involved in the Food Forum discussion, when we, it was reported to us that we'd actually lost a community nutritionist, I read this with great interest to see just how now the professional was seen through sections."
"And, I mean, reluctantly we have to accept that this is not an ideal world, but I mean, just now, we were actually looking at the number of food hygiene inspections that have been done over the last few months, which have increased enormously, it just means, I mean it emphasises the fact that food has changed, food, and the number of places that are actually serving food now I mean, the corner shop does sandwiches."
"Everybody seems to be producing food, wherever you go food is on offer, food is for sale."
"I realise that many of these are not high-risk areas, but they are areas that our officers have got to, got to keep an eye on."
"And numbers are increasing while our staffing has actually, actually decreased."
"erm We've got to recognise the professional advice that Matthew is giving us in this report, that he, he needs professional trained staff, and it grieves me that really we can only offer a technician when he is asking for something more."
"But we are giving, we are giving him a post, another body, and hopefully with a very careful job description he will get a trained person, because we also recognise the fact that Oxford's a marvellous place for people to come."
The environmental health department is seen throughout Britain as being a nice place to come.
"I mean, I keep hearing that when I come into the environmental health department, that, just that people are interested in what Oxford are doing."
"They keep  busy, don't they."
Well set up.
Yes.
"So we're one of the important environmental health departments, sure, so hopefully we will actually get somebody who is really very good, a food technician to assist in this erm field, and there have, I hope that through Food Forum we may well be able to help Matthew with his, well not just Matthew, but help, help that section with the nutrition advice that he feels is still lacking in his team under the circumstances."
Thanks very much Diana.
"Can I just remind members that, I mean there's a member of the technical staff in this room now."
"We have a number of technicians in the environmental health department who do some sterling work, and I know that no one here would want you to suppose that they are a kind of second-string person."
"They do a different kind of work, they've traditionally done considerably responsible work within Oxford City's Environmental Health Department, so there isn't a suggestion on the part of any of us that they are somehow lesser beings, because that is not the case at all."
Can I put it to you that we cannot today accept the recommendation on page forty-eight.
"But I do move today that we transfer the technical post that will become vacant in the pollution section by the end of this year to the food section, and that Matthew together with the chief environmental health officer consider how best to write a job description, and advertise for that post, and that while I do not see us securing a budget of two thousand five hundred pounds as under fifteen b, I do recommend that the health education authority are contacted, that their help-line is used, and that our E H O's use their premises in the coming new year."
I am assured that they are advertised in the Institutions Journal.
"Matthew, that isn't all you want, but maybe we'll be able to discuss this again in twelve months time."
Thank you very much for the work you've put in.
Alright.
Thank you chair.
Thanks.
I note that we have Terry Randal here.
"Maybe we should take item seventeen and allow him, is ten minutes going to be enough?"
Well that's what GATT is really.
"That's what, you know, that's why agriculture is trying to be, sort of er, subsumed within the GATT."
"Yes, but it's failed."
"Well, it's, it's failed at the moment, but as, you know, if you've seen on television, or read a paper lately, you know, you've got ten days to go"
"before erm, you know, if we're going to get a GATT agreement, you've got ten days to, to negotiate it in."
Ten days to
"Er, yes, yes, that's right."
"There's a lot of brinkmanship going on at the moment, a lot of er, horse-trading I dare say, going on as well."
"Erm, but er, okay."
"Erm  er, okey-doke, domestic policies will affect world, world market."
"It's likely, will world market prices fall?"
Or rise as a result of protectionism?
Rise.
"Why might, why might they rise?"
Because they cost more.
What costs more?
Erm  panic
It may not do
"You know what tends to happen, is that world prices fall, alright, in the presence of protectionism."
"Alright, because what you're doing, is that you're increasing domestic production."
"Right now it serves its purpose, and increasing domestic production is going to increase world production, if there's more supply, prices will fall, if everything else stays the same."
"So what tends to happen is that world, world agricultural prices fall, right, and that trend has been observed erm, er, it's an im empiric empirically, agricultural product prices tend to have fallen in general sort of, over the last sort of, eighteen hundred years."
Yes.
"So that, erm, the fact that you're increasing erm, protection, protectionism against it, isn't it likely to upset the producers who are exporting it, and who say it's no point exporting it there cos we're going to get erm, huge thing put on our things and we're not going to sell that much, it might be better just sell in our own country, isn't that reduce world tr"
"No, no eventually, protectionism will, will lead to a cessation of production in the most efficient er regions of the world which by and large, are the, are the regions that sell onto the world market."
"It's only the inefficient producers that support their agricultures, because it's those inefficient producers that need support, erm, so, in the, in the long run, world supply, world supply will contract, but in the short run, you know, farmers in these er, efficient countries of the world may well erm, continue in production because they may, may be able to cut their average variable costs, it's only when in, in the long run, you know, providing farmers can cover their average variable costs, they'll continue in production in the short run."
"Right, in the long run, they've got to cover all their costs, right, they will be driven out of business, but that may take some time."
"Alright, so in, in the short run, because more is being produced, alright, and demand has been increased very much, or in world terms, then market prices will fall."
All market prices will fall.
"And world market prices also tend to fall because these erm  sort of protectionist programmes are often too successful, so not only do we reach self sufficiency, but you reach the status of net exporter."
"Now, for net exporting, for a net exporter, so our production exceeds our own consumption, how the hell do we er, how the hell do we get rid of it?"
Do we just burn it?
"This county is one that for quite a long time has had the policies, I think it's it's E it's number eleven E E eleven is it or I eleven"
I I I eleven.
"thank you, in the existing structure plan."
There's a there's a established prejudice against warehousing and distribution er developments in this county in the existing structure plan.
"To be candid with you I would expect there to be, I'm certain, that there will be demand for er modern warehousing and logistic floor space of strategic scale  strategic importance er in this county."
And I know this presents the county council with some problems I don't know currently what the the local authorities' view on it is.
But do let me say a couple of things about it.
A subject I happen to know quite a bit about because we've got seven and a half million square feet erm in development at the moment in Lutterworth at Magna Park.
Modern warehousing and logistics can yield good job densities.
Er modern logistics floor space will at the very least yield about a thousand jobs sorry a hundred jobs per thousand square feet.
Er sorry getting all my digits in the wrong place.
Try and get it right.
"It is a hundred jobs per hundred thousand square feet, that's right."
And the reason why those job densities work like that is that modern logistics floor space comes brings with it typically an office element  unit.
"So you'll get a big erm warehouse erm which may be typically erm computer controlled, retrieval systems, storage, inventory, stock control and all the rest of it which will employ a certain number of people."
"But also with it comes erm office accommodation which is handling the clerical processing, ordering and so on of the business itself."
"And that is a relatively new phenomenon and the type of warehouse which historically we all knew which was men in brown coats driving forklift trucks is not what it's about, it's about er pretty sophisticated labour erm dealing with erm computer systems and electronic retrieval systems and often working in shifts on twenty four hour basis."
Now whether we would find in our strate if we were to have a strategic sites policy erm whether there's an issue there that it might let in as it were too much of that kind of land use and not enough of the manufacturing or proper office kind I think is worth kicking around the table.
And if it is an issue as to whether there's some way of containing that.
"But I'll have to be very careful with it I I do expect, I would expect, that there would be inquiries for that kind of investment here erm it's just that we haven't any major ones in the last couple of years of that type because the overall framework here is opposed to it."
"I suspect the answer to my first question is  about numbers of jobs, by virtue of what you've just said as long as a piece of string."
Would you like to hazard a guess about how long the string might be?
On the number of jobs?
"Well, if you'll just, if I'm allowed to turn round and consult the chap sitting behind me I can actually give you a direct a direct answer."
"It's sorry, I'm going to have to do some mathematics because what my friend is telling me it it curious it's it's the thirty four per hectare."
Right
I've actually I've actually been doing some arithmetic while you were talking
Thank you.
"on the basis of a hundred per hundred thousand square feet to which you'd have to add obviously a sort of surrounding area from the square footage used for a distribution warehouse, it looks as though it's around about the thirteen"
Yeah.
per hectare.
Something like that.
Okay has anybody else got anything more on that on that subject?if we go back for a bit and just go back to the
"idea of the theory, which is something that probably should have come at the beginning but it doesn't matter too much."
And like there are two different sort of schools of thought about men and women's conversation.
Er one is like the traditional school of though and the other one is like the feminist way of looking at things.
Er just to run through what the two  what the two schools sort of think it will be fair to say that the traditional school thinks as follows.
"Er in terms of syntax and pronunciation, women were always thought of as being more careful than men, er a lot of dialectologists in the past considered women to be very conservative in their speech, they ascribed conservatism to them."
"Er men and women were always thought to use different specialist vocabularies, that's something else that was said."
"Er women were also said to be polite, diffident, verbose and deferential, which"
What all of those?
Mhm.
polite and deferential.
"Verbose as in when they actually said things, they they did a lot of talking."
I'm not saying this is actually correct but this is the traditional view.
Okay.
Except that women were deferential to other speakers they would let they would they were they would allow themselves to be walked over in conversation but at the same time you had this stereotype of women who talked too much.
"I'm not saying that the same person thought of these two things at once, but"
Okay.
These are these are things which were all said.
Er  said in in an article that women used empty language.
That was a phrase he used.
So what so traditional schools Thought that women did a lot of Recognized they thought that women did a lot of talking but that a lot of it wasn't really any use.
Yeah that that was just the ideas it had.
Whereas men talked more for function.
"Er and then to contrast this you've got like the feminist view er well it's a just reconstruct a lot of these ideas instead of saying that women's talk was diffident they said it was more considerate, and so the idea that quite often A lot of the features that are in this conversation aren't because women want to be deferential to the men they're talking to, it's that they actually want to show some consideration to to the turn-taking or the conversational style that's going on."
Er in actual fact the speech styles aren't really comparable which is why you sort of get these contradictions.
Er you fi What the feminist the schools says that a lot of languages minimize and trivialize interests and achievements of women and denigrate them by the way in which they use language and the way in which they talk about things.
"Er and similarly the syntax of languages are often said to be oppressive of women, a lot of the way that language is structured and a lot of the words that you get in a language, that's another thing that's said."
there's one quite sort of ground breaking paper that obviously there's a lot in that people don't agree with but it was quite an important paper in terms of er in terms of feminist linguistics and feminism in general.
It came out o it came out in nineteen seventy five.
And that was by a women called Robin Lakehoff and she wrote a paper called l language and woman's place.
"Er the things that she said were that women used more hedges, such as I think er hedges are sort of things that get put into the conversation if al allegedly if somebody wants to give the impression that they're not quite sure, and they wouldn't w You know like I wouldn't want to say it for sure but I think that."
Er and then similarly to that they er were said to seek agreement by Lakehoff she said they used more questions and more tag questions.
"The, the relative cost to you would be trivial, but the relative benefit to a much younger, erm, sibling of yours, might be much greater."
"And because you are so much older, you wouldn't see yourself as competing for the same resources, and you would probably have matured in ways emotionally, that would make you accept and identify with the parental values, rather than, than feel sad or, or resentful, because you felt you were more like your brother, as it were , and you were being discriminated against."
Does that answer your question?
"I mean, it's not a very good answer, because frankly we don't know,th the full reasons for this, but"
obviously some variations in
"Oh, absolutely, it would."
"And, of course, I mean, we have, have to remember, that when we talk about ageing altruism, this is just an abstraction."
"I mean, we're not, erm, we're just simplifying a very complex situation, and in fact, probably large numbers of genes are, are involved, and they're, there are probably complex interactions between different sorts of altruism.  kin altruism will certainly function within families for reasons that we've just been looking at, but this will also be a fertile and erm, encouraging er, framework for sibling altruism."
"So it may be that elements of the sibling altruism will develop in families, too."
"For example, you might have been a mere, much more happy about making a sacrifice for your brother, giving him a sweet, if you knew that on other occasions, he would give one to you, and because you are related to each other ."
"In other words, you met each other a lot, and w we know you had the kind of situations that"
What I want to do today.
"I got some pens, today, which is great."
"Ah, that's wonderful, ah, of course, they don't work."
"Ah, that's just  okay, got one that works."
"I meant to bring my own, but I forgot, and somebody's used the wrong kind of pen on here, so you can't rub that off."
That was probably in desperation.
Thank you.
"Erm, I have a pause dubbed, you know in comedy shows, they dub laughter, well, I have a pause dubbed."
Makes me think the things I'm saying are very clever.
Okay.
"Erm, right, what I want to do this week, is to go on to the next er, work of Freud's, that follows after erm, group psychology, or rather to the next two, because I'm gonna back these two books together for, hi there,, erm gonna back these two books together, because as we'll see, they, they really deal with the same subject."
"Or at least they start, both books really start with the same issue, and the issue in question is in many ways, well, you could argue that it was in many ways fundamental to the social sciences."
"And, and the issue is, question is is what is often called a problem of social order."
The problem of order.
What this means is  it's the question of how is society possible.
Why do people cooperate?
"Why isn't there total chaos, why doesn't everybody pursue their own self interest at the expense of everybody else, reducing life to a, a state of chaotic erm er, conflict of individuals against each other."
"This is what is normally called the problem of social order, and of course it's been around in philosophy and, and social sciences, really since the beginning, and er, some of the greatest and earliest works of er, social philosophy like Plato's Republic, are really in part about this er question."
"How do you, how do you er, create er social, social order."
It often leads on to more prescriptive utopian ideas about what would the ideal society be like.
Hence the socio-cultural factors are important erm and another important one at the end of the day is your own personal mobility.
Your own health and fitness.
Now this can become an increasingly important factor because of all the activity holidays around today.
"For example if you go for a Peter Stuyvesant activity holiday, you have to have a medical first."
"Erm unless you've got a doctor's note saying that you've passed the medical, they won't allow you to actually go on the activity holiday."
"Now that's a drawback in many respects, but it's also if you er think about it, a very good selling point."
"It makes it sound really challenging and adventurous before you've even bought the package, the mere fact that you have to go through that beforehand."
Motivating factors are more complex  and the sort of things we'll be talking about here  something we call income elasticity.
And in fact we'll come back to look at this and Bob will also be looking at er with you environmental analysis as well.
"Erm the whole question here is if you have more money in a sense, what do you spend it on?"
"In general we find that, for a very small increase in, for example, wages, we tend to spend a lot more, proportionately, on holidays."
"It's almost as if we think subconsciously well we've got that little bit extra, let's go for it."
Even though in effect you're using more of your income proportionately than you would have been doing before.
The other thing about holidays and elasticity is the question of what happens when the price of a holiday goes up.
Now we looked at the graphs and that should dictate in general that demand will go down.
But it doesn't seem to work like that.
"In general even if the price of a holiday goes up extortionately, the number of people going overseas tends to stay about the same."
"W we haven't noticed, if you like, a very big change in it."
"If you at the statistics over the last three to four years, you'll find the number of U K people travelling abroad has always stayed round about the thirty million mark, despite what's happened to the prices."
"A second factor  motivating people  again  it's the demographic situation, the fact that if you haven't got children, you're free to do what you want."
"You don't have any, if you like, responsibilities as such."
"Geographical factors can be a motivating factor, er we've talked about the sun and the influence of the sun."
"You can also have geographical factors again, as we said last week, to do with things like scenery and obviously geographical factors are very important if we consider skiing er with the classification of the ski slopes between difficult and suit beginners."
Or the pistes as we call them.
Socio-cultural factors  these relate to things like our beliefs and notions  and our aspirations.
"But probably the key one here is the belief that somehow if we go on holiday, we're gonna come back totally refreshed."
"Again we talked about this last week, fifty weeks of the year you toil  and you look forward to your holiday months in advance, you then take your holiday and somehow it recharges your batteries so that you're ready to do battle again for the next fifty weeks."
"It's claimed by many people that we live in a cycle where, if you like, we struggle to get through fifty weeks of the year to live for holidays  recharge the batteries, then you go into it again."
Incidentally on this one you've got the lifestyle aspirations.
"If you think of what you do on a holiday, it's a totally different lifestyle to when you're normally working and obviously people desire to have that sort of experience more and more, and you've got the rise of things like short breaks."
So again the trend today is towards people having at least one overseas trip a year and possibly two or three short break weekends as well.
"Er increasingly, we're also looking at a new market which has a holiday in the summer overseas and in winter goes skiing."
"any, any points  anything anybody would like to add to this?"
Did you call it wash your fact  sort of?
Mm.
"Yes I mean it, it can be, I think it can be ."
"It's not something which is introduced for the first time in nineteen forty eight but, but there is erm sort of another round of it erm and  sort of the new dimension is that the, everybody's name is published because until then you, you didn't er you didn't know who the Party members were."
Mm.
Right.
Now  we need to decide  where to go from here.
"Now I, I, I er our, our, in a sense our policy now is that we're going to sort of readjust the policy in, in the north ."
"As we go into the south we are just going to conduct a rent reduction, interest reduction campaign and we, we will then aim to consolidate that position and at some stage we will then move forward into land reform again, but to do that we will probably need a new land law because we're recognizing the old agrarian land law is, is inappropriate,absolute egalitarianism  is now dead in a sense of as erm  it's sort of saying that, that as Mao is arguing in May forty eight, May forty eight that absolute egalitarianism is wrong."
"So, so, so that bit of it we've, we've moved forward ."
"Er  are you happy with this idea that, that  sort of the immediate future in the newly liberated areas is, is just rent reduction, interest rate reduction, consolidate that and then move on?"
Do does this seem to be the right policy?
It would have more affect in the south
"on the moderate side erm it would, would stand a better chance than"
"Yes, right."
and as a starting point
Yes.
and there's more of a justified presence.
"So that it, it would actually fit the conditions in the south in terms that we are, you're moving into an area of, of higher tenancy and therefore rent reduction, interest rate reduction is, would have a significant effect."
Right.
you say this rent reduction?
"Oh cos I, I thought they erm   they had the three different areas"
Mm
"but erm I thought  forty eight, areas where  and carry out"
"Yes, I, I think that was  that was still when the  I think that was still in a sense under the auspices of the old agrarian  er of the  of forty seven  was still being given by ."
"Erm I think bro broadly, certainly by the time you've got through to the later spring th th there is  y yes I mean i in a sense there are sort of three areas if you like but, but very broadly the areas which had not been taken over yet i is very much a slower process of consolidation and then you wait for the next rule."
"Er you're happy with this, this seems  okay in terms of policy"
Doesn't it seem slightly odd though?
"In the sense that, in a way going on from what I was saying  on the face of it south China ought to be the area where  land reform will be easiest to achieve  in the sense that here you've got a society which is landlord dominated, heavily landlord dominated  and therefore w where one would expect that the antagonism, antagonisms between landlords and tenants would be at their greatest."
"I in, in the north you've got a higher proportion of owner-occupiers and"
"you perhaps haven't got the same degree of landlord exploitation, you might, I think one might argue from, from what we said earlier that in the north you've got a s a slightly more paternalistic landlord, it's, it, there's less, less absentee landlordism  landlords were more likely to have been behaving within the confines of moral economy  wouldn't, wouldn't have been  tt erm reducing rents, it was done on a much more, more personal sort of scale."
"No, I'm not even an astronomer now really in many ways."
I mean I've never looked through a telescope.
I mean I have helped to run a radio telescope.
We don't actually look at that — a radio telescope is a rather superb radio set with a rather large ariel.
And all this started with you actually putting an undergraduate student on the project?
"Yes, one of the nice aspects of astronomy is that it brings people from many different areas of science together."
"What actually happened was that a colleague of mine, Dave Walton and I, got together to look at a rather esoteric aspect of molecular motion, thinking of making molecules which were very, very long and had very simple structure but could have perhaps erm very complicated what we call dynamic motion, but there was some very good chemistry involved and we erm put this project together for the Sussex Chemistry Bithesis programme, and erm the student who took on this particular project, Alexander, spent two years learning how to do the synthesis and developed a lot of ability in this area; he also learned how to do the spectroscopic experiments and studied the analysis of molecular motion, and he was able to do this on top of the course work that he did, and in fact this particular project and Alexander, who did the work himself, and the subsequent exciting sort of repercussions of the project have all made me a rather firm believer in the course here, and that in fact undergraduates can do research and also that it's a very good training for the future."
"Thank you very much, Harry."
Hello.
"In this short series we're exploring some of the boundaries of science — the limits to what we can measure or experience, limits that exist in space, time, temperature and so on."
"Last week, for example we were looking at the mind boggling distances that we encounter when we journey across the universe."
Today we travel to the other extreme and enter the microscopic world of the atom and its nucleus.
Jim Byrne is a physicist who work as the university.
I recently asked him how large an atom is.
"Well, of course, there are big atoms and small atoms  hydrogen is a very small atom, uranium is a big atom — but something of the order of ten to the minus eight of a centimetre."
Roughly a hundred million atoms per centimetre.
So that means if you could line up a hundred million atoms you'd just reach one centimetre?
"Just about one centimetre for relatively small atoms, yes."
And virtually all matter is composed of atoms?
All matter that we know is composed of atoms.
"The familiar matter that we deal with in our ordinary life, that's jsut atoms, yes."
And putting combinations of atoms together you get molecules and up to really rather long and complicated molecules?
"That's so, indeed."
That's going in one direction of building up.
mhm
"And going in the other direction, what do you have inside atoms?"
"Are atoms solid things, or are they all space or what?"
"No, atoms are not solid things."
This is the great discovery that Rutherford and his erm collaborators made forty/fifty years ago.
In fact atoms are almost entirely made up of free space.
"Essentially, what you have inside an atom is you have a very small mass of core, called the nucleus, and around this nucleus you have lighter particles called electrons, which orbit in closed orbits."
Now this is the picture that we have.
"morning, I'm  I'm a Site Agent for Tarmac Refurb based in Birmingham"
yes
"erm, the bulk of my presentations are obviously site based, site meetings,meetings  meetings."
I have been involved in  meetings
right
for a variety of different contracts er my last presentation was a site meeting last Thursday
right
last week and er what I want to get out of course is obviously increased confidence and skill at sort of maintaining the aims of the meeting or the presentation
so it's getting your point across and achieving your objective
keeping the meetings as precise because I tend to my meetings wandering and
"Ah, okay now that's that's"
keeping to the theme of the meeting
"yes, okay now that's about meetings as such isn't it which is a which is almost another subject but I know what you mean it's about timing in a way yes, that's what you're saying?"
"We're not gonna get into anything about chairmanship of meetings on this course, there is a meeting's course  that does that so I don't want to promise you something that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be able to deliver I know what you mean certainly in terms of timing of your presentation keeping t time with your presentation we'll be looking at that and help you achieve that."
So can we can we keep it to that?
"yep, fine"
"okay, I ju as I say i don't want to promise you something that that I know I'm not going to be able to achieve in these two days because that's not  yep  certainly if you want to talk about that you know as a separate thing outside the time then then we'll be able to help you do that, okay?"
Okay yep
As I say I don't want to  promise you something and and then and  then at the end you say well hang on we didn't look at that because that's not within the agenda of of these two days.
"Okay, so what we're looking at over these two days and what in order for you to be able to say yes we've achieved the objectives er by tomorrow is how to use that time that we have to prepare to to the most er efficient and effective so that e the preparation you know when you've prepared it that yes when I stand up to speak I'm gonna be able to put these points over effectively and make the presentation memorable."
"Confidence and in a way that attaches to also nerves, how to be able to stand up and appear confident, appear that you know what you're talking about and you are you can confidently put your message across."
"Some feedback now Jeff said okay he's done this course before and he's looking for feedback to to see the level of his competence at this point, but everybody er I'm sure you will agree by the end of tomorrow will have got feedback."
Feedback on how effective you are and how your effectiveness has increased over the two days.
Because when all said and done if at the end of two days you don't feel that you're any better at making a presentation then when you started then why have you been here for two days.
So certainly in terms of feedback erm and how to deal with these nerves.
What to  understand to understand what they're about.
To make sure that we're able to put our point across clearly so that we speak in a clear way so that people don't have any er doubts as to what you actually mean.
When we've prepared how do we then effectively present.
What are the skills we need to stand up and be able to present effectively?
How to put a point over persuasively.
Persuasion is about changing people's minds.
So how to put over a point that supports the point of view that you have when you want to change something.
"Right, Club Eighteen to Thirty."
Okay so Club Eighteen to Thirty was doing good business around this period because of this situation.
Now what we have to do however is look at it in more  in more detail than just simply the age of people.
"We're also gonna look at where they live, remember what they're income is etcetera and the important thing is  because of these increases here  and because of the recession in general, it dictated to us that there were gonna be more one and two person households."
Households without children in other words.
And this implies greater mobility both physically and financially.
"If you picture a, for example, a typical couple perhaps living in London, erm the price of property  is such that you maybe start with an apartment."
"If you want to have children you've gotta offset that against, for example, having a car or a new stereo, things which affect your lifestyle."
"So the pattern would have been perhaps towards marrying later, or certainly having children later and then perhaps moving out of London."
So this in a sense tends to reinforce the idea of these households with just one and two people living in them.
"As the recession's gone on through the eighties and enters the nineties, we can see that the number of single households, households with just one person, is increasing rapidly."
It's a major market and the tourism industry has really been very slow to wake up to this factor.
"Because if you look in any package holiday brochure, you'll still see that, in order to get a room, you need two people."
"If you, if any of you, you probably haven't, seen any brochures specifically geared towards single people."
"Very, very few."
And yet that's a major growing part of the market.
A third area will be social factors and here you've already mentioned the weather.
"Climate obviously is a major determinant of demand, attracting people to if you like the guaranteed sunshine."
"Ironically, now we're probably moving into a new era where sunshine is actually seen as something harmful giving things like skin cancer, er certainly in the Australia market it's the case at the moment."
"And so ironically, although climate will be a factor in er this century and into the next century, it could be well to escape the sun."
The direct reverse if you like of this period here.
The second factor is of  is the whole question of holiday entitlements.
"The number of weeks paid holiday  that a worker will get is increasing rapidly so as today we have the norm of twenty days plus public bank holidays, giving more time if you like to engage in a package holiday abroad."
Another social factor is the whole thing about foreign holidays being seen as somehow superior.
"Remember we keep talking about tourism as being fashionable, it's fashionable to say you've been to certain destinations."
Saying you've been to those destinations in the U K doesn't actually hold the same appeal or esteem.
"So the foreign holidays, because you're guaranteed sunshine, cheap alcohol, everything else, somehow being seen as better than the traditional British holiday."
At this time remember the traditional British holiday was seen as staying in a boarding house with a landlady.
"You had to be in at a certain time  you know, you had very standard cuisine, it was, it had become if you like, ridiculed in jokes and things of this nature."
"And yeah another one connected to this whole lifestyle, aspirational argument  the image the brochures give us of a couple si sitting on a terrace with, you know, you can almost hear the music in the background, the sun setting over the sea."
"If you like, giving us the Hollywood image that we can live that lifestyle for two weeks."
Very difficult to imagine British resorts somehow trying to capture that.
They started paying
"Yes, at fifty instead of sixty, they said you retire at age fifty and we will make your pension up to what you would have got at age sixty and we will also do the same with you lump sum  and so now you know, this and they did that with thirty thousand I think went in one year, it doesn't take long to get rid of one point seven billion pounds when you're doing for that er that number of people erm and"
I think the problem is that this one point seven billion was er an actuarial assessment by Watsons i it may never have been that amount of money.
"Directly  directly B T started erm saying well thirty thousand employees will go this year under B T ninety-two scheme i.e. they will go at fifty, they will draw their pension at fifty, which isn't  the trust deed and for many years Inland Revenue point blank refused to let anybody draw a pension below sixty."
"They changed that, so the money er it's a bit different than the Maxwell, the money hasn't been erm a switched over to the Cayman Islands and all over the place, it's  it's stayed in, in the  but of course we're told by the trustees and by our legal advice that nothing illegal's taken place, the money's been used to st er finance early voluntary retirement etcetera, etcetera."
"If the Trust Deed says the pension has to be paid at sixty, then the Trust Deed says it has to be paid at sixty, surely that you know, that's something you can't get rid of."
"The schemes now are paid a pension at fifty, but the only, the only snag I understand is it isn't inflation, inflation proofed until fifty-five, but people are drawing their pensions and they get their lump sums at fifty and it's enhanced to take into account the actual and expected earnings for the next three years, so er you take thirty thousand people, one point seven billion can soon erm"
Disappear.
Can soon disappear.
Clarify a point here.
I if someone's their pension at fifty
Yes.
"and they had joined British Telecom at twenty,"
Yes.
Then they will have paid some thirty years
thirty years yes.
into the pension fund
Yes.
Presumably the maximum was about forty or was forty-five
Forty-eight er yes.
"Forty eight and and presumably many of the people who are perhaps seventy drawing pensions, they may not have even paid in thirty years themselves, I mean they may be many of them may not have been around for that period of time."
"So in fact there may be a quality of treatment actually between someone retiring at fifty or fifty-five in terms of the number of years paid into the pension fund, as someone say age seventy."
Well I doubt it actually at the moment.
Pardon?
The operative word there is might.
"Yes  erm because I doubt it, erm at the moment with the fund that we're talking about the erm the close scheme, because most of these people in B T were originally erm in the Post Office, and of course when the they split erm then the erm Post Office workers went over to B T, they get a B T pension but in actual fact they paid into a pension scheme erm for many of them for forty years because they come into that age group, where so many people, you took a job when you were twenty o or or sixteen and you stayed with it for life, you didn't chop and change like people do these days and the majority of our members erm we can go down and I would say the vast majority of our members have actually worked for the Post Office or starting with the Post Office and then B T or staying with the Post Office for forty years, there's no end of them they've got in there forty years service."
"So no, I can't agree there, that there is erm unequality, they think they are being hard done by."
"also history if I might just say that when the Post Office er split from the Civil Service, the firm was in deficit for twenty years and of course Post Office management say quite clearly that they were putting in sums of eighteen per cent of the pay bill  when it was only supposed to be nine per cent of the pay bill and that's why they're entitled to the  to the surplus."
"B T say the same, that for twenty years the firm was in deficit and both managements put in much more than the Trust Deed says to keep us to keep the fund afloat."
But that
Employees paid their six per cent of their erm salary.
"Mm, yeah."
"Military stores, every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord, which was used to ignite his musket, and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford, a whole lot of match had to be stored."
"That's quite combustible, sort of oiled cord."
"erm And there was, of course, powder had to be stored as well ."
"And as well as that, beyond the city walls, fortifications were being erected all the way round the north of Oxford, the bits that weren't covered by the river."
"That's another story, where they were, and if you're interested, downstairs there's a very good map that shows you superimposed on a modern map of Oxford where they were, but they very much affected citizens in the St Aldate's, because every citizen, and every scholar who was still in the university, between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work on the fortifications at least one day a week, or pay a shilling fine."
"And getting them to work was a constant problem and collecting the fines, and we do actually know about this."
"If you would like to look at the second sheet on your erm of the two that you've got, erm this really brings to mind , one day in St Aldate's, in the summer of 1643, when a very hard working, methodical loyal official, Edward Heath, was ordered by the King and his Council to walk around St Aldate's, and make a list of all the defaulters, all those who had failed to work on the fortifications."
"erm And there are erm it's quite difficult to read until you get used to it, but erm the title is nice and easy, could I just have a copy, erm down there?"
I don't want to deprive you.
"erm Now, if you look at the top, you see the widow Smith's house, and then it says ‘the officers would not speak with him’."
"Next to that would be a sort of double stroke in the margin, erm can you see the name Holloway erm Well, on the line below that, erm it's talking about the Earl of Newark and his servants, and then on the following line it says, ‘removed to Trinity College and son gone out of town’."
"erm Now, there's a very nice one, if you move down to the single stroke, you see there are two 2s written, and below that there's a single stroke."
"erm And if you look at the second line, and begin three words in, it says ‘the mistress,’ the mistress is abbreviated, ‘answers her man cannot work, nor can she spare him till she be paid for what her husband did for the King's soldiers’."
"You can just imagine her standing arms, you know, just telling the man where he ."
erm Perhaps you can begin to pick out where it keeps saying no Answer.
"The next two in the margin, if you go further in you'll see a ‘noe answere’."
"(It's always spelt N O E, and answer has an E.) One does have this feeling that people were getting wind of Mr Edward Heath walking down the street, and were going out the back doors of the house."
"erm Yes, now if we get to about half way down there's a plus in the margin, and the third line in the bracket below that plus, more or less on a level with a three dot, and a little bit below, it says, William, I think it's Wilkinson, a minister, curate of St Ebbe's Parish, ‘his answer that he must attend the burials and christenings’, so obviously he couldn't work on the fortifications."
"And then, if we go right down to the bottom, there's a whole lot bracketed together against the ."
"‘No answer, but that they would not pay’, they ought not to pay."
erm And one can go on picking out a great many of these people once you get used to the writing.
"It is fairly easy to read, once you begin to get ."
"Now, as well as the fortifications, I think one wants to erm very much keep in mind that the citizens of St Aldate's were constantly being asked for money."
"There were these big loans for instance, £2,500 once the city had to make to the king."
"And this was collected by the parishes, and we know that St Aldate's had to pay £280, which along with All Saints, the city church, was the highest amount from all the various parishes."
"And then there was money for maimed soldiers, for what they called visited persons, which was the plague, fire and candles for the courts of guards, that was paying for fire and candles for all the little sentinel posts round Oxford."
"If they were freemen, they had to give up their right to graze in Port Meadow, because erm the hay was to be grown there, to be promised to His Majesty."
"They had to perhaps give up their pots and pans, or they were supposed to."
"Actually, a remarkably few were collected, to provide brass for armaments."
And there were actually arms collections too.
"They were supposed to raiding the city regiments and paying for it, there was constant trouble for this, and the man who was appointed colonel by the king, Nicholas Selby, was very unpopular."
"But I think the main thing that they all had to bear to survive, was a tremendous amount of overcrowding. erm Now, we're fast running out of time, aren't we."
"Quite, it's amazing."
It hadn't thought.
"I had honestly not thought how you would solve that problem in advance, and I'm glad I did because my amazement  certainly I wanted it to show with the kids when I said ‘Goodness, what, you know, how on earth are you going to do it that way?’."
It really was  I was quite astonished to see some of the solutions.
"One of the nice aspects of a task such as that is that I think we, as professional physicists — and I'm a physicist too  erm we, as professional physicists, feel there's a right way of doing something because it's the way we learnt and we've got used to, and we tend to instil this idea into other people."
"And I think it was really rather refreshing to see the kids not know what was the right idea and actually dream up all sorts of fantasies for themselves, many of which were  had their own validity."
They really did.
I think this is an extremely important point in the teaching.
"I think one of the difficulties of science — you talked at the beginning of switching people off science — is there are some golden opportunities when you can argue science, you can argue politics, you can argue English Literature with your teacher — it's very hard to argue mathematics with your teacher."
It's hard also to argue physics and chemistry with your teacher.
I'd like to find some examples of that and to give the kids chances to talk and to argue their ideas where there isn't some mammoth answer stacked up on the shelves of a library somewhere.
There are a lot of simple problems where kids can actually have opinions.
"Sandy, are you finding any difference between the boys and girls in the way they're reacting to your experiments and course?"
"No, no difference whatsoever."
"All of them enthusiastic — questions are coming think and fast, not at the end of a lecture — I think we actually slightly dominate them because we're not school teachers, but quote with a big U ‘University lecturers’, but get them down in the laboratory and the questions come thick and fast from boys and girls — no difference whatsoever."
So it's too young at the moment for the girls to feel that they can't do science.
"They haven't been put off science, they haven't decided that it's unwomanlike, or unladylike to be a scientist?"
You're right.
"This group, however, are slightly specially selected."
These are selected children from the schools — often perhaps the best in the class — that have been put forward.
They're very determined.
Further down the line the rot may have set in.
"These are people who are enthusiastic about science that we're transferring more enthusiasm to, to reinforce their interest in science."
"I am a bit worried about the ones further down the line, how we influence them."
"Sandy, what's going to happen to these kids when they go back to their dull, boring school laboratories and classes after having seen the vision of your course and what physics can possibly be in the future?"
"Well we know, from talking to some of the school teachers involved, they go back and  the kids go back and talk to the other kids in the form."
"They may have a slight perturbation on the behaviour of the school teachers, because they're going to come back with some ideas which the school teachers will find slightly foreign to them."
"For instance, in one of the lectures we were talking about how you know how heavy an atom is, and my colleague, Mike Pendlebury, was describing how you can actually do this by weighing a crystal and counting the number of atoms in it, erm this is certainly not the traditional way, it's a way that's been developed over the last few years."
"It's a beautiful, simple way of doing it."
"It's not at all in the general knowledge of the sixth form science teacher, or certainly not of the O level science teacher."
Some of them are going to have to puzzle a little bit hard.
"I do worry slightly that if some child answers this in an O level exam paper in, what, let's see, two years time, that they may get marked down."
erm I'll try and do this in ten minutes.
You'll try and do this in ten minutes.
"Let's straight into seventeen then, I'll just remind committee that we need to move to the confidential section at five o'clock today in order to get it finished."
"Item seventeen is the age-well project, the report is circulated on page a hundred and eight."
We're particularly delighted actually that Tony Randall has come along to share his own very particular views on this project.
"You'll remember that we had a pilot project in South Oxford Health Centre, Tony is one of the G P's there, I'm expecting that he's going to be very positive about this project since we all are, in terms of it's practice service delivery."
"Well, then Tony, tell us about how it feels at your end."
"Okay, I'll give you a very brief background to the project."
"It started in the Autumn of eighty-eight, when Phil approached me and said, ‘Look, we would like to consider putting our services that we do offer to finance in a more effective way’, running alongside that was a project being run by Oxfordshire Health Authority where they were sending postal surveys to elderly people; people over the age of seventy erm sixty-five at one point, and were getting back a huge amount of information on their perceived needs."
"We thought perhaps we can use that as a goal standard, and pick up what actually happens with our project to compare the two."
So that's where we were in the autumn of eighty-eight.
"By spring of eighty-nine, when the project had started, we'd gone quite a long way down the road, we'd decided that we wanted to be looking at what was feasible in general practice."
Get this machine working over here.
"What was feasible general practice, and whether that was the best place to be contacting the local people."
"Now, the reason we particularly were interested in this was that from the questionnaire we already were beginning to get back some information, and we discovered that eighty-six percent of people had seen their G P in the previous year, and maybe if we could introduce them to the age-well project at some point during that contact, we would be able to achieve something."
"Against that there'll be seventeen percent of this population was seeing home-helps, five percent was seeing social workers."
So we though that we would try it in general practice.
Next thing to do was to set up a form.
"Looks horrendous, but bear in mind these elderly people have just answered a sixteen page postal questionnaire with no help."
And what's more eighty-six percent of them answered it.
And I was quite impressed by that.
"We gave them a sheet of paper which said what we were, what we're doing, and said please, if you want any help in any of those areas, just tick the box, and if you don't want any help, tick this little box, and that's what they had to fill in."
And they were given this when they were brought into the surgery by the receptionist.
We discovered very rapidly that if it was the doctor that had to present the age-well project to the patients that quite often they forgot to do it.
"In greater detail I could look at what kind of coverage we've got, but I think in ten minutes I don't have time to do that."
Suffice it to say that amongst the people who were not contacted by this project within the first year are some of those seeing doctors on eight occasions.
The receptionists are much at giving out these things than doctors.
"They can do it while they're waiting, couldn't they."
"On the back of the form, we simply have a method of writing down anything that's interested, and also includes a sticker of who the person is, a particular one."
"So I thought we could look at results now, which are probably the thing that's most interesting."
"Just taking that form with those boxes, that's how people responded."
"This thing breaks it down by age, as I say, we're looking at seventy-fives and over."
Is that on?
What's this?
Shouldn't eat that.
There's no T V .
"Well St Aldate's in the Civil War is quite a problem to talk about really, erm in half an hour, because it's so enmeshed in the story of Oxford in the Civil War which is a long, very interesting one, so what I'm going to try and do is erm to pick out some of the local landmarks that did survive in the 17th century and relate them to what we know about some of the people  and in this short half an hour, just try and picture what it was like to live in St Aldate's during the civil war."
Obviously a whole lot else is .
"I think it's quite important to orientate ourselves first, and you're looking at a map of Oxford in 1643, erm and 17th century maps for the most part are what we should call upside down."
"The north is at the bottom, and I think it helps if you stop thinking about it as a map and you think about it as a birds-eye view, a helicopter view, erm and then the whole thing begins to make sense."
"erm Now, what you've got there is a slightly later map of 1675, which is exactly the same, the north is at the bottom, I'm afraid the top is not very obvious, if I could just hold it up, you've got the castle there, and you've got it the right way up, and actually there's some writing  as well."
"erm And the reason I've given you that one is that that was drawn in 1675  by David Loggen, and it's a very, very accurate one, and it's rather easier to see some of the places I shall be talking about, so I think it's a nice one for you to have close up."
erm There are some little differences which are quite interesting too.
"Now, if we find Carfax first in the middle, Oxford's on the  crossroads principle, like so many cities, we've got St Giles down here, erm and Oxford of course a small city, or we should regard it as a very small city."
"It was still a walled city, the walls were all virtually intact, the castle was a bit ruinous, but it was there, and it had its four main gates, erm East Gate on the important London Road going out past Magdalen and over Magdalen Bridge, erm the North Gate here, the Westgate by the Castle, and then still existing then but not in your map if you can find it, the South Gate across the road, just at the bottom of Christchurch, can you find Christchurch on your map? erm Now, perhaps you can that there's a difference in Christchurch on your map with this one."
"When Cardinal Wolsey fell, he hadn't finished the building of Tom Quad, the whole of this side was left open because he'd planned a very grand perpendicular chapel like King's College Chapel, and erm the ruins, well no, not the ruins, the  foundations were still to be seen apparently in the 17th Century John Gomley tells us."
"But it was open, I mean it must have been fenced in some way  later on."
"erm But there was this great gap and I think had the civil war not come, the dean of Christchurch who was the first of the two Fells, would have probably finished that building then."
"As it was it was finished, as you can see on your map, after the war, erm but perhaps you can also see that Tom Tower is not yet built on yours."
That wouldn't come till the 1680s.
Now St Aldate's was a long narrow parish.
"It didn't quite reach up to Carfax, and it had another great landmark, as well as the big, rich college of Christchurch, and that was the Guildhall, built at the centre of the civic power, which was more or less, well, just where the Town Hall is now."
"It had 2 big inns, and we're more or less, well, we are on the site of the first one, Blue Boar Inn, and on your map, rather strangely, it seems to be built across the opening of Blue Boar Lane, I don't know if you can see."
"erm Anyway, it's just about there, and then, almost next door, presumably in competition with each other is the other inn, the Unicorn Inn, erm so that was it just on the South Side of Blue Boar Lane."
"erm One very important house is erm what is now the Newman Mobray Bookshop, and that of course is still very much as it was in the 17th Century."
"It belonged to an extremely important erm civic family, Thomas and John Smith, who are the two important ones during the civil war, Thomas was mayor just before the War, John Smith was a member of parliament in the Long Parliament, and erm there's a slightly complicated story to the house, Thomas moved out of it just before the war and built another one  way up the street, but John stayed there, and another important landowner in Marston, Umpton Croak, owned the other half of it."
"If you go down to Newman Mobray, and walk down that little alleyway, Rose Place, you see what is the frontage of that house, and it's very fine, and you can tell these are important people building themselves a fine house."
"erm And I've got a picture in here somewhere , which I'll pass round."
"erm And also, the Alice Shop?"
"Do you know where I mean? erm Well, that too, is a 17th century building, I've got a  an early 19th century Butler engraving of it here, and some pictures from the Alice shop itself, Now that was owned by a Walter Paine, both these citizens were well off brewers, erm those are just pictures of the same one, it's a little bit of a problem because this is called the house belonging to the manciple of Christchurch."
"I think in fact that's a mistake from,a mistaken  caption."
"Manciples were like college bursars, and they were very important."
"I'm rather advertising this because I think it's important to understand that although, and I'm sure you know, that there's this constant war really between, it wasn't of course a physical war, but certainly tension, and difficulty between the university and the city."
"If erm, what would it have to be?"
"It would have to be at least, erm, what would it have to be, it would have to be at least the benefit, yes, the benefit would have to be at least four on the, on the B's side, in order for that to work."
"Anyway,the these erm, numbers don't matter, this is just an arbitrary example."
"The fundamental point that you have to grasp is  that parents want any transfers between their siblings that will result in a net gain for the, a, sorry, parents want any transfers between their offspring that result in a net gain for reproductive success."
"It doesn't really matter to the parent, which offspring has gained, as long as there is a net gain."
All other things being equal.
"The offspring, however, don't take the same view."
"For them, all other things being equal, they will only be selected to make a sacrifice, where the benefit is twice the cost."
"If you work it out for other relatives, the discrepancy gets even bigger."
"As  mentioned, if you work it out for maternal erm  for maternal cousins, for example the benefit turns out, has to be at least eight times."
"So the principle, the fundamental principle is that, conflict between parents and offspring, over a we over a altruism, over self-sacrifice, or, selfishness, which is the other side of it."
"Because, this works just as well for selfishness, because, if you think of it, selfishness is negative altruism."
It's the opposite altruism.
"Parents will always want twice as much altruism, or half as much selfishness as the offspring, our certainty to ."
That's the whole thing in a nutshell.
"In other words, the conflict between parents and offspring, over offspring behaviour is not rooted in culture and nature, as we often think it is."
It's rooted in evolution.
It's rooted in biology.
"fo for example, says, that he, about his first erm, experience, was as a field observer of baboons in er, Kenya or somewhere."
"And this is one of the first, on the first day, he was astonished to see, an older male baboon intervene in a fight between two younger ones and stop it."
"And this astonished him, because he'd seen this kind of thing at home."
"He'd seen human parents intervene in conflicts between pa er, between er offspring."
"You know, like, like er  parents did, when her brother was pulling her hair, and she wanted to clout him."
I daresay they intervened to stop the fight.
"Well, what  observed exactly the same thing with, with baboons, and said to himself, why are these animals doing this?"
"There has to be a reason why, all the male baboons who have got no particular self interest in, well there's no obvious sign, in a fight between two youngsters, nevertheless he intervened to stop it, and he had realized that the reason, well he ultimately realized, development of parental investment, the reason they intervened to stop it, is that parents do not have the same self interest as their offspring do, when it comes to behaviour of offspring."
"There's a fundamental ineradicable conflict of interest, because the parents will want any gain to their offsprings net reproductive success."
"In other words, they favour any act of altruism."
But the offspring will only favour acts of altruism where the benefit exceeds the cost discounted by the figure we agreed.
"How do you erm,"
"Well, what, what I mean is, my genes for altruism are present in my body one hundred percent, okay."
"Any gene I had for making a sacrifice, on behalf of a  a sibling, are one hundred percent in my own body."
Eight sixty please.
Alternatively they can travel on the slightly slower Network Southeast for only seven pounds fifty.
"Tory loyalists argue that the Peyton amendment would jeopardize this sort of competition, because it would deter enterprising B R managers from leaving the public sector to stage management buy-outs."
"I don't think that I could ever support the Peyton amendment, the amendment in the house of lords, which if I get it right, would permit B R as an organization to bid for franchises."
I don't mind managers getting together and having in a sense management buy- outs.
Teaming up with private individuals to bid for franchises.
"But iff you actually allow B R as an organization to bid, I think it's making a nonsense of privatization because you're saying in essence there isn't anything wrong with B R management at the moment and we'll let them take over the network."
"And in that case why, why privatize?"
"All the same, MPs from the right of the party are boarding the Peyton train along with left wing Tories."
"if John Major intended the bill to convince the right of his radical instincts, he may have misjudged them."
I don't think rail privatization has ever been really debated inside the conservative party.
"Most people prefer privatization on the right of the party, where I stand, but it's not something that we get up early in the morning and actually pray for at every day."
"And I think at the present time, all of us on the right are more concerned about getting the economy right and cutting government expenditure that carrying on with er schemes of a privatization that might or might not succeed."
What do you think the position of the transport secretary would be in the House of Commons if he was forced to drop what is after all a very major plank of his programme?
"Well er they would er Knowing the House of Commons as we do, there would inevitable be some catcalls and some hoots of derision."
But I don't think go governments or ministers should be deterred by them.
"Indeed I think that the the the present secretary of state for whom I have great respect and regard, I think he would be very well advised to think again, because I think that the temporary derision that he would meet in the House of Commons would be nothing as compared with the the er the wounding that he will sustain later if and when things go wrong with these proposals."
"At the end of September, a flight across the channel achieved a notable victory on the issue of airline subsidies for the transport secretary, John Macgregor. success for his team on the railways bill, may prove more elusive."
A climb-down wouldn't be easy.
They've already spent two hundred million pounds preparing for privatization.
"But with the government under fire from so many directions, the pressure to give way on the Peyton amendment, could be difficult to resist."
"I'm not sure about a U-turn on a railway line, more of a shunt perhaps."
"However, now for the return of our resident sage, John Cole."
So it's unity then?
Well only up to a point Lord Copper.
"returning from my prolonged Summer break, I was initially almost as sceptical as the Tory faithful at Blackpool that John Major faces a leadership crisis."
"And the ecstatic reception for his speech, might confirm that view among the politically innocent at least."
So might the way in which this week has gradually marginalized Margaret Thatcher.
"A senior minister, looking at the vast new platform which turned the Winter Gardens into a television set, suggested that it really ought to contain a pantheon for past leaders."
"Ted ought to have been there years ago, he said, and now it's time for Margaret to be elevated."
We could venerate them as ancestors.
A bit Chinese?
Tell me some of the things that we do.
Well the science area as a whole has a number of activities.
"For example, we organise an annual school science lecture."
"This takes place in late November and on two separate evenings we fill our largest lecture theatre with local school children from both sides of the county, sometimes a little bit further afield, and that means that we're giving them an illustrated lecture by one of our more distinguished colleagues, and we entertain and inform, I think, something like eight hundred school children every year in that alone."
And that's something that possibly the public don't know about.
"Wel it doesn't get a great deal of publicity in the media, and of course we only circulate information about it to schools, so I'm sure that the man in the street probably has never heard of it."
What sort of subjects will we tackle at these November lectures?
Well we try to span right over the range of science.
"We've had lectures in the biology area, in physics, in engineering and in chemistry, so that we've really spanned the whole shooting match really as far as that goes, and of course we try to put something into these lectures for those doing the most advanced work in the sixth form and also for those doing O levels, let's say, and some who are younger even than that."
"We try in other words to hit a variety of targets of different ages, right across the spectrum."
That's one big lecture in the year.
"Are there occasions when there are other opportunities for kids to meet university people, perhaps hear them speak about their subjects?"
"Well again the science area as a whole puts out a very large list of lecture titles, which it is prepared to deliver in schools."
"Now this is very much a voluntary activity on the part of those who give the lectures, but neverthless we have an extremely large list, right across the science area, of lecture titles and lecturers, people who are prepared to go out and do this in schools, and of course they get an opportunity to meet teachers and students in schools in this way."
You talk about a large list erm how many possible lectures are there on the list?
"Oh, I should say of the four science schools on average we've got maybe thirty or forty titles from each, so that's about  well certainly well over a hundred titles altogether."
And how many schools avail themselves of this opportunity each year?
"It's a little bit variable, I think, from our own science school — one science school to another — and from year to year, but I would say maybe twenty or thirty for each science school."
"And any school can get a lecturer to come out, subject to availability of course, to give one of these?"
"Well we generally aim to have  I suppose most of our lectures at an A level standard, but we have a significant number for those doing O level, indeed some lectures which can be tailored for either, so anybody very mucg below O level we probably couldn't cater for — I think probably because we wouldn't feel competent, rather than because we don't want to do it."
So some of the lectures are actually aimed at A level students.
"Certainly, yes."
Others at O level students.
Right.
And some could be given at either level?
"Well they might be tailored a little bit according to the level, but basically it's a similar lecture."
Do they come with demonstrations?
"Usually this is so, but of course the lecturers they are very different in their approaches — some will use this illustration approach more than others."
"And if there are any teachers that want to know about this, they could get details by contacting you, Peter Simpson, at the university?"
"They could indeed, yes, at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences."
Good.
"Now that's lecturing, what other contacts do we have with schools?"
mhm And how many places in this country are computers actually used in diagnosis?
"Oh, there you have me."
I don't know in general.
"This particular system erm for diagnosing the acute abdomen, acute abdominal pain, we got the basic ideal from a hospital in Edinburgh."
"They in turn got it from a hospital in Leeds, and I know of one other implementation in Sheffield of this particular system, so there may be two or three others that I don't know about, perhaps four or five in this country, of this particular type."
"erm of more general types, I really don't know."
Not very many.
Is it used much more in the United States where medicine is much more expensive altogether?
"Yes, certainly, the erm place where such diagnostic systems came from, I think, was certainly the States, and most research has been done there — Stanford in particular has been very much involved in this so-called expert system."
You do this research in collaboration with the Royal Sussex Hospital.
Is that where the idea came from originally?
The original idea came from a Doctor Dedombar in Leeds.
"This  his system was implemented in one or two places, including Edinburgh, and our current ideas essentially came from Edinburgh, from Bangor Hospital near Edinburgh."
"The consultant down here who got interested is a Mr Philip Somerville, who's a senior consultant at the Royal Sussex."
"He visited Edinburgh, saw what they were doing there, liked it and decided to see whether it could be done at Sussex and approached the university through the Bi-Medical Engineering Group, of which I'm a member, and I was interested."
"We did a lot of talking, of course, and then it was decided that we could possibly raise some money by going to the League of Friends, which we did, and they very generously provided  well in fact the whole total is about five thousand pounds, of which three and a half thousands represents the computer, and we're about to go live, as it were , in a week or two."
"So far we've only had particular doctors using it to run it in, as it were, but in the very near future we hope that all of the doctors in the accident department will be using this system."
Do you have a medical background at all?
None whatsoever.
So you do have to rely very heavily on collaboration with the local doctors?
Oh indeed.
"This is one very good aspect of such projects, I think, that the interesting work is to be done at the interface between one discipline — medicine in this case  and another discipline — computer science — where both people just have to learn to talk to each other in their own language."
"That's part of the problem in doing such research, certainly."
"Do you think that it could ever be true that they would be sufficiently inexpensive that they could be used in most doctors' surgeries, or is it going to be something which is only used in one or two important hospitals?"
Oh no.
I think expense certainly won't be a problem.
I can very well see such prices going down and down and down  well certainly to several hundred pounds.
"In particular, if one started to make such systems much more, how shall I put it,tailor the electronics to the purpose, then the cost could be quite low."
"At the moment we're dealing with a general purpose system, which is designed for all sorts of applications, and one pays for having a thing general purpose by costing more money."
Certainly it's feasible to have them in G Ps surgeries.
"I would, myself, be very keen to look at the possibility of such machines perhaps even going to third world countries, because it's even arguable that the place for such intelligence systems is not to replace expert medical people in this country where we have such people, but to export them to developing countries which don't have such people, and one could imagine, perhaps, a system of erm paramedical orderlies, who had some sort of medical knowledge and manipulative skill, taking a small expert computer in a shoe box — it would be no bigger — to villages and getting diagnoses of patient illnesses there on the spot."
So it would make a great deal of difference in areas where there's very little available in the way of medical services.
"You move into the south which is the area where landlord exploitation might have been at its most intense, where you would expect antagonisms to be greatest, where one would expect that peasants would be actually demanding land reform and, and  indeed if you, you go back to, to the  you've clearly got that almost spontaneous underlying radicalism because of the, the intense landlord exploitation."
"What we're saying on the whole is that we, we are moving south  erm militarily we, we now control most of north China, we begin to move on to the  into areas of very high tenancy where landlordism was thought to be at its extreme but all we're doing is reducing rents and interest rents."
"I think if, if they adopted a policy of erm of struggle  last time, I mean they would get to land reform indirectly but I don't think you can erm initiate it from the Party as such like  because that causes all sorts of problems through definitions and things like that but"
"yeah I think  right  but I think the way of analyzing  is through just saying  you, what are your grievances and then ultimately that will result in landlords being driven out."
Right.
"So they've learnt that they can't implement land reform unless they've got the support of the popular masses and it's got to come from them cos ultimately they, they're pursuing land reform in order to get the peasant support and if that's not what they want there's no point in just erm  imposing it on them."
"You've got to, the peasants have got to be demanding it themselves."
"Alright, so what you've learnt from the experience in North China is that you are actually better off to go in fairly gently"
Mm.
"and  begin the process and then allow the peasants to kind of take it over, to become involved, to become vocal and to become activated."
"And you've got to educate the masses and perhaps instil  erm more revolutionaries, sort of a more, a culture that actually sees that they're not gonna gain just material benefits but how that this is in order to advance society forward."
Mm.
Yes and take control of them in terms of direction and so on.
Yes.
Mm.
in a sense though you're putting a lot more emphasis on the Party.
"You're saying it's the, it's the, it's the Party that, that erm mobilizes them, there is, there is actually very little spontaneous revolutionary charge within the peasantry."
"That, that you've got to create it for them."
I mean by just doing this sort of settling of accounts is that creating it for them?
Er I mean is that creating a sparkle?
"I think  I mean it's a, it's a very small sparkle  just saying"
now's a chance to erm
"Is, isn't the idea that"
most likely to make people believe that they can achieve a certain thing and let them get up and do it and erm  so that the Party's role is in the initial stage  fostering as much mobilization
Yes.
creating a common consciousness and then let the peasants go with that.
"Not do actually do the land reform themselves, but to create the conditions whereby they can believe in themselves."
Right.
"So land reform is, is, and this will be very counter to nineteen forty seven, land re land reform is, is not now the means of mobilizing the masses, you have to mobilize the masses for land reform."
"And this rent reduction, interest rate reduction together with the kind of settling accounts procedure which presumably will come out of this is the means by which you mobilize the masses and once you've got them mobilized, you can then move on to land reform."
"But it's, it's premature to go for land reform straight away."
Yeah.
"There have been an enormous series of changes over the last ten or fifteen years, and maybe some school teachers would be glad if it slowed down a little bit to make their life a little easier, I don't know."
Sir Keith Joseph has recently gone on record as saying that he wished that examiners could be more objective in their assessment of what children know.
Is there any application of this in chemistry that you can see?
"Is there a body of chemistry that, if you knew it, you're all right, as it were , you could pass a certain exam and if you didn't know it, or is chemistry a little bit subjective in terms of its assessment?"
"Well there's an element of subjectiveness, inevitably, in an assessment, I think, but of course we are aware of this problem and we do try to be a objective as we possibly can."
"We try to set ourselves specific aims and objectives and when it comes to marking scripts, for example, we have a quite specific mark scheme which has been very carefully thrased out, not only with examiners, but with certain school teachers, which we try to make tie this down as be as objective as we can, but there's always and element of subjectivity."
"If there are four marks for a given point, the candidate who gets it all right gets four, the candidate who gets it all wrong gets nothing, but the chap who gets it part right has a possibility of one, two or three, and it's often a question of judgement as to what an imperfect answer is worth."
Do you use multiple choice papers in examinations these days?
"Yes, most Boards do, I think, but to varying extents."
I think probably something like twenty per cent of the marks for most Boards will go on the multiple choice erm paper.
We use multiple choice question papers in physics too.
I'm always a little bit worried about them because it seems to me that they almost define the syllabus in terms of what you can ask four reasonable questions in terms of alternatives about.
Well I wouldn't like to see an exam system which was entirely multiple choice questions for just that reason.
I would also like to see skills of writing and arguing developed and tested.
"But they are particularly easy to mark, but I suspect they give us a false sense of objectivity and I think we sometimes give the statistics a little bit too much weight."
"Lastly, in terms of chemistry as a career, is it a good career these days, Peter?"
Well my feeling is that students who graduate from here ultimately get jobs.
"Many of them, of course, not in chemistry."
There are fewer jobs in chemistry than there used to be.
"In an economic upturn that may change, of course, but I think they all get jobs of some sort, and I would have hoped that a chemistry degree, a good training in chemistry, would in fact also train people to think in such a way that they could apply it to a lot of other areas."
Chemists have traditionally taken employment in other areas anyway.
"Lots of chemists have made very good chartered accountants, for example, but I would like to see very many more — let's say science trained people going out into the professions, particularly into politics."
"So it's a training for life, not just a training for being a chemist?"
I would like to think so.
"Peter, thank you very much."
That's all that we have time for today.
Next
Hello.
"In our series about computers we're looking at applications in all sorts of different areas, and today we're going to talk about how they're used in medicine."
Would you tell your symptoms to an electronic box?
I recently asked Dr Jim Hunter whether in the future diagnosis would be by computer rather than by doctor.
Yes and no I suppose.
"Item twenty,funding."
"Er, we have erm,"
Thank you chairman.
Yes I would.
"Erm, and in fact I would move my original motion as an amendment to yours."
"And the reason I do that, is that er, I believe that you've er, actually misunderstood what is going on, and I alluded to some of that during the debate earlier, on the budget."
"I think it's wrong, in paragraph a of your motion, to say the police committee has received privileged funding."
It's privileged if you don't want it maybe.
"The funding, was a matter of assessing priorities, and each time, when that assessment came, the police were prioritised as to receive the funding that was thought correct to undertake the duties that they do in this county."
"And we know that through that period, there has been a steady increase in the number of police officers the county have got, and this county has always up to now, willingly funded those police officers."
Part b of your motion.
Yes we know that from the first of April ninety-five it will probably no longer be the responsibility of the county council to set a budget for the Wiltshire police authority.
That's all the more reason why you should not be cutting their budget below what they need for next year.
"You've used, er, er, an underspend from this year rolled over, but you haven't increased the base budget to pay for the projection costs which came from erm, this year's budget."
"And we all know, that if you put the police into the er, budget next year, in at a low level, that is the level which the Government will assume this county council thinks is correct to fund the police force."
"So your under-funding next year, and your use of the rollovers, will actually have a long term effect on the funding of the Wiltshire police force, and I suggest that there'll be problems er, ahead on that basis."
"You refer in part d erm, to recent Government announcements which you say will make the fight against crime less effective."
"A freeze on the number of police officers, but we know that through the review of the police ranking system, that the Home Secretary has said that will mean a considerable number, and I think the figure of two thousand was mentioned, extra officers will be back on the beat."
"That's where the public want to see them, not sitting in offices pushing paper."
"The reduction in the paperwork undertaken by officers will mean a further number of police officers back on the beat, where the people of this county want to see them."
Not pushing paper in headquarters and divisional headquarters and police stations.
But the announcement made by the Home Secretary went further.
"And it went further into things like, erm, giving more thought to the problems of the victim, and a little less erm, consideration of the criminal who inflicts such terrible da er, harm onto their victims."
"I can think now of two elderly people I know, who never, ever got over a burglary."
"One died recently, but she couldn't ever come to terms with the fact that her house had been burgled, and that the er, that some of her most valued contents had been taken."
"And I'd want to know that the person who did that was going to be punished, and punished properly."
"And I think for too long, we've listened to the libertarians who want to think of the rights of the criminal all the time, and er, and don't worry too much about the victim."
"I think that the genetic er, testing that was, that is now law, has to go a long way towards finding criminals, who once they've been tested will find it very difficult to commit crime again, because they're on record, and they'll be on computer record."
"Many announcements made by the Home Secretary are moving in the way that I have always wanted it to move, and I believe that er, in Wiltshire this will have a very positive effect."
"We have already, we believe  accepting in Wiltshire for two of the new parish constable erm, appointments."
"I only hope that the police committee will actually support those and get on towards introducing them, because that is a way of using some of the people in our village communities to erm, to keep an eye on the community and see that those people that shouldn't go round."
"I hear that maybe, we're not going to support that policy."
"Here's the planning permission here's the site if you insist on going there well we can't give you any guarantees but we'll do our best for you, but certainly the best thing is to have the allocation."
"And if that allocation is pushed through, if you like in the teeth of the structure plan policy, but it becomes your local plan, and that's the legislation provides for that, that surely must be the the question."
"Just one other other point, there is the issue of sustainable development Professor Lock referred to erm alright we'll bring in the railway line er as as part of your criteria, but I am concerned at the the general dispersal that is er envisaged in the sort of development er that he suggested."
Erm so as I say to to get your erm to get the elephant er have the cage with planning permission.
Thank you.
Mr Potter.
Thank you.
David Potter North Yorkshire County Council.
Erm I think Professor Lock appears to be talking about a site specific proposal.
The borough council refers to a criteria based policy.
Yet I think the borough council gave some clear hints they're maybe looking for additional land allocation.
Now I think it would be helpful if the borough council could clarify whether that is in fact what they're looking for an additional land allocation.
But I would like to point out the county council point of view on both a site or a criteria based policy.
"In fact er Professor Lock in his hin in his own evidence er page five para four three refers to a rash of speculation alo along the A one M in the county, as to which locations the policy might be said to apply."
I think that is the fear of the county council that a criteria based policy would lead to a sp a rash of speculation speculative development along the er the major motorway corridors.
"Erm with regard to a site specific policy, if it's additional, and there's no clear need for it it's not catered for within the allocation which is er provided for within the structure plan, then we could be left with a major site with a clear commitment to its development or its suitability for development and and no end user."
Now what would happen to the site in those circumstances?
"A major business park, er a major manufacturer, a major distribution centre, erm with the consequences for perhaps in commuting and trans er transport movements."
I think these are the fears of the county council that er the uncertainty such a policy would bring.
"Would the more explicit specification in a policy like E four of Humberside, excuse me, that the development should not be speculative, in other words that the end user should be known, overcome some of your concerns?"
I think if the end user was known then the end user is perfectly capable of submitting a planning application.
Erm and it could be dealt with on its merits.
I don't think there's anything within fifty four section fifty four A which precludes that.
David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council.
I just wanted to come back on er David Potter's assertion that we were looking for a a higher allocation under I five and I I thought I'd specifically covered that point by saying that that wasn't what we were looking for because that wouldn't address the sort of development we're talking about here.
Er another allocation under I five would simply mean that we'd more land to find in and around main areas.
Erm those sites are subject to other lo locational restrictions and other environmental restrictions and wouldn't in our view be appropriate for the sort of development that he's looking for erm a location in in our context anyway generally speaking along the A one corridor.
Could I just have Mr Jewitt first.
Michael Jewitt Hambleton District Council.
"Erm I tend to share Patrick Earle's reservations about this particular policy, I think that it would convey the wrong message erm to the development industry."
Erm undermine the policies of conservation and restraint in the county.
"There's also a danger, as Patrick Earle's pointed out, though it would be applied differently between different districts erm given erm that erm erm relative issues on unem unemployment and the economy will er differ between between districts."
"You're right so it's, so it's not just in terms of the number of the cadre, it's the quality of the cadre, and, and you can't just erm  er I mean  you can't just pick, you can't   you've gotta educate them, create them etcetera, yeah."
"In applying that how that they didn't implement land reform because it wasn't viable  but if  erm another way of looking at it is that how the Communist Party no longer saw land reform as the best way, means of achieving greater"
Yes.
"egalitarianism and that how that  increased production was seen as the  you know, priority, and so perhaps they would want to just  I mean it might seem  appear that they were changing their policy to a more moderate land reform but this was  not an end in itself it was a means to an end in order to increase production which would benefit the population as a whole, so it's, they still had the same goal"
Yeah.
which is to achieve greater equality but you're having different means to achieve that.
Right.
"It, it, it's a different means to an end, it's a much slower means to an end"
Mm.
"in the, in the sense that i if, if you look,i if you adopt a sort of retrospective view, I E if you look back from say  anything after nineteen forty nine and you say look, hold on erm  this was the final stage of the revolution."
"The communists had never been in a better position than they were in in, in nineteen forty eight, the civil war was, was clearly going in their favour  erm they were to achieve power within eighteen months  and at precisely the point where they had everything going for them, they are adopting the most moderate policy."
"If there was any time when radical land reform would have succeeded, it was during nineteen forty eight to nineteen forty nine, and it's precisely that time  looking into an area which would seem to be the most favourable for radical land reform, they have not taken that opportunity."
how much control did they have over ?
"Well they're getting increasing control, increasing control but not  and er so yo what you're saying is that, is that even if, if you go back to the reality of nineteen forty eight, actually they didn't realize they were going to get that control as quickly."
"they, they were seeing  as being an, a longer drawn out struggle"
Mm.
"not, which, one which would not be over in a year and a half."
"I mean we've, I mean at that point you've got  that was the point where you've got the massive United States aid coming in  erm  you, you've got erm  United States equipping China with all   enormous fire power, sending tanks in etcetera, I mean this was the beginning of, of the realization of the United States that, that the communists were a threat and they didn't like it and they, they were putting massive ai aid  erm and, and that there was all that United States war machine erm"
"And this, this other thing as well about erm  which is obviously  and erm  I think what they had in mind was that before you start doing anything radical, before you start having any real land reform at all, you have to ensure that you really have control of that area, he's had this"
"Yes, right."
"experience of trying to, trying to put through land reform in erm areas which then led to  just incredibly bad"
Yes.
cos all the sort of people  communists  they're all just full of hot air and just really get lost
Right.
the important lessons they learnt cos at first they thought land reform would enable them to achieve mass mobilization
Yes.
but now they realize that however you need to have mass mobilization in order to have successful land reform
Right.
Right.
"and so land reform was no longer seen as a means to achieve their end that they  that and that  it wasn't the best policy to consolidate power, it was  you needed to have the mass support there first so that's why land reform was no longer seen as their goal so they didn't take it up at this point when one would expect them to pursue it."
"It's, well it's still a goal but it's one step off?"
Yeah.
And she didn't take individual actions what she took was what she called clusters.
Clusters of actions so she looked at things like the use of the hands the use of the feet the use of the eyes erm and what she called the centre line.
The body's centre line and she equated that and what she said was in terms of the hands that people who were open and positive communicators used on average more symmetrical open palm gestures than individual or closed palm gestures  non-symmetrical.
And if you look at there are certain er types of people in history who use very non-symmetrical hand gestures who perhaps you might say were not the most open communicators in the world
and if you take a film of of erm Hitler and er people of that ilk in the second world war and you analyse almost frame by frame you'll see that and count the number of non-symmetrical hand gestures you will find that they're quite high as a percentage.
Now I'm not saying that we stand here and all we do is that because when you want to emphasise a point then sometimes a a single non-symmetrical a single hand gesture is more appropriate.
But on average you will find er and you look at people in the pub you look in the bar tonight at the people having conversations and see how many symmetrical hand gestures there are.
It's quite interesting.
What I'm talking about here are not things that are unnatural but things that er will come naturally as you relax into your presentation.
Are you suggesting that
"Absolutely, and you will find when we look on the video the number of people who held up a piece of paper if you hold things up and I'm holding this now because I'm about to write but if if you stand here and hold a piece of paper then it's very difficult to make symmetrical palm gestures, open palm gestures."
So that is one thing as I develop this theme you'll you'll see.
"So of course the next question comes well well how do you manage to put it down, I guess?hands we'll come on to that."
Okay?
Now another thing as I said that she  looked at in terms of clusters was the centre line.
Now ladies and gentlemen we all know that there are certain parts of the body that it is quite natural that we like to protect
Such as a direct free kick.
erm and and ladies perhaps would tend to do the same sort of thing.
Now what that does of course is close off the centre line and what  found was that people who were positive communicators as they spoke to somebody they presented the centre line to them.
"Now if I'm presenting my centre line to Tony and speaking to him that feels fine yeah, but if I talk to you Dave over my shoulder like that I mean how does that feel?"
Talk to you and tell you something you know
It feels as though I don't care
lack of interest
lack of interest that's right.
"So presenting the centre line and okay we're going to come on to the eye contact as well in a moment, presenting the centre line with eye contact means that it feels much more positive for the audience in terms of the delivery."
So the centre line is an is an important aspect of   Now if you're holding your notes yeah I I mean that's not a very open sort of centre line is it because I've got this as a barrier.
In a way this standing behind  and it's unfortunate we have to have something as big as this table er and if I stand behind it then you know Gordon's not getting my full centre line yep.
So standing behind a barrier is another thing.
The third aspect the third aspect that  er noticed was movement of the feet whilst in this sort of a situation.
In any communication and Mike used that term and this is what this is about in communication there is a gap it doesn't matter whether it's you know writing a letter making a phone call or just standing this sort of distance away.
There's a gap over which these words have to flow.
"Yes, there's a gap in this communication."
aye
And the against  that is carried.
"Item sixteen, the district auditors management letter and audited accounts for ninety-two ninety-three."
Mr .
"Thank you chair, chairman."
"I have a particular over the management letter, and I'm sure Mr  will be aware that in fact I refer of course to the facilities management contract."
"Erm, this management letter was distributed er, to all of us, so I suppose some of us at least will have read it."
"And, and the district auditor is particularly concerned."
"He says, I remain concerned that it is not yet possible to agree an implementation plan for recommendations made in his previous report."
"Now this is in his key messages, and towards the back, there are two pages, where he complains that many promises were made for the facilities management contract, and in particular, erm, he says it is still the case that work to take advantage of the development faci facility has not yet been identified, now I think this is the thing we spent a million pounds on it, and are not using it."
"And he says that progress towards down-sizing has not yet been planned to meet the target deadline within the con , within the contract."
Now how long ago was that contract?
Eighteen months?
"And this is a letter dated a couple of months ago, is it?"
"Erm, what's been going there?"
Now the facilities management contract is being held up by Mr  as an example for the property out-sourcing.
"Well I don't think it's a very good example, if it's being criticized."
"Perhaps it's the kind of example, in the same way that Westminster Council was held up as an example, and it's now being criticized by the district auditor."
"Erm, perhaps it will be Mr  's policy to impune all district auditors that their findings are not worth erm, troubling with."
"Well, I don't suppose this contract's costing us twenty-one million, but it's costing us several million, and I would hate to think that er, any of that is being wasted, or not spent in the best possible way, and I would therefore recommend, chair, that we refer the matter of the facilities management contract to the budget review sub-committee for consideration of the way it's not being implemented."
"Right, thank you."
"referring to, paragraphs one hundred and four to one hundred and nine, saying , Miss  also wishes to comment on this"
"Erm, yes I do, very much indeed."
"I'm extremely disappointed, that erm, we don't seem to make any progress towards getting the savings erm, that, that, erm, we were promised."
"I, I hesitate to suggest, I mean that I'm quite happy to support what Mr  is saying, because I really hesitate to suggest reviving the old computer and financial services working party, because I think that was probably my most miserable experience on this council, with the single exception of the budget review er, parallel, or whatever it was, when it was led by ."
"Erm, but it seems to be the case that when there are not councillors here whinging away at officers, saying why isn't it working, nothing happens, it all gets sort of forgotten or something."
"And we've got to do something about it, we were promised these savings, there aren't any, it doesn't look as if anybody's working awfully hard to get them, and I'd like to know why not, and what's going on, and I'm quite happy to support what Mr  proposes, that we refer it all to budget review."
"You might have noticed, there is an officer response."
Mr
"Can I just say sir, we are, er, the  manager is preparing a report, tonight plans a report for the February the twenty-second meeting of policy resources committee, on the first, well it's not the first year, first tranche of the F M contract, and dealing with these points of the"
"It started at the end of March, it's the first nine months, it's the first tranche of the erm, the F M arrangement, and, and your members will be getting a report in February on that."
Mr
"In other words, if you say, religion is an illusion, are you undermining and destroying social order?"
This is a  this is a paradox that Freud has to face up to.
"And in the closing pages of the book, he answers this  this er, problem, by saying, well look, er, you don't have to base morality, civilization, and social order on an illusion."
"On the contrary, Freud says, basing it on an illusion is, is very very dangerous."
"Because you see, the thing with illusions is, it's okay as long as people believe."
"For example, you know, you could frighten a child into  I mean this is not an, an analogy Freud uses, this is one I thought of, but it's in the same spirit as his argument."
"You could, for example, frighten a child into conformity with your wishes by saying that erm, you know, if, if the child doesn't go to bed at the right time, the bogie man will come and eat them up, or something."
You might say something like that.
And I can remember being frightened of the bogie man when I was a little er child.
My elder brother used to terrify me with it.
"Erm, okay the bogie man would come and eat me up."
"Erm, well as long as the child is, is young enough to believe in the bogie man, everything is fine, and that child may well go to bed on time and er, and er, shuts its eyes and goes straight to sleep  er in fear."
"But what happens if the child matures a bit, and realizes that the bogie man is just er, just er an invention, created to, to set fear in it?"
"In the first place, says Freud, the child won't obey any longer, necessarily, because now he's got nothing to fear, and secondly, a child might resent the lie that has been told to him."
"You know, I was told about the bogie man, but the bogie man, I now know, didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't exist."
"So, Freud says, trying to build morality on the basis of religion, is like trying to build a house on sand, because the foundations won't hold."
The foundations are illusory.
"What we need, says Freud, is a sure foundation for social order, and the only foundation that will do is, is reality."
"The trouble with religion, is that transference is based on an illusion and it serves the pleasure principle ultimately, because it's a tremendous wish fulfilment."
"Wish fulfilments as we know, and what we saw about dreams and so on, so the pleasure principle that reigns in the unconscious."
"And as we saw, the unconscious is out of contact wi with reality and so need take no account of it."
"However, says Freud, ideally, morality and social order should be based, not on the pleasure principle, but on the reality principle, and, and, and he ends up with  this book invoking the idea that science should replace erm, religion in, in this respect."
"In other words that science should establish insights into reality which make social order erm, both possible and well founded."
"Now in this particular book, Freud doesn't say very much about what these insights er, are."
"And er, as you'll see, probably next week's, I'm not going to get to this now, er, next week, or possible the week after, even, depending on how long it takes me to get there, I will suggest to you that the revolution now taking place in behavioural science, does suggest wh what they are, and that there are in fact some deeply countering intuitive insights, erm, into this whole issue, which have only emerged in the last few years."
"But er, this is just by way of an anticipation, the  the general conclusion comes for instance, in this rather generalized book, and relatively short book, is that we ought to base variety and social order on science, and its insights, and certainly not on, on religion, and, and there he, there he leaves the question."
"However, he takes it up again, at much greater length, in his next book of nineteen thirty, Civilization and its Discontents."
"This book erm, begins, once again with the Hobbesian problem."
"The,wi with the, with the question of social order."
"Only in this book, it comes out even more clearly."
"Civilization, says Freud, is based on the suppression, repression and inhibition and frustration of the id"
"people's individual er, drives, especially their sexual and aggressive drives, which are deeply compromised by having to live erm, in a civilized er, society."
attention
it does it moves attention away just takes takes the little bit of the tension off you so you can do that as well.
So it's it appeals to the right brain that visual aspect it can take attention it can actually make the presenter move around  when it switches attention what does that do for the audience then?
wakes them up
"er absolutely, yeah it keeps the interest going doesn't it?"
So it's it's an interest thing as well it keeps the interest it changes the emphasis switches the attention makes a break doesn't it it just changes er er a natural break that happens and it changes attention.
So there's there's lots of reasons to illustrate the point then and another thing of course it does is if it's one you use on here it helps you remember you don't have to have that written down because it's there already produced if it's a pre-prepared acetate as we call as we call it.
So and it can break up a long session it can it can maintain interest.
So two two methods I'm going to talk about really is is the overhead and the flipchart.
You may have caught me doing this some of you may have have noticed that I try to force meself not to and it's something to remember.
If I'm writing something up here and I talk to you while I'm writing up here then what does it do?
It loses impact
"It loses impact doesn't it because a the power of the voice is hit against there, b it's very rude to talk while I've got me back to you as well so people yes lose interest."
So while you're writing on the board have one of those pauses.
Now again it's oh there's silence in the room but while you're writing what what are the audience doing if you're not speaking?
Watching
"Absolutely they're reading it with you so they're with you so you're you're holding their interest even though you're not actually saying anything, yeah, and again you may you may have noticed well another thing is once you've once you're written put the pen down and the easiest thing in the world to have a  but if you want to make a point and you probably noticed once I once I put the red lines around the red boxes round there and I gave you the first demonstration of the Aldershot method I stood here okay."
Now if I want to write something I can just turn like that and I'm not turning me back away.
"Okay if you're left handed then then I guess you're probably gonna feel more comfortable that way round erm but while you're using this and while you're making a point about what you've written just just stand to the side of it I usually put me hand up have done there just make the points to be made, yes."
So that's that's the way to use that is not to talk to it but to have a silence while you're writing er and then to stand at the side while you making the points that are that are associated with what you've written up.
I would recommend for any talk that you give that you don't use more than two types of visual aid.
I know we used the video but that was for a very specific reason but if you know have you ever been to one of those lectures where there's there's overheads going on here and then they go and they write on there and they you have some slides and then you have a video and then you know it's like being at Wimbledon.
er if you stick to just just two as a maximum er ah an overhead and a flipchart or maybe a video and an overhead then it actually doesn't it really helps not to confuse the audience.
That's actually all I want to say about the flipchart unless anybody's any other comments I mean Jeff's you've obviously got a lot of experience in a do you feel there's any anything further than that I know I've covered it very briefly.
Well the only one that comes back to me is you've got the ability to review
"that's right, that's right you can you can"
"yep, good it has that creative element about it doesn't it because as you say if you get them to produce it get the audience to help produce it then again it's involvement and the whole thing is is erm more spontaneous than than pre-prepared."
I mean if if I'd done that this morning and I'd written it all up before you came in and then said well what we've done is this and then we did that and then we did that  but as as it was generated as we discussed then then you were with me I hope at the way it went
It's quite important though to do it fairly neatly
Oh indeed indeed and I'm not the neatest writer in the world I will say and erm
I wasn't
No I know you weren't getting at me
Well the three things that er were most significant for me yesterday were the cluster the thought patterns and the Aldershot method.
Erm the cluster makes you realise how you presented things to people what you can improve them having things in your hand that it it just makes you erm more nervous because you're fumbling about what makes me more nervous you're fumbling about with something trying to to do something that you don't really need to do.
Erm moving around er feet movement I didn't quite master that yesterday but it it's something that er I know that will come with time and er it'll it'll all come together.
The thought patterns like Joanne and others the the concept of putting a little circle down and one word in it and expanding that out and being able to stand around and talk erm for three minutes or ten minutes or whatever for a significant amount of time erm that that was also a revelation to me.
And along along with that erm the Aldershot method erm an introduction and expansion and an ending all on the same subject erm makes it a nice concise er little parcel erm for you to talk through.
"So the end the three things for me yesterday cluster, thought patterns and the Aldershot method"
Thank you very much
"Well for me exactly the same as Bob sorry Robert, the Aldershot method plus er the thought processes."
The Aldershot method because er it it sort of explained to me the most effect way of getting across whatever you want to say so that made me a feel a bit happier about that.
It also made me think that perhaps I had more control over the whole presentation generally which is my biggest concern so get up there and just do some  and therefore it's going to go on to the confidence side of it.
The cluster erm I was always very aware of this bit so it made me you know aware that there are things you can do and watching everybody just seemed just the answer inside you.
It didn't look er odd it looked okay so that would make me a bit more confident I think a bit less self conscious.
But the most important thing I thought was the thought process I mean just just saying this while you were just going on I just jotted down in the same way you could come off with three ideas that  around and I felt that was that was ideal.
It keeps the your your presentation  and it stops those pregnant er pauses you know suddenly you realise Christ I've forgotten  lost the thing.
"So for me Aldershot method, cluster but most important was the thought patterns."
Gordon
Er yes there the three things I got out of erm yesterday's course was the thought patterns the Aldershot method and the delivery.
"The thought patterns allow me to erm put down what I wanted to talk about, expand on it and at the same time break it down into areas and on the other and spend some time on each area."
The Aldershot method erm because it showing you how you broke that subject down allows you to erm introduce it expand on it and summarise at the end.
Er the delivery part it was more the cluster but the overall delivery allowed me to prepare how I was going to be standing er how to get the audience in contact with me the eye the eye contact and also the way I spoke.
So to summarise the  thought patterns the Aldershot method  Jeff
The three things that came out of yesterday for meself were the the Aldershot method the delivery .
The Aldershot principally because it gave a structure to what I had to say at least went up there fairly confident of what I had .
The delivery because it gave me what I had to think about when I was up there  language body language  and then the playbacks  I could look at the two things that Mike just highlighted as one and two.
The Aldershot method the structure of what I said and the way the delivery had come across.
The feedback gave me a review of those questions.
So out of yesterday it was how to put the structure together as  the delivery of how it came across and what the audience's reaction was to it.
Morning ladies and gentlemen
carry on Mike and then  to John
good morning ladies and gentlemen the three main items I got out of yesterday was the er structured thought patterns the cluster and the playback
the structured thought patterns I found that the most important because when I was up at the table on the second presentation I was able to have my thoughts relating to the layout  already and with in fact just the single element of the subject shown on my paper I could immediately focus on that and in fact give the details of that right the way through.
On the cluster erm not having in fact had any erm work on this type of thing before I didn't realise that holding a paper could close you down and in fact without moving my feet I wasn't getting movement I was just static and with no use of the hands you were  to express yourself sufficiently.
Okay morning everybody
morning
let's a what are we going to be doing today then as Dave's already observed because he's seen my notes it's going to be a very full day er so we need to crack on.
What I'd like to do first of all is just to summarise wha what we did yesterday.
"Just very quickly summarise that and what I'd like you to do is take notes in the new form that we've got now with er a thought pattern so if you,"
morning  okay
excuse me
"Okay we've only barely started if you take a a fresh piece of paper then, a fresh sheet of paper and and er the orientation that you now know we need to do if we're going to do if we're going to do a thought pattern"
this morning
"Tom, we're jus just gonna summarise what we did yesterday by means of a a thought pattern."
so if in the middle of the page you write day one  let's just summarise er what we did yesterday.
"Well it was twenty three hours I was going to say twenty four hours ago, but twenty three hours."
"We started off with er some introductions  and er the introductions, you introduced yourself  and we discussed the the objectives that the company have and also the objectives that you have for the course."
The objectives give us a way of er measuring at the end of the course whether the course has achieved for you what you wanted from we'll come back as I said to those this afternoon and and just review them to see that you got out of the course what you.
Okay having done that we discussed what the content of the course was going to be and then I asked you to make a first presentation.
Pres presentation one  and it was to last three minutes  and the subject was what would I do if I won two million pounds  and we recorded that er on the C C T V for later playback.
Having done that we then talked about the problem that we all have on these sorts of occasions which is the problem of nerves  and we talked about the symptoms of dry voice and the shaking limbs the the wonky voice  and the reasons why we have er these nerves  and we also talked about the causes of the the primitive instinct of fight or flight er how we get get our body ready to handle this unusual situation.
And we we discussed the the difference between anxiety and arousal and how we can turn our anxiety into arousal to ensure performance and I plotted a little graph if you remember.
Of performance against arousal levels and we agreed that the the purpose of training like this and also putting these principles into practice is to be able to handle more and more arousal er more and more nerves   and still and still be able to perform in a confident manner.
We then talked about the first of those two towers of Tower Bridge if you remember which was  about the skills that we need for er delivery.
What are the skills that we need when we stand up in front of people to actually deliver what we have to say
and there were three aspects we looked at I wonder why it was three?
I wonder why it was three?
"Erm three aspects, first of all there was that little word I gave you er to describe pa"
paralinguistics
Thank you  the voice and and the words that we said paralinguistic is correct.
The study of the voice what we say and how we say it  I then introduced you to if you like advanced body language and based on the work that Marion North did and rather than take an individual movement of the body we took a cluster   and how many aspects where there to cluster I wonder  there were three weren't there.
"Hands, feet centre  level."
"Okay so paralinguistics, the cluster and the other one was the need for audience contact."
the way we get feedback from the audience the way we ensure that we involve the audience as well through the use of the eyes the names er and asking questions.
"And then we had the moment that a lot of you er weren't looking forward to which was playing the video back, yes."
and this gave you an opportunity to see yourself to see others  and to take part in some coaching  something that we did again yesterday and we shall be doing again today  We then talked about the the design aspect first of all we talked about er the way the brain is involved in this communication and some of the aspects of the brain.
"I mean, many, many wards, but that doesn't mean that we should therefore ignore a ward because it's got an area that is not deprived, you've got the, I think that by choosing East and St Clements as areas, that they seem then quite sensible areas to start with, nice central, fairly central location."
"I was going to say, when it comes to paragraph five, do you erm suggest that you actually think in terms of church organisations, they're not mentioned, and I look forward in in paragraph seven one to the seminar, the working seminar that's going to be in the near future, and I hope that we'll soon get a date, so that we can get it in our very busy diaries, in the hope that we can come along and learn more about this."
"Thanks very much, Diana."
"Could we add mosques as well to the churches, please?"
"I'm sorry, I should have said all religious groups."
All religious groups !
Can we come to a decision there please.
"Yes, just on the sub-ward level, of course there's really, there's a lot more investigations to go into targeting the resources, just I mean to target them in a city by having these standard mortality ratios for wards, but they're all below ward level, and target the specific areas."
"erm That's one point, the other point is of course, we have already targeted of course in working with the groups that we've defined as erm ones whose health status is at risk in effect, so this is a supplement, this is actually translating those targets we have already defined into a locality planning exercise."
"So we're testing, those priorities are still holding for us that but we're applying them to the localities."
Thanks very much.
"Can I direct you then to page sixty-one, recommendations in paragraph eight."
"You're asked to support the general move, that we have set out from this report, and you're asked to agree to St Clements and East Ward, and I think we've heard Mandy and Phil acknowledge that there may well be a case for looking at an area of council housing, which we will leave them to do, and also to approve the set of objectives, which I particularly welcome, on page sixty-two and sixty-three, which will amount to a work programme, which I would have thought we were all very pleased to see."
"Can we endorse that, and ask the officers to come back to us and keep us in touch with their work."
Are you agreed?
"Thanks very much indeed, thank you both, and I ."
"We need to move somewhat quickly, and I am reminded that, I did see Caroline come in, but we have two people who've come in connection with item fifteen, Community Concerns in East Oxford, are you agreed that we take that now, so that they can"
I think it ties in very well with the item we've just discussed.
"Thank you, Graham."
"Item fifteen, and Shereen has just arrived as well."
"Caroline and your visitor, would you like to join us at the table, if you want to join in."
So we're turning to page seventy-five.
The paper is in fact written by Shereen.
"I don't want you to think, Caroline that we are acquitting you rapidly, I will try to acquit you rapidly, but I am also delivering what you've come for."
"Well, thank you, chair, for inviting me here."
erm do you want me to speak to this
Please do.
"Caroline Morrell, from OCADU, do you want to press your button, Caroline, so that everybody will  please sit down normally and naturally, and maybe moved a bit closer to you, they'll pick up what you're saying."
"erm But I raised this at the alcohol forum, because erm sometime this summer I had a phone call from Mr Bailey here, who is a resident of East Oxford, to express his concern about various problems erm in East Oxford, problems that were posed to residents there."
"erm I think in fact it would be better to ask Mr Bailey to explain what his concerns were erm I'd just like to say first although initially it revolves around problems of drinking, I'm looking at other issues of East Oxford, in that recently there's been a great deal of concern about glue sniffing in sections there, and there have been various letters from residents in the local newspapers, and I think there's a general level of problem for people living in East Oxford, and it's not just that the people there want the streets cleaned up or whatever, they want something constructive and helpful to be done for people."
So
"Welcome, would you like to take two or three minutes to talk to us about your concerns."
"And when you look far into space, you're also looking back in time and we're looking back when we look at the very most distant objects."
We're looking right back to the beginning of the universe.
"And, lastly, if you went into space and you really went very fast and for a long, long time, would you ever reach an edge?"
Would you ever reach an end?
Would you ever reach a boundary?
That's disputed at the moment.
"erm I think the consensus is that you wouldn't — that either space is infinite, or at the very least it it's finite it has no edge, so if you went in one direction for long enough you would come back in the other direction."
"Robert, the mind literally boggles at those distances  mine does, anyway."
So does mine.
Thank you very much.
"I'd love to talk to you more about this, but I'm afraid that's all that we have time for today."
Hello.
Peter Simpson is a chemist at the university.
It's a long time ago since I did any chemistry.
"It was at school, and my memories of chemistry is laboratories full of stink bombs, full of bangs, and rather unpleasant chemicals."
"Has chemistry changed very much over the years, Peter?"
Well it's probably a good deal less smelly and bangy than once it was.
"The Health and Safety at Work Act has made us rather more concerned about smells and bangs and the dangers these cause, so perhaps life is a little bit less smelly than it was, perhaps a little less exciting, but it ought to be a little longer too."
"On a more serious note, has chemistry changed as a subject very much over the last, dare I say, twenty five years?"
"Well, yes, I think it has."
"There have been scientific developments, of course, in chemistry, but perhaps it's seen now as being more important in the context of the contribution it's making to other important areas such as biology, environmental science and so forth ."
"At school one did a certain amount of chemistry, and then at university one did what was possibly a slightly different subject."
"Is that still true, or is the chemistry at school very similar to the chemistry that one would do at university?"
"I think it's probably fairly similar, but of course it gets more sophisticated, both in terms of the intellectual level at which you talk about chemistry, the concepts and so forth, and also in terms of the sort of experiments you can do because we have such sophisticated apparatus now, which you couldn't possibly get in a school laboratory."
So we can do more sophisticated things experimentally and intellectually I would say.
"Now does that matter, so far as being at school is concerned, if they can't really do proper experiments does that mean to say they can't do proper chemistry?"
"I wouldn't say that they couldn't do proper experiments at school, I don't think that's right."
"It's just that we do rather more sophisticated versions sometimes of very similar things which are done at school, but they might be done more precisely, simply in a rather more sophisticated way."
"But I am sure that if someone found they liked doing chemistry at school they're likely to find that they like continuing to do it at university, and vice versa."
If it turns them off at school it will probably turn them off at university.
"Taking your point that chemistry at university is a privileged subject in so far as that the equipment available is more sophisticated, more expense, more accurate, possibly, surely universities ought to be doing something to help kids in schools?"
"Well, yes, that's absolutely right, and I think we've always taken it as part of our responsibilities here really that they should extend over towards students in schools as well as students here at the university, and we do of course do quite a lot, in various ways, across the science area, to contribute towards science in schools."
"And I suggest libraries and museums, because I dare say they have the greatest experience in information co-ordination systems erm, within the, within the council, and I think, er, and of course they're highly involved out in the community."
"You'll find a library in absolutely every community, and reacting with people, and I would like to suggest that erm, a pilot project is erm, promoted within the libraries and museums committee, and that libraries and museums committee consider that at it's next meeting."
"Okay erm,Mr  please."
Thank you.
"If we look at the paper before us Mr Chairman, er, g two, and c thirteen."
"Er, g two is something which is specifically an envir , part of the environmental strategy."
"But c thirteen, about the conservation of the water environment and water resources, is a matter which could be incorporated in the county structure plan."
As opposed to g two.
"I was wondering whether erm, the director of planning and highways could, in an update, as proposed by erm, Councillor  erm, suggest other ways in which our environmental strategy could be inc er, could, could be strengthened."
"I have already suggested that c thirteen could become the formal part of the county structure plan, and that would strengthen it enormously."
"But because g two can't become a, a structure plan issue, I was wondering if the erm, environmental strategy of this council, when it is adopted, er, er,wh when it's formulated and, and, and, and adopted, er, could that be incorporated as an appendix to the county structure plan."
"I think there are a variety of ways Mr Chairman, in which our environmental strategy, when it's formulated, could be publicised and that's one way forward, and I wonder whether director could perhaps incorporate an argument for or against that,i , in, in,i , in the paper that Councillor  has suggested."
Thank you Mr .
"I'm going to bring Mr  in in a minute, but I think  Mr ."
"Firstly chairman, er er, a comment about the district auditor, I do find it a little perverse, that in fact on the last subject when we were talking about small schools, he doesn't take into account any other erm, item than the financial argument."
"And then suddenly we find the district auditor making comments about an environmental strategy, which I would have thought was, if he worked on the basis of the last one, rather outside his remit."
"Erm, I, I think sometimes if he's prepared to talk about such things as this, he should be prepared to consider the advantages to villages of, of small schools, and not just work on the financial item."
"Erm, when we look at the environmental strategy, I always think that environmental strategies are common sense to people, and that sometimes the involvement of large organizations is sometimes counter-productive."
"Erm, comment was made of c thirteen, we do when we design our roads, actually already put catchment areas in, so that if a lorry load of diesel happens to split on it that, that there are drains to hold it."
"I saw that when I, when we opened the Codford by-pass."
Or went to it during construction.
"There are pits down the hill, as you come into Codford, which actually would take the contents of a tanker, if it, if there was an accident."
"So, already, these things have been done as common sense in the past."
"Er, and I just wonder why we're trying to re-invent the wheel sometimes at these things."
"It's probably, maybe member's ignorance that they don't know that, that already a lot of work has been done on it."
"But, we're in danger very often, with environmental strategies, of taking quick decisions, that are misguided."
"Erm, and I've been involved in lengthy discussion on behalf of certain people in the trade, one of the largest er, chains of superstores, do-it-yourself superstores."
"And some of the things that are coming through there, are common sense, some of the things are a reaction which erm, is mis-informed."
But this is particularly in the timber trade.
"Timber trade world-wide is doing an enormous amount of work already to make sure that sustainable timber is supplied, and the horror stories are slowly going away, and a lot of people now do not buy timber in this country, from those countries who've got a bad track record, but are buying from countries like Denmark and Sweden, where it's a national law on their forestry policy."
"I, I, I believe that a lot of work's going on."
I think we have to be very careful we don't take reactions which actually negate some of the work and the common sense that has been undertaken at the moment.
Illuminate your colleagues underestimate go on.
My my view is that er those proposals would still stand to be considered as departures to to the structure plan.
"Er what the policy does is to set out quite clearly, I'm really looking at the the Humberside structure plan policy as an example, as to how the material considerations would come into play in erm offsetting if you like the the pol the other policies of the structure plan."
And far far from muddying the waters I think it makes clear that there are certain considerations that are acknowledged er which would allow certain proposals to come forward.
Rather than rather than having a sort of under the counter scenario where er material considerations you know will be considered when it when it's a separate planning application comes in there are there an ack there is an acknowledgement or a framework which is in a formal local plan which which identifies what the main considerations will be.
Thank you.
Professor Lock do you want to pick up the points that have been made so we can move on ?
Sir I I'm just not sure how you how you want to play this because you may feel I beginning to feel we're probably getting to the end of this circuit here .
I thought I thought we'd given it a really good airing this
Yeah.
afternoon and I was going to ask you to sort of sum up with your views as the sort of
I'm very willing to do
progenitor of this er
If you're feeling the moment
particular animal and then ask Mr Williamson to or Mr Potter to conclude for the county.
Thank you I'm very happy to do that.
David Lock.
The erm the discussion has been a great illumination.
"The erm what we've not erm what has not been er challenged is the argument that it is a good thing for North Yorkshire and for the region and for the United Kingdom and possibly for the European Union, that footloose inward investment, sorry footloose investment, of erm strategic importance should erm be capable of being attracted to this county."
Nobody seems to have challenged that building brick.
So it's a it's a good thing to be able to attract inward investment of that quality and significance.
There is a dispute erm between my report sir or what North Yorkshire County Council actually does and what the planning erm representatives here say they do.
And er you've been given a document by the county and you'll take your own view on that.
Erm all I can say is the county council economic development people are are there on the ground with their helicopters and the cameras when Kimberley Clarke comes in or the Central Science Laboratory and the car people and so on of the moment.
"Erm in planning terms I five, that's where all these last two days string together, I five does not enable this kind of inward investment to come."
"There are, finding fifty hectares or thereabouts for a development of this kind and characteristic out of the districts' allocations on the one hand in their geography, you know that has to be broadly speaking within the existing settlement pattern on the other, not possible."
So I five doesn't help us.
"E two if it was carried forward sir after this morning's discussion also doesn't help us because, as the county made clear this morning and made very clear just a minute ago, it would use such a policy, it sees its position as being to block erm the er inward investment planning terms to block it as er erm being out of tune with the county's general conservation and environmental policies."
So we really do have a problem here.
We've got the local authorities at both strategic and local scale quite keen to welcome inward investment.
We've got a an emerging altered structure plan here which as it stands doesn't help.
"And so the issue the discussion has focused on, from where I'm sitting, seems to have focused on is, you know can one afford to let loose a strategic policy and could such a policy be written in a way that it would work for inward investment attraction without being a a Trojan horse as you know letting in a lot of other nasty things."
If you go there afterwards and what they say.
Er right okay then.
"Right erm these notes are sort of based on a lecture that I went to when I was in sixth form erm and the theme for it is, Men And Women, Do We Speak The Same Language?"
Erm so first of all sounds and pronunciation.
"Er men tend to have a lower pitch on the whole, erm th they're louder and the's due to their physiological differences, erm Jacqueline  once said that, Men try to talk bigger than they are whereas women talk as though they're smaller."
Erm it's been shown that women strive for a  pronunciations and and sort of go more towards the .
"Erm some women tend to have more pitch variation and they're more emotional so they're more likely to use encouraging tones er which can sometimes be seen to be slightly patronizing, whereas boys think it's soppy to be  emotional or  expressive way, so that if you're in school and you're asking people to read out in class, erm a girl would be more likely to be more expressive, whereas a boy would be a little bit more monotonous, and just sort of read it out and not put any emotion into it."
"And go to words of meaning, erm and the descriptions of colours where men are more likely to say purple whereas women would describe it as aubergine or plum and go into more detail about the shading than the colour."
"Then erm names, babies I if a baby's christened Timothy er it gets called Timmy or Nicholas gets called Nicky, which sort of ties in with the biscuits being called bickie and horsie and doggie and all this sort of ee things that you say to babies."
"But as soon as the n the kid Nicky hits teenage years then he wants to be called Nick, whereas if the girl's been christened Nicola and she's called Nicky through her childhood, when she hits teens she's still called Nicky."
So girls don't seem to mind the ee thing whereas the the boys do.
"Erm also if you look at entertainment, like James Saville calls himself Jimmy Saville, Terence Wogan is Terry Wogan, so but then you look at people like Charlie Chaplin, when he was doing his comedian role he was c he called himself Charlie Chaplin, and when he's directing films he called himself Charles Chaplin, so maybe it's all like a bit  of a serious thing."
So maybe that implies that when  do  the kids have got that ee ending.
"Then we go to the taboo language and if you talk about when you go to the toilet, if you Everybody excuses themselves to leave and that's both men and women and then somehow you have to say where you're going, so the women are more likely to use the polite sort of euphemistic kinds of things like they'd say toilet or loo, whereas the men are more likely to say bog."
And they actually say what they do when they get there.
"Oh, younger men are more likely to use coarser tones and be more explicit erm although they wouldn't use those sort terms to their father or elder men, and the women are more likely to use euphemisms like Spend a penny, Powder your nose and things like that."
And then we go to grammar.
Women tend to use more standard forms er and men are more likely to use regional dialect forms.
"So that shows women are more status conscious and men are more Maybe could be more concerned with their macho image, and they associate the non-standard with macho image."
"Erm there is a study where they looked into erm men in the workforce and women and in the workforce and er if men worked together in factories it sort of reinforces their speech patterns, their workmates are reinforcing their speech pattern so they're more likely to use non- standard."
"And then there was a study into and area of Belfast where most of the men were unemployed and it was the women who were going out to work in the factory and it was found to be the other way round, and the women spoke more of a non-standard than the men did  when the men were staying at home."
It was the women going out to work.
Then we get use and interaction.
"Women tend to use more  questions which sort of softens the effect of what they're saying, so they'll say things like, There we go and the men say things like, Let's go."
"Erm women are more likely to use the words such as may, might, possibly, perhaps which seem to be a little less forceful."
"In turn-taking men have be shown to interrupt women more than they interrupt other men, er and then there's the use of mm."
"Erm it's been shown that men seem to er connect the word mm with I agree, that's what they use it to mean whereas the women tend to use mm as I understand."
Erm so where do these differences come from?
"They come from the way  socializes children er during the early school years, boys and girls tend to have different activity, the boys in the groups Are in groups outdoors and the girls and in tos and fros and they're sharing their little secrets and being loyal to each other and whispering away in little corners."
So that women aren't taken seriously.
So do we speak the same language?
"Yes, but with differences and we don't always  the same message."
Well they're a lot of fun and kids love them.
"As I commented a little earlier to somebody, I still haven't quite forgiven my mother-in-law for the chemistry set she bought my seven-year-old."
"He is absolutely amazed by it and spends lots of time in a garage at the back, which actually means that I spend an awful lot of time  in that garage in the cold too!"
"Yes, they are good sets and they do  they are exciting for children."
They do enjoy them and they do make good use of them.
"Quite often they need a lot of erm time spent by the parent with the child, and if the parent's happy with that they're fine."
"None of them, or very few of them, if you buy a good quality one is dangerous."
"It's very important, I think, that erm you match the age of the child to the age which is written on the box, because then the child will actually be handling materials that he can physically handle and ideas that he can physically cope with or intellectually cope with."
"So they are probably very useful erm toys, educational toys, to have in the home, but I think for the child to get the maximum from them they do  he often does require an adult with him."
How about electronic kits and circuits?
"Are they worthwhile, would you say?"
"Yes, they are; they are very much."
"Again, it's a question of matching the kit to the age of the child because some of them erm — the one we have at home, for example, plugs into the mains and although it only pushes out six or nine volts at the end the child actually does have to plug it in and, well I don't think I'd be happy if my six or seven year old was doing that, although my nine year old could cope with it quite happily."
So they are useful erm children can learn a lot.
"What I like about them and where I think their strengths are is that they do put science, the physical sciences, in that bracket of activity which is fun, excitement and leisure and enjoyment and that it moves away from the notion that it's something you do on a wet Friday afternoon at school."
"Thank you very much, Mike."
"In our series on education we've talked about many aspects of school life, including the extent to which they are open or closed societies and various features of the curriculum."
But so far we haven't said much about schools as organisations.
"Today I have with me Tony Bailey from the university; Bob Glover, who is Principal of Portslade Community College; and John Werner, who is Head of Stanley Deason High School."
"Tony, are schools today very different from the schools of the past?"
"Well I'm not sure I'm a very competent person to answer that question Brian, but I hope erm Bob and John might move to that."
My research interests are just in schools today.
I think perhaps one difference is they've become much larger and more complicated and I certainly think that parents in particular tend to expect far more of schools now than they used to.
Schools are very large and complex organisations.
"I mean there are over a thousand people, sometimes two thousand people there, and in this erm complex organisation I think headmasters are very important people; they're responsible for developing a style of organisation which is, I think, very significant."
"They influence the education of children in enormously important ways, not just in terms of how many exams they pass, what results they get at O level or C S E, but on important issues such as education for democracy, the kind of climate that schools create for young people is very important in the way they see society and they see their role in it."
"So from my point of view it's very important to have contact with head teachers and to talk with them about these things, and to create a situation in which they can talk to each other."
"Bob, are you erm head teacher in any classical sense, or are you more a manager?"
"Well I think of myself, probably arrogantly, as an educational leader, but that certainly would include management as well as being an academic."
If I can just say something about the management to start off with.
"I think sometimes people who don't actually work in schools imagine that the schools are managed, in the financial organisational sense, by the Local Education Authority, and that in some way the head of the school is merely concerned with discipline, curriculum and so on, but one has to bear in mind that the sheer size of some of these schools now makes the head a manager in a very real sense."
"I mean I have to cope with about five thousand different individuals each week erm at Portslade Community College, erm fifteen hundred full-time eleven to eighteen year olds, and the rest adults from the community coming in to use the college."
"What to do in terms of scripts, what do we physically have here that we're going to read from or not read from as the case may be."
"Erm and how we can speak to time and how we can control that time and make sure that even with interruptions which is what in a way what a meeting is about a discussion, that we're able to stick to the time that we've allocated for the particular meeting or presentation that we've got."
So if by the end of tomorrow we can say yes we've achieved all that have have we got a course?
Yep okay.
These these are a measure aren't they they're a measure of the quality of what we're going to do over the next two days and therefore I will come back to these tomorrow afternoon I will check through them and if everybody can say yes yes I'm satisfied with that then we've achieved what we set out to achieve today.
Okay Now as those of you who have been on a course will know er on a  training course one thing I particularly ask you and we all do is to be open minded.
We're here for two days and I'm going to present to what to some of you will be some new ideas some new concepts that you've perhaps never come across before.
"So I ask you to be open minded they may seem a little bit off the wall to start with, but everything that we do is done for a purpose to achieve er what we're wanting to achieve and what I do want to achieve is by the end of tomorrow is to have given you a system."
Now you might think presentation and a system do they go together?
"What I'll do is give you a system whereby even at the drop of a hat you will be able to put together a few words and speak with clarity, speak coherently and be able to put your point of view across."
"You know the situations where you're in a I don't know a meeting in some  presentation and somebody wants you to give a vote of thanks have you ever had that,I had that  Birmingham University one time."
I'm a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and er because I'm by background an electronics engineer and I was at a meeting there where a chap was giving a talk on  design express lifts you know at Northampton and the Chairman stood up and introduced doctor whoever he was sat down turned round to me in the second row and said could you give a vote of thanks at the end.
"So I'm hoping that this system that I give you will allow you to do that, anybody been a best man at a wedding?"
What do you say at a wedding.
Oh dear me so I'm hoping that the system that I give you will allow you to deal with all those situations as well as make a longer presentation where you do have some preparation time.
So be opened minded.
I take on board these ideas for these two days.
At the end of two days you say well fine but it's not for me I can't do anything about that when you walk out the room but I hope my objective is to convince you that here is something that like lots of other people in time I can  it's a very very useful system.
".. Try it out when you leave here, try it out in the meetings and the presentations that you have to make I encourage you to do that, to try it out in your day to day working and for those people who have either already been on this course or are coming on this course after you that you meet encourage them to do the same, because there's nothing like encouragement and feedback from each other to be able to use these new ideas."
And of course if you've got any questions in the two days I'm not just going to er at you all the time you know  it's participation is this so any questions that you have any comments you want to make please feel free to make them at any time it's not going to throw me.
You have a set of notes here now I'm not gonna start at page one and work right through to page whatever it is erm they are there for you to take away for you to make notes during these two days er and for you to take away so that they're they're for revision and er there are as Bob's just discovering pages where a I'll ask you to make make specific notes er that I'll supply to you as we go along.
Okay then  let me just by way of er introduction er to the concepts and the content of what we're going to do over the next two days let me just put a very small fraction of a picture up here.
I don't know if anybody's seen this before.
Anybody want to stake a month's salary on what this is a picture of?
A church
"A church, possibly yeah."
I think as I as I reveal a bit more you'll get it.
Tower Bridge
"Tower Bridge, right absolutely, yeah gives it away doesn't it?"
Now a daft question in a way but how do we know it's Tower Bridge?
seen it before
You've seen it before yeah that's right you you recognise it from the shape and and er because you've either seen pictures of it before or you've been there.
"I believe we've taken a decision on that for the health conference, last time round."
"I've got one on page eighty-one, but we'll come to it on pollution control."
"They're are some others too, chair, on the seminars and conferences we've listed."
"We can do on the way through, okay."
I think there is no urgent business.
"erm Well, as I understand it there is a report on the authorization of officers, which is urgent business."
"Ah, that's right, sorry"
"Yes, chair, and I don't have copies and, you do?"
"Well, I have some, I thought they'd gone round, but this is, erm sorry"
"Chair, it was one officer whom we've got on staff at the moment  Karen Wheeler who's away nursing her new baby, and it's to authorize that officer to carry out certain roles under the health and safety"
"Can you circulate that, the committee is accustomed to seeing it."
"I don't think it should cause you any problems, but it is something that's come on late erm as a result of maternity cover."
Right.
"Ian Waterhouse is with us, probably wondering how on earth these meetings get off the ground at all."
"Ian, you're the community services manager."
"We have a paper from you on, can we settle down a bit."
We have a paper from you on page eleven.
Can I ask you to limit yourself to some five minutes.
"I apologize for that, that, but we have a very heavy agenda, and members start falling asleep around five, and if people have questions or comments, perhaps they ."
"Welcome to our committee, and we hope we'll be working together in the future."
"Thank you, yes, erm thank you very much for inviting me to attend to those meetings and giving me the opportunity to meet you all."
"Having worked for a number of years now in community health services, previously erm in Yorkshire, in fact I've only been down in Oxford about four or five months, I've learnt how important it is in fact to make good working contacts with members and officers of other organizations, and particularly of local authority organizations."
"I'm therefore doubly grateful to you for giving me the chance to meet you today, and I hope that some of the contacts I might make today will stand me in good stead in the job that I'm doing in Oxford over the next year or so."
"I have sent round a briefing paper, and rather than go right through that, what I'd just like to do is to highlight two or three things about myself and about the post that I now hold, and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have during the next two or three minutes."
"Firstly, just to set my own context, I've been in the health service now for just over twenty year."
"I went into the service in nineteen seventy as a national trainee, and I'm therefore coming from the administrative branch of the service."
"I'm not a qualified nurse, or a health care professional."
"I'm an administrator by background, and I think that's interesting, because one of the things that we are trying to do in the health service is to open up our management posts to people of all professions, and to recognise that management is not the prerogative of any particular group, but that we're looking for the right people to manage our services from wherever they might come, and I'm one of three people who has a responsibility to the senior manager in the community at the top, for the managing on a day-to-day basis the health services in Oxfordshire."
"Of those two colleagues, interestingly enough, one is a health visitor by background, the other is a nurse, but someone who practised or hasn't practised, but as a district health community planner for a number of years."
So you can see that we have quite a mixture of people in terms of our backgrounds professionally.
"The purpose of general management is to try and ensure that in the city that we are getting the best value we can from the health resources that are in the city, and I have the authority now, and the responsibility to spend the budget that I've had allocated from the Oxfordshire Health Authority, by Gerald Simon who's the general manager."
"So a big change in the way that we are arranged has actually come about through the general management structure, and we're hoping that this will give us more room, if you like  to start looking at priorities, and to move the budget around in accordance with our feelings about those priorities."
"In a way, the most important word in the whole of that speech is probably ‘nature’—‘I feel the link of nature draw me’ because here now Adam is using the word nature as, I suppose, he would not have used it at any earlier point in the poem."
It is being used as something contrasted to God's order.
"He's already feeling that there is a counter movement in him which he is prepared to call nature, which links him to Eve and which will lead him to join Eve in her defiance of God."
We have of course got here a speech about a human bond versus a larger loyalty.
About a link of nature versus accepting your place in God's universe and obeying God's instructions.
"Milton, we could say, is here showing us the price of following God's command."
"What, once sin has entered the world, it can cost you to obey all those injunctions in the new testament about ‘I am thy father and thy mother,sell all and follow me.’"
And of course he's showing us Adam's failure to follow .
"You could even say that Milton's rejecting the future in this speech and saying I label sin what is going to become, if you have prophetic powers, new kind of ethic."
"And to justify the ways of God to men with such honesty, that is to say with such a complete account of what the price is which would have to be paid, is of course no longer to justify but to enact the actual conflict."
"It is no longer to come down on one side or other of the fence as the entire poem was so clearly designed to do, but to say following the ways of God will mean this."
"And that, of course, is why in the end, though we can all read Paradise Lost alike, and we can all in a certain sense respond to Paradise Lost alike, we must come to our final conclusions about the poem in terms of our own values."
"And for the humanist reader, for this reason Paradise Lost is really the greatest reputation of Christianity that's ever been written."
Thank you.
"This is the second in our new series of twelve programmes on opportunities in education, in which we're looking at some of the ideas in action in schools today."
"Contributors are largely from the Education Faculty at the university, and today I have with me Dr Johanna Turner, who is a Developmental Psychologist and the person who is particularly interested in development in young children."
"Jo, at what stage do you think that formal education ought to start for a child?"
"As you know, at the moment it starts and five, but ideally perhaps it could start younger, but obviously there are financial considerations as well."
"Perhaps a development of nursery education on a much greater scale, bigger scale than has hitherto been the case"
"Well, be careful what you're committing me to say."
I mean you asked me about formal education and immediately we're talking about nursery education.
Now I don't want necessarily to equate the two of them.
"I do think some formal education could start sooner, but I wouldn't want you or the listeners to think that nursery education and formal education are one and the same."
"What is the difference, basically?"
"Well I think one of the advantages of a nursery schooling is certainly a considerable amount of social interaction for the children, which very often they won't be obtaining, either if they're living in high rise flats, or at the other end of the social spectrum if their parents are living in large houses with large gardens and no other children within the vicinity."
"So I think it has a social function, as well as a formal educational function."
"Do you think that the social function comes before the formal function, or do you think they both go together?"
I think it would depend on the child.
"For some children they are more socially deprived, and yet they may be getting considerable ‘education’ in inverted commas within their home environment."
"For other children they probably are getting enough social interaction, there may be plenty of children around, but educationally, in terms of the sort of basics for education they may be extremely deprived."
I think there are many functions that it serves.
Do children develop at roughly the same rate?
Any suggestions there?
"Yes, I think that  well non-government ways, I certainly thing that we should be continuing and I think ordinary people should be continuing, as indeed they are."
"If you talk to people in the street the majority of people who have young children are certainly saying we need day care, we need opportunities for ourselves erm and are quite prepared, some of them at any rate, to go and say that to their local councillors and to write to their M Ps."
And that's perfectly clear.
"If you're talking about non-government ways to do it, then I think that in any authority there are lot of voluntary organizations struggling to make provision of this kind."
"It's increasingly difficult for the voluntary sector to make provision of this kind, to offer those opportunities without proper partnership with the state, so I don't actually accept if you're posing an alternative and saying that it's either or, I don't think that's correct."
"I think that there must be a partnership of that kind in order to offer the opportunities that people, women particularly with children, are saying they need."
"Yes, Ann Mobbs."
"One of the things we are doing during International Women's Celebrations is we're putting on a jobs and training opportunities fair, in Templar Square in the middle of Cowley Centre erm on the fifteenth of March between ten and four, so any women who want to know how they can get back to work, or what training opportunities there are available, are welcome to come."
"And also one of the things we have done is we've booked this erm Just The Job Exhibition, which we brought down from Liverpool, and it's got fifty life-size images of black and Asian women, with erm a little bit on their experiences at work, how they managed to find jobs, how they got started in their careers, and we felt that would be erm an inspiration to women coming into Cowley Centre."
"We're going to put the whole exhibition for the day there, so they can see the kinds of ways that women have got jobs and the kinds of training that they've had to get to get them."
"Well, I'm joined on the line by Audrey."
"Hello Audrey, calling from Abingdon are you?"
Yes.
"It was just a quickie, I just wanted to read this little point that I actually think brings lots of what you've been discussing about together, and it's a light hearted, but it does have some relevance if I can just say it."
"Because women's work is never done, and underpaid, or unpaid, or boring or repetitious and we're the first to get the sack, and what we look like is more important than what we do, and if we get raped it's our fault, and if we get bashed we must have provoked it, if we raise our voices we're nagging bitches, and if we enjoy sex we're nymphs and if we don't we're frigid, and if we love women it's because we can't get a real man, and if we ask our doctor too many questions we're neurotic and if we expect the community to care for our children we're selfish, and if we stand up for our rights we're aggressive and unfeminine, and if we don't we're typical weak females, and if we want to get married we're out to trap a man, and if we don't we're unnatural, and because we can't get adequate safe contraceptives, but men can walk on the moon, and we can't cope or don't want a pregnancy we're made to feel guilty about abortion, and for lots and lots of other reasons we're all part of the Women's Liberation Movement."
"Audrey, thanks very much."
"Sorry, but  all together."
Quite wonderful.
Thank you.
We've talked about the Women's Movement so far.
Let's talk about how men have changed.
"Well it's interesting, actually, because I've heard that before erm the piece that Audrey read out, and in fact erm someone in the City Council, a women in the City Council, put it on the front of her door and there was an outcry by many of the men who worked in the City Council."
They were very angry about it.
"Oh, we're getting angry men now?"
Well let's look at how men have changed.
"Brenda Thornton, do you think that men have changed very much as a result of the more forthright stance that women have been taking recently?"
"Yes, I do."
"I think erm many men have changed their attitudes erm towards women, particularly since erm men and women were educated together in colleges in their further education, because they've shared their life together before marrying, before having children, and I think young men have become much more erm domesticated, if you like, I think that's the only way to say it."
And I think that they are more willing to listen to women and to share women's duties.
I'm not saying that the world is perfect.
It's far from perfect.
Now the erm major contribution has been from the Department of Environment who have pointed us at Humberside's formulation.
"Not only is that generally helpful in being a recently approved structure plan that's been through the Secretary of State's hands, but of course it is also part of this region."
"And it is the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association that is the one that in this locality, the county, takes the lead in attracting inward investment."
Prima facie it seems to me that if erm Humberside erm finds a need for such a policy erm then the remainder of the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association area erm should also have such a policy.
So that that Association can actually employ erm the Yorkshire and Humberside area in an intelligent way and not in a divided way.
"I referred sir at the beginning to er the limited experience I've had in Nottinghamshire where erm a criteria based policy was put into a structure plan erm for er in that case for a prestige business development I think is what they call it, prestige business park, that was a criteria based policy as a way of containing, stopping this strategic issue becoming a Trojan horse for lots of other things."
And I pointed you sir to the fact that in that county at least they found that to further contain it it helped to name districts.
"What I hadn't expected was the reaction we got here today which is that erm whilst there are smiling dis , he's smiling now, there are smiling districts who might be pleased to be named as areas in which a major exception might be accommodated and I hadn't expected the others would like a bit of it if there was one going too."
"So this all suggests to me that the establishment of fierce criteria could make this a very rare exception is the key and erm I think we've had it in the course of the discussion, it'll now be on the record, erm an exploration of the kind of criteria those could be."
And erm you've got that Harrogate  goes into it in some detail.
But erm my closing remarks we be these sir that the the actual reality is that North Yorkshire and some of its districts want and deserve inward investment.
The present planning policy framework frustrates that objective and an enabling policy framework is now required.
A legitimate moment to to put it in place.
Everything we've heard today this afternoon shows the disinclination of the County Planning Department to be flexible and enabling on this matter.
It is just not their inclination.
And so it seems to me that erm we must look to you sir and Miss Whittaker to say what you feel as er independent erm hearkeners to the debate er we it's time as I would say for erm North Yorkshire now to face up to what's going on in its own territory and remove the planning obstacles to what is actually happening and just to make sure that it's safely tied up with criteria to make sure it doesn't erm erm unhappy consequences instead of the happy consequences that we are trying to achieve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr Williamson or Mr Potter the penultimate word.
Thank you.
turn to Mr Potter I think he's been dying to get back on this so
I wouldn't quite say that.
This is the precursor to the summing up.
Erm David Potter North Yorkshire County Council.
Er the position of the county council is that we remain unconvinced of a need for such a policy.
"Er the county council acknowledges that inward investment is important but because of the nature of the local economy and competition elsewhere, I think we realistically look at it in terms of er it going to provide a small contribution to the local economy."
And that's acknowledged by the Economic Development Officer.
And I would add that the Economic Development Officer also acknowledges that he must work within the strategic framework which is the policy of the county council.
"And the county council feels that it has adequately addressed the needs of the districts within the county, erm obviously that's up to the panel to determine whether you agree with that, and we believe that the strategic framework is capable of addressing any changing needs or circumstances without recourse to a policy which we feel would reduce the clarity of the structure plan."
That it?
That's it.
Thank you very much.
I question really whether or not this erm this policy is needed erm to meet local employment requirements.
I think it should be erm local councils should be able to bring their requirements from allocated sites provided they make the appropriate er provide an appropriate choice of location and size of sites erm up to the erm levels proposed in the county.
And I really do question whether the potential benefits of such such an exceptions policy really erm are worth undermining those strategic policies of conservation and restraint.
I tend to think that it should really be left outside the development plan process and it should be for individual developers to prove exceptional needs.
That way it can be dealt with through the departure process and the checks and balances the departure er introduces erm are in place erm to to protect local interest.
Do you want to come back on something or can I ask Professor Lock to
"Well  it was really er, Ken Williamson of North Yorkshire."
It was really er the point er Mr Allenby made.
"It seems to me that what we're talking about here is Harrogate's land allocation being, not necessarily an I five, but sixty hectares which he agreed was adequate for I five yesterday, plus I suspect another fifty which would be a strategic site."
Although there may be differences between er Professor Lock's approach and Harrogate's  superficially I think the the mutual objective seems to be er between the two  strategic site within the development plan in Harrogate district and on the access one site of the A one A fifty nine junction.
"Could I check out I I mean I'm still not sure whether Harrogate are happy with sixty hectares at I five to meet their requirements, that was what I understood yesterday."
Are we talking about another fifty hectares really to add on to that?
Not necessarily as I five but as another fifty hectares as industrial or employment land whatever you'd like to call it.
David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council.
I'm not sure how clearly I have to spell this out.
No we're not looking for an increase in our I five allocation.
That is not going to help in this situation.
We support the I five allocation.
What we're looking for is a new policy initiative which will allow in appropriate circumstances inward investment of er er a significant strategic nature to be accommodated within North Yorkshire and that could possibly probably be Harrogate district.
Thank you.
Professor Lock.
Sir.
Erm er four or five points.
Er  the contribution to the discussion made by Mr Jewitt of Hambleton erm is a necessary contribution but it really doesn't fit or sit well with the economic circumstances of other parts of the county.
I don't know about Hambleton but erm talking in er erm on high ground about conservation and so on erm is very difficult when a local authority is faced with structural change in its economic base and major unemployment.
I mean that is a serious social and political issue to which there should be in my submission a planning response.
We can't just ignore it erm it is proper planning to try and do something about it.
"On the second er the second point to make is that erm on the county council's end of this equation, er Mr Potter er referred us to the county's economic development strategy, I think I've got that latest edition, where he was erm attempting to tell us that the erm county's economic strategy is to attract inward investment of a small scale type."
That is indeed part of their strategy but the fact of the matter is that the county council is wholly implicated in the efforts that have been made in this erm county over the last couple of years to get large scale inward investment.
That is a factual situation which I hope Mr Allenby would be able to erm endorse it if it becomes a matter of dispute between us.
Erm the county is implicated in the search for erm er large scale investment.
"It also puts money into the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association which is wholly involved and has been for the last two years in trying to get large scale erm strategic inward investment into the county, and erm it is a erm awkwardness I think that it's best to be open about that the planning policy of the county is out of tune with the day factor activities of the economic development side of the of the county council."
It's about because the company after all is you it's a group of people and so er it's about putting over the right image so quality presentation to a client  the image.
What's the value to you as individuals?
More confidence
"It gives you more confidence, yeah, what's it do for you within the company?"
Pushes your standing up
oh that's what I thought yeah yeah yes
well I mean you're right in a way Bob  those people who seem to get on within a company some of them are people who seem to be able to say the right words at the right time don't they?
They seem to be able to put their point of view over.
They they're able to by by the way they present themselves they're able to demonstrate their value within the organisation and as Bob says hopefully then it increases your status.
Yeah although the tape's on I'll still say  I'll still say I mean there are people within the company as within any company I'm sure who you when you get to know their technical ability or lack thereof you think well how have they managed to get where they have but they just seem to be able they seem to have this ability to be able to be in the right place at the right time.
Well yes but also say the right words at the right time yeah? yep.
So being able to present effectively and put your point of view across is very important within within the company context for the company in order to to project the right image and also to pro project your own right image.
"To show your value, to demonstrate your worth for the organisation."
Now as you probably know this is a level nine course it's a it's a course on which a platform is erected for other courses as Gordon said then the the introduction to management you have to make a short presentation don't you but it doesn't concentrate just on this.
This concentrates on it but builds builds the platform on which other courses on advanced presentation skills and negotiation skills team presentation skills are all founded and so you're able to er continue through er the courses.
"Now we we just mentioned Tarmac's Tarmac's objectives let's just go through them er after the course you should be able to make clear logical and well organised case presentations, fine."
"er you should be able to display more confidence, I mean that's what Mike suggested it gives you more confidence to be able to do this."
"To make more effective preparation for speaking, to maintain a higher standard of discussion at all times and to display a more positive reaction to questions."
Okay so those are the objectives that Tarmac have.
"Now I hope that by tomorrow afternoon you're able to say yes all those objectives have been met but it may well be and I'm sure it is that you as individuals have other objectives, you have other issues that you want to address er or put more emphasis on during these two days."
So what I'd like you to do if you just turn to page one sort of a couple of pages in the first one that's numbered.
You'll have the opportunity to write down your objectives.
"You see towards the bottom er we pose a few questions there, I'm going to ask you in a few minutes to introduce yourselves and to say what what sort of presentations you make at the moment."
Now don't think in terms of presentations just as standing up in front of an audience.
"It may well be that you don't actually do that, it may be that you have one to one meetings with people or group meetings er which could be when you have to put across your point of view."
Those could be classed as presentations.
"So when was the last time you made a presentation and then what I'd like you to do and there are three lines there you may only have one you may have two, three, four objectives"
just spend a couple of minutes now and jot down what it is you would like to get out of this course by tomorrow afternoon what you would like to say you've achieved on this course.
Just just er pop those down.
"Right, erh what I'd like to do then is er I say could you just introduce yourself or what you're working on at the moment where you work and then the sort of presentations that you make er and then give us one of your objectives so that by the time we've got right round the room we'll er hopefully have everybody."
Tony would you start us off?
erm I work for
it's true
it's absolutely true and this shaking is the limbs are ready to spring into action one way or another and this gland injects adrenalin
"or sorry it sends a signal to the adrenal glands which sit on the top of the kidneys yeah, and pumps adrenalin into the blood which again is something that makes you ready and that's what all these things about about a dry throat a wonky voice a shaking limbs is all about a very primitive instinct of fight or flight."
Now trying to think of a situation where you might come up here and have no nerves whatsoever.
I mean I know it's difficult
When nobody else is here
Sorry
When nobody else is here
When nobody else is here but I mean one definition of that is that you're asleep yeah.
If there's no sort of arousal of any sort yep.
Let's just plot a graph  When we stand up here we're wanting to perform right we're wanting to do an activity  we have some level of anxiety.
Now we've just said there needs to be some level somewhere if you're right down this end of the curve here you're either asleep or dead  so there's some peak performance at some level of anxiety or arousal and as the anxiety increases the performance drops off.
Okay.
But you have to have some level of arousal has to be something pumping round you round your blood your brain has to be working in some way to be able to perform.
So we have some peak okay at which we are performing.
"Right down this other end of the curve the level of anxiety is so high that performance is zero, that's when you freeze."
"I mean there was a classic case a couple of years ago of a lady who was pushing a baby in a pram across a zebra crossing and as she was half way across out of the corner of her eye she saw a truck thundering towards her which was quite clearly wasn't going to stop and that you know a sort of fairly anxious situation, and she froze."
She could not move.
She absolutely could not move because her level of arousal was so high she had no performance her performance being walking in that case
"Well  but I mean that's an example and as I say at this end where you've no arousal you're either asleep or dead, there's no sort of performance performance of any sort and we talk about having those butterflies in the stomach don't we?"
We talk about the butterflies and that that's to do with this this effect of the the adrenalin in the system.
Now the professional presenter is the one who can get them to fly in formation .
"It's it's not about being able to get rid of them totally and we agree that we need some sort of level of arousal it's being able to perform despite them to use that arousal to put into an effective presentation, and that's what this two days is about is getting those butterflies for you to fly in formation."
To be able to actually present effectively whilst still having those butterflies whilst still having that that slightly anxious feeling.
"I get it, I get it every time I come into one of these but I I hope that I've got it in got them in formation."
"Now the purpose of therefore of this training course and any any training course is to do this  is to be able to handle the arousal and increase your level of performance and even get the peak to move that way so for any level of arousal you're getting better performance but you're also able to handle a bit more butterflies a bit more of the nerves in order to perform effectively, and apart from a training course like this how do you achieve that?"
Experience
"Experience, which is based on"
Practice
"practice, doing it yep."
"So when I said to Bob this morning was it Bob, I said don't I don't have a magic wand that's gonna get rid of them but what I hope I'm gonna give you over these two days is a system whereby you can use that and can support you so you're able to effectively present despite having the nerves and be able to put over your point of view effectively, yeah?"
How do you feel about that  yeah okay.
Er what is necessary for me to also convey to you is that the theme that I was given today was one of forgiveness .
Er  the only difference between the situation now and the situation when I was a teacher is that there are a lot of Christians in this room per square metre than there would have been in a school where I taught  and that  applies to where I work now er because er  the number of Christians who are around me in in the workplace are actually even smaller I guess  and er that may be something that er you will need to recognise is an unusual feature of your school life and that er as you leave school so you're going to go into very different environments where people behave very differently.
When a colleague discovered that I was coming here to do this er she saw it as laughable  and she also saw it as something that I would prefer to keep quiet from my colleagues and tried a bit of moral blackmail on me as well to say I'm going to tell them about that if you don't them about this sort of thing.
Er  to contact when you're talking about forgiveness er well that was just the end you know  that point.
Life isn't always like that for me and there are times when I do have
Christians around me when I am  on Sundays and on Sundays I'm often involved in my own church with er preaching appointments and for me when I'm preaching the  the good news that is the heart of  is actually one of forgiveness.
"I know from my own life of faith that my thoughts, my words and my  often fail to match up to the Christian ideal  there is much that I do that hurts other people and there is much that I do that does not reflect Christ."
The Christians good news is that guilt and shame that I have of such behaviour is actually taken away from me.
"I don't deserve that forgiveness, but the God who loves me who has actually died on the cross for me has actually taken all of that away and more than that has made me new, has actually raised me as a new life with him."
I've been lifted out of my selfishness.
"Now you think that because I am  I am forgiven and I preach forgiveness that I would be pretty good as  up people, but that's part of my human failure  and I must admit that I've given plenty of opportunity to practice at home and at work er the opportunity to forgive, but it doesn't come easily  and certainly it isn't a strong feature of the non-Christian world in which I work and which you will be working soon."
Forgiveness is not a strong feature of life.
"You've been brought up in a television age and  you've been particularly been brought up in an age of card cartoons and soap operas and in all of those you would er expect to see good being oppressed that's part of the plot in every cartoon there is a plot in every soap opera, that the good  the good people actually end up in difficult situations  and the way that results in the cartoons and in the soap operas is usually find revenge or punishment."
Let me give an example Dirty Den got his comeuppance in Eastenders  erm the Road Runner always er wants er always manages to get that crafty bull er to the follies of his own tracks.
It's all to do with revenge and punishment rather than with forgiveness.
"The only trouble with storylines like that is that life is for more complicated er we may want to see justice be done, we may want to see virtue being rewarded, we may want to see er all of those things happen, but when we make mistakes  when we make mistakes, when we are not virtuous, we actually end up not being too keen, but justice should be applied straight away."
"We actually want mercy, we want forgiveness, we want leniency."
"I've got on the tape here a song which is by Manny Fryer he used to sing in Steel Ice Band er now I know that that's sort of very old hat, I'm sorry, but I sort of live in the past and er this er I I believe also that  these days so that er you know I can sort of justify that  but this is a song that er she has sung which er reminds us that each of us has the potential to commit the crime  I'll try not to play it fast forward, let's see how we go."
.consider today and it's two things.
"I'm inviting you to consider how far a Christian should go in forgiving and to how far a Christian organisation like this school should go, in showing forgiveness  er I just want to kick you off with one or two points on each of those."
That  I  On the first point about us and our own showing of forgiveness.
"Jesus himself has  things to say, for example his disciples asked him how many times should I forgive somebody else."
"I was actually looking at you before I came in, but just come out here for a second  There are two ways I can hurt you."
Actually there's probably  probably three ways that I can hurt you.
One way I can hurt you is physically all right?
And another way I can hurt you is er mentally  and the third way I can hurt you is by combining the two together.
All right?
But I think that basically there's either two or three ways that each one of us has the ability to hurt somebody else.
You've been doing it to each other all the time  but if I were to hurt you or if anybody else here were to hurt you physically or mentally  how many times would you forgive them?
"If they did it once, would you forgive them?"
Yes.
"Yeah, probably."
In ret in terms of inward investment the economic development strategy focuses on inward investment it has a role to play.
Er without suitable sites and premises inward investment cannot succeed since inquiries cannot be converted into jobs.
And the county council will actively promote key sites to potential inward investors.
It will seek to attract further inward investment based upon its strengths and by bioscience.
Whilst inward investment
Can you can you submit that?
I I can certainly.
Essentially what it's talking about it inward investment on small scale.
Inward investment which could be accommodated within the existing plans existing strategies on existing sites.
And in fact at the greenbelt  plan inquiry er er I I spent a considerable amount of time arguing on the issue of prestige sites and the availability of prestige sites within the greater York area already planned and available.
Er I think the county council recognizes the role of inward investment but that it is a small part of the ec economic growth.
"In fact the revised economic development strategy which Professor Lock probably doesn't have a copy of, refers to inward inward investment as being desirable erm and is of critical importance but whilst it will be vigorously sort in this way it has to be said that the bulk of North Yorkshire suffers from a relative lack of financial incentives from Central Government in terms of whose regional policy does not have a  priority."
Even when North Yorkshire sites have been short-listed by an investor on quality grounds the county has had no means of matching the financial incentives elsewhere.
And I think the er inward investors that Professor Lock is referring to in terms of the German car manufacturer er the information that we have is that those were the very factors they considered and erm North Yorkshire is not short- listed.
Erm we have not perceived that inward investment of this scale is required or that the economic structure of the county could support such a major investment.
It is based on small firms.
And I  look at issues much broader that the sites availability.
Availability of labour erm the structure of the labour force.
Now in terms of Harrogate for example that is largely focused on erm on the office commercial sector.
There is no obviously er pool of manufacturing labour or erm strong manufacturing base sufficient to support a firm coming in and and taking up these large quantities of land.
I mean why should this be in  there'd be a strategic sites policy.
It's it's not necessarily possible to generate jobs from with within its own boundaries.
I mean the focus of the plan and the way we've approached erm trying to identify the appropriate level of of land takes into account all that we considered to be the needs of the local economy.
And I think this inward investment that Professor Lock is referring to and the scale of investment that he is referring to must be considered as additional and and would draw in additional jobs.
I think that's all I I'd like to say on that for the moment.
Any one else want to participate in this discussion?
Mr Allenby.
Thank you Chairman.
Er David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council.
Erm obviously the borough council strongly advocates the the principle of a strategic exceptions policy and I think there there is some difference between what Professor Lock is advocating and what the borough council is advocating.
From a planning point of view we're advocating that there should be a criteria based policy within the structure plan.
"Er we're not seeking a er a side based initiative if you like as such, although that might come later."
"Goodey making a change for the benefit of the scheme members paying into a scheme, rather than employers going away in a contribution holiday."
Now is there any other er pension funds that do likewise or have any other  experiences as far as surpluses are concerned?
"I I find  issue with one point in the Good Report, when he mentioned that a surplus is a notional surplus, it cannot crystallize until the fund actual close down."
"If it is in fact a notional surplus, then why is the employer allowed to take money out of that notional surplus, he's taking real money out of from a notional surplus, it should not be allowed."
"told you didn't he that the  surplus the only way one would know there was a surplus there was when the fund was closed, when every pensioner had been paid  money left."
But in view of the fact that different actuaries can come to different answers and Professor Good quotes one where a difference of half per cent gives rise to a difference of a hundred and sixty seven million.
How does one know and I accept Professor Good's point what the exact amount of that surplus is.
"There may be in fact a deficit, and yet we still allow the employer to take money out."
"Now if we're saying you cannot ascertain this surplus, then why is the employer allowed to take money out?"
Right.
B T?
Would you like to respond to Jimmy's question?
"Well we were disappointed in the Good Report because er they did say it was one of the major issues, and yet they said that they didn't think any sweep in changes are needed which rather erm contradicted the earlier part of our report, we would have thought there were erm changes needed."
A group of our  here is largely actuarial surpluses and one doesn't really know whether there's a surplus  things keep changes.
The actuaries go to the employer to find out what their plans are.
British Steel how you go that answers a really good way of putting it.
Thank you very much.
Well British Steel adopted a somewhat more subtler tactic er they make a strong point of the fact that no money has ever been removed from the scheme despite the presence of a six hundred  surplus.
"What they did is took half and used it to reduce their contributions and it was a large reduction, it was a reduction from twelve to currently five per cent."
"Er okay, different words to describe the same and indeed they didn't take  out of any fund, but they achieved the same end result."
Jimmy?
"Well if this is the case then you don't see that any recommendations in Goodey would stop that kind of thing happening and if you don't see that, what recommendations would you make to the Committee that Goodey should put any report that would stop that kind of thing happening."
"Well the fear of boring you because I've said it before, I think that either a Trustee made up of an equal balance of members from the various interested groups which is very difficult to achieve in practice  and additionally independent trustees certainly in our case, we believe would have stopped it happening  because the movements in the direction it went was clear  now that we have the information in front of us to the Trustees, it was quite clear what was gonna happen and nothing was done about it."
"Now we didn't have a voice, remember we were never even informed before or until two years later after the event that it had happened."
There are still British Steel pensioners from the old scheme who genuinely do not know that there exists a new scheme.
Do you not believe that with this recommendation where
Goodey has said that the regulator has got to give his approval that would stop that?
The problem there I would suggest is the timescale between the things happening and it getting to the regulator and being digested.
In the present
"didn't understand the two years, I mean he would have told the regulator."
Yes.
"Erm  whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained, they would I suggest be able to smell out very quickly any malpractice and would have  straight to the regulator, if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it."
Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear compels me to disturb your season dew.
"For Lucidas is dead, dead 'ere his prime, young Lucidas and hath not left his peer."
Who would not sing for Lucidas.
He knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme.
He must not float upon his watery bier unwept and welter to the parching wind without the mead of some melodious tear.’
It is in a way saying the same thing as the preface to The Reason of Church Government.
"‘Reluctant as I am, I must lay aside other tasks and do this one.’"
"I presume that the  before the mellowing year, the premature moment at which he's dedicating himself is of course a personal reference concerning his own youth."
"But the difference is that the degree to which Milton is speaking in his own person seems so much less in the poem, doesn't it?"
It's almost a kind of professional remark.
He's writing as the poet.
"If I do it for Edward King, somebody will do it for me."
"Indeed, it's not only the writer who is depersonalised, but also the subject."
"It's not Edward King, the man who was actually drowned and whom, as it happens, Milton hardly knew, it's Lucidas, the figure of the young poet, priest, put to some extent on a classical model that he is writing about."
"Lucidas, I suppose, more than any other poem of Milton's, and indeed I suppose more than any other poem in English, Lucidas shows us that there doesn't have to be a conflict between personal involvement and formal rhetoric."
"Though  the very fact that it is so traditional and so formal a poem in the pastoral tradition, held in the tightness of all the conventions that it employs, not only allows, but in some strange way makes possible, the intensity of personal feeling that it contains."
"For instance, erm when he speaks the fact that the young man was cut off in his prime, perhaps the most famous passage of the lot ‘Alas what boots it with incessant care to tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade and strictly meditate the thankless muse."
"Were it not better done as other use to sport with Amaryllis in the shade, or with the tangles of Nayera's hair.’"
"Writing poetry is presented in the wholly artificial diction of tending the shepherd's trade, or in a Latinism that is not even correct, colloquial, normal English in meditating the thankless muse."
"The lures of sex, relaxation, all the things that distract you from your high heroic task, are in the form of nymphs with Latin names."
"It's hard to imagine anybody writing more artificially, but I hope you feel, as I do, there can hardly be a piece of poetry in which the distress of the poet and the feeling that he may be wasting his time comes through in a more anguished fashion."
"And since I am raising this question of the universalizing and the depersonalizing of egoism as it becomes poetic dedication in poetry, I'd like to do this by offering you a contrast, and I choose as my contrast Alexander Pope, another poet who was obsessively concerned with his own role as a poet — in his satires in this case."
"He spent a good deal of time in his satires, presenting himself as a satirist — unplaced, unpensioned, no man's heir or slave he proudly describes himself as he tells us that he's willing to lash out at even the most eminent public figures."
"It's impressive, in a way, as an assertion of poetic independence."
But it's almost impossible to separate it from thinking of Alexander Pope the man.
‘I will or perish in the generous cause.
"Hear this and tremble, you who scape the laws."
"Yes, while I live, no rich or noble maid shall walk the world in credit to his grave.’"
"I'm not very sure it's prudent if you're indicating your own incorruptibility as a poet to put it in the future tense in the first place, and when you continue as Pope does ‘Envy must own, I live among the great’ as he starts to describe his own life and you realise he's bringing in touches about himself which really have very little to do with the particular role as poet, it becomes quite clear that that depersonalisation process has not taken place in the case of Pope."
"erm I suppose the very extreme of such self-satisfaction is in the epilogue to Pope's satires, where he actually tells us ‘Yes, I am proud."
I must be proud to see men not afraid of God afraid of me.’
"Hence rhyme, you can see, is a two-edged weapon in the hands of a poet."
Thanks very much indeed John.
Conference accept S O C report number three?
"Agreed, thanks very much."
"Colleagues I'd just like to put one of er John's themes and that is that for the next couple of days we've got a hell of a lot of business to get through and er we've done quite well so far but er I would certainly be looking where possible colleagues for formally seconding er, as often as possible, if not all the time and I really appreciate your er your assistance in that regard because we have a great deal of business to get through in the next two days."
"We can do it, you can do it, I know that and er so if we all act with a bit of restraint, we'll get through."
The other point is I gave you an undertaking yesterday to come back to you on the reschedule of the programme in respect of items that have fell of the agenda during the course of the week.
"Now what I'm proposing to do is to issue a revised programme in respect of the afternoon session this afternoon, which will take in some of the business that er has has already fell off which would be at the end of the private session this afternoon so we'll try and get in er rule twenty Regions in their Manage and their Management which will take in three motions, thirty six, thirty seven and forty and then we'll turn, hopefully, to the Social Security Payments Resolutions, you'll remember that they fell off, composite two eight three, motions three seven nine, three eight five and three eight six."
"Er, equally colleagues, I intend to try and take er key  national officers' report during the course of this morning."
"You'll recall that the key fell off the agenda as well, earlier or should I say, wasn't very painful."
Should I say the report fell off the agenda.
"So that's what, that's the way I'm hoping that we can proceed, as I say, yes with your assistance and then if we can get through that business, then equally tomorrow morning, we'll be doing a similar thing,we we'll issue another revised programme which will er take in some of the outstanding stuff that's fell off."
Yes.
"President, congress, Denise , South Western Region."
"As important as those motions are, we have also missed some very important ones which I think should take priority."
"On page six of our agenda there are congress organization motions which clearly need to be discussed some time during this congress because they concern rule amendments, and if they do fall off the agenda because debate is long on the other things, I really do believe they should take priority because we won't be raising them for another three years."
There's also on page ten the motions regarding timing of congress which clearly concerns next year and I do believe that these should have priority.
Right I think you have missed the point or may not have understood how we deal with the business of this congress.
"Nothing at this congress falls off the agenda, nothing."
"Unlike some union conferences, some business is not taken, but this conference all business is taken."
"All business is taken, so that particular, those particular items that you've referred to I am already seeking to schedule that business for tomorrow, but I don't want to preempt the situation and chance my arm any further than what it is, because I could end up falling on my face and I want to try and avoid that."
"But I could assure you colleagues that business will be taken, okay?"
Right thanks very much indeed for that colleagues.
"Now, it's now my pleasure to welcome on your behalf Chris  the Secretary of Portsmouth Trades Council."
"Chris has been Secretary for Trades Council for ten years, he's a W E A tutor, that's his er profession, he's an organizer, and he organizes courses throughout Hampshire and the Isle of Wight."
"More recently I understand that Chris has had er had a very interesting, made a very interesting study of the French trade union movement, that must have been fascinating."
"Erm, difficult job, difficult part of the world for the trade union movement."
"For his sins he's a Member of E M E S A, but we won't hold that against him!"
Just a very warm welcome on behalf of the G M B please address our conference.
Thank you Dick.
"Actually the last time I was stood up on a platform and did this was in front of erm a S G T congress in Dieppe and I tell you I had to do it in French, and it was much  more difficult so I'm hoping this one will go smoothly, but I, what I'd really like to do is begin with is offer you erm delegates and platform both, a very very warm welcome from the trade union movement in Portsmouth."
We're absolutely delighted that you're here in Portsmouth for your congress and it's very very important to us and I think perhaps I'd take a little bit of time to explain why it's important.
The first thing is erm those of you that know this area will know that it's er not like the rest of Hampshire er leaving aside Southampton.
Mm.
"wouldn't you, I mean, not as so  best way to figure out what they were repressing, but just, I mean wouldn't you need to really have the whole life in front of you"
You would.
to figure out?
"I mean, we urgently  certainly we can psychoanalyse a group, you know, the group psy the group psychology, because we all understand how groups act, and we can say, oh, yes groups act like that, you do act like that, that makes sense and that can prove it, you know."
"But with, with a man, I mean, you really need to have every single incident in his life, to, to really know what"
That is absolutely true.
"Yes, this is another big problem  I think you put that very well, that people forget, of course, that in clinical psychoan analysis the analyst has a vast amount of data, because the patient is going five times a week, or in Freud's case, six times a week, for fifty minutes every day, six days a week, nine months of the year, often for several years and er, the, the sheer amount of data that the analyst gets, is absolutely immense."
"I mean, I can well recall in my own analysis with , of course, for the first six months she said nothing, and I used to get very frustrated, and say, look, what do you think of this?"
"What's your interpretation, she would say, oh, we don't know enough yet."
She said I'm not sure.
We'll have to wait and see.
"And for about six months, I didn't get anything."
"When interpretations were offered to me, she said so and so, and I said, why, and then she was ready."
"She said there was this female, that  the other thing, and there was a whole long list of things  that pointed to this interpretation, and it was all part of a, as you say a great mass of data, that erm, is, is quite mind-bogglingly large, if you actually erm, see it in words."
"Erm, it's very difficult, of course, to er, well it's impossible actually, to turn that into er written accounts."
"Because of course if you were to tape record analytic sessions, it would change that nature of the, of the analysis."
"And er, one of the big scientific problems with psychoanalysis is that privacy and confidentiality are prominent, as obviously in other areas of science, you can er, the demonstration has to be in public, as it were ."
"I mean, other people can do the experiment or repeat it."
"Trouble with an individual psychoanalysis, it can never be."
"So one of the big problems with an historical figure, is that erm, you don't even have that much data to go on, the data you have is gonna inevitably be, be selective and limited."
"Again I think if Freud and Bullitt were here today, they'd say, well look we did, in fact, have quite a lot of data, because I, Bullitt knew Wilson intimately for several years and worked with him, and er, Freud had rarely the stuff in erm, in all papers of Woodrow Wilson in the library of Congress or wherever they were, and he had a great deal of data."
"But even so, 's point is a good one, that there isn't, there's seldom if ever enough  this is a small problem in psychoanalysis, I myself hope to put right to some extent, and some of you may live long enough to see this happen, I hope you will."
"Er, that's why I'll tell you all, I even tell young people."
"There's no point in telling old people, because they'd be dead."
"But erm, there are one or two interesting exceptions to this, and one exception is myself, because er, I started analyzing myself through maybe to nineteen sixty nine, and with one or two small exceptions, like when I was being analyzed by  and I didn't like it, with any doubt, my entire analysis was being written down."
"Erm, I guess now in fact, erm er, last few years is all er, is all er entered in data on computer."
"And it's my intention to keep up this analysis, er, for as long as it takes, probably to the end of my life."
"And that er, on the centenary of my birth, which will fall in two thousand and forty six, my heirs and executors will be free to er, release it to the world, on condition, however, that it's published complete and unexpurgated and unedited."
"In other words, if you're gonna have personal , you're gonna, it, you can't allow somebody to edit us out, as it were."
"And er, if and when it's published, there will be millions of words, I mean there are now, and I don't how large it is now, it's impossible to tell how large, erm, but just a couple of years, for example, amounts to over a quarter of a million words, so if you run that back to nineteen sixty nine, you see it is going to be one of the largest books ever written."
"And it maybe, if it's ever published, while we're still here in two thousand and forty six, and my executors do as I hope they will, erm, you know, it will be a book alongside Samuel Pepys, and Casanova and Saint Augustine, it's that length."
So there position in nineteen forty nine wasn't re in effect all that secure cos
No.
of the personnel that
Right.
"I mean th th th th they were on the way to military security, but were they going, they, they, they recognized they had to carry the population with them."
"I think there, there was a genuine democratic element to this that, that it,i i i it wasn't going to be forcible socialism, it was going to be socialism which would come naturally because that would be what the population wanted."
Mm.
"And that, that would come  gradually."
"Well you, you could do the sort of token gesture of giving them the land like they did in the past, at least that's showing what some sort of  communism"
"In order to get the support, yes, and to or in order to end feudalism, which was, was the, the priority."
After that it's anybody's guess.
Okay.
"Let's, let's have a look at the, the document"
So have you all got one you can  you can see ?
"So, article one    feudal exploitation by the landlord class shall be abolished and the system of peasant land ownership shall be introduced in order to set free the rural productive forces, develop agricultural production and thus pave the way for new China's industrialization ."
"So that the, the, the two main aims are, are stressed there, you are gonna end feudal exploitation  and you are going to create a new system which will set free the force of rural production in order to pave the way for new China's industrialization."
"So for, for the first time  the revolution is given an economic goal in that it is to set up industrialization  and in a sense  the ending of feudalism and the creation of industrialization emerge as, as the two forces whereas up until now it has been feudalism perhaps egalitarianism."
"So it's  we, we've already, that, that already has changed significantly."
"Er you've then got a series on  confiscation  confiscation and retribution of land, so article two, land, draught animals, farm implements and surplus grain the landlords  surplus houses  shall be confiscated."
"other, other property shall not be confiscated so you're gonna take all the land, animals, implements from the landlords, you're gonna take their surplus grain, their surplus houses into the countryside but, but nothing else you, you're gonna take from landlords."
"Er you're gonna take in rural land belonging to, to shrines, temples, monasteries, churches, schools, organizations etcetera etcetera etcetera   industry and commerce shall be protected from infringement, industrial and commercial enterprises operated by landlords  and the land and properties used by landlords to  greater industrial  shall not be confiscated  erm you, you're worried that if you confiscate them they're simply broken up between people and those productory forces are disbanded."
"So  you, you, you're taking  landlords farm assets, but you're not taking their industrial, commercial or urban assets at all."
"And then er revolutionary armament d dependents, farmers, workers, staff  professional workers, peddlers and others who rent out small pro portions of land because they're engaged in other occupations, or because they lack the labour power, shall not be classified as landlords."
If the average per capita of land held in such  does not exceed two hundred percent of the average per capita land held in the locality it shall remain untouched.
So there's a group within the village that you are going to allow to own twice  the average
So you're enshrining inequality within it.
Is there a  a sort of suggestion of reward here?
You know there's some tenants
"Well, er sure but what about  commercial workers and peddlers  and others who"
But there's already inequality by not stripping the landlords of anything but
Yeah.
"Tt  and then we come to rich peasants, land owned by rich peasants and cultivi cultivated by themselves or hired labour and their other properties shall be protected from infringement."
Can you say that all three year olds are roughly the same?
"You can say that three year olds are more like other three year olds than, say, thirty year olds would be like other thirty year olds, and the younger the child the more true that is, so that would be much more true at age a year, assuming that there aren't any physical defects or mental defects, than say at three."
"So by three, yes, there is some variation, but they are certainly  there is less variation than you would get at the end of the secondary school or university."
And are there quite specific stages that one can recognise perhaps as a developmental psychologist which take place at roughly particular times in a child's development?
Very broadly.
Could you give me some idea of what these might be in the very early years perhaps?
"Perhaps I could, but whether I should is a different point."
"I feel that once parents begin to become too aware of norms, they worry, and therefore unless a child is grossly out of sync, if you like, with their peers, I wouldn't say it would matter, but yes, one would expect a three year old to be talking at one extreme."
"If there is no speech by three, indeed if there is no speech earlier than that, it might be very important to check that the child is not deaf."
"I think also you would expect children who are really quite young, well before the first year, to be showing social interest in other adults around, and if they're not it might be worth checking that there isn't some problem with the child."
But generally speaking I'm not very happy about norms.
Oh well we won't press you on that  particular point then.
"There's been a lot of publicity recently about parents teaching their own children, rather formal things."
"There have been one or two stories about youngsters who've become  reached a very high level in mathematics, for example."
Are you in favour of parents teaching their own children?
"Well can I come to that in a minute, because you said something I'd like to pick up."
"You said the child may not be developing in the way the parent expects the child to develop, and I think that it's very important for parents to check out their expectations."
"If they are expecting something that they haven't got, it may well be that their expectation is wrong."
"What is important is the child that they have in front of them, and to learn to understand that child."
"It's not it's brother or sister, or their brother or sister, it is unique, and it's pattern of development, although of course it will be broadly similar to other children, exactly like no other child, and in a sense I would feel that the parental job is to judge very carefully the needs and the developmental cycle of their own child, and then stimulate to the extent that that child needs."
"Now having said that, of course, I've almost answered the other question, that I just do not believe there are any rules."
"I mean maybe you're thinking of the sort of publicized cases of a nine year old, I believe it was, who's got A levels in mathematics."
"I would not want to say that I could criticise that parent, because I don't know the background of it."
"I would very much hope that other parents would not feel that they ought to be doing to the same thing, unless their circumstances were very similar."
"If you have a child who appears to show a talent at one thing, then of course it's natural to let the child do what it enjoys doing, but that might be the very moment for saying well what is this child not talented at and ensuring that this child gets some experience of the kind of world that it not part of its own talents, so I would feel, from my own point of view and as a psychologist, that if you have a child who is very talented in mathematics, then fine, it's going to be quite good at mathematics one would assume, now's the time to say well is it as equally talented in music?"
Are there other things that could develop?
Has it got erm a wide social relationship with other children?
So that at the end of the day one has a much more rounded individual with of course specific talents.
I'm not for holding back children.
"I think parental anxieties are something with which one must have great sympathy because very often the anxiety is not so much an anxiety about the child, it's an anxiety about the parent."
If they have had difficulty in school they will worry that their child is having difficulty in school.
"Now of course it may be that the child has caught a worry about schooling from the parent, but I think that's the first thing to sort out — is this really a problem in the child, or is it a problem in the parent's mind?"
"Well that would be an error, because it's actually Canberra, but you could be, you yo that's, that's a mistake er, that anybody could make."
"However, erm, thinking that er, one day, er, you might marry erm, a prince or princess, Freud says is an, is an illusion, in the sense that er, people do sometimes marry princ princes and princesses, it could happen, it's not very likely to happen  to any particular individual who might have that wish, but it could happen."
"Erm, as we know does happen."
"Not for long actually , but it does happen."
"Erm, so that's an illusion, a delusion, in other words, an illusion is something that could happen, but the difference between an illusion and an error, is an error is just a cognitive mistake, an illusion is a cognitive mistake that is kept going by a wish."
"An, an illusion, erm, presupposes that there is some kind of er, of wish er,under underlying it."
And the wish keeps the illusion going as it were.
"A delusion, on the other hand, is a, is a much more serious kind of factual error in which the element of wish fulfilness becomes so strong that it won't countenance any evidence against it."
"So a delusion is something that people insist on believing, erm, no matter what."
"For example, erm, in erm, paranoia, delusions of persecution where people believe that   is plotting against them, and no matter what you do, erm, you know if you said well look, we can prove to you we are not plotting against you, the paranoic says to you, why do you want to prove this to me, if it's not true, you know."
You can't win.
Not against a delusion.
"So Freud is not saying religion is a delusion or an error, he's saying it's an illusion, and it's an illusion because it's a factual mistake maintained by wish fulfilment."
"It's a factual mistake, of course, because er, there aren't in fact deities looking after us in the way there were parents in, in childhood."
"Our parents after all, were, were real people."
They actually existed.
"Whereas erm, divinities exist only in people's er, hopes or imaginations."
"They don't er, you can't see them in the same way you could go and see your parents."
"And er, this illusion is maintained according to Freud, because of the wishes that people have."
"These wishes go straight back to childhood, and  so religion represents a transference from childhood and a kind of emotional infantilism in which people try and make out that they're still children, as it were, even though they, even though they really aren't."
"And then of course, the other characteristics that go with religion, and that he had emphasized in other books on Totem and Taboo, like guilt, the feeling that you ought to obey the moral commands  of the parents, because after all the parents weren't just benevolent entities who looked after you and rewarded you and praised you, but they were your judges and censors as well ."
"They punished you when you did  the wrong thing, and they rewarded you when, when, when they did, when you did the right thing."
"So the believing in religion with, with moral codes, particularly in those religions which have rather strict moral codes, and demand quite a lot from the believer, in terms of adherence to the er, to the moral law  even those religions can be explained in terms of Freud's transference theory, because that too, comes from childhood."
"The thing that you have to obey, if you don't obey you will be punished."
"That too, is a transference from the childhood situation, where the child is under the authority of the parent."
"In adult life the, the, the authority of religion stems from this, from this transference effect."
"Now here of course, and, and by now we've reached the closing pages of the book, though it's actually quite a short book, erm, it doesn't take very long to read."
"Here, Freud in terms of paradox, because on the one hand, he started out asking the problem of order."
"How is order possible, and answered it in part, by saying, well, religion is a civilizing order creating force."
"In the next step of the argument, he then said, well, religion is a transference, and therefore a form of infantilism, so now he seems to be criticizing religion, but if he's criti criticizing religion by saying it's an illusion, surely he's jeopardizing civilization, because the danger, as he points out in the book, if you take religion away from people, you say, look, this is just an illusion, God doesn't exist."
The ten commandments are just a myth  it carries no more force whatsoever.
"Might the consequence of that be, that people then  go out and murder and steal and rape and  fight wars, and do all, do all these kinds anti-social things?"
The sail is just flapping and there's no drive in it.
It's flapping freely.
To start sailing we simply pull in the rope that controls the sail that's the mainsheet.
Then we can sail off on a reach in either direction just as we saw Suzanne doing.
Now let's watch that again.
"From the basic  two position, we pull in the mainsheet, we start sailing away on a reach, the wind is blowing directly across the boat and we accelerate away."
"Now to start sailing closer towards the wind, we need to pull in the mainsheet, pop the daggerboard down and then turn the boat gently towards the wind, we reach the point where even with the sail sheeted in tightly, the front edge, the luff of the sail is still flapping, that's as close to the wind as we can get and so we maintain a course to keep the sail full."
Now we're sailing at about forty five degrees to the wind.
"We're on the edge of what we call a no go area, if we try to sail any closer to the wind the boat will come upright, the sail will flap and we'll slow down and stop and so the best we can make either side of the no go area is known as a beat."
Let's look at that again in practice.
Sailing along at forty five degrees to the wind the sail is in tightly and it needs constant adjustment on the tiller to stay on that right course because the wind is never totally steady.
Keep a look out for where you are going and watch the luff of the sail.
"Now we cross to the other side of the no go area but turning is called tacking, and so to make ground for wind width we have to go in a series of zig-zags, each time turning for about ninety degrees and see that the sail is kept full most of the time only flapping momentarily as the boat turns directly through the eye of the wind."
"Now let's look at the manoeuvre and tacking in more detail, you will remember it's a sequence which involves changing hands, pushing, changing sides and then straightening up again."
"So the first thing we do is to change hands, then push, wait until the boom comes across and change sides and straighten up."
Sailing upwind is hard work so don't waste effort by letting the mainsheet out.
Keep the sail driving for as long as you can through the tacks.
"Now watch this, as we go through the tack the sail is driving for most of the time just flapping briefly as the sail turns through the wind."
The whole thing becomes one fluid manoeuvre with power on for the maximum possible time.
"Change hands, push, wait, change sides, straighten up and off you go."
Now what can go wrong?
"The most common fault is to be stuck halfway through the tack, head to wind, the boat's right in the middle of the no go zone and the sail's flapping."
"Simply push the tiller away from you, push the boom out and the boat will sail backwards and then pull the tiller, pull the mainsheet and sail off again."
"If you get stuck remember, push, push, then pull, pull."
From the reach let's now look at sailing downwind.
"The first thing to remember is that as you turn the boat away from the wind, you let out the mainsheet, the sail only works properly at one angle to the wind and so it's essential to let out the mainsheet as you bear away."
"Sailing away from the wind is known as running and you've got great freedom of choice in the exact course you pick, you can even sail dead downwind."
What we need to look at though is how we change course if that means moving the position of the sail across the boat.
"Here we're sailing downwind and we want to turn left effectively, so that means moving the sail across the boat without changing the course of the boat too much."
"There, that manoeuvre is known as gybing but really it's as simple as that, sailing downwind you don't have to change course very often, unlike when we're sailing upwind with tacking but we need to show you a few more demonstrations about it in quick succession."
"Like tacking a manoeuvre consists of a series of related movements, change hands, push, change sides and straighten up again but the difference is in the tiller movement where you move the tiller towards where you were sitting, so let's watch that again, change hands, push the tiller to where you were sitting, watch the boom, as it swings across, straighten up the tiller and settle on the new side."
"Again, change hands, push the tiller to where you were sitting, watch for the boom, as it swings across, straighten up and sit down on the new side."
Impressionism has really made things very difficult in so far as people think that impressionism is a kind of normal state for art to be in and anything else is a kind of deviation from good sense.
Impressionism was a very extreme form of art.
I'm amazed it ever happened.
"I am even more amazed that, having hated it, people have now come to love it quite so much."
"I mean I can understand why they do and I like the stuff myself, but I don't share the belief that I get from all sides that impressionism is what art should be like normally."
"You see impressionism isn't art about anything very much, it's art as description — a very lively, lovable form of description, pure and simple — whereas normally art has been full of messages and meaning and didacticism if you like — full of morality and sermonizing very often, and that is normal for art."
"A lot of modern art has tended to be that way, often abstract art, that people think is meaningless, is in fact full of very serious messages if only people are willing to listen to them."
It's a big subject but I'm in a sense referring to it only in this context because it's precisely in these areas that British art in the twentieth century has been very important.
"A man like Ben Nicholson, elderly now, rather frail, still I hope working — certainly last year he was still working and exhibiting — is part of an international modern art tendency, or number of tendencies and is recognized as such, and yet if you examine his art, it's full of Englishness as well."
You see one can be both.
"One can be both part of the international abstract art and some of his work is abstract, and even in that context bring into it qualities that once one knows the idiom people can recognize as purely English and one can also, at the same time as he was much of the time, be a figurative artist that do landscapes, interiors, figure paintings (rarely), and figure drawings of a very high quality, and again they are partly of an international modern  and they are partly essentially English works."
What about the art public?
It seems to me that ultimately artists must be successful or otherwise because of the public response to their output.
Is the British public different from New York public or the Continental public?
"Ah, alas, I don't know how to say this without seeming to go to extremes."
"Only in Britain would eminent, highly educated people, leaders of society, heads of educational institutions, ministers, etc. etc., think it was worth mocking modern art."
"Please believe me, this is absolutely true."
"You go to an avant-garde exhibition in Germany or in Italy, in France, in New York of course, and you find that a lot of people want to be informed about it and even, if they are not normally art people, they accept it in the sense of not mocking it."
"In Britain it seems to be a kind of tradition that if you refer to modern art at all, you make jokes about it."
"Even Henry Moore until quite recently was still being mocked for the holes that go through his sculptures and so on, and the tradition continues."
I used to find it kind of funny.
I find it painful because it wastes a lot of effort.
"It means a lot of being enjoy being on the wrong side, if I can put it that way."
"Certainly, on my visits to exhibitions, such as at the Royal Academy, my impression is that the British public much prefers the older works, as it were."
"At the post-impressionist exhibition you could scarcely move at all for people, but at the new spirit in painting exhibition, which is currently on at the R A, there's a lot of space and people on the whole go round very quickly and are rather sceptical about it all."
This actually reinforces what you're saying I suppose.
"Yes, I think you would find that everywhere people will crowd into especially post-impressionism, which is Van Gogh, etc., more than they would into an avant-garde exhibition."
I don't mean that people necessarily have to like what's going on.
"What I'm begging, especially our leaders so to speak, to do is to stop thinking that it's all kind of a joke that's being perpetrated by idiots or by  of some sort against the public."
"Alas the exhibition at the Royal Academy, it should be fuller of course because there are some good things there."
"Any exhibition is worth going looking at and thinking about, but I do think that that is an extraordinarily bad exhibition."
It's the first time I've come away from an exhibition thinking that the exhibition as such was stupid.
A few minutes later it emerged and flew off and then when it returned it looked at the wall and saw the marks and went inside.
Ample proof indeed that it had recognized them and it realized that it was the entrance to its home.
Another day I observed the antics of a sea bird who had found a small crab in one of those rock pools on the beach below the house.
"And after several attempts to break the shell open by picking it up and dropping it onto the rocks, well that didn't work, so the bird picked it up and then from a about a height of twenty feet it dropped it onto the rocks below."
Well it must have been a tough old crab because this didn't work either.
And eventually in exasperation the bird flew a short way down the beach and picked up a small stone in its beak and then it returned and it bashed the shell repeatedly until it cracked it open and it was able to get at the contents inside.
So you see human beings are not the only animals capable of using tools to get at their food.
Now sheep are animals that we tend to regard as being pretty stupid and most of the time they're timid creatures who will run away at the slightest sound or sight of something strange in their midst.
But at lambing time they take on a total change of character and they can sometimes become very aggressive.
A mother ewe with two lambs in the field behind the house one morning demonstrated her strong maternal instincts when she successful saw off a two year old steer with a series of savage head butts.
Eventually this great shambling hulk of a beast turned tailed and fled.
Human beings it seems are not the only animals who go in for worshipping idols.
The farm cattle have their gods too and anyone who leaves a car or a tractor and trailer parked in a field of cattle can observe that when such a vehicle appears it produces the most unusual reactions amongst the herd.
And that old theory that animals can't see colours is just not true because any vehicle which is black or red in colour appears to get more attention that any other.
At first it will be surrounded and sniffed and if it appears friendly then a good licking follows and if this is accepted by the stranger then it's usually used for a good old scratch.
And that's why you can expect to find the car in the morning with the windows all covered in saliva and the wing mirrors all bent and the chrome strips on the doors are often  with tufts of cow hair.
And if the stranger has pleased the local cattle they will show their gratitude by plastering the sides of the vehicle with a generous dolloping of fresh dung before they depart.
A field of cattle are normally quiet docile creatures and most of the time it's fairly safe to walk through their midst and they will observe your passing with that quiet curiosity.
However the one thing that you must never do is to go between a cow and her calf and I made this mistake one morning and I had to take to my heals and run.
And this started a stampede amongst the rest of the herd and as I advanced down the field with them all in close pursuit I somehow managed to clear a four stranded barbed wire fence like an Olympic champion.
So be warned.
Like human families the animal and the bird life have a order of seniority or what they call the pecking order and usually the more dominant member of the clan is the oldest.
And at Mucklehouse we have Brigadier Sydney the gander and everybody else is kept firmly in place.
But like most families while father appears to be the boss more often than not it's mother who usually has the last word.
This morning I observed all of them returning home in single file after their dawn patrol around the valley and as usual mother was leading the way with father in the middle keeping the unruly youngsters in hand.
When they reached their favourite bathing spot in the burn below the house they began the slow decent of the steep bank.
However one of the youngsters at the back in his enthusiasm to reach the water tripped and fell over the one in front and this started a chain reaction in the column and the entire orderly procession landed at the bottom in a tangle of webbed feet and flapping wings.
This undignified arrival at the bathing spot started off the most dreadful family squabble and several minutes were to elapse before order was restored.
The more you observe the bird and the animal life you begin to realize that they're not so dump after all and if anything they begin to look and behave more like human beings every day.
Does this have to be done writing it down?
Yeah
I think we're taking first faltering steps in this direction at the moment.
Is a computer better than a doctor?
"Well, the studies that I've been involved in, the computer has performed certainly as well as a consultant, and at times much better than a junior doctor in the particular situation that I'm talking about."
It sounds to me as if it could be a bit worrying to think that when you went to see your doctor you'd be faced by a machine instead of a human being the other side of desk.
Well there are two answers to that I suppose.
One is that we're certainly nowhere near that.
"All of the uses that I know of diagnostic computers are  involve the doctor talking to the patient, looking at the patient, taking symptoms and then going and using the computer in a similar way that we perhaps might go and ask for an x-ray."
"The other answer is that erm certainly some trials have been done with patients not being diagnosed by a computer, but by giving initial information like their age, their date of birth, erm where the pain is, etc. erm actually interacting themselves with the computer, and studies have shown curiously that patients actually prefer to use a computer rather than to give this information to a doctor."
"Now why this should be, I don't know."
"Whether it's because they feel they're not taking up the valuable time of a doctor, they can go at their own pace, who knows?"
"But certainly it may even be that people might, in the future, even prefer to talk to computers under some circumstances."
That sounds absolutely fascinating.
I suppose one advantage of a computer is that it can store and remember a great deal of information.
Yes.
"The  if I can talk perhaps a little bit about the particular system that I'm interested in, the way it works is that it  well it diagnoses abdominal pain; if you go into the erm particular casualty department — in the fact the Royal Sussex County Hospital at the moment — with back pain in your abdomen, lower abdomen, then the symptoms will be taken by a doctor and he will then go to the diagnostic computer and feed these symptoms in."
"These cover a large range of things, like the patient's age, the patient's sex, where the pain is, where it started, how quickly it came on, and so on and so forth, and essentially within the computer has a large table, and this table contains, how shall I put it, the frequency with which this particular symptom was associated with a particular disease over the last few hundred patients that have been seen at that hospital."
It's very limited.
It only deals with the acute abdomen.
"It deals with pains like appendicitis, coley cystitis, which is inflammation of the gall bladder — about nine different diseases — and it merely says to you at the end of the operation based on the last five or six hundred patients I've seen, the probability of this patient having appendicitis is ninety per cent, the probability of something else being ten per cent ."
"So, yes, it has a big database of about oh three thousand numbers, and it just looks these up essentially."
"So it could be used as a preliminary check for patients, more or less on a routine basis?"
"Before the doctors or the consultant actually sees a patient, then"
"Well not before the doctor sees the patient, because much of the information that is fed in would have to be gain, acquired, by somebody with a good deal of medical knowledge."
"When I say ‘Where is the pain?’ and questions like this, this could be answered just by asking the patient, but there are erm various kinds of tests — one lovely test called Murphy's test, for example— which have to be carried out by a qualified doctor or a qualified medical person, so it's not a question of must being hooked onto the computer and the computer giving the answer."
"It's an aid to the doctor for making diagnoses, not a diagnostic instrument in itself."
Is there anything special about this sort of computer?
"Is it an ordinary digital computer of the sort that's used in commerce and industry, or is it a special type of computer."
Is it the program or is it the computer that's specific?
It's the program that's very specific to this problem.
"erm the one at the Royal Sussex is perhaps interesting, in that in fact it's  the computer is based on a microprocessor, so it really is using the latest erm in advanced microtechnology."
"The computer itself is a box, oh what, a foot and a half by a foot by two feet, very small."
"erm but it's the program, yes, it's the application of complex programs to thee very sophisticated but very small computers, I think, which is of interest in this particular case."
And then and then Mr Feist.
Just on one of the points er made by Professor Lock erm who was arguing that it it basically wasn't possible to include an agricultural land quality criterion er in the exceptions policy because there was so much good land in North Yorkshire.
"Erm our estimate of the proportion of of agricultural land in the county which would be classified as best and most versatile land, that is having a considerable er weight in planning decisions grades one two and three A, is between thirty and thirty five percent."
"Er and that's of agricultural land not of all land in the county, so the proportion of the total land would be less than that."
So I don't think I would accept the Professor's argument on that point I think there is plenty of scope for locating a development of this kind either on non-agricultural site or on moderate or poor quality land.
Mr Feist.
Thank you.
"Michael Feist Countryside special sites could be in open countryside away from Government policies concerning sustainability, I wonder how Professor Lock would see the situation emerging whereby a local authority has allocated a certain amount of land in its local plan for development for industrial or commercial purposes, it's tried to erm identify a broad range of criteria but it also identified special sites erm which will only be released in exceptional circumstances, that happened to be an open countryside and had the advantages that it may be a little close to the A one or somewhere similar."
Most developers would probably opt for the open site policy on the bas open site erm area on the basis this would better meet their functional needs.
They don't have to worry too much about the eventualities and all the other sins that the planning process is concerned with.
So a local authority might then find itself in a situation that it'd got a two tier site.
One which the developer would prefer and one which the local authority and maybe sustainability policies would prefer.
"In this case the developer would probably say to the local authority, I want this site and it's all or nothing, which then puts the local authority in a dilemma and in the sense its allocated sites are now seen to be some form second status."
"And I can't help thinking that we might end up with a sort of repeat of the sort of situation that's occurred at Octavius Atkinson site which is erm mentioned in the erm the paper tabled this morning, whereby er a sort of market-led approach which puts a lot of pressure on the local authorities may be at the expense of the planning-led approach to erm deciding where development should most appropriately go."
But I'd I say that with full acceptance that there is a dilemma in trying to attract erm development to er to areas which badly need them.
I think that the question is how much are we going to sacrifice in order to satisfy the developers' erm er desire to have virtual guarantees that the site will be available as and when they want it.
Thank you for that.
Mr Collier and then I think .
Thank you Chairman.
Erm I'd like to make a point about the this question of an agricultural land quality criterion in the policy.
Erm it seems to me erm that there's a danger that if Professor Lock has his way when the elephant comes crashing through into the clearing he will be sending Richonds Richmondshire's sheep flying in all directions and er will be er affecting lots of other other agricultural creatures at the same time.
Erm what I think we need is an alternative to the suggestion made by Mr Broughton erm is simply erm a wording in the exceptions policy should it be er carried forward that makes it clear that the agricultural policies in the structure plan do still apply erm to to those proposals.
Now the reason I I make that suggestion is that erm Policy A two for example looks at not only the erm quality of the agricultural land but also the effect of development proposals on erm the maintenance and economically viable erm farm units and so forth.
Er and therefore it looks at erm the indirect impact of development erm and it's it's more sophisticated one might say than merely looking at the quality of the land.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Can we break for tea now come back at twenty five to four.
No no let's make it twenty to four.
Then you'll have time to enjoy your tea.
Thank you.
Mr Allenby are you ready to burst into song?
Metaphorically speaking.
"Well, as a chemist perhaps you'll forgive me for dwelling largely on what we as chemists do, but of course it's not only the chemists in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences who do things for schools — it's right across the area — but each year, for example, we have a week set aside for sixth form visits, in which parties of sixth formers come to the School and we're about to talk to them about university entrance, about what goes on in universities, but, most importantly, to show them some of the apparatus which they don't have at school but which they've probably heard about."
I think we've settled down to a pattern of events now which schools have actually indicated to us is what they want to see.
And what time of the year does this happen?
This is in the summer.
This year I think it's the first week in July we have set aside for this purpose.
"And again arrangements are made between schools and the university to accommodate groups of children, or"
Right.
"We send out details to the schools each year, and they will book to bring a party of children round for, oh it lasts about two and a half hours altogether, and they will come either for a morning or for an afternoon."
"We in physics have two or three opportunities for sixth formers, fifth formers to come to the university and find out a little bit more about physics."
"We run a lower sixth form residential summer school for kids, which has been very popular for the past five years."
"We also run a summer school called Women into Physics, which is a rather strange title, but the idea basically is to persuade, if not encourage, young girls who have just taken their O levels that physics is a subject which could be for them — it's not unladylike about being a scientist and, in particular, being a physicist."
"Do you do anything like this in chemistry, Peter."
"Well, not quite like this."
"I think this merely emphasises that each school is operating its own erm thing, as it were."
But I must say I'm very encouraged to see the numbers of women who are applying to do subjects like chemistry and physics is going up and certainly we would applaud that sort of activity.
I think as chemists we would be glad to see more and more women come into the subject.
"Do you think that there is a disadvantage to being a woman at school, so far as a science subject's concerned?"
Do you think that teachers really don't expect them to do well in the sciences and perhaps even positively discourage them from going into science?
"I doubt whether this is done deliberately, but I think it's part of everybody's perception of science in schools that girls do biology and boys do chemistry and physics, and I suppose this is bound to have its affect on people's choices, but I personally, and I think most of my colleagues would agree with me on this, see no reason to suppose that girls should be any less good at chemistry and physics than boys."
Are they at any form of disadvantage when they come to university studying a science subject such as chemistry?
I don't think so.
I don't think so at all.
"It's interesting, actually, since I teach a first year class of biologists, where we do have rather more girls than boys, that erm as a class it works very well, possibly better than some of our own chemistry classes where there are fewer girls, and I don't know whether this is because of the mix or not."
"And certainly if they come for interview, if they apply to the university, they get a very good chance of entrance."
"Oh certainly, yes, there's no question of discriminating against women."
We're looking for good candidates whether they're men or women.
"Peter, the things we're talking about are highly commendable, but I suspect at the back of the minds of most kids at school the question of examinations — whether they're going to get their O level, or their A level, or their G C E or whatever — to what extent are university people involved in examining?"
Well we're involved in actual fact to quite a heavy extent.
Within our own School two of us are actually senior examiners for one examining board and this brings us into contact with teachers and indeed candidates.
"It helps a great deal to keep us in touch with what's happening at school and enables us to exert some influence, I suppose, on what happens in schools, hopefully in the interests of the candidates."
Do you find a resistance to change in schools in terms of the examination syllabus and content?
I think possibly the reverse.
"These readers, the assumption might run, are at ease with the complexities of rhythm and vision, pattern and play, and united by this ease are free to discriminate more and more finally the detail of the smallest fragment or the structure or the entire work."
You may well think indeed that I'm wasting your time in calling this an assumption rather than recognising it as a plain fact.
The critical and biographical studies already written to Joyce and his work would stop a sizeable bookshop.
"More are appearing all the time, and nineteen eighty two will be no more than a particularly rich year for them."
"And nor is it simply a question of numbers — among these studies are some of the subtlest, most ingenious and most penetrating essays written in our time, and the factor common to almost all, the naive or the clumsy as well as the brilliant, is the conviction explicit or implicit that Joyce is an outstanding, indeed for some the outstanding, modern writer."
The status of his work for some approaching that of the sacred book.
"Surely here is, after all, that unity of celebration which earlier I claimed as missing."
Not so.
"I suggested a second or so ago that the ordinary reader, unsure of what to make of the shifting realities of Joyce's writing, might defensively assume that no such hesitations would trouble the experienced reader, but that is far from being a homogeneous class."
"Among experienced readers, including those most passionately concerned with modernism, there are some for whom Joyce occupies nothing like so central a position, some for whom the whole drift of the later work is radically misconceived, even a colossal mistake."
We are back again in disputed ground.
"In the bewildering tracery formed by the work and by the claims and counter-claims that it has provoked, there is matter for a hundred lectures, and what follows is neither and attempt to summarize, nor a rival undertaking."
"I want rather, by focusing on a small number of closely related questions, and simple ones at that, to suggest something of how all this came about and why it matters."
"What I have to say would bear essentially on the four works named, and would be grouped round three notions which I shall call language as rescue, language as screen, and language as replay."
First rescue.
One sense of that is obvious enough.
"Everywhere in the stories that make up Joyce's first major work, Dubliners, we come across a double reality, an invariable focus on the precise detail of place and person, class and bearing, speech and gesture."
"The kind of attention that we usually associate with love or hate, and at the same time an acute awareness of limits, of closed worlds, of helplessness, of traps of unsatisfiable longing — the sort of awareness that we associate rather with pity or fear."
"Even as we admire the sharpness, the delicacy, of the delineation, of this self-sacrificing old maid, that lowly and tormented man, this uncertain child — even as we admire, we see too the hopelessness that these so powerfully suggest."
"But because it is a writer who is giving us this, and a writer at the beginning of his career, what more natural than that we should see him as writing his way out of all this, as ‘getting it out of his system’ as we say, clearing the ground for work that will enact triumphantly his escape, his liberation, his hope."
"And again and again in the stories comes the hint of separateness, of difference, as if to confirm this."
"Say, from the first story, The Sisters, a little moment like this one ‘It's bad for children’ said Old Cotter ‘because their minds are so impressionable."
"When children see things like that, you know, it has an affect.’"
I crammed my mouth with  for fear I might give utterance to my anger.
Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile.’
"Or again that difference seen the other way round, as in these lines from the last great story, The Dead."
‘He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife.
One by one they were all becoming shades.
"Better pass boldly into that other world in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age."
He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to love.
Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes.
"He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love."
Yes.
That method can be used to distances of about a hundred light years.
Beyond that the angles involved become just too small to be measured and we have to use a quite different kind of technique which involves knowing something about the properties of the objects we're looking at.
"And we talk about standard light bulbs — the idea here is that take a terrestrial example again, suppose you're looking out at night and you see a light approaching you, if it's a cyclist with a very faint light then you'll not see him until he's quite close."
If it's a motorcar with very powerful headlights you'll see it very much further away.
"So we want to get bright objects that we can see at great distances, but we also need to know something about what it is we're looking at."
"If we saw the cyclist close to and the motorist a long way away, they would look about the same."
"So the distance makes something look rather fainter, and similarly if you have something like a particular kind of start that you can identify by some property — which we'll perhaps talk about in a moment — if you can identify it and you know how bright it is, then the fainter ones are further away and you can estimate the distance by how faint they are."
"What happens, Robert, if the stars aren't actually fixed distance, but they're actually moving, either towards us or away from us."
Doesn't that mess up you approach?
"It does, but the stars, although they're moving fast by terrestrial standards, are moving very slowly by comparison with the vast distances we're talking about, and they don't change their distances by very much in the time that we're watching."
So what about the things that we occasionally hear of  colour shifts and so on— is that relevant to what we're talking about at the moment?
That is a way of measuring the speeds at which stars and galaxies are moving away from us.
The effect here is similar to listening to a train whistle.
As the train goes past erm you get a note that goes .
"The frequency changes as the train passes and the high note is when the train is coming towards us and the low one when the train is going away, and you get the same effect with light except that instead of being high and low it's blue shifted if the object is coming towards us and red if it's going away."
Do we actually have blue shift stars?
I've heard of red shifts.
Oh yes.
We have both do we?
"Stars near the sun have both  well some have blue shifts and some have red shifts, so they're moving in all directions relative to the sun."
"All right, now we've got pretty well way out — have we been able to reach the furthest objects in space by these methods, or are we stil stuck for a method?"
"Well, by an extension of the this standard light bulb method you can get most of the way into the universe."
The nearby galaxies you can reach using a kind of special variable star.
It varies in brightness and the way that it varies picks it out.
"Its a sort of signature — you can recognise that particular kind of star — it's called a sephied variable, and we know how bright that is and so we can use that to get distances to nearby galaxies."
"For very distant objects these stars themselves are too faint to be visible, but if you look at clusters of galaxies, we find that the very brightest galaxy in a cluster is the same brightness in all clusters and so the fainter it looks to us the further away the cluster of galaxies must be."
"And then we come to the red shift, in fact, that you were talking about a minute ago."
"Because although stars near to us show both red shifts and blue shifts, distant galaxies show only red shifts, and that means that all the galaxies that we can see are moving away from us."
"The universe, in fact, is expanding (although that's another talk really) and for the present purpose the important thing is that they're moving away at a speed which increases with their distance and so if we can measure the speed that they're moving away from us, then we can find their distance, and that takes us to the edge of the universe."
"Are there events taking place that we will never ever see because they're so far away, or maybe they're taking place in such a way that they're moving away faster than the light is travelling in our direction?"
"No, they won't be moving away faster than light is travelling because the theory of relativity says that nothing can move faster than light, but there are certainly things which may be happening now which we shall not learn about for thousands of millions of years because they are so far away."
These are negative particles and the nucleus is made up of positively charged and neutral particles and the combination is kept together by electrostatic forces.
So the nucleus itself is not solid.
It itself consists of particles?
Well of course it's rather more solid than the atom is.
"I mean if you think that an atom is, as we said, typically ten to the minus eight of a centimetre, then a nucleus is typically ten to the minus twelve of a centimetre, so that's four orders of magnitude down, so the nucleus itself, if you scaled the whole thing down by a factor of ten to the four, the neucleus itself again is made up of a fair amount of free space and loss of particles inside it."
"If you've got a positive nucleus and you've got electrons, negative particles going round it, and the two attract each other, why don't they just all collapse together?"
Well of course this was the great argument that went on.
"I mean when Rutherford did his experiments years and years ago he produced his planetary model of the nucleus, of the atom where the nucleus plays the role of the sun and the electrons play the role of the planets, and people said well why don't they just spiral in an erm Rutherford had actually no answer to this, but the answer to this was produced by the Danish physicist Nils Bore, who said ‘Well they don't spiral in because erm electrons cannot just take up any orbit, they can take up certain specified orbits which he called stationary states, and there is a lowest one of these, and when the electron gets down there it cannot go any further."
"Well, I'm sure that's the right answer, but we're already getting a little bit complicated in our vision of what's happening."
Let's go inside the nucleus a little bit.
"The nucleus isn't solid, it consists of other particles — what sort of particles are these?"
"Well, erm the nucleus is not solid, but the particles in it are much more massive than electrons."
"If you look at the particles inside the nucleus you have a proton, which is a positively charged particle, and it's about two thousand times more massive than an electron, and you have also have another type of particle in there called a neutron, and a neutron is to all practical intents and purposes it's just like a proton except that it has no charge, and so the whole mass of the atom is actually concentrated inside the nucleus."
"The electrons balance the forces of course, but they don't really contribute to the mass."
"So what we have inside the nucleus, we have two kinds of particle, the neutron, which is uncharged, and the proton which is positively charged."
And you get smaller particles out of the neutrons and protons?
"Well, you can get hosts of smaller particles if you do various things."
I mean you're getting into quite deep water here.
Let's go back a little bit.
"I mean if you ask what happens when electrons drop down from one orbit to another inside the atom, the emit light, which is the thing we are familiar with, but erm physicists tend to think of this as particles which they call photons."
"Now, we you have neutrons and protons, they interact one with the other, but the particle that carries the interaction is not the photon, it's the new particle called the meson, and you have got smaller particles, much less massive particles than neutrons and protons, and these are called mesons or pye mesons, and the pye meson has erm a mass which is typically a tenth of that of a proton."
"So if you collide neutrons and protons, bang them one off the other, you can produce these mesons."
How do you know these particles actually exist?
"Well I mean how do you know that, for example, light exists?"
"I mean if you put your hand up to the sun you can feel it, you detect it, your eyes detect it, well you have detectors which detect them and, for example, if I want to detect something like an electron well then I can make a counter which is sensitive to charged particles like electrons, and I can allow these electrons to hit this counter and it will produce erm an identifiable electrical pulse and I can look at that and I can say this is an electron, or I can look at other particles, say, for things like helium nuclei which are called alpha particles, and I can make counters which will detect these and I can put a little piece of paper in front and I can stop off the alpha particles."
We know they exist because we can do things with them.
We can actually see practical effects which follow from usin them.
You can't see a proton because proton is too small erm the only things that you can see are microscopic bodies and again you only infer the existence of these microscopic bodies because you actually detect the light that comes from them.
Somehow or other your miond analyzes the light that it receives from these bodies and tells you about them.
"In a sense you can do the same thing, of course, with erm elementary particles like neutrons and protons, but the process of interpretation is much more complicated."
"Continuing our journey to ever smaller particles, can we break up the pye meson into anything smaller?"
Well you don't actually have to do that with the pye meson because if it erm if you have a pye meson it just breaks up itself.
"`` Better , sir . ''"
"`` Rather tired of the house , are n't you ? ''"
`` Guess I am ! ''
and Dan 's eyes roved away to the green hills and woods where he longed to be .
`` Suppose we take a little turn before the others come back ?
"That big , easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable , and a breath of fresh air will do you good ."
"Get a cushion and a shawl , Demi , and let 's carry Dan off . ''"
"The boys thought it a capital joke , and Dan looked delighted , but asked , with an unexpected burst of virtue , `` Will Mrs. Bhaer like it ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes ; we settled all that a minute ago . ''"
"`` You did n't say any thing about it , so I do n't see how you could , '' said Demi , inquisitively ."
"`` We have a way of sending messages to one another , without any words ."
It is a great improvement on the telegraph . ''
"`` I know it 's eyes ; I saw you lift your eyebrows , and nod toward the carriage , and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again , '' cried Nat , who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time ."
`` Right .
"Now them , come on , '' and in a minute Dan found himself settled in the carriage , his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite , nicely covered with a shawl , which fell down from the upper regions in a most mysterious manner , just when they wanted it ."
"Demi climbed up to the box beside Peter , the black coachman ."
"Nat sat next Dan in the place of honor , while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite , to take care of the foot , he said , but really that he might study the faces before him both so happy , yet so different , for Dan 's was square , and brown , and strong , while Nat 's was long , and fair , and rather weak , but very amiable with its mild eyes and good forehead ."
"`` By the way , I 've got a book somewhere here that you may like to see , '' said the oldest boy of the party , diving under the seat and producing a book which make Dan exclaim , `` Oh !"
"by George , is n't that a stunner ? ''"
"as he turned the leaves , and saw fine plates of butterflies , and birds , and every sort of interesting insect , colored like life ."
"He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks , but Mr. Laurie did not mind , and was quite satisfied to see the boy 's eager delight , and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as he came to them ."
"Nat leaned on his shoulder to look , and Demi turned his back to the horses , and let his feet dangle inside the carriage , so that he might join in the conversation ."
"When they got among the beetles , Mr. Laurie took a curious little object out of his vest-pocket , and laying it in the palm of his hand , said , `` There 's a beetle that is thousands of years old ; '' and then , while the lads examined the queer stone-bug , that looked so old and gray , he told them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy , after lying for ages in a famous tomb ."
"Finding them interested , he went on to tell about the Egyptians , and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them the Nile , and how he sailed up the mighty river , with the handsome dark men to work his boat ; how he shot alligators , saw wonderful beasts and birds ; and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel , who pitched him about like a ship in a storm ."
"`` Uncle Teddy tells stories ` most as well as Grandpa , '' said Demi , approvingly , when the tale was done , and the boys ' eyes asked for more ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Mr. Laurie , quite soberly , for he considered Demi 's praise worth having , for children are good critics in such cases , and to suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of ."
"`` Here 's another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was turning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan , '' and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrow-head and a string of wampum ."
`` Oh !
"tell about the Indians , '' cried Demi , who was fond of playing wigwam ."
"`` Dan knows lots about them , '' added Nat ."
"`` More than I do , I dare say ."
"Tell us something , '' and Mr. Laurie looked as interested as the other two ."
"There was no way , think , plan , worry as she might ."
And if she could not !
"Marcella remembered Patty 's face and the doctor 's look , and her heart sank like lead ."
"Patty was growing weaker every day instead of stronger , and the weather was getting hotter ."
"Oh , if Patty were to -- to -- but Marcella could not complete the sentence even in thought ."
If they were not so desperately poor !
Marcella 's bitterness overflowed her soul at the thought .
Everywhere around her were evidences of wealth -- wealth often lavishly and foolishly spent -- and she could not get money enough anywhere to save her sister 's life !
"She almost felt that she hated all those smiling , well-dressed people who thronged the streets ."
"By the time she reached the store , poor Marcella 's heart was seething with misery and resentment ."
"Three years before , when Marcella had been sixteen and Patty nine , their parents had died , leaving them absolutely alone in the world except for their father 's half-sister , Miss Gibson , who lived in Canning and earned her livelihood washing and mending for the hands employed in the big factory nearby ."
"She had grudgingly offered the girls a home , which Marcella had accepted because she must ."
"She obtained a position in one of the Canning stores at three dollars a week , out of which she contrived to dress herself and Patty and send the latter to school ."
"Her life for three years was one of absolute drudgery , yet until now she had never lost courage , but had struggled bravely on , hoping for better times in the future when she should get promotion and Patty would be old enough to teach school ."
But now Marcella 's courage and hopefulness had gone out like a spent candle .
"She was late at the store , and that meant a fine ; her head ached , and her feet felt like lead as she climbed the stairs to her department -- a hot , dark , stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter ."
"It was warm and close at any time , but today it was stifling , and there was already a crowd of customers , for it was the day of a bargain sale ."
The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella 's tortured nerves .
"She felt that she wanted to scream , but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer -- a big , handsome , richly dressed woman ."
Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year .
She was Mrs. Liddell -- Marcella knew her by sight -- and she was in a very bad temper because she had been kept waiting .
For the next half hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction .
Nothing suited her .
"Pile after pile , box after box , of shirtwaists did Marcella take down for her , only to have them flung aside with sarcastic remarks ."
Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella responsible for the lack of waists that suited her ; her tongue grew sharper and sharper and her comments more trying .
"Then she mislaid her purse , and was disagreeable about that until it turned up ."
Marcella shut her lips so tightly that they turned white to keep back the impatient retort that rose momentarily to her lips .
"The insolence of some customers was always trying to the sensitive , high-spirited girl , but today it seemed unbearable ."
"Her head throbbed fiercely with the pain of the ever-increasing ache , and -- what was the lady on her right saying to a friend ?"
"`` Yes , she had typhoid , you know -- a very bad form ."
"She rallied from it , but she was so exhausted that she could n't really recover , and the doctor said -- '' `` Really , '' interrupted Mrs. Liddell 's sharp voice , `` may I ask you to attend to me , if you please ?"
"No doubt gossip may be very interesting to you , but I am accustomed to having a clerk pay some small attention to my requirements ."
"But I thought he seemed crestfallen ; indeed , he was clutching at every straw , and all the time , I dare say , saw the faces of his hereditary foes on the bench , and in the jury-box , and the gallows in the background ."
"`` Well , sir , '' says Alan , turning to me , `` what say ye to that ?"
Ye are here under the safeguard of my honour ; and it 's my part to see nothing done but what shall please you . ''
"`` I have but one word to say , '' said I ; `` for to all this dispute I am a perfect stranger ."
"But the plain common-sense is to set the blame where it belongs , and that is on the man who fired the shot ."
"Paper him , as ye call it , set the hunt on him ; and let honest , innocent folk show their faces in safety . ''"
"But at this both Alan and James cried out in horror ; bidding me hold my tongue , for that was not to be thought of ; and asking me what the Camerons would think ?"
"-LRB- which confirmed me , it must have been a Cameron from Mamore that did the act -RRB- and if I did not see that the lad might be caught ?"
`` Ye havenae surely thought of that ? ''
"said they , with such innocent earnestness , that my hands dropped at my side and I despaired of argument ."
"`` Very well , then , '' said I , `` paper me , if you please , paper Alan , paper King George !"
"We 're all three innocent , and that seems to be what 's wanted ."
"But at least , sir , '' said I to James , recovering from my little fit of annoyance , `` I am Alan 's friend , and if I can be helpful to friends of his , I will not stumble at the risk . ''"
"I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent , for I saw Alan troubled ; and , besides -LRB- thinks I to myself -RRB- , as soon as my back is turned , they will paper me , as they call it , whether I consent or not ."
"But in this I saw I was wrong ; for I had no sooner said the words , than Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair , came running over to us , and wept first upon my neck and then on Alan 's , blessing God for our goodness to her family ."
"`` As for you , Alan , it was no more than your bounden duty , '' she said ."
"`` But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst , and seen the goodman fleeching like a suitor , him that by rights should give his commands like any king -- as for you , my lad , '' she says , `` my heart is wae not to have your name , but I have your face ; and as long as my heart beats under my bosom , I will keep it , and think of it , and bless it . ''"
"And with that she kissed me , and burst once more into such sobbing , that I stood abashed ."
"`` Hoot , hoot , '' said Alan , looking mighty silly ."
"`` The day comes unco soon in this month of July ; and to-morrow there 'll be a fine to-do in Appin , a fine riding of dragoons , and crying of ` Cruachan ! '"
* and running of red-coats ; and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone . ''
* The rallying-word of the Campbells .
"Thereupon we said farewell , and set out again , bending somewhat eastwards , in a fine mild dark night , and over much the same broken country as before ."
"CHAPTER XX THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE ROCKS Sometimes we walked , sometimes ran ; and as it drew on to morning , walked ever the less and ran the more ."
"Though , upon its face , that country appeared to be a desert , yet there were huts and houses of the people , of which we must have passed more than twenty , hidden in quiet places of the hills ."
"When we came to one of these , Alan would leave me in the way , and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at the window with some sleeper awakened ."
"This was to pass the news ; which , in that country , was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to it even while fleeing for his life ; and so well attended to by others , that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard already of the murder ."
"In the others , as well as I could make out -LRB- standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue -RRB- , the news was received with more of consternation than surprise ."
"For all our hurry , day began to come in while we were still far from any shelter ."
"It found us in a prodigious valley , strewn with rocks and where ran a foaming river ."
"Wild mountains stood around it ; there grew there neither grass nor trees ; and I have sometimes thought since then , that it may have been the valley called Glencoe , where the massacre was in the time of King William ."
"But for the details of our itinerary , I am all to seek ; our way lying now by short cuts , now by great detours ; our pace being so hurried , our time of journeying usually by night ; and the names of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the more easily forgotten ."
"But there was one recess in the wall , no larger than a bird-cage , which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell ."
"It could be shut off from the rest of the home by a tiny curtain , which Tink , who was most fastidious , always kept drawn when dressing or undressing ."
"No woman , however large , could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined ."
"The couch , as she always called it , was a genuine Queen Mab , with club legs ; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season ."
"Her mirror was a Puss-in-boots , of which there are now only three , unchipped , known to the fairy dealers ; the wash-stand was Pie-crust and reversible , the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth , and the carpet and rugs of the best -LRB- the early -RRB- period of Margery and Robin ."
"There was a chandelier from Tiddly winks for the look of the thing , but of course she lit the residence herself ."
"Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house , as indeed was perhaps inevitable ; and her chamber , though beautiful , looked rather conceited , having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up ."
"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy , because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do ."
"Really there were whole weeks when , except perhaps with a stocking in the evening , she was never above ground ."
"The cooking , I can tell you , kept her nose to the pot ."
"Their chief food was roasted breadfruit , yams , cocoa-nuts , baked pig , mammee-apples , tappa rolls and bananas , washed down with calabashes of poe-poe ; but you never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe , it all depended upon Peter 's whim ."
"He could eat , really eat , if it was part of a game , but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy , which is what most children like better than anything else ; the next best thing being to talk about it ."
Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder .
"Of course it was trying , but you simply had to follow his lead , and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge ."
Wendy 's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed .
"Then , as she expressed it , she had a breathing time for herself ; and she occupied it in making new things for them , and putting double pieces on the knees , for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees ."
"At this high-handed proceeding , and the threat which accompanied it , Jack 's patience gave out , and catching up Caesar , as he thought , sent him flying after the retreating tyrant with the defiant declaration , -- `` Keep them , then , and your old book , too !"
I wo n't look at it till you give all my stamps back and say you are sorry .
So now ! ''
"It was all over before Mamma could interfere , or Jill do more than clutch and cling to the gum-brush ."
"Frank vanished unharmed , but the poor book dashed against the wall to fall half open on the floor , its gay cover loosened , and its smooth leaves crushed by the blow ."
`` It 's the album !
"O Jack , how could you ? ''"
"cried Jill , dismayed at sight of the precious book so maltreated by the owner ."
`` Thought it was the other .
Guess it is n't hurt much .
"Did n't mean to hit him , any way ."
"He does provoke me so , '' muttered Jack , very red and shamefaced as his mother picked up the book and laid it silently on the table before him ."
"He did not know what to do with himself , and was thankful for the stamps still left him , finding great relief in making faces as he plucked them one by one from his mortified countenance ."
"Jill looked on , half glad , half sorry that her savage showed such signs of unconverted ferocity , and Mrs. Minot went on writing letters , wearing the grave look her sons found harder to bear than another person 's scolding ."
"No one spoke for a moment , and the silence was becoming awkward when Gus appeared in a rubber suit , bringing a book to Jack from Laura and a note to Jill from Lotty ."
"`` Look here , you just trundle me into my den , please , I 'm going to have a nap , it 's so dull to-day I do n't feel like doing much , '' said Jack , when Gus had done his errands , trying to look as if he knew nothing about the fracas ."
Aunt Susanna came down the next day and told Margaret that she would send her to college .
Also she commissioned Laura to paint her a water-color for her dining-room and said she 'd pay her five dollars for it .
"Kate and I were rather left out in the cold in this distribution of favors , but when you come to reflect that Laura and Magsie had really cooked that dinner , it was only just ."
"Anyway , Aunt Susanna has never since insinuated that we ca n't cook , and that is as much as we deserve ."
By Grace of Julius Caesar Melissa sent word on Monday evening that she thought we had better go round with the subscription list for cushioning the church pews on Tuesday .
I sent back word that I thought we had better go on Thursday .
"I had no particular objection to Tuesday , but Melissa is rather fond of settling things without consulting anyone else , and I do n't believe in always letting her have her own way ."
"Melissa is my cousin and we have always been good friends , and I am really very fond of her ; but there 's no sense in lying down and letting yourself be walked over ."
We finally compromised on Wednesday .
"I always have a feeling of dread when I hear of any new church-project for which money will be needed , because I know perfectly well that Melissa and I will be sent round to collect for it ."
"People say we seem to be able to get more than anybody else ; and they appear to think that because Melissa is an unencumbered old maid , and I am an unencumbered widow , we can spare the time without any inconvenience to ourselves ."
"Well , we have been canvassing for building funds , and socials , and suppers for years , but it is needed now ; at least , I have had enough of it , and I should think Melissa has , too ."
"We started out bright and early on Wednesday morning , for Jersey Cove is a big place and we knew we should need the whole day ."
"We had to walk because neither of us owned a horse , and anyway it 's more nuisance getting out to open and shut gates than it is worth while ."
"It was a lovely day then , though promising to be hot , and our hearts were as light as could be expected , considering the disagreeable expedition we were on ."
"I was waiting at my gate for Melissa when she came , and she looked me over with wonder and disapproval ."
I could see she thought I was a fool to dress up in my second best flowered muslin and my very best hat with the pale pink roses in it to walk about in the heat and dust ; but I was n't .
"All my experience in canvassing goes to show that the better dressed and better looking you are the more money you 'll get -- that is , when it 's the men you have to tackle , as in this case ."
"If it had been the women , however , I would have put on the oldest and ugliest things , consistent with decency , I had ."
"This was what Melissa had done , as it was , and she did look fearfully prim and dowdy , except for her front hair , which was as soft and fluffy and elaborate as usual ."
I never could understand how Melissa always got it arranged so beautifully .
Nothing particular happened the first part of the day .
"Some few growled and would n't subscribe anything , but on the whole we did pretty well ."
"If it had been a missionary subscription we should have fared worse ; but when it was something touching their own comfort , like cushioning the pews , they came down handsomely ."
"We reached Daniel Wilson 's by noon , and had to have dinner there ."
"We did n't eat much , although we were hungry enough -- Mary Wilson 's cooking is a by-word in Jersey Cove ."
"No wonder Daniel is dyspeptic ; but dyspeptic or not , he gave us a big subscription for our cushions and told us we looked younger than ever ."
"Daniel is always very complimentary , and they say Mary is jealous ."
"When we left the Wilson 's Melissa said , with an air of a woman nerving herself to a disagreeable duty : `` I suppose we might as well go to Isaac Appleby 's now and get it over . ''"
I agreed with her .
I had been dreading that call all day .
It is n't a very pleasant thing to go to a man you have recently refused to marry and ask him for money ; and Melissa and I were both in that predicament .
"`` I guess we had better go , '' said Demi , suddenly , as Aunt Jo 's voice was heard on the stairs ."
"`` P ` r ` aps we had , '' and Nat hastily dropped a stray jumble that he had just picked up ."
"But Mrs. Jo was among them before the retreat was accomplished , and into her sympathetic ear the young ladies poured the story of their woes ."
"`` No more balls for these boys till they have atoned for this bad behavior by doing something kind to you , '' said Mrs. Jo , shaking her head at the three culprits ."
"`` We were only in fun , '' began Demi ."
`` I do n't like fun that makes other people unhappy .
"I am disappointed in you , Demi , for I hoped you would never learn to tease Daisy ."
Such a kind little sister as she is to you . ''
"`` Boys always tease their sisters ; Tom says so , '' muttered Demi ."
"`` I do n't intend that my boys shall , and I must send Daisy home if you can not play happily together , '' said Aunt Jo , soberly ."
"At this awful threat , Demi sidled up to his sister , and Daisy hastily dried her tears , for to be separated was the worst misfortune that could happen to the twins ."
"`` Nat was bad , too , and Tommy was baddest of all , '' observed Nan , fearing that two of the sinners would not get their fair share of punishment ."
"`` I am sorry , '' said Nat , much ashamed ."
`` I ai n't ! ''
"bawled Tommy through the keyhole , where he was listening with all his might ."
"Mrs. Jo wanted very much to laugh , but kept her countenance , and said impressively , as she pointed to the door , `` You can go , boys , but remember , you are not to speak to or play with the little girls till I give you leave ."
"You do n't deserve the pleasure , so I forbid it . ''"
"The ill-mannered young gentlemen hastily retired , to be received outside with derision and scorn by the unrepentant Bangs , who would not associate with them for at least fifteen minutes ."
"Daisy was soon consoled for the failure of her ball , but lamented the edict that parted her from her brother , and mourned over his short-comings in her tender little heart ."
"Nan rather enjoyed the trouble , and went about turning up her pug nose at the three , especially Tommy , who pretended not to care , and loudly proclaimed his satisfaction at being rid of those `` stupid girls . ''"
"But in his secret soul he soon repented of the rash act that caused this banishment from the society he loved , and every hour of separation taught him the value of the `` stupid girls . ''"
"The others gave in very soon , and longed to be friends , for now there was no Daisy to pet and cook for them ; no Nan to amuse and doctor them ; and , worst of all , no Mrs. Jo to make home life pleasant and life easy for them ."
"To their great affliction , Mrs. Jo seemed to consider herself one of the offended girls , for she hardly spoke to the outcasts , looked as if she did not see them when she passed , and was always too busy now to attend to their requests ."
"This sudden and entire exile from favor cast a gloom over their souls , for when Mother Bhaer deserted them , their sun had set at noon-day , as it were , and they had no refuge left ."
"This unnatural state of things actually lasted for three days , then they could bear it no longer , and fearing that the eclipse might become total , went to Mr. Bhaer for help and counsel ."
It is my private opinion that he had received instructions how to behave if the case should be laid before him .
"But no one suspected it , and he gave the afflicted boys some advice , which they gratefully accepted and carried out in the following manner : Secluding themselves in the garret , they devoted several play-hours to the manufacture of some mysterious machine , which took so much paste that Asia grumbled , and the little girls wondered mightily ."
"Nan nearly got her inquisitive nose pinched in the door , trying to see what was going on , and Daisy sat about , openly lamenting that they could not all play nicely together , and not have any dreadful secrets ."
"Wednesday afternoon was fine , and after a good deal of consultation about wind and weather , Nat and Tommy went off , bearing an immense flat parcel hidden under many newspapers ."
"Nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity , Daisy nearly cried with vexation , and both quite trembled with interest when Demi marched into Mrs. Bhaer 's room , hat in hand , and said , in the politest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years , `` Please , Aunt Jo , would you and the girls come out to a surprise party we have made for you ?"
Do it 's a very nice one . ''
"`` Thank you , we will come with pleasure ; only , I must take Teddy with me , '' replied Mrs. Bhaer , with a smile that cheered Demi like sunshine after rain ."
"For our Lowland beggars -- even the gownsmen themselves , who beg by patent -- had a louting , flattering way with them , and if you gave them a plaek and asked change , would very civilly return you a boddle ."
"But these Highland beggars stood on their dignity , asked alms only to buy snuff -LRB- by their account -RRB- and would give no change ."
"To be sure , this was no concern of mine , except in so far as it entertained me by the way ."
"What was much more to the purpose , few had any English , and these few -LRB- unless they were of the brotherhood of beggars -RRB- not very anxious to place it at my service ."
"I knew Torosay to be my destination , and repeated the name to them and pointed ; but instead of simply pointing in reply , they would give me a screed of the Gaelic that set me foolish ; so it was small wonder if I went out of my road as often as I stayed in it ."
"At last , about eight at night , and already very weary , I came to a lone house , where I asked admittance , and was refused , until I bethought me of the power of money in so poor a country , and held up one of my guineas in my finger and thumb ."
"Thereupon , the man of the house , who had hitherto pretended to have no English , and driven me from his door by signals , suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful , and agreed for five shillings to give me a night 's lodging and guide me the next day to Torosay ."
"I slept uneasily that night , fearing I should be robbed ; but I might have spared myself the pain ; for my host was no robber , only miserably poor and a great cheat ."
"He was not alone in his poverty ; for the next morning , we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a rich man to have one of my guineas changed ."
"This was perhaps a rich man for Mull ; he would have scarce been thought so in the south ; for it took all he had -- the whole house was turned upside down , and a neighbour brought under contribution , before he could scrape together twenty shillings in silver ."
"The odd shilling he kept for himself , protesting he could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying `` locked up . ''"
"For all that he was very courteous and well spoken , made us both sit down with his family to dinner , and brewed punch in a fine china bowl , over which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start ."
"I was for getting angry , and appealed to the rich man -LRB- Hector Maclean was his name -RRB- , who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment of the five shillings ."
"But Maclean had taken his share of the punch , and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was brewed ; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts and Gaelic songs , till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or the barn for their night 's rest ."
"Next day -LRB- the fourth of my travels -RRB- we were up before five upon the clock ; but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once , and it was three hours before I had him clear of the house , and then -LRB- as you shall hear -RRB- only for a worse disappointment ."
"As long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean 's house , all went well ; only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder , and when I asked him the cause , only grinned at me ."
"No sooner , however , had we crossed the back of a hill , and got out of sight of the house windows , than he told me Torosay lay right in front , and that a hill-top -LRB- which he pointed out -RRB- was my best landmark ."
"`` I care very little for that , '' said I , `` since you are going with me . ''"
The impudent cheat answered me in the Gaelic that he had no English .
"`` My fine fellow , '' I said , `` I know very well your English comes and goes ."
Tell me what will bring it back ?
Is it more money you wish ? ''
"`` Five shillings mair , '' said he , `` and hersel ' will bring ye there . ''"
"I reflected awhile and then offered him two , which he accepted greedily , and insisted on having in his hands at once `` for luck , '' as he said , but I think it was rather for my misfortune ."
"The two shillings carried him not quite as many miles ; at the end of which distance , he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues from his feet , like a man about to rest ."
I was now red-hot .
`` Ha ! ''
"said I , `` have you no more English ? ''"
"He said impudently , `` No . ''"
"At that I boiled over , and lifted my hand to strike him ; and he , drawing a knife from his rags , squatted back and grinned at me like a wildcat ."
"At that , forgetting everything but my anger , I ran in upon him , put aside his knife with my left , and struck him in the mouth with the right ."
"I was a strong lad and very angry , and he but a little man ; and he went down before me heavily ."
"`` Yes , it 's quite true ."
And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of duty and all that .
"But now , thank goodness , there is no need of such wholesale immolation ."
So just let 's forgive each other . ''
"`` Oh , '' sighed Edith happily , `` it is almost too good to be true . ''"
"`` It is really providentially ordered , is n't it ? ''"
said Katherine .
"`` Ned and I would never have got on together in the world , and you and Sidney would have bored each other to death ."
"As it is , there will be four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones ."
I 'll tell Ned so tomorrow . ''
Four Winds Alan Douglas threw down his pen with an impatient exclamation .
"It was high time his next Sunday 's sermon was written , but he could not concentrate his thoughts on his chosen text ."
"For one thing he did not like it and had selected it only because Elder Trewin , in his call of the evening before , had hinted that it was time for a good stiff doctrinal discourse , such as his predecessor in Rexton , the Rev. Jabez Strong , had delighted in ."
"Alan hated doctrines -- `` the soul 's staylaces , '' he called them -- but Elder Trewin was a man to be reckoned with and Alan preached an occasional sermon to please him ."
"`` It 's no use , '' he said wearily ."
"`` I could have written a sermon in keeping with that text in November or midwinter , but now , when the whole world is reawakening in a miracle of beauty and love , I ca n't do it ."
"If a northeast rainstorm does n't set in before next Sunday , Mr. Trewin will not have his sermon ."
"I shall take as my text instead , ` The flowers appear on the earth , the time of the singing of birds has come . ' ''"
"He rose and went to his study window , outside of which a young vine was glowing in soft tender green tints , its small dainty leaves casting quivering shadows on the opposite wall where the portrait of Alan 's mother hung ."
"She had a fine , strong , sweet face ; the same face , cast in a masculine mould , was repeated in her son , and the resemblance was striking as he stood in the searching evening sunshine ."
"The black hair grew around his forehead in the same way ; his eyes were steel blue , like hers , with a similar expression , half brooding , half tender , in their depths ."
"He had the mobile , smiling mouth of the picture , but his chin was deeper and squarer , dented with a dimple which , combined with a certain occasional whimsicality of opinion and glance , had caused Elder Trewin some qualms of doubt regarding the fitness of this young man for his high and holy vocation ."
"The Rev. Jabez Strong had never indulged in dimples or jokes ; but then , as Elder Trewin , being a just man , had to admit , the Rev. Jabez Strong had preached many a time and oft to more empty pews than full ones , while now the church was crowded to its utmost capacity on Sundays and people came to hear Mr. Douglas who had not darkened a church door for years ."
"All things considered , Elder Trewin decided to overlook the dimple ."
There was sure to be some drawback in every minister .
"Alan from his study looked down on all the length of the Rexton valley , at the head of which the manse was situated , and thought that Eden might have looked so in its innocence , for all the orchards were abloom and the distant hills were tremulous and aerial in springtime gauzes of pale purple and pearl ."
"But in any garden , despite its beauty , is an element of tameness and domesticity , and Alan 's eyes , after a moment 's delighted gazing , strayed wistfully off to the north where the hills broke away into a long sloping lowland of pine and fir ."
"Beyond it stretched the wide expanse of the lake , flashing in the molten gold and crimson of evening ."
Its lure was irresistible .
Alan had been born and bred beside a faraway sea and the love of it was strong in his heart -- so strong that he knew he must go back to it sometime .
"Meanwhile , the great lake , mimicking the sea in its vast expanse and the storms that often swept over it , was his comfort and solace ."
"As often as he could he stole away to its wild and lonely shore , leaving the snug bounds of cultivated home lands behind him with something like a sense of relief ."
"as she softly lifted away the apron , and saw the little ruddy face below ."
"The berry-stained lips were half-open as the breath came and went , the yellow hair lay damp on the hot forehead , and both the chubby hands held fast the little pail still full ."
"The sight of the childish harvest , treasured through all the troubles of that night for her , seemed to touch Mrs. Jo to the heart , for suddenly she gathered up her boy , and began to cry over him , so tenderly , yet so heartily , that he woke up , and at first seemed bewildered ."
"Then he remembered , and hugged her close , saying with a laugh of triumph , `` I knew you 'd come !"
O Marmar !
I did want you so ! ''
"For a moment they kissed and clung to one another , quite forgetting all the world ; for no matter how lost and soiled and worn-out wandering sons may be , mothers can forgive and forget every thing as they fold them in their fostering arms ."
"Happy the son whose faith in his mother remains unchanged , and who , through all his wanderings , has kept some filial token to repay her brave and tender love ."
"Dan meantime picked Nan out of her bush , and , with a gentleness none but Teddy ever saw in him before , he soothed her first alarm at the sudden waking , and wiped away her tears ; for Nan also began to cry for joy , it was so good to see a kind face and feel a strong arm round her after what seemed to her ages of loneliness and fear ."
"`` My poor little girl , do n't cry !"
"You are all safe now , and no one shall say a word of blame to-night , '' said Mrs. Jo , taking Nan into her capacious embrace , and cuddling both children as a hen might gather her lost chickens under her motherly wings ."
`` It was my fault ; but I am sorry .
"I tried to take care of him , and I covered him up and let him sleep , and did n't touch his berries , though I was so hungry ; and I never will do it again truly , never , never , '' sobbed Nan , quite lost in a sea of penitence and thankfulness ."
"`` Call them now , and let us get home , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and Dan , getting upon the wall , sent a joyful word `` Found ! ''"
ringing over the field .
"How the wandering lights came dancing from all sides , and gathered round the little group among the sweet fern bushes !"
"Such a hugging , and kissing , and talking , and crying , as went on must have amazed the glowworms , and evidently delighted the mosquitoes , for they hummed frantically , while the little moths came in flocks to the party , and the frogs croaked as if they could not express their satisfaction loudly enough ."
"Then they set out for home , a queer party , for Franz rode on to tell the news ; Dan and Toby led the way ; then came Nan in the strong arms of Silas , who considered her `` the smartest little baggage he ever saw , '' and teased her all the way home about her pranks ."
"Mrs. Bhaer would let no one carry Rob but himself , and the little fellow , refreshed by sleep , sat up , and chattered gayly , feeling himself a hero , while his mother went beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that came handy , and never tired of hearing him say , `` I knew Marmar would come , '' or seeing him lean down to kiss her , and put a plump berry into her mouth , '' 'Cause he picked 'em all for her . ''"
"The moon shone out just as they reached the avenue , and all the boys came shouting to meet them , so the lost lambs were borne in triumph and safety , and landed in the dining-room , where the unromantic little things demanded supper instead of preferring kisses and caresses ."
"They were set down to bread and milk , while the entire household stood round to gaze upon them ."
"Nan soon recovered her spirits , and recounted her perils with a relish now that they were all over ."
"Rob seemed absorbed in his food , but put down his spoon all of a sudden , and set up a doleful roar ."
"`` My precious , why do you cry ? ''"
"asked his mother , who still hung over him ."
"`` I 'm crying 'cause I was lost , '' bawled Rob , trying to squeeze out a tear , and failing entirely ."
`` But you are found now .
"Nan says you did n't cry out in the field , and I was glad you were such a brave boy . ''"
`` I was so busy being frightened I did n't have any time then .
"But I want to cry now , 'cause I do n't like to be lost , '' explained Rob , struggling with sleep , emotion , and a mouthful of bread and milk ."
"The boys set up such a laugh at this funny way of making up for lost time , that Rob stopped to look at them , and the merriment was so infectious , that after a surprised stare he burst out into a merry , `` Ha , ha ! ''"
and beat his spoon upon the table as if he enjoyed the joke immensely .
"At first this little damsel was afraid of Maimie , who most kindly went to her aid , but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was Brownie , and that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the Duke would have her ."
"`` Of course , '' she said , `` I am rather plain , '' and this made Maimie uncomfortable , for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite plain for a fairy ."
It was difficult to know what to reply .
"`` I see you think I have no chance , '' Brownie said falteringly ."
"`` I do n't say that , '' Maimie answered politely , `` of course your face is just a tiny bit homely , but -- '' Really it was quite awkward for her ."
Fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar .
"He had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in London were on view for half-a-crown the second day , but on his return home instead of being dissatisfied with Maimie 's mother he had said , `` You ca n't think , my dear , what a relief it is to see a homely face again . ''"
"Maimie repeated this story , and it fortified Brownie tremendously , indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the Duke would choose her ."
"So she scudded away up the ribbon , calling out to Maimie not to follow lest the Queen should mischief her ."
"But Maimie 's curiosity tugged her forward , and presently at the seven Spanish chestnuts , she saw a wonderful light ."
"She crept forward until she was quite near it , and then she peeped from behind a tree ."
"The light , which was as high as your head above the ground , was composed of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other , and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring ."
"There were thousands of little people looking on , but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them ."
"It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment : yet out of love his dusky grace still was : you could see it by the shamed looks of the Queen and court -LRB- though they pretended not to care -RRB- , by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on , and by his own most dreary face ."
"Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke 's heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry , and she was particularly sorry for the Cupids , who stood in their fools ' caps in obscure places and , every time they heard that `` Cold , quite cold , '' bowed their disgraced little heads ."
"She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan , and I may as well tell you now why he was so late that night ."
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
They forget all the steps when they are sad and remember them again when they are merry .
"David tells me that fairies never say `` We feel happy '' : what they say is , `` We feel dancey . ''"
"Well , they were looking very undancy indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , `` Cold , qui -- , '' when he stopped abruptly ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then put his ear to it ."
`` Bless my soul ! ''
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled and looked as if he would like to run away ."
`` Good gracious me ! ''
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful !
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , `` My Lord Duke , '' said the physician elatedly , `` I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . ''"
"Jack folded his arms and departed like a warrior borne from the battle-field , to be chaffed unmercifully for a `` pepper-pot , '' while Gus made him comfortable in his own room ."
`` I heard once of a boy who threw a fork at his brother and put his eye out .
"But he did n't mean to , and the brother forgave him , and he never did so any more , '' observed Jill , in a pensive tone , wishing to show that she felt all the dangers of impatience , but was sorry for the culprit ."
`` Did the boy ever forgive himself ? ''
asked Mrs. Minot .
"`` No , 'm ; I suppose not ."
"But Jack did n't hit Frank , and feels real sorry , I know . ''"
"`` He might have , and hurt him very much ."
"Our actions are in our own hands , but the consequences of them are not ."
"Remember that , my dear , and think twice before you do anything . ''"
"`` Yes , 'm , I will ; '' and Jill composed herself to consider what missionaries usually did when the natives hurled tomahawks and boomerangs at one another , and defied the rulers of the land ."
"Mrs. Minot wrote one page of a new letter , then stopped , pushed her papers about , thought a little , and finally got up , saying , as if she found it impossible to resist the yearning of her heart for the naughty boy , -- `` I am going to see if Jack is covered up , he is so helpless , and liable to take cold ."
Do n't stir till I come back . ''
"`` No , 'm , I wo n't . ''"
"Away went the tender parent to find her son studying Caesar for dear life , and all the more amiable for the little gust which had blown away the temporary irritability ."
"The brothers were often called `` Thunder and Lightning , '' because Frank lowered and growled and was a good while clearing up , while Jack 's temper came and went like a flash , and the air was all the clearer for the escape of dangerous electricity ."
"Of course Mamma had to stop and deliver a little lecture , illustrated by sad tales of petulant boys , and punctuated with kisses which took off the edge of these afflicting narratives ."
"Jill meantime meditated morally on the superiority of her own good temper over the hasty one of her dear playmate , and just when she was feeling unusually uplifted and secure , alas !"
"like so many of us , she fell , in the most deplorable manner ."
"Glancing about the room for something to do , she saw a sheet of paper lying exactly out of reach , where it had fluttered from the table unperceived ."
"At first her eye rested on it as carelessly as it did on the stray stamp Frank had dropped ; then , as if one thing suggested the other , she took it into her head that the paper was Frank 's composition , or , better still , a note to Annette , for the two corresponded when absence or weather prevented the daily meeting at school ."
`` Would n't it be fun to keep it till he gives back Jack 's stamps ?
"It would plague him so if it was a note , and I do believe it is , for compo 's do n't begin with two words on one side ."
"I 'll get it , and Jack and I will plan some way to pay him off , cross thing ! ''"
"Forgetting her promise not to stir , also how dishonorable it was to read other people 's letters , Jill caught up the long-handled hook , often in use now , and tried to pull the paper nearer ."
"It would not come at once , for a seam in the carpet held it , and Jill feared to tear or crumple it if she was not very careful ."
"The hook was rather heavy and long for her to manage , and Jack usually did the fishing , so she was not very skilful ; and just as she was giving a particularly quick jerk , she lost her balance , fell off the sofa , and dropped the pole with a bang ."
"`` Oh , my back ! ''"
"was all she could think or say as she felt the jar all through her little body , and a corresponding fear in her guilty little mind that someone would come and find out the double mischief she had been at ."
"For a moment she lay quite still to recover from the shock , then as the pain passed she began to wonder how she should get back , and looked about her to see if she could do it alone ."
"She thought she could , as the sofa was near and she had improved so much that she could sit up a little if the doctor would have let her ."
"She was gathering herself together for the effort , when , within arm 's reach now , she saw the tempting paper , and seized it with glee , for in spite of her predicament she did want to tease Frank ."
"asked Gus , when the song ended , for Ed had not returned to school in the autumn , but had gone into a store in the city ."
"`` Dull ; things will look up toward spring , they say ."
"I get on well enough , but I miss you fellows dreadfully ; '' and Ed put a hand on the broad shoulder of each friend , as if he longed to be a school-boy again ."
"`` Better give it up and go to college with me next year , '' said Frank , who was preparing for Boston University , while Gus fitted for Harvard ."
"`` No ; I 've chosen business , and I mean to stick to it , so do n't you unsettle my mind ."
Have you practised that March ? ''
"asked Ed , turning to a gayer subject , for he had his little troubles , but always looked on the bright side of things ."
"`` Skating is so good , I do n't get much time ."
"Come early , and we 'll have a turn at it . ''"
`` I will .
Must run home now . ''
`` Pretty cold loafing here . ''
`` Mail is in by this time . ''
"And with these artless excuses the three boys leaped off the posts , as if one spring moved them , as a group of girls came chattering down the path ."
"The blue cloud floated away beside Frank , the scarlet feather marched off with the Admiral , while the fur cap nodded to the gray hat as two happy faces smiled at each other ."
"The same thing often happened , for twice a-day the streets were full of young couples walking to and from school together , smiled at by the elders , and laughed at by the less susceptible boys and girls , who went alone or trooped along in noisy groups ."
"The prudent mothers had tried to stop this guileless custom , but found it very difficult , as the fathers usually sympathized with their sons , and dismissed the matter with the comfortable phrase , `` Never mind ; boys will be boys . ''"
"`` Not forever , '' returned the anxious mammas , seeing the tall lads daily grow more manly , and the pretty daughters fast learning to look demure when certain names were mentioned ."
"It could not be stopped without great parental sternness and the danger of deceit , for co-education will go on outside of school if not inside , and the safest way is to let sentiment and study go hand in hand , with teachers and parents to direct and explain the great lesson all are the better for learning soon or late ."
"So the elders had to give in , acknowledging that this sudden readiness to go to school was a comfort , that the new sort of gentle emulation worked wonders in lazy girls and boys , and that watching these `` primrose friendships '' bud , blossom , and die painless deaths , gave a little touch of romance to their own work-a-day lives ."
"`` On the whole I 'd rather have my sons walking , playing , and studying with bright , well-mannered girls , than always knocking about with rough boys , '' said Mrs. Minot at one of the Mothers ' Meetings , where the good ladies met to talk over their children , and help one another to do their duty by them ."
"`` I find that Gus is more gentle with his sisters since Juliet took him in hand , for he wants to stand well with her , and they report him if he troubles them ."
"I really see no harm in the little friendship , though I never had any such when I was a girl , '' said Mrs. Burton , who adored her one boy and was his confidante ."
"`` My Merry seems to be contented with her brothers so far , but I should n't wonder if I had my hands full by and by , '' added Mrs. Grant , who already foresaw that her sweet little daughter would be sought after as soon as she should lengthen her skirts and turn up her bonny brown hair ."
"Molly Loo had no mother to say a word for her , but she settled matters for herself by holding fast to Merry , and declaring that she would have no escort but faithful Boo ."
"It is necessary to dwell a moment upon this new amusement , because it was not peculiar to Harmony Village , but appears everywhere as naturally as the game parties and croquet which have taken the place of the husking frolics and apple-bees of olden times , and it is impossible to dodge the subject if one attempts to write of boys and girls as they really are nowadays ."
"`` Here , my hero , see how you like this ."
"If it suits , you will be ready to march as soon as the doctor gives the word , '' said Ralph , coming into the Bird Room that evening with a neat little crutch under his arm ."
"`` Ha , ha , that looks fine !"
"I 'd like to try it right off , but I wo n't till I get leave ."
"Did you make it yourself , Ral ? ''"
"asked Jack , handling it with delight , as he sat bolt upright , with his leg on a rest , for he was getting on capitally now ."
The Thrush 's Nest Shelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to be .
He was a poet ; and they are never exactly grown-up .
"They are people who despise money except what you need for to-day , and he had all that and five pounds over ."
"So , when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens , he made a paper boat of his bank-note , and sent it sailing on the Serpentine ."
"It reached the island at night : and the look-out brought it to Solomon Caw , who thought at first that it was the usual thing , a message from a lady , saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one ."
"They always ask for the best one he has , and if he likes the letter he sends one from Class A , but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed ."
"Sometimes he sends none at all , and at another time he sends a nestful ; it all depends on the mood you catch him in ."
"He likes you to leave it all to him , and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time , he is almost sure to send another girl ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
`` Preposterous ! ''
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a play-thing ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
Nor was this all that Peter did to pin the powerful old fellow 's good will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by-and-by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper and a bootlace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , `` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , '' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"`` Consider , '' he said at last , `` how warm the mud makes the nest . ''"
"How long this might have gone on I do not know , for they seemed to have no sense of time : but at last the captain of the ship , who seemed near beside himself -LRB- and no great wonder -RRB- in the midst of this crying and confusion , came to the side and begged us to depart ."
"Thereupon Neil sheered off ; and the chief singer in our boat struck into a melancholy air , which was presently taken up both by the emigrants and their friends upon the beach , so that it sounded from all sides like a lament for the dying ."
"I saw the tears run down the cheeks of the men and women in the boat , even as they bent at the oars ; and the circumstances and the music of the song -LRB- which is one called `` Lochaber no more '' -RRB- were highly affecting even to myself ."
"At Kinlochaline I got Neil Roy upon one side on the beach , and said I made sure he was one of Appin 's men ."
`` And what for no ? ''
said he .
"`` I am seeking somebody , '' said I ; `` and it comes in my mind that you will have news of him ."
Alan Breck Stewart is his name . ''
"And very foolishly , instead of showing him the button , I sought to pass a shilling in his hand ."
At this he drew back .
"`` I am very much affronted , '' he said ; `` and this is not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all ."
"The man you ask for is in France ; but if he was in my sporran , '' says he , `` and your belly full of shillings , I would not hurt a hair upon his body . ''"
"I saw I had gone the wrong way to work , and without wasting time upon apologies , showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm ."
"`` Aweel , aweel , '' said Neil ; `` and I think ye might have begun with that end of the stick , whatever !"
"But if ye are the lad with the silver button , all is well , and I have the word to see that ye come safe ."
"But if ye will pardon me to speak plainly , '' says he , `` there is a name that you should never take into your mouth , and that is the name of Alan Breck ; and there is a thing that ye would never do , and that is to offer your dirty money to a Hieland shentleman . ''"
It was not very easy to apologise ; for I could scarce tell him -LRB- what was the truth -RRB- that I had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman until he told me so .
"Neil on his part had no wish to prolong his dealings with me , only to fulfil his orders and be done with it ; and he made haste to give me my route ."
"This was to lie the night in Kinlochaline in the public inn ; to cross Morven the next day to Ardgour , and lie the night in the house of one John of the Claymore , who was warned that I might come ; the third day , to be set across one loch at Corran and another at Balachulish , and then ask my way to the house of James of the Glens , at Aucharn in Duror of Appin ."
"There was a good deal of ferrying , as you hear ; the sea in all this part running deep into the mountains and winding about their roots ."
"It makes the country strong to hold and difficult to travel , but full of prodigious wild and dreadful prospects ."
"I had some other advice from Neil : to speak with no one by the way , to avoid Whigs , Campbells , and the `` red-soldiers ; '' to leave the road and lie in a bush if I saw any of the latter coming , `` for it was never chancy to meet in with them ; '' and in brief , to conduct myself like a robber or a Jacobite agent , as perhaps Neil thought me ."
"The inn at Kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs were styed in , full of smoke , vermin , and silent Highlanders ."
"I was not only discontented with my lodging , but with myself for my mismanagement of Neil , and thought I could hardly be worse off ."
"But very wrongly , as I was soon to see ; for I had not been half an hour at the inn -LRB- standing in the door most of the time , to ease my eyes from the peat smoke -RRB- when a thunderstorm came close by , the springs broke in a little hill on which the inn stood , and one end of the house became a running water ."
"Places of public entertainment were bad enough all over Scotland in those days ; yet it was a wonder to myself , when I had to go from the fireside to the bed in which I slept , wading over the shoes ."
"Early in my next day 's journey I overtook a little , stout , solemn man , walking very slowly with his toes turned out , sometimes reading in a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger , and dressed decently and plainly in something of a clerical style ."
"This I found to be another catechist , but of a different order from the blind man of Mull : being indeed one of those sent out by the Edinburgh Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge , to evangelise the more savage places of the Highlands ."
"His name was Henderland ; he spoke with the broad south-country tongue , which I was beginning to weary for the sound of ; and besides common countryship , we soon found we had a more particular bond of interest ."
"For my good friend , the minister of Essendean , had translated into the Gaelic in his by-time a number of hymns and pious books which Henderland used in his work , and held in great esteem ."
"Indeed , it was one of these he was carrying and reading when we met ."
"We fell in company at once , our ways lying together as far as to Kingairloch ."
"No service was too humble , and Tommy and Ned came to blows before they could decide which should have the honor of blacking her little boots ."
"Nan was especially benefited by a week in the society of a well-bred lady , though such a very small one ; for Bess would look at her with a mixture of wonder and alarm in her great blue eyes when the hoyden screamed and romped ; and she shrunk from her as if she thought her a sort of wild animal ."
Warm-hearted Nan felt this very much .
"She said at first , `` Pooh !"
I do n't care ! ''
"But she did care , and was so hurt when Bess said , `` I love my tuzzin best , tause she is twiet , '' that she shook poor Daisy till her teeth chattered in her head , and then fled to the barn to cry dismally ."
In that general refuge for perturbed spirits she found comfort and good counsel from some source or other .
Perhaps the swallows from their mud-built nests overhead twittered her a little lecture on the beauty of gentleness .
"However that might have been , she came out quite subdued , and carefully searched the orchard for a certain kind of early apple that Bess liked because it was sweet and small and rosy ."
"Armed with this peace-offering , she approached the little Princess , and humbly presented it ."
"To her great joy it was graciously accepted , and when Daisy gave Nan a forgiving kiss , Bess did likewise , as if she felt that she had been too severe , and desired to apologize ."
"After this they played pleasantly together , and Nan enjoyed the royal favor for days ."
"To be sure she felt a little like a wild bird in a pretty cage at first , and occasionally had to slip out to stretch her wings in a long flight , or to sing at the top of her voice , where neither would disturb the plump turtle-dove Daisy , nor the dainty golden canary Bess ."
"But it did her good ; for , seeing how every one loved the little Princess for her small graces and virtues , she began to imitate her , because Nan wanted much love , and tried hard to win it ."
"Not a boy in the house but felt the pretty child 's influence , and was improved by it without exactly knowing how or why , for babies can work miracles in the hearts that love them ."
"Poor Billy found infinite satisfaction in staring at her , and though she did not like it she permitted without a frown , after she had been made to understand that he was not quite like the others , and on that account must be more kindly treated ."
"Dick and Dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles , the only thing they knew how to make , and she accepted but never used them ."
"Rob served her like a little lover , and Teddy followed her like a pet dog ."
"Jack she did not like , because he was afflicted with warts and had a harsh voice ."
"Stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily , and George tried hard not to gobble , that he might not disgust the dainty little lady opposite ."
Ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when he was discovered tormenting some unhappy field-mice .
"Goldilocks could never forget the sad spectacle , and retired behind her veil when he approached , waving him away with an imperious little hand , and crying , in a tone of mingled grief and anger , `` No , I tar n't love him ; he tut the poor mouses ' little tails off , and they queeked ! ''"
"Daisy promptly abdicated when Bess came , and took the humble post of chief cook , while Nan was first maid of honor ; Emil was chancellor of the exchequer , and spent the public monies lavishly in getting up spectacles that cost whole ninepences ."
"Franz was prime minister , and directed her affairs of state , planned royal progresses through the kingdom , and kept foreign powers in order ."
"Demi was her philosopher , and fared much better than such gentlemen usually do among crowned heads ."
"Dan was her standing army , and defended her territories gallantly ; Tommy was court fool , and Nat a tuneful Rizzio to this innocent little Mary ."
"Uncle Fritz and Aunt Jo enjoyed this peaceful episode , and looked on at the pretty play in which the young folk unconsciously imitated their elders , without adding the tragedy that is so apt to spoil the dramas acted on the larger stage ."
"`` They teach us quite as much as we teach them , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
`` Bless the dears !
"they never guess how many hints they give us as to the best way of managing them , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` I think you were right about the good effect of having girls among the boys .
"Nan has stirred up Daisy , and Bess is teaching the little bears how to behave better than we can ."
"I agree with him , and if you want an example of what girls can do , why , look at Jill ."
"She 's young , I know , but a first-rate scholar for her age ."
"As for pluck , she is as brave as a boy , and almost as smart at running , rowing , and so on ."
"Of course , she ca n't play ball -- no girl can ; their arms are not made right to throw -- but she can catch remarkably well ."
I 'll say that for her .
"Now , if she and Mabel -- and -- and -- some others I could name , are so clever and strong at the beginning , I do n't see why they should n't keep up and go along with us all through ."
"I 'm willing , and will do what I can to help other fellows ' sisters as I 'd like to have them help mine ."
"And I 'll punch their heads if they do n't ; '' and Gus subsided , assured , by a burst of applause , that his manly way of stating the case met with general approval ."
"`` We shall be happy to hear from our senior member if he will honor us with a few remarks , '' said Frank , with a bow to Ralph ."
"No one ever knew whom he would choose to personate , for he never spoke in his own character ."
"Now he rose slowly , put one hand in his bosom , and fixing his eye sternly on Grif , who was doing something suspicious with a pin , gave them a touch of Sergeant Buzfuz , from the Pickwick trial , thinking that the debate was not likely to throw much light on the subject under discussion ."
"In the midst of this appeal to `` Me lud and gentlemen of the jury , '' he suddenly paused , smoothed his hair down upon his forehead , rolled up his eyes , and folding his hands , droned out Mr. Chadband 's sermon on Peace , delivered over poor Jo , and ending with the famous lines : -- `` Oh , running stream of sparkling joy , To be a glorious human boy ! ''"
"Then , setting his hair erect with one comprehensive sweep , he caught up his coat-skirts over his arm , and , assuming a parliamentary attitude , burst into a comical medley , composed of extracts from Jefferson Brick 's and Lafayette Kettle 's speeches , and Elijah Pogram 's Defiance , from `` Martin Chuzzlewit . ''"
"Gazing at Gus , who was convulsed with suppressed merriment , he thundered forth : -- `` In the name of our common country , sir , in the name of that righteous cause in which we are jined , and in the name of the star-spangled banner , I thank you for your eloquent and categorical remarks ."
"You , sir , are a model of a man fresh from Natur 's mould ."
A true-born child of this free hemisphere ; verdant as the mountains of our land ; bright and flowin ' as our mineral Licks ; unspiled by fashion as air our boundless perearers .
Rough you may be ; so air our Barrs .
Wild you may be ; so air our Buffalers .
"But , sir , you air a Child of Freedom , and your proud answer to the Tyrant is , that your bright home is in the Settin ' Sun ."
"And , sir , if any man denies this fact , though it be the British Lion himself , I defy him ."
Let me have him here ! ''
"-- smiting the table , and causing the inkstand to skip -- `` here , upon this sacred altar !"
"Here , upon the ancestral ashes cemented with the glorious blood poured out like water on the plains of Chickabiddy Lick ."
"Alone I dare that Lion , and tell him that Freedom 's hand once twisted in his mane , he rolls a corse before me , and the Eagles of the Great Republic scream , Ha , ha ! ''"
"By this time the boys were rolling about in fits of laughter ; even sober Frank was red and breathless , and Jack lay back , feebly squealing , as he could laugh no more ."
"In a moment Ralph was as meek as a Quaker , and sat looking about him with a mildly astonished air , as if inquiring the cause of such unseemly mirth ."
"A knock at the door produced a lull , and in came a maid with apples ."
"`` Time 's up ; fall to and make yourselves comfortable , '' was the summary way in which the club was released from its sterner duties and permitted to unbend its mighty mind for a social half-hour , chiefly devoted to whist , with an Indian war-dance as a closing ceremony ."
Chapter X .
"The Dramatic Club While Jack was hopping gayly about on his crutches , poor Jill was feeling the effects of her second fall , and instead of sitting up , as she hoped to do after six weeks of rest , she was ordered to lie on a board for two hours each day ."
"Not an easy penance , by any means , for the board was very hard , and she could do nothing while she lay there , as it did not slope enough to permit her to read without great fatigue of both eyes and hands ."
"So the little martyr spent her first hour of trial in sobbing , the second in singing , for just as her mother and Mrs. Minot were deciding in despair that neither she nor they could bear it , Jill suddenly broke out into a merry chorus she used to hear her father sing : -- `` Faut jouer le mirliton , Faut jouer le mirlitir , Faut jouer le mirliter , Mir -- li -- ton . ''"
"` Mumps one pound , that is what I have put down , but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings -- do n't speak -- measles one five , German measles half a guinea , makes two fifteen six -- do n't waggle your finger -- whooping-cough , say fifteen shillings ' -- and so on it went , and it added up differently each time ; but at last Wendy just got through , with mumps reduced to twelve six , and the two kinds of measles treated as one ."
"There was the same excitement over John , and Michael had even a narrower squeak ; but both were kept , and soon you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom 's Kindergarten school , accompanied by their nurse ."
"Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so , and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours ; so , of course , they had a nurse ."
"As they were poor , owing to the amount of milk the children drank , this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog , called Nana , who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her ."
"She had always thought children important , however , and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens , where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators , and was much hated by careless nursemaids , whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses ."
She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse .
How thorough she was at bath-time ; and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry .
Of course her kennel was in the nursery .
She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking round your throat .
"She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf , and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs , and so on ."
"It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school , walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved , and butting them back into line if they strayed ."
"On John 's footer days she never once forgot his sweater , and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain ."
There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom 's school where the nurses wait .
"They sat on forms , while Nana lay on the floor , but that was the only difference ."
"They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves , and she despised their light talk ."
"She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling 's friends , but if they did come she first whipped off Michael 's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding , and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John 's hair ."
"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly , and Mr. Darling knew it , yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked ."
He had his position in the city to consider .
Nana also troubled him in another way .
He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him . '
"I know she admires you tremendously , George , ' Mrs. Darling would assure him , and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father ."
"Lovely dances followed , in which the only other servant , Liza , was sometimes allowed to join ."
"Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid 's cap , though she had sworn , when engaged , that she would never see ten again ."
The gaiety of those romps !
"And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling , who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss , and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it ."
There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan .
Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children 's minds .
"It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning , repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day ."
"If you could keep awake -LRB- but of course you ca n't -RRB- you would see your own mother doing this , and you would find it very interesting to watch her ."
It is quite like tidying up drawers .
"You would see her on her knees , I expect , lingering humorously over some of your contents , wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up , making discoveries sweet and not so sweet , pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten , and hurriedly stowing that out of sight ."
"When you wake in the morning , the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind ; and on the top , beautifully aired , are spread out your prettier thoughts , ready for you to put on ."
"Charmed by this suggestion , the children arranged the doomed village , laid a line of coals along the main street , and then sat down to watch the conflagration ."
"It was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint , but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up , fired a tree of the palm species , which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion , and in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily ."
"The wooden population stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads , as they were , till they also caught and blazed away without a cry ."
"It took some time to reduce the town to ashes , and the lookers-on enjoyed the spectacle immensely , cheering as each house fell , dancing like wild Indians when the steeple flamed aloft , and actually casting one wretched little churn-shaped lady , who had escaped to the suburbs , into the very heart of the fire ."
"The superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a degree , that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration , and before it had time even to roast , he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre ."
"Of course she did not like it , and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer ."
"Being covered with kid , she did not blaze , but did what was worse , she squirmed ."
"First one leg curled up , then the other , in a very awful and lifelike manner ; next she flung her arms over her head as if in great agony ; her head itself turned on her shoulders , her glass eyes fell out , and with one final writhe of her whole body , she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town ."
This unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy half out of his little wits .
"He looked , then screamed and fled toward the house , roaring `` Marmar '' at the top of his voice ."
"Mrs. Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue , but Teddy could only cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about `` poor Bella hurted , '' `` a dreat fire , '' and `` all the dollies dorn . ''"
"Fearing some dire mishap , his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action , where she found the blind worshippers of Kitty-mouse mourning over the charred remains of the lost darling ."
`` What have you been at ?
"Tell me all about it , '' said Mrs. Jo , composing herself to listen patiently , for the culprits looked so penitent , she forgave them beforehand ."
"With some reluctance Demi explained their play , and Aunt Jo laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks , the children were so solemn , and the play was so absurd ."
`` I thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this .
"If I had any Kitty-mouse I 'd have a good one who liked you to play in safe pleasant ways , and not destroy and frighten ."
"Just see what a ruin you have made ; all Daisy 's pretty dolls , Demi 's soldiers , and Rob 's new village beside poor Teddy 's pet lamb , and dear old Annabella ."
"I shall have to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes of toys , `` The children of Holland take pleasure in making , What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking . ''"
`` Only I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston . ''
"`` We never will again , truly , truly ! ''"
"cried the repentant little sinners , much abashed at this reproof ."
"`` Demi told us to , '' said Rob ."
"`` Well , I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people , who had altars and things , and so I wanted to be like them , only I had n't any live creatures to sackerryfice , so we burnt up our toys . ''"
"`` Dear me , that is something like the bean story , '' said Aunt Jo , laughing again ."
"`` Tell about it , '' suggested Daisy , to change the subject ."
"`` Once there was a poor woman who had three or four little children , and she used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work , to keep them safe ."
"On day when she was going away she said , ` Now , my dears , do n't let baby fall out of window , do n't play with the matches , and do n't put beans up your noses . '"
"Now the children had never dreamed of doing that last thing , but she put it into their heads , and the minute she was gone , they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of beans , just to see how it felt , and she found them all crying when she came home . ''"
`` Did it hurt ? ''
"asked Rob , with such intense interest that his mother hastily added a warning sequel , lest a new edition of the bean story should appear in her own family ."
"`` Very much , as I know , for when my mother told me this story , I was so silly that I went and tried it myself ."
"Frank was considered a remarkably well-bred and proper lad , and rather prided himself on his good reputation , for he never got into scrapes like the other fellows ."
"Well , hardly ever , for we must confess that at rare intervals his besetting sin overcame his prudence , and he proved himself an erring , human boy ."
"Steam-engines had been his idols for years , and they alone could lure him from the path of virtue ."
"Once , in trying to investigate the mechanism of a toy specimen , which had its little boiler and ran about whistling and puffing in the most delightful way , he nearly set the house afire by the sparks that dropped on the straw carpet ."
"Another time , in trying experiments with the kitchen tea-kettle , he blew himself up , and the scars of that explosion he still carried on his hands ."
"He was long past such childish amusements now , but his favorite haunt was the engine-house of the new railroad , where he observed the habits of his pets with never-failing interest , and cultivated the good-will of stokers and brakemen till they allowed him many liberties , and were rather flattered by the admiration expressed for their iron horses by a young gentleman who liked them better even than his Greek and Latin ."
"There was not much business doing on this road as yet , and the two cars of the passenger-trains were often nearly empty , though full freight-trains rolled from the factory to the main road , of which this was only a branch ."
"So things went on in a leisurely manner , which gave Frank many opportunities of pursuing his favorite pastime ."
"He soon knew all about No. 11 , his pet engine , and had several rides on it with Bill , the engineer , so that he felt at home there , and privately resolved that when he was a rich man he would have a road of his own , and run trains as often as he liked ."
"Gus took less interest than his friend in the study of steam , but usually accompanied him when he went over after school to disport himself in the engine-house , interview the stoker , or see if there was anything new in the way of brakes ."
"One afternoon they found No. 11 on the side-track , puffing away as if enjoying a quiet smoke before starting ."
"No cars were attached , and no driver was to be seen , for Bill was off with the other men behind the station-house , helping the expressman , whose horse had backed down a bank and upset the wagon ."
"`` Good chance for a look at the old lady , '' said Frank , speaking of the engine as Bill did , and jumping aboard with great satisfaction , followed by Gus ."
"`` I 'd give ten dollars if I could run her up to the bend and back , '' he added , fondly touching the bright brass knobs and glancing at the fire with a critical eye ."
"`` You could n't do it alone , '' answered Gus , sitting down on the grimy little perch , willing to indulge his mate 's amiable weakness ."
`` Give me leave to try ?
"Steam is up , and I could do it as easy as not ; '' and Frank put his hand on the throttle-valve , as if daring Gus to give the word ."
`` Fire up and make her hum ! ''
"laughed Gus , quoting Bill 's frequent order to his mate , but with no idea of being obeyed ."
`` All right ; I 'll just roll her up to the switch and back again .
"I 've often done it with Bill ; '' and Frank cautiously opened the throttle-valve , threw back the lever , and the great thing moved with a throb and a puff ."
"`` Steady , old fellow , or you 'll come to grief ."
"Here , do n't open that ! ''"
"shouted Gus , for just at that moment Joe appeared at the switch , looking ready for mischief ."
"`` Wish he would ; no train for twenty minutes , and we could run up to the bend as well as not , '' said Frank , getting excited with the sense of power , as the monster obeyed his hand so entirely that it was impossible to resist prolonging the delight ."
"`` By George , he has !"
Stop her !
Back her !
"Hold on , Frank ! ''"
"cried Gus , as Joe , only catching the words `` Open that ! ''"
"obeyed , without the least idea that they would dare to leave the siding ."
"But they did , for Frank rather lost his head for a minute , and out upon the main track rolled No. 11 as quietly as a well-trained horse taking a familiar road ."
"Then I told him that , sure enough , I had a pistol in my pocket as well as he , and if he did not strike across the hill due south I would even blow his brains out ."
"He became at once very polite , and after trying to soften me for some time , but quite in vain , he cursed me once more in Gaelic and took himself off ."
"I watched him striding along , through bog and brier , tapping with his stick , until he turned the end of a hill and disappeared in the next hollow ."
"Then I struck on again for Torosay , much better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning ."
"This was an unlucky day ; and these two , of whom I had just rid myself , one after the other , were the two worst men I met with in the Highlands ."
"At Torosay , on the Sound of Mull and looking over to the mainland of Morven , there was an inn with an innkeeper , who was a Maclean , it appeared , of a very high family ; for to keep an inn is thought even more genteel in the Highlands than it is with us , perhaps as partaking of hospitality , or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken ."
"He spoke good English , and finding me to be something of a scholar , tried me first in French , where he easily beat me , and then in the Latin , in which I do n't know which of us did best ."
"This pleasant rivalry put us at once upon friendly terms ; and I sat up and drank punch with him -LRB- or to be more correct , sat up and watched him drink it -RRB- , until he was so tipsy that he wept upon my shoulder ."
"I tried him , as if by accident , with a sight of Alan 's button ; but it was plain he had never seen or heard of it ."
"Indeed , he bore some grudge against the family and friends of Ardshiel , and before he was drunk he read me a lampoon , in very good Latin , but with a very ill meaning , which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house ."
"When I told him of my catechist , he shook his head , and said I was lucky to have got clear off ."
"`` That is a very dangerous man , '' he said ; `` Duncan Mackiegh is his name ; he can shoot by the ear at several yards , and has been often accused of highway robberies , and once of murder . ''"
"`` The cream of it is , '' says I , `` that he called himself a catechist . ''"
`` And why should he not ? ''
"says he , `` when that is what he is ."
It was Maclean of Duart gave it to him because he was blind .
"But perhaps it was a peety , '' says my host , `` for he is always on the road , going from one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion ; and , doubtless , that is a great temptation to the poor man . ''"
"At last , when my landlord could drink no more , he showed me to a bed , and I lay down in very good spirits ; having travelled the greater part of that big and crooked Island of Mull , from Earraid to Torosay , fifty miles as the crow flies , and -LRB- with my wanderings -RRB- much nearer a hundred , in four days and with little fatigue ."
Indeed I was by far in better heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been at the beginning .
CHAPTER XVI THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON : ACROSS MORVEN There is a regular ferry from Torosay to Kinlochaline on the mainland .
"Both shores of the Sound are in the country of the strong clan of the Macleans , and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all of that clan ."
"The skipper of the boat , on the other hand , was called Neil Roy Macrob ; and since Macrob was one of the names of Alan 's clansmen , and Alan himself had sent me to that ferry , I was eager to come to private speech of Neil Roy ."
"In the crowded boat this was of course impossible , and the passage was a very slow affair ."
"There was no wind , and as the boat was wretchedly equipped , we could pull but two oars on one side , and one on the other ."
"The men gave way , however , with a good will , the passengers taking spells to help them , and the whole company giving the time in Gaelic boat-songs ."
"And what with the songs , and the sea-air , and the good-nature and spirit of all concerned , and the bright weather , the passage was a pretty thing to have seen ."
But there was one melancholy part .
"In the mouth of Loch Aline we found a great sea-going ship at anchor ; and this I supposed at first to be one of the King 's cruisers which were kept along that coast , both summer and winter , to prevent communication with the French ."
"As we got a little nearer , it became plain she was a ship of merchandise ; and what still more puzzled me , not only her decks , but the sea-beach also , were quite black with people , and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them ."
"Yet nearer , and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning , the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart ."
Then I understood this was an emigrant ship bound for the American colonies .
"We put the ferry-boat alongside , and the exiles leaned over the bulwarks , weeping and reaching out their hands to my fellow-passengers , among whom they counted some near friends ."
"I had no beans , so I took some little pebbles , and poked several into my nose ."
"I did not like it at all , and wanted to take them out again very soon , but one would not come , and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been that I went for hours with the stone hurting me very much ."
"At last the pain got so bad I had to tell , and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came ."
"Then I was put in a chair and held tight , Rob , while he used his ugly little pincers till the stone hopped out ."
Dear me !
"how my wretched little nose did ache , and how people laughed at me ! ''"
"and Mrs. Jo shook her head in a dismal way , as if the memory of her sufferings was too much for her ."
Rob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the warning to heart .
"Demi proposed that they should bury poor Annabella , and in the interest of the funeral Teddy forgot his fright ."
"Daisy was soon consoled by another batch of dolls from Aunt Amy , and the Naughty Kitty-mouse seemed to be appeased by the last offerings , for she tormented them no more ."
"`` Brops '' was the name of a new and absorbing play , invented by Bangs ."
"As this interesting animal is not to be found in any Zoological Garden , unless Du Chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of Africa , I will mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits , for the benefit of inquiring minds ."
"The Brop is a winged quadruped , with a human face of a youthful and merry aspect ."
"When it walks the earth it grunts , when it soars it gives a shrill hoot , occasionally it goes erect , and talks good English ."
"Its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a shawl , sometimes red , sometimes blue , often plaid , and , strange to say , they frequently change skins with one another ."
On their heads they have a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamp-lighter .
"Wings of the same substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly ; this is never very far from the ground , as they usually fall with violence if they attempt any lofty flights ."
"They browse over the earth , but can sit up and eat like the squirrel ."
"Their favorite nourishment is the seed-cake ; apples also are freely taken , and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food is scarce ."
"They live in dens , where they have a sort of nest , much like a clothes-basket , in which the little Brops play till their wings are grown ."
"These singular animals quarrel at times , and it is on these occasions that they burst into human speech , call each other names , cry , scold , and sometimes tear off horns and skin , declaring fiercely that they `` wo n't play . ''"
"The few privileged persons who have studied them are inclined to think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey , the sphinx , the roc , and the queer creatures seen by the famous Peter Wilkins ."
"This game was a great favorite , and the younger children beguiled many a rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery , acting like little bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs ."
"To be sure , it was rather hard upon clothes , particularly trouser-knees , and jacket-elbows ; but Mrs. Bhaer only said , as she patched and darned , `` We do things just as foolish , and not half so harmless ."
"If I could get as much happiness out of it as the little dears do , I 'd be a Brop myself . ''"
"Nat 's favorite amusements were working in his garden , and sitting in the willow-tree with his violin , for that green nest was a fairy world to him , and there he loved to perch , making music like a happy bird ."
"The lads called him `` Old Chirper , '' because he was always humming , whistling , or fiddling , and they often stopped a minute in their work or play to listen to the soft tones of the violin , which seemed to lead a little orchestra of summer sounds ."
"The birds appeared to regard him as one of themselves , and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to watch him with their quick bright eyes ."
"The robins in the apple-tree near by evidently considered him a friend , for the father bird hunted insects close beside him , and the little mother brooded as confidingly over her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who cheered her patient watch with his song ."
"The brown brook babbled and sparkled below him , the bees haunted the clover fields on either side , friendly faces peeped at him as they passed , the old house stretched its wide wings hospitably toward him , and with a blessed sense of rest and love and happiness , Nat dreamed for hours in this nook , unconscious what healthful miracles were being wrought upon him ."
"One listener he had who never tired , and to whom he was more than a mere schoolmate ."
"Poor Billy 's chief delight was to lie beside the brook , watching leaves and bits of foam dance by , listening dreamily to the music in the willow-tree ."
"`` One other fellow , '' after a pause ."
"`` Yes , I understand ; '' and Mr. Acton 's eye glanced at Joe with a look that seemed to say , `` I wish he 'd held his tongue . ''"
"A queer smile flitted over Jack 's face , for Joe was not the `` other fellow , '' and knew very little about it , excepting what he had seen when he was sent on an errand by Mr. Acton on Friday ."
"`` I wish you would explain the matter , John , for I am sure it is better than it seems , and it would be very hard to punish you when you do n't deserve it . ''"
"`` But I do deserve it ; I 've broken the rule , and I ought to be punished , '' said Jack , as if a good whipping would be easier to bear than this public cross-examination ."
"`` And you ca n't explain , or even say you are sorry or ashamed ? ''"
"asked Mr. Acton , hoping to surprise another fact out of the boy ."
"`` No , sir ; I ca n't ; I 'm not ashamed ; I 'm not sorry , and I 'd do it again to-morrow if I had to , '' cried Jack , losing patience , and looking as if he would not bear much more ."
"A groan from the boys greeted this bare-faced declaration , and Susy quite shivered at the idea of having taken two bites out of the apple of such a hardened desperado ."
"`` Think it over till to-morrow , and perhaps you will change your mind ."
"Remember that this is the last week of the month , and reports are given out next Friday , '' said Mr. Acton , knowing how much the boy prided himself on always having good ones to show his mother ."
"Poor Jack turned scarlet and bit his lips to keep them still , for he had forgotten this when he plunged into the affair which was likely to cost him dear ."
"Then the color faded away , the boyish face grew steady , and the honest eyes looked up at his teacher as he said very low , but all heard him , the room was so still , -- `` It is n't as bad as it looks , sir , but I ca n't say any more ."
"No one is to blame but me ; and I could n't help breaking the rule , for Jerry was going away , I had only that time , and I 'd promised to pay up , so I did . ''"
"Mr. Acton believed every word he said , and regretted that they had not been able to have it out privately , but he , too , must keep his promise and punish the offender , whoever he was ."
"`` Very well , you will lose your recess for a week , and this month 's report will be the first one in which behavior does not get the highest mark ."
You may go ; and I wish it understood that Master Minot is not to be troubled with questions till he chooses to set this matter right . ''
"Then the bell rang , the children trooped out , Mr. Acton went off without another word , and Jack was left alone to put up his books and hide a few tears that would come because Frank turned his eyes away from the imploring look cast upon him as the culprit came down from the platform , a disgraced boy ."
"Elder brothers are apt to be a little hard on younger ones , so it is not surprising that Frank , who was an eminently proper boy , was much cut up when Jack publicly confessed to dealings with Jerry , leaving it to be supposed that the worst half of the story remained untold ."
"He felt it his duty , therefore , to collar poor Jack when he came out , and talk to him all the way home , like a judge bent on getting at the truth by main force ."
"A kind word would have been very comforting , but the scolding was too much for Jack 's temper , so he turned dogged and would not say a word , though Frank threatened not to speak to him for a week ."
"At tea-time both boys were very silent , one looking grim , the other excited ."
"Frank stared sternly at his brother across the table , and no amount of marmalade sweetened or softened that reproachful look ."
"Jack defiantly crunched his toast , with occasional slashes at the butter , as if he must vent the pent-up emotions which half distracted him ."
"Of course , their mother saw that something was amiss , but did not allude to it , hoping that the cloud would blow over as so many did if left alone ."
"But this one did not , and when both refused cake , this sure sign of unusual perturbation made her anxious to know the cause ."
"As soon as tea was over , Jack retired with gloomy dignity to his own room , and Frank , casting away the paper he had been pretending to read , burst out with the whole story ."
"Mrs. Minot was as much surprised as he , but not angry , because , like most mothers , she was sure that her sons could not do anything very bad ."
"`` I will speak to him ; my boy wo n't refuse to give me some explanation , '' she said , when Frank had freed his mind with as much warmth as if Jack had broken all the ten commandments ."
`` He will .
"You often call me obstinate , but he is as pig-headed as a mule ; Joe only knows what he saw , old tell-tale !"
"and Jerry has left town , or I 'd have it out of him ."
"Another good plan , which David and I sometimes follow , is to stare them down ."
"After a long time they ca n't help winking , and then you know for certain that they are fairies ."
"There are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk , which is a famous gentle place , as spots frequented by fairies are called ."
Once twenty-four of them had an extraordinary adventure .
"They were a girls ' school out for a walk with the governess , and all wearing hyacinth gowns , when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth , and then they all stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths ."
"Unfortunately , what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to plant new flowers in that very bed ."
"They were wheeling a handcart with flowers in it , and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied ."
"`` Pity to lift them hyacinths , '' said the one man ."
"`` Duke 's orders , '' replied the other , and , having emptied the cart , they dug up the boarding-school and put the poor , terrified things in it in five rows ."
"Of course , neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that they were fairies , so they were carted far away to a potting-shed , out of which they escaped in the night without their shoes , but there was a great row about it among the parents , and the school was ruined ."
"As for their houses , it is no use looking for them , because they are the exact opposite of our houses ."
You can see our houses by day but you ca n't see them by dark .
"Well , you can see their houses by dark , but you ca n't see them by day , for they are the colour of night , and I never heard of anyone yet who could see night in the daytime ."
"This does not mean that they are black , for night has its colours just as day has , but ever so much brighter ."
Their blues and reds and greens are like ours with a light behind them .
"The palace is entirely built of many-coloured glasses , and is quite the loveliest of all royal residences , but the queen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see what she is doing ."
"They are very inquisitive folk , and press quite hard against the glass , and that is why their noses are mostly snubby ."
"The streets are miles long and very twisty , and have paths on each side made of bright worsted ."
"The birds used to steal the worsted for their nests , but a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end ."
One of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they never do anything useful .
"When the first baby laughed for the first time , his laugh broke into a million pieces , and they all went skipping about ."
That was the beginning of fairies .
"They look tremendously busy , you know , as if they had not a moment to spare , but if you were to ask them what they are doing , they could not tell you in the least ."
"They are frightfully ignorant , and everything they do is make-believe ."
"They have a postman , but he never calls except at Christmas with his little box , and though they have beautiful schools , nothing is taught in them ; the youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress , and when she has called the roll , they all go out for a walk and never come back ."
"It is a very noticeable thing that , in fairy families , the youngest is always chief person , and usually becomes a prince or princess , and children remember this , and think it must be so among humans also , and that is why they are often made uneasy when they come upon their mother furtively putting new frills on the basinette ."
"You have probably observed that your baby-sister wants to do all sorts of things that your mother and her nurse want her not to do : to stand up at sitting-down time , and to sit down at standing-up time , for instance , or to wake up when she should fall asleep , or to crawl on the floor when she is wearing her best frock , and so on , and perhaps you put this down to naughtiness ."
"But it is not ; it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do ; she begins by following their ways , and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways ."
"Her fits of passion , which are awful to behold , and are usually called teething , are no such thing ; they are her natural exasperation , because we do n't understand her , though she is talking an intelligible language ."
She is talking fairy .
"The reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean , before other people know , as that `` Guch '' means `` Give it to me at once , '' while `` Wa '' is `` Why do you wear such a funny hat ? ''"
"is because , mixing so much with babies , they have picked up a little of the fairy language ."
"The fairies take an hour longer in the morning , the beasts attend to their young , the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights , and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other ."
"But with the coming of Peter , who hates lethargy , they are all under way again : if you put your ear to the ground now , you would hear the whole island seething with life ."
On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows .
"The lost boys were out looking for Peter , the pirates were out looking for the lost boys , the redskins were out looking for the pirates , and the beasts were out looking for the redskins ."
"They were going round and round the island , but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate ."
"All wanted blood except the boys , who liked it as a rule , but to-night were out to greet their captain ."
"The boys on the island vary , of course , in numbers , according as they get killed and so on ; and when they seem to be growing up , which is against the rules , Peter thins them out ; but at this time there were six of them , counting the twins as two ."
"Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file , each with his hand on his dagger ."
"They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him , and they wear the skins of bears slain by themselves , in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll ."
They have therefore become very sure-footed .
"The first to pass is Tootles , not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band ."
"He had been in fewer adventures than any of them , because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner ; all would be quiet , he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood , and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood ."
"This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance , but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it , so that he was quite the humblest of the boys ."
"Poor kind Tootles , there is danger in the air for you to-night ."
"Take care lest an adventure is now offered you , which , if accepted , will plunge you in deepest woe ."
"Tootles , the fairy Tink who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool , and she thinks you the most easily tricked of the boys ."
` Ware Tinker Bell .
"Would that he could hear us , but we are not really on the island , and he passes by , biting his knuckles ."
"Next comes Nibs , the gay and debonair , followed by Slightly , who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes ."
Slightly is the most conceited of the boys .
"He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost , with their manners and customs , and this has given his nose an offensive tilt ."
"Curly is fourth ; he is a pickle , and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly , ` Stand forth the one who did this thing , ' that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not ."
"Last come the Twins , who can not be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one ."
"Peter never quite knew what twins were , and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know , so these two were always vague about themselves , and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way ."
"The boys vanish in the gloom , and after a pause , but not a long pause , for things go briskly on the island , come the pirates on their track ."
"We hear them before they are seen , and it is always the same dreadful song : ` Avast belay , yo ho , heave to , A-pirating we go , And if we 're parted by a shot We 're sure to meet below ! '"
A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock .
"Here , a little in advance , ever and again with his head to the ground listening , his great arms bare , pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments , is the handsome Italian Cecco , who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao ."
That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo .
"Here is Bill Jukes , every inch of him tattooed , the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores ; and Cookson , said to be Black Murphy 's brother -LRB- but this was never proved -RRB- ; and Gentleman Starkey , once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing ; and Skylights -LRB- Morgan 's Skylights -RRB- ; and the Irish bo ` sun Smee , an oddly genial man who stabbed , so to speak , without offence , and was the only Nonconformist in Hook 's crew ; and Noodler , whose hands were fixed on backwards ; and Robt ."
Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main .
"In the midst of them , the blackest and largest jewel in that dark setting , reclined James Hook , or as he wrote himself , Jas ."
"First the kits , who rushed at the bowl and thrust their heads in , lapping as if for a wager ; then the cats , who each went to one of the four piles of scraps laid round at intervals and placidly ate their meat ; while Molly retired to the basket , to ponder over the phenomena taking place in the house ."
She could not imagine what had started the old lady .
"It was not the example of her neighbors , who had beaten carpets and scrubbed paint every spring for years without exciting her to any greater exertion than cleaning a few windows and having a man to clear away the rubbish displayed when the snow melted ."
"Molly never guessed that her own efforts were at the bottom of the change , or knew that a few words not meant for her ear had shamed Miss Bat into action ."
"Coming home from prayer-meeting one dark night , she trotted along behind two old ladies who were gossiping in loud voices , as one was rather deaf , and Miss Bat was both pleased and troubled to hear herself unduly praised ."
"`` I always said Sister Dawes meant well ; but she 's getting into years , and the care of two children is a good deal for her , with her cooking and her rheumatiz ."
"I do n't deny she did neglect 'em for a spell , but she does well by 'em now , and I would n't wish to see better-appearing children . ''"
`` You 've no idee how improved Molly is .
"She came in to see my girls , and brought her sewing-work , shirts for the boy , and done it as neat and capable as you 'd wish to see ."
"She always was a smart child , but dreadful careless , '' said the other old lady , evidently much impressed by the change in harum-scarum Molly Loo ."
"`` Being over to Mis Minot 's so much has been good for her , and up to Mis Grant 's ."
"Girls catch neat ways as quick as they do untidy ones , and them wild little tykes often turn out smart women . ''"
"`` Sister Dawes has done well by them children , and I hope Mr. Bemis sees it ."
He ought to give her something comfortable to live on when she ca n't do for him any longer .
He can well afford it . ''
`` I have n't a doubt he will .
"He 's a lavish man when he starts to do a thing , but dreadful unobserving , else he 'd have seen to matters long ago ."
"Them children was town-talk last fall , and I used to feel as if it was my bounden duty to speak to Miss Dawes ."
"But I never did , fearing I might speak too plain , and hurt her feelings . ''"
"`` You 've spoken plain enough now , and I 'm beholden to you , though you 'll never know it , '' said Miss Bat to herself , as she slipped into her own gate , while the gossips trudged on quite unconscious of the listener behind them ."
"Miss Bat was a worthy old soul in the main , only , like so many of us , she needed rousing up to her duty ."
"She had got the rousing now , and it did her good , for she could not bear to be praised when she had not deserved it ."
"She had watched Molly 's efforts with lazy interest , and when the girl gave up meddling with her affairs , as she called the housekeeping , Miss Bat ceased to oppose her , and let her scrub Boo , mend clothes , and brush her hair as much as she liked ."
"So Molly had worked along without any help from her , running in to Mrs. Pecq for advice , to Merry for comfort , or Mrs. Minot for the higher kind of help one often needs so much ."
"Now Miss Bat found that she was getting the credit and the praise belonging to other people , and it stirred her up to try and deserve a part at least ."
"`` Molly do n't want any help about her work or the boy : it 's too late for that ; but if this house do n't get a spring cleaning that will make it shine , my name ai n't Bathsheba Dawes , '' said the old lady , as she put away her bonnet that night , and laid energetic plans for a grand revolution , inspired thereto not only by shame , but by the hint that `` Mr. Bemis was a lavish man , '' as no one knew better than she ."
"Molly 's amazement next day at seeing carpets fly out of window , ancient cobwebs come down , and long-undisturbed closets routed out to the great dismay of moths and mice , has been already confided to the cats , and as she sat there watching them lap and gnaw , she said to herself , -- `` I do n't understand it , but as she never says much to me about my affairs , I wo n't take any notice till she gets through , then I 'll admire everything all I can ."
It is so pleasant to be praised after you 've been trying hard . ''
"She might well say that , for she got very little herself , and her trials had been many , her efforts not always successful , and her reward seemed a long way off ."
"Poor Boo could have sympathized with her , for he had suffered much persecution from his small schoolmates when he appeared with large gray patches on the little brown trousers , where he had worn them out coasting down those too fascinating steps ."
"As he could not see the patches himself , he fancied them invisible , and came home much afflicted by the jeers of his friends ."
"Then Molly tried to make him a new pair out of a sack of her own ; but she cut both sides for the same leg , so one was wrong side out ."
"Of late David has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue , with his hands clutching his temples , and he has remembered a number of their phrases which I shall tell you some day if I do n't forget ."
"He had heard them in the days when he was a thrush , and though I suggested to him that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering , he says not , for these phrases are about fun and adventures , and the birds talked of nothing but nest-building ."
"He distinctly remembers that the birds used to go from spot to spot like ladies at shop-windows , looking at the different nests and saying , `` Not my colour , my dear , '' and `` How would that do with a soft lining ? ''"
and `` But will it wear ? ''
and `` What hideous trimming ! ''
and so on .
"The fairies are exquisite dancers , and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it ."
"They hold their great balls in the open air , in what is called a fairy-ring ."
For weeks afterward you can see the ring on the grass .
"It is not there when they begin , but they make it by waltzing round and round ."
"Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring , and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away ."
"The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little people leave behind them , and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates ."
David and I once found a fairy-ring quite warm .
But there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place .
You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to close to-day .
"Well , these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the board on a ball night , so that it says the Gardens are to close at six-thirty for instance , instead of at seven ."
This enables them to get begun half an hour earlier .
"If on such a night we could remain behind in the Gardens , as the famous Maimie Mannering did , we might see delicious sights , hundreds of lovely fairies hastening to the ball , the married ones wearing their wedding-rings round their waists , the gentlemen , all in uniform , holding up the ladies ' trains , and linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries , which are the fairy-lanterns , the cloakroom where they put on their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps , the flowers streaming up from the Baby Walk to look on , and always welcome because they can lend a pin , the supper-table , with Queen Mab at the head of it , and behind her chair the Lord Chamberlain , who carries a dandelion on which he blows when Her Majesty wants to know the time ."
"The table-cloth varies according to the seasons , and in May it is made of chestnut-blossom ."
"The way the fairy-servants do is this : The men , scores of them , climb up the trees and shake the branches , and the blossom falls like snow ."
"Then the lady servants sweep it together by whisking their skirts until it is exactly like a table-cloth , and that is how they get their table-cloth ."
"They have real glasses and real wine of three kinds , namely , blackthorn wine , berberris wine , and cowslip wine , and the Queen pours out , but the bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out ."
"There is bread and butter to begin with , of the size of a threepenny bit ; and cakes to end with , and they are so small that they have no crumbs ."
"The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are very well-behaved and always cough off the table , and so on , but after a bit they are not so well-behaved and stick their fingers into the butter , which is got from the roots of old trees , and the really horrid ones crawl over the table-cloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues ."
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wall-flower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seals ."
"Wall-flower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seals juice is for bruises ."
They bruise very easily and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits .
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
`` P. P. '' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
The way it was done was this .
"He hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little wood ; and at night , when the coast was clear , would come into the house to visit me ."
"I need not say if I was pleased to see him ; Mrs. Maclaren , our hostess , thought nothing good enough for such a guest ; and as Duncan Dhu -LRB- which was the name of our host -RRB- had a pair of pipes in his house , and was much of a lover of music , this time of my recovery was quite a festival , and we commonly turned night into day ."
"The soldiers let us be ; although once a party of two companies and some dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley , where I could see them through the window as I lay in bed ."
"What was much more astonishing , no magistrate came near me , and there was no question put of whence I came or whither I was going ; and in that time of excitement , I was as free of all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert ."
Yet my presence was known before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts ; many coming about the house on visits and these -LRB- after the custom of the country -RRB- spreading the news among their neighbours .
"The bills , too , had now been printed ."
"There was one pinned near the foot of my bed , where I could read my own not very flattering portrait and , in larger characters , the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my life ."
"Duncan Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan 's company , could have entertained no doubt of who I was ; and many others must have had their guess ."
"For though I had changed my clothes , I could not change my age or person ; and Lowland boys of eighteen were not so rife in these parts of the world , and above all about that time , that they could fail to put one thing with another , and connect me with the bill ."
"So it was , at least ."
"Other folk keep a secret among two or three near friends , and somehow it leaks out ; but among these clansmen , it is told to a whole countryside , and they will keep it for a century ."
"There was but one thing happened worth narrating ; and that is the visit I had of Robin Oig , one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy ."
He was sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from Balfron and marrying her -LRB- as was alleged -RRB- by force ; yet he stepped about Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy .
"It was he who had shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts , a quarrel never satisfied ; yet he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider * might into a public inn ."
* Commercial traveller .
Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was ; and we looked at one another in concern .
"You should understand , it was then close upon the time of Alan 's coming ; the two were little likely to agree ; and yet if we sent word or sought to make a signal , it was sure to arouse suspicion in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor ."
"He came in with a great show of civility , but like a man among inferiors ; took off his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren , but clapped it on his head again to speak to Duncan ; and having thus set himself -LRB- as he would have thought -RRB- in a proper light , came to my bedside and bowed ."
"`` I am given to know , sir , '' says he , `` that your name is Balfour . ''"
"`` They call me David Balfour , '' said I , `` at your service . ''"
"`` I would give ye my name in return , sir , '' he replied , `` but it 's one somewhat blown upon of late days ; and it 'll perhaps suffice if I tell ye that I am own brother to James More Drummond or Macgregor , of whom ye will scarce have failed to hear . ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I , a little alarmed ; `` nor yet of your father , Macgregor-Campbell . ''"
"And I sat up and bowed in bed ; for I thought best to compliment him , in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his father ."
He bowed in return .
"`` But what I am come to say , sir , '' he went on , `` is this ."
"In the year ' 45 , my brother raised a part of the ` Gregara ' and marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side ; and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother 's leg when it was broken in the brush at Preston Pans , was a gentleman of the same name precisely as yourself ."
"He was brother to Balfour of Baith ; and if you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman 's kin , I have come to put myself and my people at your command . ''"
"You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger 's dog ; my uncle , to be sure , had prated of some of our high connections , but nothing to the present purpose ; and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell ."
"Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about , turned his back upon me without a sign of salutation , and as he went towards the door , I could hear him telling Duncan that I was `` only some kinless loon that did n't know his own father . ''"
"Angry as I was at these words , and ashamed of my own ignorance , I could scarce keep from smiling that a man who was under the lash of the law -LRB- and was indeed hanged some three years later -RRB- should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances ."
"Just in the door , he met Alan coming in ; and the two drew back and looked at each other like strange dogs ."
"They were neither of them big men , but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride ."
"They lie side by side , and the simple inscriptions read -- + --------- + + --------- + | W. | | 13a | | St. M. | and | P. P. | | | | 1841 ."
| + --------- + + --------- + David sometimes places white flowers on these two innocent graves .
"-LSB- Illustration : I think that quite the most touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter Stephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps -RSB- But how strange for parents , when they hurry into the Gardens at the opening of the gates looking for their lost one , to find the sweetest little tombstone instead ."
I do hope that Peter is not too ready with his spade .
It is all rather sad .
"_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens,_Version_2.txt.out"
"Peter Pan If you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl she will say , `` Why , of course , I did , child , '' and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say , `` What a foolish question to ask , certainly he did . ''"
"Then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl , she also says , `` Why , of course , I did , child , '' but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days , she says she never heard of his having a goat ."
"Perhaps she has forgotten , just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred , which is your mother 's name ."
"Still , she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat ."
Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl .
"This shows that , in telling the story of Peter Pan , to begin with the goat -LRB- as most people do -RRB- is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest ."
"Of course , it also shows that Peter is ever so old , but he is really always the same age , so that does not matter in the least ."
"His age is one week , and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday , nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one ."
The reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days ' old ; he escaped by the window and flew back to the Kensington Gardens .
"If you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape , it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days ."
"When David heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape , but I told him to think back hard , pressing his hands to his temples , and when he had done this hard , and even harder , he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops , and with that memory came others , as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep , and how she had once caught him half-way up the chimney ."
"All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples , for , having been birds before they were human , they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks , and very itchy at the shoulders , where their wings used to be ."
So David tells me .
"I ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story : First , I tell it to him , and then he tells it to me , the understanding being that it is quite a different story ; and then I retell it with his additions , and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine ."
"In this story of Peter Pan , for instance , the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine , though not all , for this boy can be a stern moralist , but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly reminiscences of David 's , recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard ."
"Well , Peter Pan got out by the window , which had no bars ."
"Standing on the ledge he could see trees far away , which were doubtless the Kensington Gardens , and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown , and away he flew , right over the houses to the Gardens ."
"It is wonderful that he could fly without wings , but the place itched tremendously , and , perhaps we could all fly if we were as dead-confident-sure of our capacity to do it as was bold Peter Pan that evening ."
"He alighted gaily on the open sward , between the Baby 's Palace and the Serpentine , and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick ."
"He was quite unaware already that he had ever been human , and thought he was a bird , even in appearance , just the same as in his early days , and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand , which , of course , a bird never does ."
"He saw , however , that it must be past Lock-out Time , for there were a good many fairies about , all too busy to notice him ; they were getting breakfast ready , milking their cows , drawing water , and so on , and the sight of the water-pails made him thirsty , so he flew over to the Round Pond to have a drink ."
"He stooped , and dipped his beak in the pond ; he thought it was his beak , but , of course , it was only his nose , and , therefore , very little water came up , and that not so refreshing as usual , so next he tried a puddle , and he fell flop into it ."
"When a real bird falls in flop , he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry , but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do , and he decided , rather sulkily , to go to sleep on the weeping beech in the Baby Walk ."
"At first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch , but presently he remembered the way , and fell asleep ."
"He awoke long before morning , shivering , and saying to himself , `` I never was out in such a cold night ; '' he had really been out in colder nights when he was a bird , but , of course , as everybody knows , what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown ."
"Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable , as if his head was stuffy , he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply , though they were really himself sneezing ."
"On the other side , the parts were reversed ; and the defenders exposed themselves like madmen to protect their rampart ."
"So for some minutes the contest raged almost in silence , friend and foe falling one upon another ."
"But it is always the easier to destroy ; and when a single note upon the tucket recalled the attacking party from this desperate service , much of the barricade had been removed piecemeal , and the whole fabric had sunk to half its height , and tottered to a general fall ."
"And now the footmen in the market-place fell back , at a run , on every side ."
"The horsemen , who had been standing in a line two deep , wheeled suddenly , and made their flank into their front ; and as swift as a striking adder , the long , steel-clad column was launched upon the ruinous barricade ."
"Of the first two horsemen , one fell , rider and steed , and was ridden down by his companions ."
"The second leaped clean upon the summit of the rampart , transpiercing an archer with his lance ."
Almost in the same instant he was dragged from the saddle and his horse despatched .
And then the full weight and impetus of the charge burst upon and scattered the defenders .
"The men-at-arms , surmounting their fallen comrades , and carried onward by the fury of their onslaught , dashed through Dick 's broken line and poured thundering up the lane beyond , as a stream bestrides and pours across a broken dam ."
Yet was the fight not over .
"Still , in the narrow jaws of the entrance , Dick and a few survivors plied their bills like woodmen ; and already , across the width of the passage , there had been formed a second , a higher , and a more effectual rampart of fallen men and disembowelled horses , lashing in the agonies of death ."
"Baffled by this fresh obstacle , the remainder of the cavalry fell back ; and as , at the sight of this movement , the flight of arrows redoubled from the casements of the houses , their retreat had , for a moment , almost degenerated into flight ."
"Almost at the same time , those who had crossed the barricade and charged farther up the street , being met before the door of the Chequers by the formidable hunchback and the whole reserve of the Yorkists , began to come scattering backward , in the excess of disarray and terror ."
"Dick and his fellows faced about , fresh men poured out of the houses ; a cruel blast of arrows met the fugitives full in the face , while Gloucester was already riding down their rear ; in the inside of a minute and a half there was no living Lancastrian in the street ."
"Then , and not till then , did Dick hold up his reeking blade and give the word to cheer ."
Meanwhile Gloucester dismounted from his horse and came forward to inspect the post .
"His face was as pale as linen ; but his eyes shone in his head like some strange jewel , and his voice , when he spoke , was hoarse and broken with the exultation of battle and success ."
"He looked at the rampart , which neither friend nor foe could now approach without precaution , so fiercely did the horses struggle in the throes of death , and at the sight of that great carnage he smiled upon one side ."
"`` Despatch these horses , '' he said ; `` they keep you from your vantage ."
"Richard Shelton , '' he added , `` ye have pleased me ."
Kneel . ''
"The Lancastrians had already resumed their archery , and the shafts fell thick in the mouth of the street ; but the duke , minding them not at all , deliberately drew his sword and dubbed Richard a knight upon the spot ."
"`` And now , Sir Richard , '' he continued , `` if that ye see Lord Risingham , send me an express upon the instant ."
"Were it your last man , let me hear of it incontinently ."
I had rather venture the post than lose my stroke at him .
"For mark me , all of ye , '' he added , raising his voice , `` if Earl Risingham fall by another hand than mine , I shall count this victory a defeat . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one of his attendants , `` is your grace not weary of exposing his dear life unneedfully ?"
Why tarry we here ? ''
"`` Catesby , '' returned the duke , `` here is the battle , not elsewhere ."
The rest are but feigned onslaughts .
Here must we vanquish .
"The evening breeze had sprung up , and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east , the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro ."
I began to see a danger to the ship .
"The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck , but the main-sail was a harder matter ."
"Of course , when the schooner canted over , the boom had swung out-board , and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water ."
I thought this made it still more dangerous ; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle .
At last I got my knife and cut the halyards .
"The peak dropped instantly , a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water , and since , pull as I liked , I could not budge the downhall , that was the extent of what I could accomplish ."
"For the rest , the HISPANIOLA must trust to luck , like myself ."
"By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow -- the last rays , I remember , falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck ."
"It began to be chill ; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward , the schooner settling more and more on her beam-ends ."
I scrambled forward and looked over .
"It seemed shallow enough , and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security , I let myself drop softly overboard ."
"The water scarcely reached my waist ; the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks , and I waded ashore in great spirits , leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side , with her main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay ."
"About the same time , the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines ."
"At least , and at last , I was off the sea , nor had I returned thence empty-handed ."
"There lay the schooner , clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again ."
I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements .
"Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry , but the recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer , and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time ."
"So thinking , and in famous spirits , I began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions ."
"I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd 's anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left , and I bent my course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was small ."
"The wood was pretty open , and keeping along the lower spurs , I had soon turned the corner of that hill , and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the watercourse ."
"This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn , the maroon ; and I walked more circumspectly , keeping an eye on every side ."
"The dusk had come nigh hand completely , and as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks , I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky , where , as I judged , the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire ."
"And yet I wondered , in my heart , that he should show himself so careless ."
"For if I could see this radiance , might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes ?"
Gradually the night fell blacker ; it was all I could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination ; the double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter ; the stars were few and pale ; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits .
Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me .
"I looked up ; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass , and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees , and knew the moon had risen ."
"With this to help me , I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey , and sometimes walking , sometimes running , impatiently drew near to the stockade ."
"Yet , as I began to thread the grove that lies before it , I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a trifle warily ."
It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake .
"The moon was climbing higher and higher , its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood , and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees ."
"At last the breeze came ; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark ; I felt the hawser slacken once more , and with a good , tough effort , cut the last fibres through ."
"The breeze had but little action on the coracle , and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA ."
"At the same time , the schooner began to turn upon her heel , spinning slowly , end for end , across the current ."
"I wrought like a fiend , for I expected every moment to be swamped ; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off , I now shoved straight astern ."
"At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour , and just as I gave the last impulsion , my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks ."
Instantly I grasped it .
Why I should have done so I can hardly say .
"It was at first mere instinct , but once I had it in my hands and found it fast , curiosity began to get the upper hand , and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window ."
"I pulled in hand over hand on the cord , and when I judged myself near enough , rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin ."
"By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water ; indeed , we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire ."
"The ship was talking , as sailors say , loudly , treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash ; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm ."
"One glance , however , was sufficient ; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff ."
"It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle , each with a hand upon the other 's throat ."
"I dropped upon the thwart again , none too soon , for I was near overboard ."
"I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious , encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp , and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness ."
"The endless ballad had come to an end at last , and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum !"
"Drink and the devil had done for the rest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
"I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA , when I was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle ."
"At the same moment , she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course ."
The speed in the meantime had strangely increased .
I opened my eyes at once .
"All round me were little ripples , combing over with a sharp , bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent ."
"The HISPANIOLA herself , a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along , seemed to stagger in her course , and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night ; nay , as I looked longer , I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward ."
"I glanced over my shoulder , and my heart jumped against my ribs ."
"There , right behind me , was the glow of the camp-fire ."
"The current had turned at right angles , sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ; ever quickening , ever bubbling higher , ever muttering louder , it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea ."
"Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw , turning , perhaps , through twenty degrees ; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board ; I could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster ."
I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker .
"At the end of the straits , I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers , where all my troubles would be ended speedily ; and though I could , perhaps , bear to die , I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached ."
"So I must have lain for hours , continually beaten to and fro upon the billows , now and again wetted with flying sprays , and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge ."
"Gradually weariness grew upon me ; a numbness , an occasional stupor , fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors , until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow ."
24 The Cruise of the Coracle IT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west end of Treasure Island .
"He wore his best black suit and white tie , his thick , tight , iron-grey curls were neatly arranged , and his broad , red round face looked , as Susan most uncharitably thought , more `` sanctimonious '' than ever ."
"`` The minute I saw that man coming into the Church , looking like that , I felt that mischief was brewing , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said afterwards ."
"`` What form it would take I could not tell , but I knew from face of him that he had come there for no good . ''"
The prayer-meeting opened conventionally and continued quietly .
Mr. Meredith spoke first with his usual eloquence and feeling .
Mr. Arnold followed with an address which even Miss Cornelia had to confess was irreproachable in taste and subject-matter .
And then Mr. Arnold asked Mr. Pryor to lead in prayer .
Miss Cornelia had always averred that Mr. Arnold had no gumption .
"Miss Cornelia was not apt to err on the side of charity in her judgment of Methodist ministers , but in this case she did not greatly overshoot the mark ."
"The Rev. Mr. Arnold certainly did not have much of that desirable , indefinable quality known as gumption , or he would never have asked Whiskers-on-the-moon to lead in prayer at a khaki prayer-meeting ."
"He thought he was returning the compliment to Mr. Meredith , who , at the conclusion of his address , had asked a Methodist deacon to lead ."
Some people expected Mr. Pryor to refuse grumpily -- and that would have made enough scandal .
"But Mr. Pryor bounded briskly to his feet , unctuously said , `` Let us pray , '' and forthwith prayed ."
"In a sonorous voice which penetrated to every corner of the crowded building Mr. Pryor poured forth a flood of fluent words , and was well on in his prayer before his dazed and horrified audience awakened to the fact that they were listening to a pacifist appeal of the rankest sort ."
"Mr. Pryor had at least the courage of his convictions ; or perhaps , as people afterwards said , he thought he was safe in a church and that it was an excellent chance to air certain opinions he dared not voice elsewhere , for fear of being mobbed ."
"He prayed that the unholy war might cease -- that the deluded armies being driven to slaughter on the Western front might have their eyes opened to their iniquity and repent while yet there was time -- that the poor young men present in khaki , who had been hounded into a path of murder and militarism , should yet be rescued -- Mr. Pryor had got this far without let or hindrance ; and so paralysed were his hearers , and so deeply imbued with their born-and-bred conviction that no disturbance must ever be made in a church , no matter what the provocation , that it seemed likely that he would continue unchecked to the end ."
But one man at least in that audience was not hampered by inherited or acquired reverence for the sacred edifice .
"Norman Douglas was , as Susan had often vowed crisply , nothing more or less than a `` pagan . ''"
"But he was a rampantly patriotic pagan , and when the significance of what Mr. Pryor was saying fully dawned on him , Norman Douglas suddenly went berserk ."
"With a positive roar he bounded to his feet in his side pew , facing the audience , and shouted in tones of thunder : `` Stop -- stop -- STOP that abominable prayer !"
What an abominable prayer ! ''
Every head in the church flew up .
A boy in khaki at the back gave a faint cheer .
"Mr. Meredith raised a deprecating hand , but Norman was past caring for anything like that ."
"Eluding his wife 's restraining grasp , he gave one mad spring over the front of the pew and caught the unfortunate Whiskers-on-the-moon by his coat collar ."
"Mr. Pryor had not `` stopped '' when so bidden , but he stopped now , perforce , for Norman , his long red beard literally bristling with fury , was shaking him until his bones fairly rattled , and punctuating his shakes with a lurid assortment of abusive epithets ."
`` You blatant beast ! ''
-- shake -- `` You malignant carrion '' -- shake -- `` You pig-headed varmint ! ''
-- shake -- `` you putrid pup '' -- shake -- `` you pestilential parasite '' -- shake -- `` you -- Hunnish scum '' -- shake -- `` you indecent reptile -- you -- you -- '' Norman choked for a moment .
"Everybody believed that the next thing he would say , church or no church , would be something that would have to be spelt with asterisks ; but at that moment Norman encountered his wife 's eye and he fell back with a thud on Holy Writ ."
`` You whited sepulchre ! ''
"he bellowed , with a final shake , and cast Whiskers-on-the-moon from him with a vigour which impelled that unhappy pacifist to the very verge of the choir entrance door ."
"There were , besides , some of the little shells that we call buckies ; I think periwinkle is the English name ."
"Of these two I made my whole diet , devouring them cold and raw as I found them ; and so hungry was I , that at first they seemed to me delicious ."
"Perhaps they were out of season , or perhaps there was something wrong in the sea about my island ."
"But at least I had no sooner eaten my first meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching , and lay for a long time no better than dead ."
"A second trial of the same food -LRB- indeed I had no other -RRB- did better with me , and revived my strength ."
"But as long as I was on the island , I never knew what to expect when I had eaten ; sometimes all was well , and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable sickness ; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me ."
"All day it streamed rain ; the island ran like a sop , there was no dry spot to be found ; and when I lay down that night , between two boulders that made a kind of roof , my feet were in a bog ."
The second day I crossed the island to all sides .
"There was no one part of it better than another ; it was all desolate and rocky ; nothing living on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill , and the gulls which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number ."
"But the creek , or strait , that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross , opened out on the north into a bay , and the bay again opened into the Sound of Iona ; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my home ; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot , I must have burst out weeping ."
I had good reasons for my choice .
"There was in this part of the isle a little hut of a house like a pig 's hut , where fishers used to sleep when they came there upon their business ; but the turf roof of it had fallen entirely in ; so that the hut was of no use to me , and gave me less shelter than my rocks ."
"What was more important , the shell-fish on which I lived grew there in great plenty ; when the tide was out I could gather a peck at a time : and this was doubtless a convenience ."
But the other reason went deeper .
"I had become in no way used to the horrid solitude of the isle , but still looked round me on all sides -LRB- like a man that was hunted -RRB- , between fear and hope that I might see some human creature coming ."
"Now , from a little up the hillside over the bay , I could catch a sight of the great , ancient church and the roofs of the people 's houses in Iona ."
"And on the other hand , over the low country of the Ross , I saw smoke go up , morning and evening , as if from a homestead in a hollow of the land ."
"I used to watch this smoke , when I was wet and cold , and had my head half turned with loneliness ; and think of the fireside and the company , till my heart burned ."
It was the same with the roofs of Iona .
"Altogether , this sight I had of men 's homes and comfortable lives , although it put a point on my own sufferings , yet it kept hope alive , and helped me to eat my raw shell-fish -LRB- which had soon grown to be a disgust -RRB- , and saved me from the sense of horror I had whenever I was quite alone with dead rocks , and fowls , and the rain , and the cold sea ."
"I say it kept hope alive ; and indeed it seemed impossible that I should be left to die on the shores of my own country , and within view of a church-tower and the smoke of men 's houses ."
"But the second day passed ; and though as long as the light lasted I kept a bright look-out for boats on the Sound or men passing on the Ross , no help came near me ."
"It still rained , and I turned in to sleep , as wet as ever , and with a cruel sore throat , but a little comforted , perhaps , by having said good-night to my next neighbours , the people of Iona ."
Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the year in the climate of England than in any other .
"This was very like a king , with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes ."
But he must have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that miserable isle .
"It was the height of the summer ; yet it rained for more than twenty-four hours , and did not clear until the afternoon of the third day ."
This was the day of incidents .
"In the morning I saw a red deer , a buck with a fine spread of antlers , standing in the rain on the top of the island ; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock , before he trotted off upon the other side ."
"I supposed he must have swum the strait ; though what should bring any creature to Earraid , was more than I could fancy ."
"A little after , as I was jumping about after my limpets , I was startled by a guinea-piece , which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off into the sea ."
"When the sailors gave me my money again , they kept back not only about a third of the whole sum , but my father 's leather purse ; so that from that day out , I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a button ."
"Queen Mab , who rules in the Gardens , had been confident that her girls would bewitch him , but alas !"
"his heart , the doctor said , remained cold ."
"This rather irritating doctor , who was his private physician , felt the Duke 's heart immediately after any lady was presented , and then always shook his bald head and murmured , ` Cold , quite cold . '"
"Naturally Queen Mab felt disgraced , and first she tried the effect of ordering the court into tears for nine minutes , and then she blamed the Cupids and decreed that they should wear fools ' caps until they thawed the Duke 's frozen heart ."
` How I should love to see the Cupids in their dear little fools ' caps ! '
"Maimie cried , and away she ran to look for them very recklessly , for the Cupids hate to be laughed at ."
"It is always easy to discover where a fairies ' ball is being held , as ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the Gardens , on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting their pumps ."
"This night the ribbons were red , and looked very pretty on the snow ."
"-LSB- Illustration : She escorted them up the Baby Walk and back again -RSB- Maimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without meeting anybody , but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade approaching ."
"To her surprise they seemed to be returning from the ball , and she had just time to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms and pretending to be a garden chair ."
"There were six horsemen in front and six behind ; in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held up by two pages , and on the train , as if it were a couch , reclined a lovely girl , for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about ."
"She was dressed in golden rain , but the most enviable part of her was her neck , which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture , and of course showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have glorified it ."
"The high-born fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin , which lets the blue blood come through and dye them , and you can not imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies ' busts in the jewellers ' windows ."
"Maimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a passion , tilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even fairies to tilt them , and she concluded that this must be another case in which the doctor had said , ` Cold , quite cold . '"
"-LSB- Illustration : An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces -RSB- Well , she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge over a dry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been unable to climb out ."
"At first this little damsel was afraid of Maimie , who most kindly went to her aid , but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was Brownie , and that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the Duke would have her ."
"` Of course , ' she said , ' I am rather plain , ' and this made Maimie uncomfortable , for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite plain for a fairy ."
It was difficult to know what to reply . '
"I see you think I have no chance , ' Brownie said falteringly . '"
"I do n't say that , ' Maimie answered politely ; ` of course your face is just a tiny bit homely , but -- ' Really it was quite awkward for her ."
Fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar .
"He had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in London were on view for half a crown the second day , but on his return home , instead of being dissatisfied with Maimie 's mother , he had said , ` You ca n't think , my dear , what a relief it is to see a homely face again . '"
"Maimie repeated this story , and it fortified Brownie tremendously , indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the Duke would choose her ."
"So she scudded away up the ribbon , calling out to Maimie not to follow lest the Queen should mischief her ."
"But Maimie 's curiosity tugged her forward , and presently at the seven Spanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light ."
"She crept forward until she was quite near it , and then she peeped from behind a tree ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A chrysanthemum heard her , and said pointedly , ` Hoity-toity , what is this ? ' -RSB-"
"The light , which was as high as your head above the ground , was composed of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other , and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring ."
"There were thousands of little people looking on , but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle , who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them ."
"It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment : yet out of love his dusky grace still was : you could see it by the shamed looks of the Queen and court -LRB- though they pretended not to care -RRB- , by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on , and by his own most dreary face ."
"Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke 's heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry , and she was particularly sorry for the Cupids , who stood in their fools ' caps in obscure places and , every time they heard that ` Cold , quite cold , ' bowed their disgraced little heads ."
"She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan , and I may as well tell you now why he was so late that night ."
Wild horses would n't draw it from you ?
"No , says you ."
"And if them pirates camp ashore , Jim , what would you say but there 'd be widders in the morning ? ''"
"Here he was interrupted by a loud report , and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking ."
The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction .
"For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island , and balls kept crashing through the woods ."
"I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place , always pursued , or so it seemed to me , by these terrifying missiles ."
"But towards the end of the bombardment , though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade , where the balls fell oftenest , I had begun , in a manner , to pluck up my heart again , and after a long detour to the east , crept down among the shore-side trees ."
"The sun had just set , the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage ; the tide , too , was far out , and great tracts of sand lay uncovered ; the air , after the heat of the day , chilled me through my jacket ."
"The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored ; but , sure enough , there was the Jolly Roger -- the black flag of piracy -- flying from her peak ."
"Even as I looked , there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering , and one more round-shot whistled through the air ."
It was the last of the cannonade .
I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack .
"Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade -- the poor jolly-boat , I afterwards discovered ."
"Away , near the mouth of the river , a great fire was glowing among the trees , and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going , the men , whom I had seen so gloomy , shouting at the oars like children ."
But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum .
At length I thought I might return towards the stockade .
"I was pretty far down on the low , sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east , and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island ; and now , as I rose to my feet , I saw , some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes , an isolated rock , pretty high , and peculiarly white in colour ."
It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one .
"Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear , or shoreward side , of the stockade , and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party ."
I had soon told my story and began to look about me .
"The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine -- roof , walls , and floor ."
The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand .
"There was a porch at the door , and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind -- no other than a great ship 's kettle of iron , with the bottom knocked out , and sunk `` to her bearings , '' as the captain said , among the sand ."
"Little had been left besides the framework of the house , but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire ."
"The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house , and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed ."
Most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees ; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand .
"Very close around the stockade -- too close for defence , they said -- the wood still flourished high and dense , all of fir on the land side , but towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks ."
"The cold evening breeze , of which I have spoken , whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand ."
"There was sand in our eyes , sand in our teeth , sand in our suppers , sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle , for all the world like porridge beginning to boil ."
"Our chimney was a square hole in the roof ; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out , and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye ."
"Add to this that Gray , the new man , had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth , still unburied , lay along the wall , stiff and stark , under the Union Jack ."
"Had she haughtily unhanded him -LRB- and we should have loved to write it of her -RRB- , she would have been hurled through the air like the others , and then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children ; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly 's secret , and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter 's life ."
"They were tied to prevent their flying away , doubled up with their knees close to their ears ; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces ."
"All went well until Slightly 's turn came , when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags -LSB- ends -RSB- with which to tie a knot ."
"The pirates kicked him in their rage , just as you kick the parcel -LRB- though in fairness you should kick the string -RRB- ; and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence ."
His lip was curled with malicious triumph .
"While his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another , Hook 's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly 's surface , probing not for effects but for causes ; and his exultation showed that he had found them ."
"Slightly , white to the gills , knew that Hook had surprised -LSB- discovered -RSB- his secret , which was this , that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick ."
"Poor Slightly , most wretched of all the children now , for he was in a panic about Peter , bitterly regretted what he had done ."
"Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot , he had swelled in consequence to his present girth , and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had , unknown to the others , whittled his tree to make it fit him ."
"Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his mercy , but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips ; he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship , and that he would be alone ."
How to convey them ?
"Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels , but most of the way lay through a morass ."
Again Hook 's genius surmounted difficulties .
He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance .
"The children were flung into it , four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders , the others fell in behind , and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood ."
"I do n't know whether any of the children were crying ; if so , the singing drowned the sound ; but as the little house disappeared in the forest , a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook ."
"Hook saw it , and it did Peter a bad service ."
It dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate 's infuriated breast .
"The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly 's tree , and make sure that it provided him with a passage ."
"Then for long he remained brooding ; his hat of ill omen on the sward , so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair ."
Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle .
"Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world , but all was as silent below as above ; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void ."
"Was that boy asleep , or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly 's tree , with his dagger in his hand ?"
"There was no way of knowing , save by going down ."
"Hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground , and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them , he stepped into the tree ."
"He was a brave man , but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow , which was dripping like a candle ."
"Then , silently , he let himself go into the unknown ."
"He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft , and stood still again , biting at his breath , which had almost left him ."
"As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape ; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested , long sought for and found at last , was the great bed ."
On the bed lay Peter fast asleep .
"Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above , Peter had continued , for a little time after the children left , to play gaily on his pipes : no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care ."
"Then he decided not to take his medicine , so as to grieve Wendy ."
"`` Ye see , '' said Alan , `` this was what I was afraid of , Davie : that they would watch the burn-side ."
"They began to come in about two hours ago , and , man !"
but ye 're a grand hand at the sleeping !
We 're in a narrow place .
"If they get up the sides of the hill , they could easy spy us with a glass ; but if they 'll only keep in the foot of the valley , we 'll do yet ."
"The posts are thinner down the water ; and , come night , we 'll try our hand at getting by them . ''"
`` And what are we to do till night ? ''
I asked .
"`` Lie here , '' says he , `` and birstle . ''"
"That one good Scotch word , `` birstle , '' was indeed the most of the story of the day that we had now to pass ."
"You are to remember that we lay on the bare top of a rock , like scones upon a girdle ; the sun beat upon us cruelly ; the rock grew so heated , a man could scarce endure the touch of it ; and the little patch of earth and fern , which kept cooler , was only large enough for one at a time ."
"We took turn about to lie on the naked rock , which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred on a gridiron ; and it ran in my mind how strange it was , that in the same climate and at only a few days ' distance , I should have suffered so cruelly , first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this rock ."
"All the while we had no water , only raw brandy for a drink , which was worse than nothing ; but we kept the bottle as cool as we could , burying it in the earth , and got some relief by bathing our breasts and temples ."
"The soldiers kept stirring all day in the bottom of the valley , now changing guard , now in patrolling parties hunting among the rocks ."
"These lay round in so great a number , that to look for men among them was like looking for a needle in a bottle of hay ; and being so hopeless a task , it was gone about with the less care ."
"Yet we could see the soldiers pike their bayonets among the heather , which sent a cold thrill into my vitals ; and they would sometimes hang about our rock , so that we scarce dared to breathe ."
"It was in this way that I first heard the right English speech ; one fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon the sunny face of the rock on which we lay , and plucking it off again with an oath ."
"`` I tell you it 's ` ot , '' says he ; and I was amazed at the clipping tones and the odd sing-song in which he spoke , and no less at that strange trick of dropping out the letter `` h. '' To be sure , I had heard Ransome ; but he had taken his ways from all sorts of people , and spoke so imperfectly at the best , that I set down the most of it to childishness ."
"My surprise was all the greater to hear that manner of speaking in the mouth of a grown man ; and indeed I have never grown used to it ; nor yet altogether with the English grammar , as perhaps a very critical eye might here and there spy out even in these memoirs ."
The tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the greater as the day went on ; the rock getting still the hotter and the sun fiercer .
"There were giddiness , and sickness , and sharp pangs like rheumatism , to be supported ."
"I minded then , and have often minded since , on the lines in our Scotch psalm : -- `` The moon by night thee shall not smite , Nor yet the sun by day ; '' and indeed it was only by God 's blessing that we were neither of us sun-smitten ."
"At last , about two , it was beyond men 's bearing , and there was now temptation to resist , as well as pain to thole ."
"For the sun being now got a little into the west , there came a patch of shade on the east side of our rock , which was the side sheltered from the soldiers ."
"`` As well one death as another , '' said Alan , and slipped over the edge and dropped on the ground on the shadowy side ."
"I followed him at once , and instantly fell all my length , so weak was I and so giddy with that long exposure ."
"Here , then , we lay for an hour or two , aching from head to foot , as weak as water , and lying quite naked to the eye of any soldier who should have strolled that way ."
"None came , however , all passing by on the other side ; so that our rock continued to be our shield even in this new position ."
"Presently we began again to get a little strength ; and as the soldiers were now lying closer along the river-side , Alan proposed that we should try a start ."
"I was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world ; and that was to be set back upon the rock ; anything else was welcome to me ; so we got ourselves at once in marching order , and began to slip from rock to rock one after the other , now crawling flat on our bellies in the shade , now making a run for it , heart in mouth ."
"The soldiers , having searched this side of the valley after a fashion , and being perhaps somewhat sleepy with the sultriness of the afternoon , had now laid by much of their vigilance , and stood dozing at their posts or only kept a look-out along the banks of the river ; so that in this way , keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains , we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood ."
But the business was the most wearing I had ever taken part in .
"Between the well and the Round Pond are the cricket pitches , and frequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is scarcely any cricket ."
"Everybody wants to bat first , and as soon as he is out he bowls unless you are the better wrestler , and while you are wrestling with him the fielders have scattered to play at something else ."
"The Gardens are noted for two kinds of cricket : boy cricket , which is real cricket with a bat , and girl cricket , which is with a racquet and the governess ."
"Girls ca n't really play cricket , and when you are watching their futile efforts you make funny sounds at them ."
"Nevertheless , there was a very disagreeable incident one day when some forward girls challenged David 's team , and a disturbing creature called Angela Clare sent down so many yorkers that -- However , instead of telling you the result of that regrettable match I shall pass on hurriedly to the Round Pond , which is the wheel that keeps all the gardens going ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The Serpentine is a lovely lake , and there is a drowned forest at the bottom of it ."
"If you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down , and they say that at night there are also drowned stars in it -RSB- It is round because it is in the very middle of the Gardens , and when you are come to it you never want to go any farther ."
"You ca n't be good all the time at the Round Pond , however much you try ."
"You can be good in the Broad Walk all the time , but not at the Round Pond , and the reason is that you forget , and , when you remember , you are so wet that you may as well be wetter ."
"There are men who sail boats on the Round Pond , such big boats that they bring them in barrows , and sometimes in perambulators , and then the baby has to walk ."
The bow-legged children in the Gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father needed the perambulator .
"You always want to have a yacht to sail on the Round Pond , and in the end your uncle gives you one ; and to carry it to the pond the first day is splendid , also to talk about it to boys who have no uncle is splendid , but soon you like to leave it at home ."
"For the sweetest craft that slips her moorings in the Round Pond is what is called a stick-boat , because she is rather like a stick until she is in the water and you are holding the string ."
"Then as you walk round , pulling her , you see little men running about her deck , and sails rise magically and catch the breeze , and you put in on dirty nights at snug harbours which are unknown to the lordly yachts ."
"Night passes in a twink , and again your rakish craft noses for the wind , whales spout , you glide over buried cities , and have brushes with pirates , and cast anchor on coral isles ."
"You are a solitary boy while all this is taking place , for two boys together can not adventure far upon the Round Pond , and though you may talk to yourself throughout the voyage , giving orders and executing them with despatch , you know not , when it is time to go home , where you have been or what swelled your sails ; your treasure-trove is all locked away in your hold , so to speak , which will be opened , perhaps , by another little boy many years afterwards ."
But those yachts have nothing in their hold .
Does any one return to this haunt of his youth because of the yachts that used to sail it ?
Oh no .
It is the stick-boat that is freighted with memories .
"The yachts are toys , their owner a fresh-water mariner ; they can cross and recross a pond only while the stick-boat goes to sea ."
"You yachtsmen with your wands , who think we are all there to gaze on you , your ships are only accidents of this place , and were they all to be boarded and sunk by the ducks , the real business of the Round Pond would be carried on as usual ."
-LSB- Illustration : The island on which all the birds are born that become baby boys and girls -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- Paths from everywhere crowd like children to the pond .
"Some of them are ordinary paths , which have a rail on each side , and are made by men with their coats off , but others are vagrants , wide at one spot , and at another so narrow that you can stand astride them ."
"They are called Paths that have Made Themselves , and David did wish he could see them doing it ."
"But , like all the most wonderful things that happen in the Gardens , it is done , we concluded , at night after the gates are closed ."
We have also decided that the paths make themselves because it is their only chance of getting to the Round Pond .
One of these gypsy paths comes from the place where the sheep get their hair cut .
"When David shed his curls at the hairdresser 's , I am told , he said good-bye to them without a tremor , though his mother has never been quite the same bright creature since ; so he despises the sheep as they run from their shearer , and calls out tauntingly , ` Cowardly , cowardly custard ! '"
But when the man grips them between his legs David shakes a fist at him for using such big scissors .
Another startling moment is when the man turns back the grimy wool from the sheep 's shoulders and they look suddenly like ladies in the stalls of a theatre .
"The sheep are so frightened by the shearing that it makes them quite white and thin , and as soon as they are set free they begin to nibble the grass at once , quite anxiously , as if they feared that they would never be worth eating ."
"The sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the Spy-glass , which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs ."
"Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow , the hill bare and dark , the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock ."
"I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward , and it was my first thought to paddle in and land ."
That notion was soon given over .
"Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed ; loud reverberations , heavy sprays flying and falling , succeeded one another from second to second ; and I saw myself , if I ventured nearer , dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags ."
"Nor was that all , for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsters -- soft snails , as it were , of incredible bigness -- two or three score of them together , making the rocks to echo with their barkings ."
"I have understood since that they were sea lions , and entirely harmless ."
"But the look of them , added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf , was more than enough to disgust me of that landing-place ."
I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils .
"In the meantime I had a better chance , as I supposed , before me ."
"North of Haulbowline Head , the land runs in a long way , leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand ."
"To the north of that , again , there comes another cape -- Cape of the Woods , as it was marked upon the chart -- buried in tall green pines , which descended to the margin of the sea ."
"I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island , and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence , I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods ."
"There was a great , smooth swell upon the sea ."
"The wind blowing steady and gentle from the south , there was no contrariety between that and the current , and the billows rose and fell unbroken ."
"Had it been otherwise , I must long ago have perished ; but as it was , it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride ."
"Often , as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale , I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me ; yet the coracle would but bounce a little , dance as if on springs , and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird ."
I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling .
But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle .
"And I had hardly moved before the boat , giving up at once her gentle dancing movement , ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy , and struck her nose , with a spout of spray , deep into the side of the next wave ."
"I was drenched and terrified , and fell instantly back into my old position , whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows ."
"It was plain she was not to be interfered with , and at that rate , since I could in no way influence her course , what hope had I left of reaching land ?"
"I began to be horribly frightened , but I kept my head , for all that ."
"First , moving with all care , I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap ; then , getting my eye once more above the gunwale , I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers ."
"I found each wave , instead of the big , smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel 's deck , was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land , full of peaks and smooth places and valleys ."
"The coracle , left to herself , turning from side to side , threaded , so to speak , her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher , toppling summits of the wave ."
"`` Well , now , '' thought I to myself , `` it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance ; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time , in smooth places , give her a shove or two towards land . ''"
No sooner thought upon than done .
"There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude , and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore ."
"It was very tiring and slow work , yet I did visibly gain ground ; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods , though I saw I must infallibly miss that point , I had still made some hundred yards of easting ."
"I was , indeed , close in ."
"I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze , and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail ."
"If you fulfil your promise you know your reward ; if not , I will have you flogged for your impudence . '"
"Gilguerillo bowed , and turned to leave the palace , followed by the jeers and scoffs of everyone he met ."
"But he paid no heed , for he had got what he wanted ."
"He waited in front of the gates till a magnificent horse was led up to him , and vaulting into the saddle with an ease which rather surprised the attendant , rode quickly out of the town amidst the jests of the assembled crowd , who had heard of his audacious proposal ."
And while he is on his way let us pause for a moment and tell who he is .
"Both father and mother had died before the boy was six years old ; and he had lived for many years with his uncle , whose life had been passed in the study of chemistry ."
"He could leave no money to his nephew , as he had a son of his own ; but he taught him all he knew , and at his dead Gilguerillo entered an office , where he worked for many hours daily ."
"In his spare time , instead of playing with the other boys , he passed hours poring over books , and because he was timid and liked to be alone he was held by everyone to be a little mad ."
"Therefore , when it became known that he had promised to cure the king 's foot , and had ridden away -- no one knew where -- a roar of laughter and mockery rang through the town , and jeers and scoffing words were sent after him ."
But if they had only known what were Gilguerillo 's thoughts they would have thought him madder than ever .
"The real truth was that , on the morning when the princess had walked through the streets before making holiday on the river Gilguerillo had seen her from his window , and had straightway fallen in love with her ."
Of course he felt quite hopeless .
"It was absurd to imagine that the apothecary 's nephew could ever marry the king 's daughter ; so he did his best to forget her , and study harder than before , till the royal proclamation suddenly filled him with hope ."
"When he was free he no longer spent the precious moments poring over books , but , like the rest , he might have been seen wandering along the banks of the river , or diving into the stream after something that lay glistening in the clear water , but which turned out to be a white pebble or a bit of glass ."
"And at the end he understood that it was not by the river that he would win the princess ; and , turning to his books for comfort , he studied harder than ever ."
There is an old proverb which says : ` Everything comes to him who knows how to wait . '
"It is not all men who know hot to wait , any more than it is all men who can learn by experience ; but Gilguerillo was one of the few and instead of thinking his life wasted because he could not have the thing he wanted most , he tried to busy himself in other directions ."
"So , one day , when he expected it least , his reward came to him ."
"He happened to be reading a book many hundreds of years old , which told of remedies for all kinds of diseases ."
"Most of them , he knew , were merely invented by old women , who sought to prove themselves wiser than other people ; but at length he came to something which caused him to sit up straight in his chair , and made his eyes brighten ."
This was the description of a balsam -- which would cure every kind of sore or wound -- distilled from a plant only to be found in a country so distant that it would take a man on foot two months to go and come back again .
"When I say that the book declared that the balsam could heal every sort of sore or wound , there were a few against which it was powerless , and it gave certain signs by which these might be known ."
This was the reason why Gilguerillo demanded to see the king 's foot before he would undertake to cure it ; and to obtain admittance he gave out that he was a shoemaker .
"However , the dreaded signs were absent , and his heart bounded at the thought that the princess was within his reach ."
"Perhaps she was ; but a great deal had to be accomplished yet , and he had allowed himself a very short time in which to do it ."
"He spared his horse only so much as was needful , yet it took him six days to reach the spot where the plant grew ."
"A thick wood lay in front of him , and , fastening the bridle tightly to a tree , he flung himself on his hands and knees and began to hunt for the treasure ."
"Many time he fancied it was close to him , and many times it turned out to be something else ; but , at last , when light was fading , and he had almost given up hope , he came upon a large bed of the plant , right under his feet !"
"Trembling with joy , he picked every scrap he could see , and placed it in his wallet ."
"Then , mounting his horse , he galloped quickly back towards the city ."
"It was night when he entered the gates , and the fifteen days allotted were not up till the next day ."
"His eyes were heavy with sleep , and his body ached with the long strain , but , without pausing to rest , he kindled a fire on is hearth , and quickly filling a pot with water , threw in the herbs and left them to boil ."
"His rallying cry was, ""I am a Democrat."""
"The Mexican War now came on. General Taylor's army met the enemy first at Palo Alto, where he ran across the Mexicans six thousand strong, and, though he had but two thousand men, drove them back, only losing nine men. This was the most economical battle of the war."
"The next afternoon he met the enemy at Resaca de la Palma, and whipped him in the time usually required to ejaculate the word ""scat!"""
"Next General Taylor proceeded against Monterey, September 24, and with six thousand men attacked the strongly-fortified city, which held ten thousand troops. The Americans avoided the heavy fire as well as possible by entering the city and securing rooms at the best hotel, leaving word at the office that they did not wish to be disturbed by the enemy. In fact, the soldiers did dig their way through from house to house to avoid the volleys from the windows, and thus fought to within a square of the Grand Plaza, when the city surrendered. The Grand Plaza is generally a sandy vacant lot, where Mexicans sell tamales made of the highly-peppered but tempting cutlets of the Mexican hairless dog."
"The battle of Buena Vista took place February 23, 1847, General Santa Anna commanding the Mexicans. He had twenty thousand men, and General Taylor's troops were reduced in numbers. The fight was a hot one, lasting all day, and the Americans were saved by Bragg's artillery."
Bragg used the old Colonial method of rolling his guns up to the nose of the enemy and then discharging an iron-foundry into his midst. This disgusted the enemy so that General Santa Anna that evening took the shreds of his army and went away.
"General Kearney was sent to take New Mexico and California. His work consisted mainly in marching for General Frémont, who had been surveying a new route to Oregon, and had with sixty men been so successful that on the arrival of Kearney, with the aid of Commodores Sloat and Stockton, California was captured, and has given general satisfaction to every one."
"In March, 1847, General Scott, with twelve thousand men, bombarded Vera Cruz four days, and at the end of that time the city was surrendered."
"At Cerro Gordo, a week later, Scott overtook the enemy under General Santa Anna, and made such a fierce attack that the Mexicans were completely routed. Santa Anna left his leg on the field of battle and rode away on a pet mule named Charlotte Corday. The leg was preserved and taken to the Smithsonian Institute. It is made of second-growth hickory, and has a brass ferrule and a rubber eraser on the end. General Taylor afterwards taunted him with this incident, and, though greatly irritated, Santa Anna said there was no use trying to kick."
"Puebla resisted not, and the army marched into the city of Mexico August 7. The road was rendered disagreeable by strong fortifications and thirty thousand men who were not on good terms with Scott. The environments and suburbs one after another were taken, and a parley for peace ensued, during which the Mexicans were busy fortifying some more on the quiet."
"September 8 the Americans made their assault, and carried the outworks one by one. Then the castle of Chapultepec was stormed. First the outer works were scaled, which made them much more desirable, and the moat was removed by means of a stomach-pump and blotting-pad, and then the escarpment was up-ended, the Don John tower was knocked silly by a solid shot, and the castle capitulated."
"Thus on the 14th of September the old flag floated over the court-house of Mexico, and General Scott ate his tea in the palace of the Montezumas. Peace was declared February 2, 1848, and the United States owned the vast country southward to the Gila (pronounced Heeler) and west to the Pacific Ocean."
"The Wilmot Proviso was invented by David Wilmot, a poor, struggling member of Congress, who moved that in any territory acquired by the United States slavery should be prohibited except upon the advice of a physician. The motion was lost."
"Gold was discovered in the Sacramento Valley in August, 1848, by a workman who was building a mill-race. A struggle ensued over this ground as to who should own the race. It threatened to terminate in a race war, but was settled amicably."
In eighteen months one hundred thousand people went to the scene.
"Thousands left their skeletons with the red brother, and other thousands left theirs on the Isthmus of Panama or on the cruel desert. Many married men went who had been looking a long time for some good place to go to. Leaving their wives with ill-concealed relief, they started away through a country filled with death, to reach a country they knew not of. Some died en route, others were hanged, and still others became the heads of new families. Some came back and carried water for their wives to wash clothing for their neighbors."
"It was a long hard trip then across the plains. One of the author's friends at the age of thirteen years drove a little band of cows from the State of Indiana to Sacramento. He says he would not do it again for anything. He is now a man, and owns a large prune-orchard in California, and people tell him he is getting too stout, and that he ought to exercise more, and that he ought to walk every day several miles; but he shakes his head, and says, ""No, I will not walk any to-day, and possibly not to-morrow or the day following. Do not come to me and refer to taking a walk: I have tried that. Possibly you take me for a dromedary; but you are wrong. I am a fat man, and may die suddenly some day while lacing up my shoes, but when I go anywhere I ride."""
"When he got to Sacramento, where gold was said to be so plentiful, he was glad to wash dishes for his board, and he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into the fields for to feed swine, and he would fain have filled his system with the California peaches which the swine did eat, and he began to be in want, and no man gave unto him, and if he had spent his substance in riotous living, he said, it would have been different."
"About thirty years after that he arose and went unto his father, and carried his dinner with him, also a government bond and a new suit of raiment for the old gentleman."
I do not know what we should learn from this.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE WEBSTERS.
"Daniel Webster, together with Mr. Clay, had much to do with the Compromise measures of 1850. These consisted in the admission of California as a free State, the organizing of the Territories of Utah and New Mexico without any provision regarding slavery pro or con, the payment to Texas of one hundred million dollars for New Mexico, which was a good trade for Texas, the prohibition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and the enactment of a Fugitive Slave Law permitting owners of slaves to follow them into the free States and take them back in irons, if necessary. The officials and farmers of the free States were also expected to turn out, call the dog, leave their work, and help catch these chattels and carry them to the south-bound train."
"Daniel Webster was born in 1782, and Noah in 1758. Daniel was educated at Dartmouth College, where he was admitted in 1797. He taught school winters and studied summers, as many other great men have done since, until he knew about everything that anybody could. What Dan did not know, Noah did."
"Strange to say, Daniel was frightened to death when first called upon to speak a piece. He says he committed dozens of pieces to memory and recited them to the woods and crags and cows and stone abutments of the New England farms, but could not stand up before a school and utter a word."
"In 1801 he studied law with Thomas W. Thompson, afterwards United States Senator. He read then for the first time that ""Law is a rule of action prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong."""
"In 1812 he was elected to Congress, and in 1813 made his maiden speech."
"One of his most masterly speeches was made on economical and financial subjects; and yet in order to get his blue broadcloth coat with brass buttons from the tailor-shop to wear while making the speech, he had to borrow twenty-five dollars."
"When the country has wanted a man to talk well on these subjects it has generally been compelled to advance money to him before he could make a speech. Sometimes he has to be taken from the pawn-shop. Webster, it is said, was the most successful lawyer, after he returned to Boston, that the State of Massachusetts has ever known; and yet his mail was full of notices from banks down East, announcing that he had overdrawn his account."
"Washington decided that he must strike a daring blow while his troops had any hope or vitality left; and so on Christmas night, after crossing the Delaware as shown elsewhere, he fell on the Hessians at Trenton in the midst of their festivities, captured one thousand prisoners, and slew the leader."
"The Hessians were having a symposium at the time, and though the commander received an important note of warning during the Christmas dinner, he thrust it into his pocket and bade joy be unconfined."
"When daylight came, the Hessians were mostly moving in alcoholic circles trying to find their guns. Washington lost only four men, and two of those were frozen to death."
The result of this fight gave the Colonists courage and taught them at the same time that it would be best to avoid New Jersey symposiums till after the war was over.
"Having made such a hit in crossing the Delaware, Washington decided to repeat the performance on the 3d of January. He was attacked at Trenton by Cornwallis, who is known in history for his justly celebrated surrender. He waited till morning, having been repulsed at sundown."
"Washington left his camp-fires burning, surrounded the British, captured two hundred prisoners, and got away to Morristown Heights in safety. If the ground had not frozen, General Washington could not have moved his forty cannon; but, fortunately, the thermometer was again on his side, and he never lost a gun."
"September 11 the English got into the Chesapeake, and Washington announced in the papers that he would now fight the battle of the Brandywine, which he did."
"Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot from under him."
"The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia."
"October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the dullest winter of his life."
"The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way."
"A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life."
"He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's troops by a neck."
"Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the militia. Stark said, ""Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow."" This neat little remark made an instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian."
"Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks."
"He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British wit had it, ""gave Gates ajar,"" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks."
"Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open fire."
"Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle, probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command, and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp."
"Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold."
"A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent compositions ever composed."
During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.
"Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to rest and dream of food and freedom."
Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of such heroic sires.
Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination of his personal record.
"In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the struggling troops."
"The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and, alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better facilities for getting home."
"Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a retreat."
"Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him and went away where they could be by themselves."
"Things were very much unsettled. England had not sent a minister to this country, and had arranged no commercial treaty with us."
Washington's Cabinet consisted of three portfolios and a rack in which he kept his flute-music.
"The three ministers were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Treasury. There was no Attorney-General, or Postmaster-General, or Secretary of the Interior, or of the Navy, or Seed Catalogue Secretary."
"Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, advised that Congress at the earliest moment provide itself with a national debt, which was done, the war debt being assumed by the Congressional representatives of the thirteen Colonies."
"A tax was levied on spirits, and a mint started, combining the two, and making the mint encourage the consumption of spirits, and thus the increase of the tax, very likely."
"A Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794. Pennsylvania especially rebelled at the tax on this grocery, but it was put down. (Those wishing to know which was put down will find out by consulting the Appendix, which will be issued a year from this winter.)"
"A few Indian wars now kept the people interested, and a large number of the red brothers, under Little Turtle, soon found themselves in the soup, as Washington put it so tersely in his message the following year."
Twenty-five thousand square miles north of the Ohio were obtained by treaty from the Indians.
"England claimed that traffic with America was not desirable, as the Americans did not pay their debts. Possibly that was true, for muskrat pelts were low at that time, and England refused to take cord-wood and saw-logs piled on the New York landing as cash."
"Chief-Justice Jay was sent to London to confer with the king, which he did. He was not invited, however, to come to the house during his stay, and the queen did not call on Mrs. Jay. The Jays have never recovered from this snub, and are still gently guyed by the comic papers."
"But the treaty was negotiated, and now the Americans are said to pay their debts as well as the nobility who marry our American girls instead of going into bankruptcy, as some would do."
"The Mississippi and the Mediterranean Sea were opened for navigation to American vessels now, and things looked better, for we could by this means exchange our cranberries for sugar and barter our Indian relics for camel's-hair shawls, of which the pioneers were very much in need during the rigorous winters in the North."
"The French now had a difficulty with England, and Washington, who still remembered La Fayette and the generous aid of the French, wished that he was back at Mount Vernon, working out his poll-tax on the Virginia roads, for he was in a tight place."
"It was now thought best to have two political parties, in order to enliven editorial thought and expression. So the Republican party, headed by Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, and the Federalist party, led by Hamilton and Adams, were organized, and public speakers were engaged from a distance."
"The latter party supported the administration, which was not so much of a job as it has been several times since."
"Washington declined to accept a third term, and wrote a first-rate farewell address. A lady, whose name is withheld, writing of those times, closes by saying that President Washington was one of the sweetest men she ever knew."
"John Adams succeeded Washington as President, and did not change his politics to amount to much."
"He made a good record as Congressman, but lost it as President largely because of his egotism. He seemed to think that if he neglected to oil the gearing of the solar system about so often, it would stop running."
We should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority.
"Adams and Jefferson were good friends during the Revolution, but afterwards political differences estranged them till they returned to private life. Adams was a poor judge of men, and offended several members of the press who called on him to get his message in advance."
"Our country was on the eve of a war with France, when Napoleon I. was made Consul, and peace followed."
"Adams's administration made the Federalists unpopular, owing to the Alien and Sedition laws, and Jefferson was elected the successor of Adams, Burr running as Vice-President with him. The election was so close that it went to the House, however."
"Jefferson, or the Sage of Monticello, was a good President, noted for his simplicity. He married and brought his bride home to Monticello prior to this. She had to come on horseback about one hundred miles, and, as the house was unfinished and no servants there, they had to sleep on the work-bench and eat what was left of the carpenter's lunch."
"Jeffersonian simplicity was his strong point, and people who called at the White House often found him sprinkling the floor of his office, or trying to start a fire with kerosene."
"Burr was Vice-President, and, noticing at once that the office did not attract any attention to speak of, decided to challenge Mr. Alexander Hamilton to fight a duel with him."
"The affair took place at Weehawken, July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell at the first fire, on the same spot where his eldest son had been killed in the same way."
"The artist has shown us how Burr and Hamilton should have fought, but, alas! they were not progressive men and did not realize this till too late. Another method would have been to use the bloodless method of the French duel, or the newspaper customs adopted by the pugilists of 1893."
The time is approaching when mortal combat in America will be confined to belligerent people under the influence of liquor. A newspaper assault instead of a duel might have made Burr President and Hamilton Vice-President.
"Burr went West, and was afterwards accused of treason on the ground that he was trying to organize Mexico against the United States government."
"His heart was good, but his blood was bad,       Sing Glory hallelujah.""[3]"

CHAPTER VIII.
THE DUTCH AT NEW AMSTERDAM.
"Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, Dutch ships began to visit that region, to traffic in furs with the Indians. Some huts were erected by these traders on Manhattan Island in 1613, and a trading-post was established in 1615. Relics of these times are frequently turned up yet on Broadway while putting in new pipes, or taking out old pipes, or repairing other pipes, or laying plans for yet other pipes, or looking in the earth to see that the original pipes have not been taken away."
"Afterwards the West India Company obtained a grant of New Netherland, and New Amsterdam was fairly started. In 1626, Minuit, the first governor, arrived, and, as we have stated, purchased the entire city of New York of the Indians for twenty-four dollars."
"Then trouble sprang up between the Dutch and the Swedes on the Delaware over the possession of Manhattan, and when the two tribes got to conversing with each other over their rights, using the mother-tongue on both sides, it reminded one of the Chicago wheat market when business is good. The English on the Connecticut also saw that Manhattan was going to boom as soon as the Indians could be got farther west, and that property would be high there."
"Peter Stuyvesant was the last Dutch governor of New York. He was a relative of mine. He disliked the English very much. They annoyed him with their democratic ideas and made his life a perfect hell to him. He would be sorry to see the way our folks have since begun to imitate the English. I can almost see him rising in his grave to note how the Stuyvesants in full cry pursue the affrighted anise-seed bag, or with their coaching outfits go tooling along 'cross country, stopping at the inns on the way and unlimbering their portable bath-tubs to check them with the ""clark."""
"Pete, you did well to die early. You would not have been happy here now."
"While Governor Stuyvesant was in hot water with the English, the Swedes, and the Indians, a fleet anchored in the harbor and demanded the surrender of the place in the name of the Duke of York, who wished to use it for a game preserve. After a hot fight with his council, some of whom were willing even then to submit to English rule and hoped that the fleet might have two or three suits of tweed which by mistake were a fit and therefore useless to the owners, and that they might succeed in swapping furs for these, the governor yielded, and in 1664 New York became a British possession, named as above."
"The English governors, however, were not popular. They were mostly political hacks who were pests at home and banished to New York, where the noise of the streets soon drove them to drink. For nine years this sort of thing went on, until one day a Dutch fleet anchored near the Staten Island brewery and in the evening took the town."
"However, in the year following, peace was restored between England and Holland, and New Amsterdam became New York again, also subject to the Tammany rule."
"Andros was governor for a time, but was a sort of pompous tomtit, with a short breath and a large aquiline opinion of himself. He was one of the arrogant old pie-plants whose growth was fostered by the beetle-bellied administration at home. He went back on board the City of Rome one day, and did not return."
"New York had a gleam of hope for civil freedom under the rule of the Duke of York and the county Democracy, but when the duke became James II. he was just like other people who get a raise of salary, and refused to be privately entertained by the self-made ancestry of the American."
"He was proud and arrogant to a degree. He forbade legislation, and stopped his paper. New York was at this time annexed to the New England Colony, and began keeping the Sabbath so vigorously that the angels had great difficulty in getting at it."
"Nicholson, who was the lieutenant tool of iniquity for Andros, fled with him when democracy got too hot for them. Captain Leisler, supported by Steve Brodie and everything south of the Harlem, but bitterly opposed by the aristocracy, who were distinguished by their ability to use new goods in making their children's clothes, whereas the democracy had to make vests for the boys from the cast-off trousers of their fathers, governed the province until Governor Sloughter arrived."
"Sloughter was another imported Smearkase in official life, and arrested Leisler at the request of an aristocrat who drove a pair of bang-tail horses up and down Nassau Street on pleasant afternoons and was afterwards collector of the port. Having arrested Leisler for treason, the governor was a little timid about executing him, for he had never really killed a man in his life, and he hated the sight of blood; so Leisler's enemies got the governor to take dinner with them, and mixed his rum, so that when he got ready to speak, his remarks were somewhat heterogeneous, and before he went home he had signed a warrant for Leisler's immediate execution."
"When he awoke in the morning at his beautiful home on Whitehall Street, the sun was gayly glinting the choppy waves of Buttermilk Channel, and by his watch, which had run down, he saw that it was one o'clock, but whether it was one o'clock A.M. or P.M. he did not know, nor whether it was next Saturday or Tuesday before last. Oh, how he must have felt!"
"His room was dark, the gas having gone out to get better air. He attempted to rise, but a chill, a throb, a groan, and back he lay hastily on the bed just as it was on the point of escaping him. Suddenly a thought came to him. It was not a great thought, but it was such a thought as comes to those who have been thoughtless. He called for a blackamoor slave from abroad who did chores for him, and ordered a bottle of cooking brandy, then some club soda he had brought from London with him. Next he drank a celery-glass of it, and after that he felt better. He then drank another."
"""Keep out of the way of this bed, Julius,"" he said. ""It is coming around that way again. Step to one side, Julius, please, and let the bed walk around and stretch its legs. I never saw a bed spread itself so,"" he continued, seeming to enjoy his own Lancashire humor. ""All night I seemed to feel a great pain creeping over me, Julius,"" he said, hesitatingly, again filling his celery-glass, ""but I see now that it was a counterpane."""
"Eighty years after that, Sloughter was a corpse."
"We should learn from this not to be too hasty in selecting our birthplaces. Had he been born in America, he might have been alive yet."
"From this on the struggles of the people up to the time of the Revolution were enough to mortify the reader almost to death. I will not go over them again. It was the history of all the other Colonies; poor, proud, with large masses of children clustering about, and Indians lurking in the out-buildings. The mother-country was negligent, and even cruel. Her political offscourings were sent to rule the people. The cranberry-crops soured on the vines, and times were very scarce."
"It was during this period that Captain William Kidd, a New York ship-master and anti-snapper from Mulberry Street, was sent out to overtake and punish a few of the innumerable pirates who then infested the high seas."
"Studying first the character, life, and public services of the immoral pirate, and being perfectly foot-loose, his wife having eloped with her family physician, he determined to take a little whirl at the business himself, hoping thereby to escape the noise and heat of New York and obtain a livelihood while life lasted which would maintain him the remainder of his days unless death overtook him."
"Dropping off at Boston one day to secure a supply of tobacco, he was captured while watching the vast number of street-cars on Washington Street. He was taken to England, where he was tried and ultimately hanged. His sudden and sickening death did much to discourage an American youth of great brilliancy who had up to 1868 intended to be a pirate, but who, stumbling across the ""Life and Times of Captain Kidd, and his Awful Death,"" changed his whole course and became one of the ablest historians of the age in which he lived."
This should teach us to read the papers instead of loaning them to people who do not subscribe.
"Cornwallis in this Virginia and Southern trip destroyed ten million dollars' worth of property, and then fortified himself at Yorktown."
"Washington decided to besiege Yorktown, and, making a feint to fool Clinton, set out for that place, visiting Mount Vernon en route after an absence of six and a half years, though only stopping two days."
"Washington was a soldier in the true sense, and, when a lad, was given a little hatchet by his father. George cut down some cherry-trees with this, in order to get the cherries without climbing the trees. One day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down, and spoke of it to the lad."
"""Yes,"" said George, ""I did it with my little hatchet; but I would rather cut down a thousand cherry-trees and tell the truth about it than be punished for it."""
"""Well said, my brave boy!"" exclaimed the happy father as he emptied George's toy bank into his pocket in payment for the trees. ""You took the words right out of my mouth."""
"In speaking of the siege of Yorktown, the historian says, ""The most hearty good will prevailed."" What more could you expect of a siege than that?"
"Cornwallis capitulated October 19. It was the most artistic capitulation he had ever given. The troops were arranged in two lines facing each other, British and American with their allies the French under Rochambeau."
"People came from all over the country who had heard of Cornwallis and his wonderful genius as a capitulator. They came for miles, and brought their lunches with them; but the general, who felt an unnecessary pique towards Washington, refused to take part in the exercises himself, claiming that by the advice of his physicians he would have to remain in his tent, as they feared that he had over-capitulated himself already."
"He therefore sent his sword by General O'Hara, and Washington turned it over to Lincoln, who had been obliged to surrender to the English at Charleston."
"The news reached Philadelphia in the night, and when the watchman cried, ""Past two o'clock, and Cornwallis is taken!"" the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics, for they regarded the war as virtually ended. The old door-keeper of Congress died of delight. Thanks were returned to Almighty God, and George Washington's nomination was a sure thing."
"England decided that whoever counselled war any further was a public enemy, and Lord North, then prime minister, when he heard of the surrender of Cornwallis through a New York paper, exclaimed, ""Oh, God!"
"it is all over!"""
"Washington now showed his sagacity in quelling the fears of the soldiers regarding their back pay. He was invited to become king, but, having had no practice, and fearing that he might run against a coup d'état or faux pas, he declined, and spoke kindly against taking violent measures."
"In 1783, September 3, a treaty of peace was signed in Paris, and Washington, delivering the most successful farewell address ever penned, retired to Mount Vernon, where he began at once to enrich his farm with the suggestions he had received during his absence, and to calmly take up the life that had been interrupted by the tedious and disagreeable war."
"The country was free and independent, but, oh, how ignorant it was about the science of government! The author does not wish to be personal when he states that the country at that time did not know enough about affairs to carry water for a circus elephant."
"It was heavily in debt, with no power to raise money. New England refused to pay her poll-tax, and a party named Shays directed his hired man to overturn the government; but a felon broke out on his thumb, and before he could put it down the crisis was averted and the country saved."
CHAPTER XIX.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
"It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon to the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation."
"Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. He was asked at all the towns to build there, and 'most everybody wanted him ""to come and make their house his home."" When he got to the ferry he was not pushed off into the water by commuters, but lived to reach the Old Federal Hall, where he was sworn in."
"In 1791 the seat of government was removed to Philadelphia, where it remained for ten years, after which the United States took advantage of the Homestead Act and located on a tract of land ten miles square, known as the District of Columbia. In 1846 that part of the District lying on the Virginia side of the Potomac was ceded back to the State."
"President Washington did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office-seekers. He could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. He could remain in the forest back of his house until Martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post-office at Pigback had gone, and then he could return."
"How times have changed with the growth of the republic! Now Pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to Hogback, and the President avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in, to leave the swarm of jobless applicants who come to pester him to death for appointments."
The historian begs leave to say here that the usefulness of the President for the good of his country and the consideration of greater questions will some day be reduced to very little unless he may be able to avoid this effort to please voters who overestimate their greatness.
"It is said that Washington had no library, which accounted for his originality. He was a vestryman in the Episcopal Church; and to see his tall and graceful form as he moved about from pew to pew collecting pence for Home Missions, was a lovely sight."
As a boy he was well behaved and a careful student.
"At one time he was given a hatchet by his father, which"
But what has the historian to do with this morbid wandering in search of truth?
"However, the suggestion was not acted on. The Colonial soldiers declined to put on a bright red coat and a pill-box cap, that kept falling off in battle, thus delaying the carnage, but preferred to wear homespun which was of a neutral shade, and shoot their enemy from behind stumps. They said it was all right to dress up for a muster, but they preferred their working-clothes for fighting. After the war a statistician made the estimate that nine per cent. of the British troops were shot while ascertaining if their caps were on straight.[4]"
"General Israel Putnam was known as the champion rough rider of his day, and once when hotly pursued rode down three flights of steps, which, added to the flight he made from the English soldiers, made four flights. Putnam knew not fear or cowardice, and his name even to-day is the synonyme for valor and heroism."
CHAPTER XV.
"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, LL.D., PH.G., F.R.S., ETC."
"It is considered advisable by the historian at this time to say a word regarding Dr. Franklin, our fellow-townsman, and a journalist who was the Charles A. Dana of his time."
"Franklin's memory will remain green when the names of the millionaires of to-day are forgotten. Coextensive with the name of E. Rosewater of the Omaha Bee we will find that of Benjamin Franklin, whose bust sits above the fireplace of the writer at this moment, while a large Etruscan hornet is making a phrenological examination of same."
But let us proceed to more fully mark out the life and labors of this remarkable man.
"Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child. If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's parents they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen pairs of them!"
"Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea, and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer."
"It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom."
"It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it would harden so that ""A Constant Reader"" or ""Veritas"" could be stabbed with it and die soon."
"Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with them."
"His paper was called the New England Courant. It was edited jointly by James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want."
"Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the other was in jail."
"In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad., put it off on ""our informant"" and go right along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side."
"How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?"
"At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to ""sub"" for a few weeks and then got a regular ""sit."""
"Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy."
He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would think he owned the paper.
"In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was then regarded as a great man, and almost every one took his paper."
"Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him."
"Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the Gazette office for examination."
"Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess."
"In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to where it was addressed."
"Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a great deal of attention."
"He was put in a common jail to await trial. Afterwards he was discharged, but was never again on good terms with the government, and never rose again."
"When he came into town and registered at the hotel the papers did not say anything about it; and so he stopped taking them, thus falling into ignorance and oblivion at the same moment, although at one time he had lacked but a single vote to make him President of the United States."
"England and France still continued at war, and American vessels were in hot water a good deal, as they were liable to be overhauled by both parties. England especially, with the excuse that she was looking for deserters, stopped American vessels and searched them, going through the sleeping-apartments before the work was done up, one of the rudest things known in international affairs."
"An Embargo Act was passed forbidding American vessels to leave port, an act which showed that the bray of the ass had begun to echo through the halls of legislation even at that early day."
"In the mean time, Jefferson had completed his second term, and James Madison, the Republican candidate, had succeeded him at the helm of state, as it was then called."
"His party favored a war with England, especially as the British had begun again to stir up the red brother."
"Madison was a Virginian. He was a man of unblemished character, and was not too haughty to have fun sometimes. This endeared him to the whole nation. Unlike Adams, he never swelled up so that his dignity hurt him under the arms. He died in 1836, genial and sunny to the last."
"It was now thought best to bring on the war of 1812, which began by an Indian attack at Tippecanoe on General Harrison's troops in 1811, when the Indians were defeated. June 19, 1812, war was finally declared."
"The first battle was between the forces under General Hull on our side and the English and Indians on the British side, near Detroit. The troops faced each other, Tecumseh being the Indian leader, and both armies stood ready to have one of the best battles ever given in public or private, when General Hull was suddenly overcome with remorse at the thought of shedding blood, especially among people who were so common, and, shaking a large table-cloth out the window in token of peace, amid the tears of his men, surrendered his entire command in a way that reminded old settlers very much of Cornwallis."
CHAPTER XX.
THE WAR WITH CANADA.
"October 13, General Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River and attacked the British at Queenstown Heights. The latter retreated, and General Brock was killed. General Van Rensselaer went back after the rest of his troops, but they refused to cross, on the ground that the general had no right to take them out of the United States, and thus the troops left in charge at the Heights were compelled to surrender."
"These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for them, because they didn't want to cross the Canadian line, would not have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers, very likely, in later years."
"August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and Guerriere, off the Massachusetts coast. The Constitution, called ""Old Ironsides,"" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull. The Guerriere was first to attack, but got no reply until both vessels were very close together, when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop-sided on the off side. She surrendered, but was of no value, being so full of holes that she would not hold a cargo of railroad-trestles."
"The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea regarding their ammunition, holding their fire until the enemy was at arm's length, was the cause of more than one victory. They were obliged, indeed, to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not produced here, and powder was imported."
"October 13, the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place, off the North Carolina coast. The Frolic was an English brig, and she wound up as most frolics do, with a severe pain and a five-dollar fine. After the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards, the decks of the Frolic were a sight to behold. There were not enough able-bodied men to surrender the ship. She was captured by the boarding-crew, but there was not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors."
"Other victories followed on the sea, and American privateers had more fun than anybody."
"Madison was re-elected, thus showing that his style of administration suited one and all, and the war was prosecuted at a great rate. It became a sort of fight with Canada, the latter being supported by English arms by land and sea. Of course the Americans would have preferred to fight England direct, and many were in favor of attacking London: but when the commanding officer asked those of the army who had the means to go abroad to please raise their right hands, it was found that the trip must be abandoned. Those who had the means to go did not have suitable clothes for making a respectable appearance, and so it was given up."
"Three divisions were made of the army, all having an attack on Canada as the object in view, viz., the army of the Centre, the army of the North, and the army of the West. The armies of the Centre and North did not do much, aside from the trifling victory at York, and President Madison said afterwards in a letter to the writer's family that the two armies did not accomplish enough to pay the duty on them. The army of the West managed to stand off the British, though the latter still held Michigan and threatened Ohio."
"September 10, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and was well received. Perry was twenty-seven years old, and was given command of a flotilla on Lake Erie, provided he would cut the timber and build it, meantime boarding himself. The British had long been in possession of Lake Erie, and when Perry got his scows afloat they issued invitations for a general display of carnage. They bore down on Perry and killed all the men on his flag-ship but eight. Then he helped them fire the last gun, and with the flag they jumped into a boat which they paddled for the Niagara under a galling fire. This was the first time that a galling fire had ever been used at sea. Perry passed within pistol-shot of the British, and in less than a quarter of an hour after he trod the poop of the Niagara he was able to write to General Harrison, ""We have met the enemy, and they are ours."""
"Proctor and Tecumseh were at Malden, with English and Indians, preparing to plunder the frontier and kill some more women and children as soon as they felt rested up. At the news of Perry's victory, Harrison decided to go over and stir them up. Arriving at Malden, he found it deserted, and followed the foe to the river Thames, where he charged with his Kentucky horsemen right through the British lines and so on down the valley, where they reformed and started back to charge on their rear, when the whole outfit surrendered except the Indians. Proctor, however, was mounted on a tall fox-hunter which ran away with him. He afterwards wrote back to General Harrison that he made every effort to surrender personally, but that circumstances prevented. He was greatly pained by this."
"The Americans now charged on the Indians, and Johnson, the commander of the Blue Grass Dragoons, fired a shot which took Tecumseh just west of the watch-pocket. He died, he said, tickled to death to know that he had been shot by an American."
"Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, having taken the British brig Peacock, was given command of the Chesapeake, which he took to Boston to have repaired. While there, he got a challenge from the Shannon. He put to sea with half a crew, and a shot in his chest that is, the arm-chest of the ship burst the whole thing open and annoyed every one on board. The enemy boarded the Chesapeake and captured her, so Captain Lawrence, her brave commander, breathed his last, after begging his men not to give up the ship."
"However, the victories on the Canadian border settled the war once more for the time, and cheered the Americans very much."
"The Indians in 1813 fell upon Fort Mimms and massacred the entire garrison, men, women, and children, not because they felt a personal antipathy towards them, but because they the red brothers had sold their lands too low and their hearts were sad in their bosoms. There is really no fun in trading with an Indian, for he is devoid of business instincts, and reciprocity with the red brother has never been a success."
"General Jackson took some troops and attacked the red brother, killing six hundred of him and capturing the rest of the herd. Jackson did not want to hear the Indians speak pieces and see them smoke the pipe of peace, but buried the dead and went home. He had very little of the romantic complaint which now and then breaks out regarding the Indian, but knew full well that all the Indians ever born on the face of the earth could not compensate for the cruel and violent death of one good, gentle, patient American mother."
Admiral Cockburn now began to pillage the coast of the Southern States and borrow communion services from the churches of Virginia and the Carolinas. He also murdered the sick in their beds.
"Whiskey will not make a poet, nor poker a great pleader. And yet I have seen poets who relied on the potency of their breath, and lawyers who knew more of the habits of a bobtail flush than they ever did of the statutes in such case made and provided."
"George Washington was always ready. If you wanted a man to be first in war, you could call on George. If you desired an adult who would be first baseman in time of peace, Mr. Washington could be telephoned at any hour of the day or night. If you needed a man to be first in the hearts of his countrymen, George's post-office address was at once secured."
"Though he was a great man, he was once a poor boy. How often you hear that in America! Here it is a positive disadvantage to be born wealthy."
And yet sometimes I wish they had experimented a little that way on me.
"I do not ask now to be born rich, of course, because it is too late; but it seems to me that, with my natural good sense and keen insight into human nature, I could have struggled along under the burdens and cares of wealth with great success. I do not care to die wealthy, but if I could have been born wealthy it seems to me I would have been tickled almost to death."
"I love to believe that true greatness is not accidental. To think and to say that greatness is a lottery, is pernicious. Man may be wrong sometimes in his judgment of others, both individually and in the aggregate, but he who gets ready to be a great man will surely find the opportunity."
"You will wonder whom I got to write this sentiment for me, but you will never find out."
"In conclusion, let me say that George Washington was successful for three reasons. One was that he never shook the confidence of his friends. Another was that he had a strong will without being a mule."
Some people cannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue donkey.
"Another reason why Washington is loved and honored to-day is that he died before we had a chance to get tired of him. This is greatly superior to the method adopted by many modern statesmen, who wait till their constituency weary of them, and then reluctantly pass away."
CHAPTER XIII.
CONTRASTS WITH THE PRESENT DAY.
"Here it may be well to speak briefly of the contrast between the usages and customs of the period preceding the Revolution, and the present day."
"Some of these customs and regulations have improved with the lapse of time, others undoubtedly have not."
"Two millions of people constituted the entire number of whites, while away to the westward the red brother extended indefinitely. Religiously they were Protestants, and essentially they were ""a God-fearing people."""
"Taught to obey a power they were afraid of, they naturally turned with delight to the service of a God whose genius in the erection of a boundless and successful hell challenged their admiration and esteem."
"So, too, their own executions of Divine laws were successful as they gave pain, and the most beautiful features of Christianity, namely, love and charity, according to history, were not cultivated very much."
"There were in New England at one time twelve offences punishable with death, and in Virginia seventeen. This would indicate that the death-penalty is getting unpopular very fast, and that in the contiguous future humane people will wonder why murder should have called for murder, in this brainy, charitable, and occult age, in which man seems almost able to pry open the future and catch a glimpse of Destiny underneath the great tent that has heretofore held him off by means of death's prohibitory rates."
In Hartford people had to get up when the town watchman rang his bell.
"The affairs of the family, and private matters too numerous to mention, were regulated by the selectmen. The catalogues of Harvard and Yale were regulated according to the standing of the family as per record in the old country, and not as per bust measurement and merit, as it is to-day."
"Scolding women, however, were gagged and tied to their front doors, so that the populace could bite its thumb at them, and hired girls received fifty dollars a year, with the understanding that they were not to have over two days out each week, except Sunday and the days they had to go and see their ""sick sisters."""
"Some cloth-weaving was indulged in, and homespun was the principal material used for clothing. Mrs. Washington had sixteen spinning-wheels in her house. Her husband often wore homespun while at home, and on rainy days sometimes placed a pair of home-made trousers of the barn-door variety in the Presidential chair."
"Money was very scarce, and ammunition very valuable. In 1635 musket-balls passed for farthings, and to see a New England peasant making change with the red brother at thirty yards was a common and delightful scene."
"The first press was set up in Cambridge in 1639, with the statement that it ""had come to stay."" Books printed in those days were mostly sermons filled with the most comfortable assurance that the man who let loose his intellect and allowed it to disbelieve some very difficult things would be essentially  well, I hate to say right here in a book what would happen to him."
"The first daily paper, called The Federal Orrery, was issued three hundred years after Columbus discovered America. It was not popular, and killed off the news-boys who tried to call it on the streets: so it perished."
"There was a public library in New York, from which books were loaned at fourpence ha'penny per week. New York thus became very early the seat of learning, and soon afterwards began to abuse the site where Chicago now stands."
"Travel was slow, the people went on horseback or afoot, and when they could go by boat it was regarded as a success. Wagons finally made the trip from New York to Philadelphia in the wild time of forty-eight hours, and the line was called The Flying Dutchman, or some other euphonious name. Benjamin Franklin, whose biography occurs in Chapter XV., was then Postmaster-General."
"He was the first bald-headed man of any prominence in the history of America. He and his daughter Sally took a trip in a chaise, looking over the entire system, and going to all offices. Nothing pleased the Postmaster-General like quietly slipping into a place like Sandy Bottom and catching the postmaster reading over the postal cards and committing them to memory."
"""It'll come again, I'll be bound,"" thought Boots; but no, it didn't come again; still it was, and still it stayed; but after he had lain a little while, he heard a noise as if a horse were standing just outside the barn-door, and cropping the grass. He stole to the door, and peeped through a chink, and there stood a horse feeding away. So big, and fat, and grand a horse, Boots had never set eyes on; by his side on the grass lay a saddle and bridle, and a full set of armour for a knight, all of brass, so bright that the light gleamed from it."
"""Ho, ho!"" thought the lad; ""it's you, is it, that eats up our hay?"
"I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel, just see if I don't."""
"So he lost no time, but took the steel out of his tinder-box, and threw it over the horse; then it had no power to stir from the spot, and became so tame that the lad could do what he liked with it. So he got on its back, and rode off with it to a place which no one knew of, and there he put up the horse. When he got home, his brothers laughed and asked how he had fared?"
"""You didn't lie long in the barn, even if you had the heart to go so far as the field."""
"""Well,"" said Boots, ""all I can say is, I lay in the barn till the sun rose, and neither saw nor heard anything; I can't think what there was in the barn to make you both so afraid."""
"""A pretty story,"" said his brothers; ""but we'll soon see how you have watched the meadow;"" so they set off; but when they reached it, there stood the grass as deep and thick as it had been over night."
"Well, the next St. John's eve it was the same story over again; neither of the elder brothers dared to go out to the outlying field to watch the crop; but Boots, he had the heart to go, and everything happened just as it had happened the year before. First a clatter and an earthquake, then a greater clatter and another earthquake, and so on a third time; only this year the earthquakes were far worse than the year before. Then all at once everything was as still as death, and the lad heard how something was cropping the grass outside the barn-door, so he stole to the door, and peeped through a chink; and what do you think he saw? Why, another horse standing right up against the wall, and chewing and champing with might and main. It was far finer and fatter than that which came the year before, and it had a saddle on its back, and a bridle on its neck, and a full suit of mail for a knight lay by its side, all of silver, and as grand as you would wish to see."
"""Ho, ho!"" said Boots to himself; ""it's you that gobbles up our hay, is it? I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel;"" and with that he took the steel out of his tinder-box, and threw it over the horse's crest, which stood as still as a lamb. Well, the lad rode this horse, too, to the hiding-place where he kept the other one, and after that he went home."
"""I suppose you'll tell us,"" said one of his brothers, ""there's a fine crop this year too, up in the hayfield."""
"""Well, so there is,"" said Boots; and off ran the others to see, and there stood the grass thick and deep, as it was the year before; but they didn't give Boots softer words for all that."
"Now, when the third St. John's eve came, the two elder brothers still hadn't the heart to lie out in the barn and watch the grass, for they had got so scared at heart the nights they lay there before, that they couldn't get over the fright; but Boots, he dared to go; and, to make a very long story short, the very same thing happened this time as had happened twice before. Three earthquakes came, one after the other, each worse than the one which went before, and when the last came, the lad danced about with the shock from one barn wall to the other; and after that, all at once, it was still as death. Now when he had laid a little while, he heard something tugging away at the grass outside the barn, so he stole again to the door-chink, and peeped out, and there stood a horse close outside far, far bigger and fatter than the two he had taken before."
"""Ho, ho!"" said the lad to himself, ""it's you, is it, that comes here eating up our hay? I'll soon stop that I'll soon put a spoke in your wheel."" So he caught up his steel and threw it over his horse's neck, and in a trice it stood as if it were nailed to the ground, and Boots could do as he pleased with it. Then he rode off with it to the hiding-place where he kept the other two, and then went home. When he got home, his two brothers made game of him as they had done before, saying, they could see he had watched the grass well, for he looked for all the world as if he were walking in his sleep, and many other spiteful things they said, but Boots gave no heed to them, only asking them to go and see for themselves; and when they went, there stood the grass as fine and deep this time as it had been twice before."
"Now, you must know that the king of the country where Boots lived had a daughter, whom he would only give to the man who could ride up over the hill of glass, for there was a high, high hill, all of glass, as smooth and slippery as ice, close by the King's palace. Upon the tip top of the hill the King's daughter was to sit, with three golden apples in her lap, and the man who could ride up and carry off the three golden apples, was to have half the kingdom, and the Princess to wife. This the King had stuck up on all the church-doors in his realm, and had given it out in many other kingdoms besides. Now, this Princess was so lovely that all who set eyes on her fell over head and ears in love with her whether they would or no. So I needn't tell you how all the princes and knights who heard of her were eager to win her to wife, and half the kingdom beside; and how they came riding from all parts of the world on high prancing horses, and clad in the grandest clothes, for there wasn't one of them who hadn't made up his mind that he, and he alone, was to win the Princess."
"So when the day of trial came, which the king had fixed, there was such a crowd of princes and knights under the Glass Hill, that it made one's head whirl to look at them, and everyone in the country who could even crawl along was off to the hill, for they were all eager to see the man who was to win the Princess. So the two elder brothers set off with the rest; but as for Boots, they said outright he shouldn't go with them, for if they were seen with such a dirty changeling, all begrimed with smut from cleaning their shoes and sifting cinders in the dust-hole, they said folk would make game of them."
"""Very well,"" said Boots, ""it's all one to me. I can go alone, and stand or fall by myself."""
"Now when the two brothers came to the Hill of Glass, the knights and princes were all hard at it, riding their horses till they were all in a foam; but it was no good, by my troth; for as soon as ever the horses set foot on the hill, down they slipped, and there wasn't one who could get a yard or two up; and no wonder, for the hill was as smooth as a sheet of glass, and as steep as a house-wall. But all were eager to have the Princess and half the kingdom. So they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode, and still it was the same story over again. At last all their horses were so weary that they could scarce lift a leg, and in such a sweat that the lather dripped from them, and so the knights had to give up trying any more. So the king was just thinking that he would proclaim a new trial for the next day, to see if they would have better luck, when all at once a knight came riding up on so brave a steed, that no one had ever seen the like of it in his born days, and the knight had mail of brass, and the horse a brass bit in his mouth, so bright that the sunbeams shone from it. Then all the others called out to him he might just as well spare himself the trouble of riding at the Hill, for it would lead to no good; but he gave no heed to them, and put his horse at the hill, and went up it like nothing for a good way, about a third of the height; and when he had got so far, he turned his horse round and rode down again. So lovely a knight the Princess thought she had never yet seen; and while he was riding, she sat and thought to herself:"
"""Would to heaven he might only come up and down the other side."""
"And when she saw him turning back, she threw down one of the golden apples after him, and it rolled down into his shoe. But when he got to the bottom of the hill, he rode off so fast that no one could tell what had become of him. That evening all the knights and princes were to go before the king, that he who had ridden so far up the hill might show the apple which the Princess had thrown, but there was no one who had anything to show. One after the other they all came, but not a man of them could show the apple."
"At even the brothers of Boots came home too, and had such a long story to tell about the riding up the hill."
"""First of all,"" they said, ""there was not one of the whole lot who could get so much as a stride up; but at last came one who had a suit of brass mail, and a brass bridle and saddle, all so bright that the sun shone from them a mile off. He was a chap to ride, just! He rode a third of the way up the Hill of Glass, and he could easily have ridden the whole way up, if he chose; but he turned round and rode down, thinking, maybe, that was enough for once."""
"""Oh! I should so like to have seen him, that I should,"" said Boots, who sat by the fireside, and stuck his feet into the cinders, as was his wont."
"""Oh!"" said his brothers, ""you would, would you? You look fit to keep company with such high lords, nasty beast that you are, sitting there amongst the ashes."""
"Next day the brothers were all for setting off again, and Boots begged them this time, too, to let him go with them and see the riding; but no, they wouldn't have him at any price, he was too ugly and nasty, they said."
"""Well, well!"" said Boots; ""if I go at all, I must go by myself. I'm not afraid."""
"So when the brothers got to the Hill of Glass, all the princes and knights began to ride again, and you may fancy they had taken care to shoe their horses sharp; but it was no good they rode and slipped, and slipped and rode, just as they had done the day before, and there was not one who could get so far as a yard up the hill. And when they had worn out their horses, so that they could not stir a leg, they were all forced to give it up as a bad job. So the king thought he might as well proclaim that the riding should take place the day after for the last time, just to give them one chance more; but all at once it came across his mind that he might as well wait a little longer, to see if the knight in brass mail would come this day too. Well, they saw nothing of him; but all at once came one riding on a steed, far, far braver and finer than that on which the knight in brass had ridden, and he had silver mail, and a silver saddle and bridle, all so bright that the sunbeams gleamed and glanced from them far away. Then the others shouted out to him again, saying, he might as well hold hard, and not try to ride up the hill, for all his trouble would be thrown away; but the knight paid no heed to them, and rode straight at the hill, and right up it, till he had gone two-thirds of the way, and then he wheeled his horse round and rode down again. To tell the truth, the Princess liked him still better than the knight in brass, and she sat and wished he might only be able to come right up to the top, and down the other side; but when she saw him turning back, she threw the second apple after him, and it rolled down and fell into his shoe. But, as soon as ever he had come down from the Hill of Glass, he rode off so fast that no one could see what became of him."
"At even, when all were to go in before the king and the Princess, that he who had the golden apple might show it, in they went, one after the other, but there was no one who had any apple to show, and the two brothers, as they had done on the former day, went home and told how things had gone, and how all had ridden at the hill, and none got up."
"""But, last of all,"" they said, ""came one in a silver suit, and his horse had a silver saddle and a silver bridle. He was just a chap to ride; and he got two-thirds up the hill, and then turned back. He was a fine fellow, and no mistake; and the Princess threw the second gold apple to him."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him too, that I should."""
"""A pretty story,"" they said. ""Perhaps you think his coat of mail was as bright as the ashes you are always poking about, and sifting, you nasty dirty beast."""
"The third day everything happened as it had happened the two days before. Boots begged to go and see the sight, but the two wouldn't hear of his going with them. When they got to the hill there was no one who could get so much as a yard up it; and now all waited for the knight in silver mail, but they neither saw nor heard of him. At last came one riding on a steed, so brave that no one had ever seen his match; and the knight had a suit of golden mail, and a golden saddle and bridle, so wondrous bright that the sunbeams gleamed from them a mile off. The other knights and princes could not find time to call out to him not to try his luck, for they were amazed to see how grand he was. So he rode right at the hill, and tore up it like nothing, so that the Princess hadn't even time to wish that he might get up the whole way. As soon as ever he reached the top, he took the third golden apple from the Princess' lap, and then turned his horse and rode down again. As soon as he got down, he rode off at full speed, and was out of sight in no time."
"Now, when the brothers got home at even, you may fancy what long stories they told, how the riding had gone off that day; and amongst other things, they had a deal to say about the knight in golden mail."

"drunk to 1919, the Mater, a light of challenge in her eyes, looked at me"
and gave another toast:
"""To a cruise and an adventure, Jack!"""
"""To romance,"" Dad cried, gallantly raising her fingers to his lips."
"There was no use being a wet blanket, so with a laugh I said:"
"""To adventure and romance!--Mater, if they're still on earth I'll bring"

[_17th August 1894._]
"Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the"
"advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in"
"this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as"
follows:
[Sidenote: Short Title.]
"1. This Act may be cited as the Prize Courts Act, 1894."
[Sidenote: Constitution of Prize Courts in British Possessions.]
"2.--(1) Any commission, warrant, or instructions from Her Majesty the"
Queen or the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning or regulating
"the procedure of a prize court at any place in a British possession may,"
"notwithstanding the existence of peace, be issued at any time, with a"
direction that the court shall act only upon such proclamation as
herein-after mentioned being made in the possession.
"(2) Where any such commission, warrant, or instructions have been"
"issued, then, subject to instructions from Her Majesty, the Vice-Admiral"
"of such possession may, when satisfied, by information from a Secretary"
"of State or otherwise, that war has broken out between Her Majesty and"
"any foreign State, proclaim that war has so broken out, and thereupon"
"the said commission, warrant, and instructions shall take effect as if"
the same had been issued after the breaking out of such war and such
foreign State were named therein.
ACIDUM CARBOLICUM CRUDUM--CRUDE CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--A liquid consisting of several different constituents of
"coal tar, particularly creosol and phenol, obtained by fractional"
distillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A nearly colorless, or reddish-brown liquid of a strong"
"disagreeable and creosote-like odor, and gradually turning darker on"
exposure to the air and light. Soluble in fifteen parts of water.
PHENOL--ACIDUM CARBOLICUM--CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--Obtained from crude carbolic acid by agitation with caustic
"soda, heating to 338° F., and adding hydrochloric acid. Then by"
"agitation with sodium chloride, digestion with calcium chloride, and"
distillation at a temperature between 336° F. and 374° F. and finally by
crystallization.
PROPERTIES.--Phenol in its pure state is a solid at ordinary
"temperatures, crystallizing in minute plates or long rhomboidal needles,"
"white or colorless, of a peculiar odor recalling that of creosote, and"
an acrid burning taste. It is likely to be colored pinkish or brown
under the influence of light and air. Soluble in about 19.6 parts of
"water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, glycerin, fixed"
Equally strong in fascination and vigour is “The Splendid Idle
"Forties,” but as far removed from “The Conqueror” as were the"
Eastern and Western seaboards of this country in the times of
"which the stories treat, “the long, drowsy, shimmering days"
"before the Gringo came,” to the California of which she writes."
"“Pointed, spirited, and Spanish” are these “rich and impressive”"
stories; “such as could hardly have been told in any other
country since the Bagdad of the ‘Thousand and One Nights.’ The
"book is full of weird fascination, and will add to Mrs."
"Atherton’s deservedly high reputation,” says _The Athenæum_."
“In this book even more than in her others is shown that
imaginative brilliancy so striking as to set one
wondering what is the secret of the effect. . . . For
"the rest, her charm lies in temperament, magnetic,"
"restless, assertive, vivid.”—_Washington Times._"
In close relation to “The Conqueror” stands Mrs. Atherton’s
"still more recent selection of “A Few of Hamilton’s Letters,”"
chosen from the great bulk of his state papers and other letters
in such a way as to bring to the average reader the means of
estimating the personality of this remarkable man from his own
words. Incidentally it is the surest refutation of some of the
"hasty criticisms upon the picture of him in “The Conqueror,”"
"where, as Mr. Le Gallienne justly observes, “it was reserved for"
Mrs. Atherton to make him really alive to the present
generation.”
[Sidenote: 53 & 54 Vict. c. 27.]
(3) The said commission and warrant may authorise either a
"Vice-Admiralty Court or a Colonial Court of Admiralty, within the"
"meaning of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, to act as a prize"
"court, and may establish a Vice-Admiralty Court for that purpose."
"(4) Any such commission, warrant, or instructions may be revoked or"
altered from time to time.
(5) A court duly authorised to act as a prize court during any war
"shall after the conclusion of the war continue so to act in relation to,"
"and finally dispose of, all matters and things which arose during the"
"war, including all penalties and forfeitures incurred during the war."
[Sidenote: Rules of Court for and Fees in Prize Courts. 27 & 28 Vict. c.
25.]
3.--(1) Her Majesty the Queen in Council may make rules of court for
"regulating, subject to the provisions of the Naval Prize Act, 1864, and"
"this Act, the procedure and practice of prize courts within the meaning"
"of that Act, and the duties and conduct of the officers thereof, and of"
"the practitioners therein, and for regulating the fees to be taken by"
"the officers of the courts, and the costs, charges, and expenses to be"
allowed to the practitioners therein.
"(2) Every rule so made shall, whenever made, take effect at the time"
"therein mentioned, and shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament,"
and shall be kept exhibited in a conspicuous place in each court to
which it relates.
"economic principle, that is of the world of nature, of feeling, of"
"passion, as a positive grade of the spiritual process, will probably"
"be counted as Croce's greatest achievement, by those who shall be able"
to look back on his work with an ampler perspective. It is through
"it that his philosophy of the spirit, and in this philosophy, the"
"consciousness of our day, has taken possession of that other world, of"
"that persistent transcendance, which we call nature. In this direction"
"lies, undoubtedly, the future course of the thought of an age, to"
"which, in this afterglow of a great conflagration, all problems seem to"
"gather into the one of the subjection to its better and higher self,"
"the utilization for its purer purposes, of its own cumbersome economic"
"body, of its nature and of its passions."
"[Footnote 1: Filosofia della Pratica, p. 208.]"
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
"Croce's Complete Works form a collection of twenty-eight volumes, in"
"four distinct series, published by Laterza e Figli, of Bari, who are"
"also the publishers of _La Critica_, and of the following collections"
"initiated or directed by Croce: _Scrittori d'Italia, Scrittori"
"Stranieri, Classici della Filosofia Moderna._"
"We give here a full list of the _Opere di Benedetto Croce_, adding to"
"the title of each volume the year of the last available edition, the"
years of their composition having already been indicated in the text:
Rossiter and the indignation of the W.S.P.U. became so alarming that
the agitated Secretary of State--not at all sure how we were going
"to come out of the War--gave way, and an order was signed for"
Vivie's release on the 11th of August; on the understanding that she
would immediately proceed abroad; an understanding to which she
would not subscribe but which in her slowly-formed hatred of the
British Government she resolved to carry out.
"Mrs. Warren, assured by Praed and Rossiter that Vivie's release was"
"a mere matter of a few days, had left for Brussels on the 5th of"
August. If--as was then hoped--the French and Belgian armies would
"suffice to keep the Germans at bay on the frontier of Belgium, she"
would prefer to resume her life there in the Villa de Beau-séjour.
If however Belgium was going to be invaded it was better she should
"secure her property as far as possible, transfer her funds, and make"
her way somehow to a safe part of France. Vivie would join her as
soon as she could leave the prison.
CHAPTER XVI
BRUSSELS AND THE WAR: 1914
The Lilacs in Victoria Road had been disposed of--through
"Honoria--as soon as possible, after the sentence of Three years'"
imprisonment had been pronounced on Vivie; and the faithful
"Suffragette maid had passed into Honoria's employ at Petworth, a"
fact that was not fully understood by Colonel Armstrong until he had
become General Armstrong and perfectly indifferent to the Suffrage
"Again, in Eugene Field's “Hushaby Lady,” the language of which is most"
"simple, the child is carried away by the beauty of the sound."
I remember hearing some poetry repeated by the children in one of
the elementary schools in Sheffield which made me feel that they had
realised romantic possibilities which would prevent their lives from
"ever becoming quite prosaic again, and I wish that this practice"
were more usual. There is little difficulty with the children. I can
"remember, in my own experience as a teacher in London, making the"
experiment of reading or repeating passages from Milton and Shakespeare
"to children from nine to eleven years of age, and the enthusiastic"
"way they responded by learning those passages by heart. I have taken,"
"with several sets of children, such passages from Milton as “Echo"
"Song,” “Sabrina,” “By the rushy fringed Bank,” “Back, shepherds, back,”"
"from _Comus_, “May Morning,” “Ode to Shakespeare,” “Samson on his"
"blindness,” etc. I even ventured on several passages from _Paradise"
"Lost_, and found “Now came still evening on” a particular favourite"
with the children.
"It seemed even easier to interest them in Shakespeare, and they learned"
"quite readily and easily many passages from “As You Like It,” “Merchant"
"of Venice,” “Julius Cæsar”; from “Richard II,” “Henry IV,” and “Henry"
V.”
The method I should recommend in the introduction of both poets
occasionally into the Story-hour would be threefold.
"First, to choose passages which appeal for beauty of sound or beauty"
"of mental vision called up by those sounds: such as, “Tell me where is"
"Fancy bred,” Titania's Lullaby, “How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon"
this bank.”
"rocks more than a mile in total thickness, which accumulated"
during the long ages of those periods in a gradually subsiding
trough between the Adirondacks and a pre-Cambrian range lying west
of the Connecticut River. But since their deposition these ancient
"sediments have been crumpled and crushed, broken with great"
"faults, and extensively metamorphosed. The limestones have"
"recrystallized into marbles, among them the famous marbles of"
"Vermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites, and the"
Hudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan
Island and northward.
"In part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for"
in several places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the
upturned Ordovician strata; but recent investigations have made it
"probable that the crustal movements recurred at later times, and"
it was perhaps in the Devonian and at the close of the
Carboniferous that the greater part of the deformation and
"metamorphism was accomplished. As a result of these movements,--"
"perhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain range was"
"upridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but whose"
roots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New
England.
"THE CINCINNATI ANTICLINE. Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and"
"Kentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through"
"Cincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,"
called the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata
thin out as they approach this area and seem never to have
"deposited upon it. We may regard it, therefore, as an island"
upwarped from the sea at the close of the Ordovician or shortly
after.
and gone himself with their beautiful new motor--whatever _could_
"the chauffeur have thought?--to meet her at the prison gates,"
"_there_ he was, afterwards, worrying himself over the War: not"
"content as she was, as most of her friends were, as the newspapers"
"were, to leave it all to Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward"
"Grey, and even Mr. Lloyd George--though the latter had made some"
"rather foolish and exaggerated speeches about Alcohol. Michael, if"
"he went on like this, would _never_ get his knighthood!"
"Then when Michael had at last, thanks to General Armstrong, found"
his right place and was accomplishing marvels--the papers said--as a
"""mender of the maimed""--here was she left alone in Portland Place"
"with hardly any one to speak to, and all her acquaintances--she now"
realized they were scarcely her friends--too much occupied with war
work to spend an afternoon in discussing nothing very important over
"a sumptuous tea, still served by a butler and footman."
"Presently, too, the butler left to join the Professor in France and"
"the footman enlisted, and the tea had to be served by a _distraite_"
"parlour-maid, with her eye on a munitions factory--so that she"
"might be ""in it""--and her heart in the keeping of the footman, who,"
"since he had gone into khaki, was irresistible."
"Mrs. Rossiter of course said, in 1914, that she would take up war"
work. She subscribed most handsomely to the Soldiers' and Sailors'
"Families' Association, to the Red Cross, to the Prince of Wales's"
Fund (one of the unsolved war-time mysteries ... what's become of
"it?), to the Cigarette Fund, the 1914 Christmas Plum Pudding Fund,"
"the Blue Cross, the Purple Cross, the Green Cross funds; to the"
outstandingly good work at St. Dunstan's and at Petersham--(I am
glad she gave a Hundred pounds each to _them_); and to the
"French, Belgian, Russian, Italian, Serbian, Portuguese and Japanese"
"A complete bibliography, cataloguing the whole of Croce's multifarious"
"activity, is outside the scope of this note. The nearest approach to it"
"can be found in G. Castellano's _Introduzione alle opere di B. Croce_,"
"Bari, 1920, which contains, besides, a full list of translations in"
"eight languages, a bibliography of the Italian and foreign critical"
"literature on Croce, and a very useful series of abstracts of"
discussions and judgments on Croce's work.
Besides articles and essays in American and English magazines and
"reviews, the following works of Croce have been translated into"
"English: the four volumes of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, the essay"
"on Hegel, the _Essence of Ãsthetics_, and the essays on _Ariosto,"
"Shakespeare, and Corneille_, by Douglas Ainslie; the essay on Vico, by"
"R. G. Collingwood, and the essays on Historical Materialism, by C. M."
Meredith. But the English or American student of Croce ought to rely
as little as possible on translations; the reading of the Italian text
"will be found comparatively easy, on the basis of a good acquaintance"
with Latin or with French. The labour entailed by the surmounting
of the first difficulties will be largely repaid by the advantages
"gained in coming into direct contact with Croce's thought, and by the"
acquisition of at least a reading knowledge of Italian.
"For the vast critical literature on Croce, scattered through the"
literary and philosophical reviews of Europe and of America during
"the last twenty years, we are compelled again to refer the reader to"
Castellano's book. We shall only mark out Croce's own autobiographical
"notes, the Contributo listed above, which, however, having been printed"
"for private circulation only, is not generally accessible except in"
the French translation printed in the _Revue de MÃ©taphysique et de
"Morale_, XXVI, pp. 1-40. The following are the only books which give"
"a general view of Croce's thought: G. Prezzolini, _Benedetto Croce_,"
"Naples, 1909; E. Chiocchetti, _La filosofia di B. Croce_, Florence,"
"will attribute such qualities as are predominant in themselves, as they"
"consider admirable; and, indeed, all supernatural beings are but the"
magnified shadows of man cast by the light of his imagination upon the
mists of his ignorance.
"Therefore, when you find that a people make their spirits beautiful and"
"fair, calm and even tempered, loving peace and the beauty of the trees"
"and rivers, shrinkingly averse from loud words, from noises, and from"
"the taking of life, it is because the people themselves think that these"
"are great qualities. If no stress be laid upon their courage, their"
"activity, their performance of great deeds, it is because the people who"
"imagine them care not for such things. There is no truer guide, I am"
"sure, to the heart of a young people than their superstitions; these"
"they make entirely for themselves, apart from their religion, which is,"
"to a certain extent, made for them. That is why I have written this"
chapter on Nats: not because I think it affects Buddhism very much one
"way or another, but because it seems to me to reveal the people"
"themselves, because it helps us to understand them better, to see more"
"with their eyes, to be in unison with their ideas--because it is a great"
key to the soul of the people.
CHAPTER XXII
"DEATH, THE DELIVERER"
"'The end of my life is near at hand; seven days hence, like a man"
"who rids himself of a heavy load, I shall be free from the burden"
of my body.'--_Death of the Buddha._
"Secondly, passages for sheer interest of content, such as the Trial"
"Scene from “The Merchant of Venice,” or the Forest Scene in “As You"
Like It.”
"Thirdly, for dramatic and historical interest, such as, “Men at some"
"time are masters of their fates,” the whole of Mark Antony's speech,"
and the scene with Imogen and her foster-brothers in the Forest.
It may not be wholly out of place to add here that the children learned
"and repeated these passages themselves, and that I offered them the"
same advice as I do to all Story-tellers. I discussed quite openly
"with them the method I considered best, trying to make them see that"
simplicity of delivery was not only the most beautiful but the most
"effective means to use; and, by the end of a few months, when they"
"had been allowed to experiment and express themselves, they began"
"to see that mere ranting was not force, and that a sense of reserve"
power is infinitely more impressive and inspiring than mere external
presentation.
"I encouraged them to criticise each other for the common good, and"
"sometimes I read a few lines with over-emphasis and too much gesture,"
"which they were at liberty to point out, so that they might avoid the"
same error.
A very good collection of poems for this purpose of narrative is to be
found in:
"Mrs. P. A. Barnett's series of _Song and Story_,"
Published by A. and C. Black.
And for older children:

"""And here, also, they used to have a grand procession"
"of priests, citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries"
"of the city government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up"
"Madonna--a stuffed and painted image, like the milliner's dummy--whose"
hair miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They
still kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years
ago. It was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the
"remarkable effigy, and the public barbering of her was always carried"
"out with the greatest _éclat_ and display--the more the better, because"
the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew
and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last the day came
"when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the city"
government stopped the Madonna's annual show.
"""There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliest"
"possible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully"
"believed, and the other half either believed or else said nothing"
"about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture."""
[Sidenote: The House of the Virgin at Loretto.]
"I had read the story of the _Casa Santa_, or Holy House, the little"
"stone building, thirteen and one-half feet high and twenty-eight feet"
"long, in which the Virgin Mary had lived at Nazareth. In 336 the"
"Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage"
to Nazareth and built a church over the Holy House. This church fell
"into decay when the Saracens again got the upper hand in Palestine,"
and when the Christians lost Ptolemais the Holy House was carried by
angels through the air from Nazareth to the coast of Dalmatia. This
miraculous transportation took place in 1291. A few years later it
acts (or legislation) we destroy the very tracts we have improved.
"The Indian must ultimately be merged into the body politic, as has been"
"affirmed. But in bringing about this desideratum, it is not necessary to"
crush all happiness out of his life. For fifty years the Indian has
"followed a devious and uncertain trail, in the fond hope that he might"
"reach his journey’s end. If men and women, who through unintentional"
"ignorance have given no heed to the welfare of our red Americans, will"
"interest their Representatives in Congress, and also help to crystallize"
"public opinion against further harmful legislation, it is quite possible"
that the National Commission plan may be carried into effect. After many
"years of study of the subject, I firmly believe that the welfare of the"
Indian depends upon the creation of such a Commission as has been
"indicated—one composed not of those interested in political parties, but"
"on the contrary of competent men who understand Indians and their needs,"
of men who are willing to devote the best years of their lives to
"transforming the rough, uncertain trail along which the Indian has"
"toiled, into a broad highway, upon which the Red Man may safely travel"
to his ultimate destination—the civilized community. And having reached
"the end of his journey, the Indian will live henceforth peacefully, and"
"enjoy to the full the blessings of liberty, equality and justice."

carefully and tenderly about her.
Concha raised her eyes once to his as he fastened its chain-catch
"beneath her chin, and Rollo, though the starlight dimmed the brilliance"
"of the glance, felt more than repaid. In the background Etienne smiled"
bitterly. The damsel of the green lattice being now left far behind at
"Sarria, he would have had no scruples about returning to his allegiance"
to Concha. But the chill indifference with which his advances were
"received, joined to something softer and more appealing in her eyes when"
"she looked at Rollo, warned the much-experienced youth that he had"
better for the future confine his gallantries to the most common and
ordinary offices of courtesy.
"Yet it was certainly a restraint upon the young Frenchman, who, almost"
"from the day he had been rid of his Jesuit tutor, had made it a maxim to"
make love to the prettiest girl of any company in which he happened to
find himself.
"When, therefore, he found himself reduced to a choice between an"
"inaccessible Concha and La Giralda, riding astride in her leathern"
"leg-gear and sack-like smock, the youth bethought himself of his"
"religious duties which he had latterly somewhat neglected; and, being"
debarred from earthly love by Concha's insensibility and La Giralda's
"ineligibility, it did not cost him a great effort to become for the"
nonce the same Brother Hilario who had left the monastery of Montblanch.
"So, much to the astonishment of John Mortimer, who moved a little"
"farther from him, as being a kind of second cousin of the scarlet woman"
"of the Seven Hills, Etienne pulled out his rosary and, falling on his"
"knees, betook him to his prayers with vigour and a single mind."
Sergeant Cardono had long ago abandoned all distinctive marks of his
"of St. Peter's, a bone of Judas Iscariot (black, not white), and also"
"bones of all the other disciples (presumably of the normal color), a"
"handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of his face,"
"part of the crown of thorns, a fragment of the purple robe worn by"
"Christ, a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by St. Luke, and a"
nail from the cross--adding in another place that he thought he had
seen in all not less than a keg of these nails.
"But I had hardly taken Mark Twain seriously in these statements, not"
"knowing at the time that his _Innocents Abroad_ was, notwithstanding"
"its broad humor, really one of the best guide-books to Europe that was"
ever written.
[Sidenote: The Palladium of Venice.]
I had read repeatedly the story of the bringing of St. Mark's bones
"from Alexandria, in Egypt, to their present resting-place in St. Mark's"
Cathedral at Venice--a story which is related as follows in that same
lively volume:
"""St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think."
"However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of"
the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for
"Venice is much younger than any other Italian city), a priest dreamed"
that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought
"to Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the"
"nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and"
a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians
"allowed the Saint to be removed from his new resting-place, in that"
day Venice would perish from off the face of the earth. The priest
"proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the"
"corpse of St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but"
which will certainly remain as the most lasting monument raised to the
memory of the poet on this occasion. This troubled peace cannot make
him deviate from the path of his appointed labour any more than the war
"could; in peace as in war, his duty is his daily task, here and to-day,"
and his confidence in the morality and usefulness of that work which is
"his work is as little shaken by the prophets of despair in peace, as"
it was by the messiahs of the promised land who were so loud above the
turmoil of war. He is probably now noting with a smile that the same
"men who talked of the war to end all wars, are now very busy preventing"
"our civilization from dying away; that is, building a peace in the"
"abstract, with programs and words, as they fought a war which was not"
"the war, but a phantasm of their imagination."

II. THE THEORY OF HISTORY
Two meanings of the word history--History as contemporary history--
"History and chronicle--The spirit as history--Philology, and"
philological history--Poetical and rhetorical history--Universal
history--The universality of history: history and philosophy--The
unity of thought--Philosophy as methodology--The positivity of
history--The humanity of history--Distinctions and divisions--The
history of nature.
"There are two meanings to the word history, in English as well as in"
CHAPTER III
PHILOSOPHY BEFORE FERRIER'S DAY
In attempting to give some idea of philosophy as it was in Scotland in
"the earlier portion of the present century, we shall have to go back"
"two hundred years or thereabout, in order to find a satisfactory basis"
"from which to start. For philosophy, as no one realised more than"
"Ferrier, is no arbitrary succession of systems following one upon"
another as their propounders might decree; it is a development in the
truest and highest significance of that word. It means the gradual
working out of the questions which reason sets to be answered; and
"though it seems as if we had sometimes to turn our faces backwards, and"
"to revert to systems of bygone days, we always find, when we look more"
"closely, that in our onward course we have merely dropped some thread"
"in our web, the recovery of which is requisite in order that it may be"
duly taken up and woven with the rest.
"At the time of which we write the so-called 'Scottish School' of Reid,"
"Stewart, and Beattie reigned supreme in orthodox Scotland; it had"
"undisputed power in the Universities, and besides this obtained a very"
"reputable place in the estimation of Europe, and more especially of"
France. As it was this school more especially that Ferrier spent much
"of his time in combating, it is its history and place that we wish"
"shortly to describe. To do so, however, it is needful to go back to its"
"real founder, Locke, in order that its point of view may fairly be set"
forth.
"the story of the great Hermits who, having listened to the discussion"
of the Monday sitting at the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France)
as to the best way to teach the young how to shoot in the direction
"of mathematical genius, said: “_Cultivez l'imagination, messieurs."
"Tout est là. Si vous voulez des mathématiciens, donnez à vos enfants à"
lire--des Contes de Fées._”
Another important effect of the story is to develop at an early
age sympathy for children of other countries where conditions are
different from our own. There is a book used in American schools
"called “Little Citizens of other Lands,” dealing with the clothes,"
the games and occupations of those little citizens. Stories of this
kind are particularly necessary to prevent the development of insular
"notions, and are a check on that robust form of Philistinism, only"
"too prevalent, alas! among grown-ups, which looks askance at new"
suggestions and makes the withering remark: “How un-English! How
"queer!”--the second comment being, it would seem, a natural corollary"
to the first.[40]
I have so constantly to deal with the question of confusion between
Truth and Fiction in the mind of children that it might be useful
to offer here an example of the way they make the distinction for
themselves.
Mrs. Ewing says on this subject:
“If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of
"distinguishing between Fancy and Falsehood, it is most desirable to"
"develop in them the power to do so, but, as a rule, in childhood,"
we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which as elders our
care-clogged memories fail to recall.”
scientist to-day would say of the Resurrection of Jesus on which
"ultimately depends His claims to our adoration, “_That could not"
happen_.” We know enough now of the laws of the Universe to know that
we do not know them all.
So some of us perceive that what is needed to-day is to arrest the
"attention of the man in the street, to get him to perceive that"
"Christianity has much more to say for itself than he suspected, and"
that Christian Philosophy will place in his hand a clue which will
guide him in the labyrinth of life.
“I say the acknowledgment of God in Christ
"Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee"
All questions in the earth and out of it.”
We must set men free from phrases and get them to think. It suits the
game of the party politician to pretend that ethics are easily
"self-evident, and that there is a simple fundamental religion on which"
all men are agreed; but there is a question which must be insistently

Probably nothing has done more to alienate the man in the street from
religious observance than the hypocritical pretence that all men are
agreed about “simple Bible teaching.” He knows well enough that what
really matters is whether a man believes or not that God became man.
If ever the Labour Party should definitely declare for elementary

CHAPTER XXX.
ROMAN CATHOLIC RELICS AT ROME.
"We reached Rome at a good time for seeing relics, as the special"
services of the Christmas season were just beginning. One of the most
splendid of these ceremonies is the procession in honor of the _Santa
"Culla_; that is, the cradle in which the priestly tradition says the"
infant Jesus was carried into Egypt. This is the great relic and chief
"distinction of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, though it contains"
"a number of others, such as the bodies of St. Matthew and St. Jerome,"
"and two little bags of the brains of Thomas á Becket, and ""one of the"
pictures attributed to St. Luke (and announced to be such in a papal
"bull attached to the walls!), much revered for the belief that it"
stayed the plague which decimated the city during the reign of Pelagius
"II., and that (after its intercession had been sought by a procession"
by order of Innocent VIII.) it brought about the overthrow of the
"Moorish dominion in Spain."""
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Snow in Summertime.]
"Moreover, this church of Santa Maria Maggiore is by no means lacking"
"in legendary and architectural interest. It was founded A. D. 352, by"
"Pope Liberius and John, a Roman patrician, to commemorate an alleged"
"miraculous fall of snow, which covered this spot of ground and no"
"other, on the 5th of August, and an alleged appearance of the Virgin"
"Mary, in a vision, at the same time, showing them that she had thus"
"appropriated the site of a new temple, all of which is duly represented"
"in a fine painting on the wall of the church, and in two of Murillo's"
"most beautiful pictures in the Academy at Madrid, and commemorated"
"every year on the 5th of August by a solemn high mass, and by showers"
"monopolized the market, for the trade statistics show 17,000,000 bunches"
of bananas imported by rival companies in 1912. As for its stimulation
"of the business of the ports of New Orleans, Galveston and Mobile, and"
"its revivifying of trade along the Caribbean, both are matters of common"
knowledge.
"[Illustration: ABOVE THE CLOUDS, CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]"
The banana thrives best in rich soil covered with alluvial deposits and
in a climate of great humidity where the temperature never falls below
75 degrees Fahrenheit. Once established the plantation needs little
"attention, the plant being self-propagating from suckers which shoot off"
"from the “mat,” the tangled roots of the mother plant. It begins to bear"
"fruit at the age of ten or eleven months, and with the maturing of one"
bunch of fruit the parent plant is at once cut down so that the strength
of the soil may go into the suckers that succeed it. Perhaps the most
technical work of the cultivator is to select the suckers so that the
"plantation will not bring all its fruit to maturity in one season, but"
"rather yield a regular succession of crops, month after month. It was"
interesting to learn from a representative of the United Fruit Company
"at Bocas del Toro, that the banana has its dull season--not in"
"production but in the demand for it which falls off heavily in winter,"
"though one would suppose that summer, when our own fruits are in the"
"market, would be the period of its eclipse."
[Illustration: THE CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]
[Illustration: NATIVE MARKET BOAT AT CHORRERA]
While most of the fruit gathered in the neighborhood of Bocas del Toro
"is grown on land owned and tilled by the Company, there are hundreds of"
small individual growers with plantations of from half an acre to fifty
"admirer of Erasmus, had requested him to direct his attention to the"
"fact that in his interpretation of St. Paul, especially in that of the"
"epistle to the Romans, Erasmus had failed to conceive the idea of"
"_justitia_ correctly, had paid too little attention to original sin: he"
might profit by reading Augustine.
"The nameless Austin Friar was Luther, then still unknown outside the"
"circle of the Wittenberg University, in which he was a professor, and"
the criticism regarded the cardinal point of his hardly acquired
conviction: justification by faith.
Erasmus paid little attention to this letter. He received so many of
"that sort, containing still more praise and no criticism. If he answered"
"it, the reply did not reach Spalatinus, and later Erasmus completely"
forgot the whole letter.
"Nine months afterwards, in September 1517, when Erasmus had been at"
"Louvain for a short time, he received an honourable invitation, written"
"by the first prelate of the Empire, the young Archbishop of Mayence,"
Albert of Brandenburg. The archbishop would be pleased to see him on an
occasion: he greatly admired his work (he knew it so little as to speak
"of Erasmus's emendation of the Old Testament, instead of the New) and"
hoped that he would one day write some lives of saints in elegant style.
"The young Hohenzoller, advocate of the new light of classical studies,"
"whose attention had probably been drawn to Erasmus by Hutten and Capito,"
"who sojourned at his court, had recently become engaged in one of the"
boldest political and financial transactions of his time. His elevation
"to the see of Mayence, at the age of twenty-four, had necessitated a"
"papal dispensation, as he also wished to keep the archbishopric of"
Magdeburg and the see of Halberstadt. This accumulation of
ecclesiastical offices had to be made subservient to the Brandenburg

This poem is specially to be commended because it is another example of
the finer qualities which are developed in war.[44]
"Now, such a ballad as this, which, being pure narrative, could"
"easily be introduced into the story-hour, would do as much to foster"
"“_L'entente cordiale_” as any processions or civic demonstrations,"
or lavish international exchange of hospitality. It has also a great
practical application now that we are encouraging visits between
English and foreign children. Let us hope the _entente cordiale_ will
not stop at France. There must be many such instances of magnanimity
"and generosity displayed to us by other nations, and it might be"
well to collect them and include them among stories for the school
curriculum.
"But in all our stories, in order to produce desired effects we must"
"refrain from holding, as Burroughs says, “a brief for either side,” and"
we must leave the decision of the children free in this matter.[45]
"In a review of Ladd's _Psychology_ in the “Academy,” we find a passage"
which refers as much to the story as to the novel:
had continuous performances; there was Grand Opera; there were
"exhibitions of toys, or pictures, and charitable bazaars. Ten days"
after the fall of Antwerp _char-à-bancs_ packed with Belgians drove
out of Brussels to visit the scenes of the battles and those
"shattered forts, so fatuously deemed impregnable, so feeble in their"
resistance to German artillery.
"Vivie, even had she wished to do so, could not have joined the"
sight-seers. As the subjects of an enemy power she and her mother
had had early in January to register themselves at the Kommandantur
and were there warned that without a special passport they might not
pass beyond the limits of Brussels and its suburbs. Except in the
"matter of the farewell visit to the farm at Tervueren, Vivie was"
"reluctant to ask for any such favour from von Giesselin, though she"
was curious to see the condition of Louvain and to ascertain whether
her father still inhabited the monastic house of his order--she had
an idea that he was away in Germany in connection with his schemes
for raising the Irish against the British Government. Von Giesselin
however was becoming sentimentally inclined towards her and she saw
no more of him than was necessary to maintain polite relations. Frau
"von Giesselin, for various reasons of health or children, could not"
join him at Brussels as so many German wives had done with other of
the high functionaries (to the great embitterment of Brussels
society); and there were times when von Giesselin's protestations of
his loneliness alarmed her.
The King of Saxony had paid a visit to Brussels in the late autumn
of 1914 and had invited this Colonel of his Army to a fastuous
banquet given at the Palace Hotel. The King--whom the still defiant

"reminded ironically of his domestic infelicity, by enquiring"
whether he had brought Signor Toselli to conduct his orchestra--was

ACTIONS.--Phenol in large and undiluted doses is an irritant and
"narcotic poison; it is used as an antiseptic, parasiticide, antiferment"
and sometimes used as a local anaesthetic or anodyne in a 2 to 5 per
"cent solution; also as a caustic, but should not be used as a caustic as"
a burn from it heals very slowly.
USES.--Internally as a gastric sedative in small doses for vomiting in
dogs; is administered in various contagious and infectious diseases with
the view of preventing or arresting the development of micro-organisms;
"it coagulates albumen, is not nearly so active as bichloride of mercury;"
1 part to 500 parts of water prevents the growth of anthrax and other
"bacilli. Full doses produce gastro-enteritis, and collapse, which may"
"end fatally; it is a muscular and nerve paralyzer, both internally and"
"externally, it kills by paralyzing the muscles of respiration and the"
"heart. It is chiefly eliminated from the system by the kidneys, giving"
the urine a brownish color.
IN SURGERY.--A three to five per cent solution is used for washing out
"wounds, a two to three per cent for hands, and for itching of the skin,"
"carbolic acid three or four drachms, glycerine two ounces to one pint of"
water. Do not use over large surface on dogs and not at all on cats.
"Phenol treatment for Tetanus, which has given very good results and I"
"would recommend one drachm in three ounces of water, injected"
hypodermically in the region of neck and shoulder every two or three
hours until twelve injections were given and less frequently thereafter.
"DOSES.--Of the phenol: Horses and cattle, 10 to 40 grs.; sheep and pigs,"
"5 to 10 grs.; dogs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 gr., well diluted."
"with the head of a lamb[51], devastation will take place in the"
country.
"If an ewe gives birth to six, confusion among the population."
"If an ewe gives birth to seven,--three male and four female--, the"
king will perish.
"If an ewe gives birth to eight, approach of an usurper, the tribute"
of the king will be withheld.
"If an ewe gives birth to nine, end of the dynasty."
"If an ewe gives birth to ten, a weakling will acquire universal"
sovereignty[52].
The general similarity of the interpretations may be taken as a further
indication that the =bârû=-priests were simply giving their fancy free
scope in making prognostications for conditions that could never arise;
nor is it of serious moment that in the case of triplets the
"interpretation is favorable to the owner of the ewe, or that in the case"
"of ten lambs, even the official interpretation is not distinctly"
unfavorable--in view of the purely 'academic' character of such entries.
An extract from a long text[53] furnishing omens derived from all kinds of
peculiarities and abnormal phenomena noted on the ears of an
"animal--primarily again the sheep, though no doubt assumed to be"
applicable to other domesticated animals--will throw further light on the
"system of divination devised by the =bârû=-priests, and will also"
illustrate the extravagant fancy of the priests in their endeavor to make
their collections provide for all possible and indeed for many impossible
contingencies.
"Gerard, who did the infamous deed, actually told his judges 'that he"
"would soon be a saint in heaven, and would have the first place there"
"next to God,' whilst his family received a patent of nobility, and"
entered into the possession of the estate of the Prince in the Franche
Comté--rewards promised for the commission of the crime by Cardinal
"Granvelle."" (Dr. Alexander Robertson's _Roman Catholic Church in"
"Italy_, p. 94.)"
These are some of the things that help to explain not only the tone
"of the pasquinades, not only the indictments of the world's leading"
"historians, which are to be presently cited, but also the present"
attitude of something like twenty millions of the thirty-odd millions
"of Italy's inhabitants, who have forsaken the church altogether."
What idea the people have of the Jesuits in particular is well shown
"by the legend connected with the Piazza del Gesu, the great open space"
"in front of the Jesuit church, which is considered the windiest place"
in Rome. The story is that the devil and the wind were one day taking a
"walk together. ""When they came to this square, the devil, who seemed to"
"be very devout, said to the wind, 'Just wait a minute, mio caro, while"
"I go into this church.' So the wind promised, and the devil went into"
"the Gesu, and has never come out again--and the wind is blowing about"
"in the Piazza del Gesu to this day."""

One of the interesting objects in Rome is a mutilated statue called

for centuries it was used for placarding those satires upon the popes
"which, by their exceeding cleverness and biting truth, have made the"

"In modern times, the nurse, who is now receiving such complete"
"training for her duties with the children, should be ready to"
imitate the “dreamer” of the Indian tribe. I rejoice to find that
regular instruction in Story-telling is being given in many of the
institutions where the nurses are trained.
Some years ago there appeared a book by Dion Calthrop called “King
"Peter,” which illustrates very fully the effect of story-telling. It"
is the account of the education of a young prince which is carried on
"at first by means of stories, and later he is taken out into the arena"
of Life to be shown what is happening there--the dramatic appeal being
always the means used to awaken his imagination. The fact that only
_one_ story a year is told him prevents our seeing the effect from day
"to day, but the time matters little. We only need faith to believe that"
"the growth, though slow, was very sure."
"There is something of the same idea in the “Adventures of Telemachus,”"
"written by Fénélon for his royal pupil, the young Duke of Burgundy; but"
whereas Calthrop trusts to the results of indirect teaching by means of
"dramatic stories, Fénélon, on the contrary, makes use of the somewhat"
"heavy, didactic method, so that one would think the attention of the"
young prince must have wandered at times; and I imagine Telemachus was
"in the same condition when he was addressed at some length by Mentor,"
"who, being Minerva (though in disguise), should occasionally have"
displayed that sense of humour which must always temper true wisdom:
"Take, for instance, the heavy reproof conveyed in the following"
passage:
“Death and shipwreck are less dreadful than the pleasures that attack
highly-developed imagination of the one and the stodgy prosaical
temperament of the other. Tom could enter into the elementary question
"of giving his school-fellow a black eye, but could not possibly enter"
into the drama of the imaginary arrival of a lion. He was sorely in
need of Fairy Stories.
"It is for this element we have to cater, and we cannot shirk our"
responsibilities.
"William James says: “Living things, moving things or things that"
"savour of danger or blood, that have a dramatic quality, these are"
"the things natively interesting to childhood, to the exclusion of"
"almost everything else, and the teacher of young children (until more"
artificial interests have grown up) will keep in touch with his pupils
by constant appeal to such matters as those.”[34]
Of course the savour of danger and blood is only _one_ of the things to
"which we should appeal, but I give the whole passage to make the point"
clearer.
"This is one of the most difficult parts of our selection, namely, how"
to present enough excitement for the child and yet include enough
constructive element which will satisfy him when the thirst for
“blugginess” is slaked.
"And here I should like to say that, whilst wishing to encourage in"
children great admiration and reverence for the courage and other fine
"qualities which have been displayed in times of war, and which have"
"mitigated its horrors, I think we should show that some of the finest"
moments in these heroes' lives had nothing to do with their profession
as soldiers. Thus we have the well-known story of Sir Philip Sidney and
the soldier; the wonderful scene where Roland drags the bodies of his
the religious orders. To these were joined the northern parts of Navarra
"and the Basque countries whose privileges had been threatened, together"
with large districts of the ever-turbulent provinces of Aragon and
Catalunia.
Round the Queen-Regent and her little daughter collected all the liberal
"opinion of the peninsula, most of the foreign sympathy, the influence of"
"the great towns and sea-ports, of the capital and the government"
"officials, the regular army and police with their officers--indeed all"
the organised and stated machinery of government.
But up to the time of our history these advantages had been to some
extent neutralised by the ill-success of the governmental generalship
and by the brilliant successes of two great Carlist leaders--Tomas
Zumalacarregui and Ramon Cabrera.
These men perfectly understood the conditions of warfare among their
"native mountains, and had inflicted defeat upon defeat on every Cristino"
general sent against them.
But a cloud had of late overspread the fair prospects of the party.
"Their great general, Tomas Zumalacarregui, had been killed by a cannon"
"ball at the siege of Bilbao, and Cabrera, though unsurpassed as a"
"guerrilla leader, had not the swift Napoleonic judgment and breadth of"
"view of his predecessor. Add to this that a new premier, Mendizábal, and"
"a new general, Espartero, were directing operations from Madrid. The"
"former, already half English, had begun to carry out his great scheme of"
filling the pockets of the civil and military authorities by conveying
to the government all the property belonging to the religious orders
"throughout Spain, who, like our friend the Abbot of Montblanch, had"
resolutely and universally espoused the cause of Don Carlos.
"went on to explain that Mr. Justice Gaunt, by nature a somewhat"
"cross-grained old limb of the law, had been very ill-pleased over being"
"bothered again, and at a moment when most of his colleagues were"
"enjoying a holiday, about any such apparently endless case as that of"
"the Jura succession, which had been cropping up before him, at more or"
"less lengthy intervals, for quite a number of years, and concerning"
"which he had, only a few days before, made an order of court in favour"

nearer his own than the rest. Nor did he often take his eyes from her
face throughout the course of a long and convincing dissertation by Mr.

period with four cases in which this had taken place.]
"[Footnote 85: This indeed seems to have been recognised by Wundt, who"
regards a 'functional rest of the sensory centres and of the apperception
"centre,' resulting in heightened latent energy which lends unusual"
"strength to excitations, as a secondary condition of the dream state."
"Külpe (_Outline of Psychology_, p. 212) argues that the existence of"
vivid dreams shows that fatigue with its diminished associability fails
to affect the central sensations themselves; this increased excitability
"resulting from dissociation may itself, however, be regarded as a symptom"
of fatigue; hyperaesthesia and anaesthesia are alike signs of exhaustion.]
[Footnote 86: The exhaustion sometimes felt on awaking from a dream
perhaps testifies to its emotional potency. Delboeuf states that a friend
of his experienced a dream so terrible in its emotional strain that on
awaking his black hair was found to have turned completely white.]
[Footnote 87: The fundamental character of emotion in dreams has been
more or less clearly recognised by various investigators. Thus C. L.
expressed the needs of his fellow-playmates when he said: “I want to go
to the place where the shadows are real.” This is the true definition
"of “Faerie” lands, and is the first sign of real mental development"
in the child when he is no longer content with the stories of his own
"little deeds and experiences, when his ear begins to appreciate sounds"
"different from the words in his own everyday language, and when he"
begins to separate his own personality from the action of the story.
George Goschen says[26]:
“What I want for the young are books and stories which do not simply
deal with our daily life. I like the fancy (even) of little children
"to have some larger food than images of their own little lives, and"
I confess I am sorry for the children whose imaginations are not
sometimes stimulated by beautiful Fairy Tales which carry them to
worlds different from those in which their future will be passed....
I hold that what removes them more or less from their daily life is
better than what reminds them of it at every step.”
It is because of the great value of leading children to something
beyond the limited circle of their own lives that I deplore the
twaddling boarding-school stories written for girls and the
artificially-prepared Public School stories for boys. Why not give them
"the dramatic interest of a larger stage? No account of a cricket match,"
"or a football triumph, could present a finer appeal to boys and girls"
than the description of the Peacestead in the “Heroes of Asgaard”:
"“This was the playground of the Æsir, where they practised trials of"
skill one with another and held tournaments and sham fights. These last
were always conducted in the gentlest and most honourable manner; for
"the strongest law of the Peacestead was, that no angry blow should be"
"struck, or spiteful word spoken upon the sacred field.”"
"publishers, although Morgan was, if possible, more indignant over the"
"statement in the same book that he had been kidnapped in Wales and sold,"
"as a boy, and sent to be a slave in Barbadoes. That he could descend to"
"rank dishonesty was shown when, returning from his extraordinary and"
"successful assault on the city of Panama in 1670, to Chagres, he left most"
"of his faithful followers behind, without ships or food, while he slipped"
"off in the night with most of the booty to Jamaica. No doubt, young Morgan"
"came to Jamaica with good credentials from his uncle, the Colonel, for the"
"latter was held in high esteem by Modyford, then Governor of Barbadoes,"
"who describes Colonel Morgan as ""that honest privateer."""
Colonel Morgan did not live to see his nephew reach the pinnacle of his
"success, for in the year 1665 he was sent at the head of an expedition to"
"attack the Dutch stronghold at St. Eustatius Island, but he was too old to"
stand the hardships of such an expedition and died shortly afterwards.
By this time Morgan had made his name as a successful and resolute
buccaneer by returning to Port Royal from a raiding expedition in Central
America with a huge booty.
"In 1665 Morgan, with two other buccaneers, Jackman and Morris, plundered"
"the province of Campeachy, and then, acting as Vice-Admiral to the most"
"famous buccaneer of the day, Captain Mansfield, plundered Cuba, captured"
"Providence Island, sacked Granada, burnt and plundered the coast of Costa"
"Rica, bringing back another booty of almost fabulous wealth to Jamaica. In"
"this year Morgan married a daughter of his uncle, Colonel Morgan."
"In 1668, when 33 years of age, Morgan was commissioned by the Jamaican"
"Government to collect together the privateers, and by 1669 he was in"
"command of a big fleet, when he was almost killed by a great explosion in"
"the _Oxford_, which happened while Morgan was giving a banquet to his"
"captains. About this time Morgan calmly took a fine ship, the _Cour"
miracle that the British Empire survived that life and death struggle
against a man of superhuman genius who was determined to effect its
overthrow. I have called special attention to the extent and
pertinacity of Napoleon's schemes for the foundation of a French
"Colonial Empire in India, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia; and"
"there can be no doubt that the events of the years 1803-13 determined,"
"not only the destinies of Europe and Napoleon, but the general trend"
of the world's colonization.
As it has been necessary to condense the story of Napoleon's life in
"some parts, I have chosen to treat with special brevity the years"
"1809-11, which may be called the _constans aetas_ of his career, in"
order to have more space for the decisive events that followed; but
even in these less eventful years I have striven to show how his
Continental System was setting at work mighty economic forces that
"made for his overthrow, so that after the _débâcle_ of 1812 it came to"
be a struggle of Napoleon and France _contra mundum_.
"While not neglecting the personal details of the great man's life, I"
have dwelt mainly on his public career. Apart from his brilliant
"conversations, his private life has few features of abiding interest,"
perhaps because he early tired of the shallowness of Josephine and the
Corsican angularity of his brothers and sisters. But the cause also
"lay in his own disposition. He once said to M. Gallois: ""Je n'aime pas"
"beaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin rien: _je suis tout à fait un"
"être politique_."" In dealing with him as a warrior and statesman, and"
"in sparing my readers details as to his bolting his food, sleeping at"
"concerts, and indulging in amours where for him there was no glamour"
"of romance, I am laying stress on what interested him most--in a word,"
I am taking him at his best.
"I could not have accomplished this task, even in the present"
"faith, and only a comparatively small number of strong minds succeed"
in after years in freeing themselves by their own powers from these
"fetters, whilst the majority remain captive in the accustomed bonds and"
form their judgment in accordance with the celebrated saying of Bishop
"Berkeley: 'Few men think; but all will have opinions.'""--Buchner, ""Man"

"""Even when such odium cannot deter, it annoys and irritates; hence the"
frequent unwillingness of men of science to come prominently forward
with the avowal of their beliefs.
"""It is time this delicacy were thrown aside, and such theologians"
plainly told that the skepticism and Infidelity--if skepticism and
Infidelity there be--lies all on their own side.
"the exasperated peasantry in Friesland and Guelderland,[757] but to put"
"down all the oligarchs who had rebelled against him, and finally to"
"behead them by the dozen,[758] leaving the land to his son as a"
virtually subject State.
"In the sixteenth century, under Charles V, the men of Ghent, grown once"
"again a great commercial community,[759] exhibited again the fatal"
instability of the undeveloped democracy of all ages. Called upon to pay
"their third of a huge subsidy of 1,200,000 _caroli_ voted by the Flemish"
"States to the Emperor, they rang their bell of revolt and defied him,"
"offering their allegiance to the King of France. That monarch, by way of"
"a bargain, promptly betrayed the intrigue to his ""brother,"" who"
"thereupon marched in force through France to the rebel city, now"
"paralysed by terror; and without meeting a shadow of resistance,"
"penalised it to the uttermost, beheading a score of leading citizens,"
"banishing many more, annulling its remaining municipal rights, and"
exacting an increased tribute.[760] It needed an extremity of grievance
to drive such communities to an enduring rebellion. When Charles V
"abdicated at Brussels in favour of his son Philip in 1555, he had"
already caused to be put to death Netherlanders to the number at least
of thousands for religious heresy;[761] and still the provinces were
"absolutely submissive, and the people capable of weeping collectively"
"out of sympathy with the despot's infirmities.[762] He, on his part,"
"born and educated among them, and knowing them well, was wont to say of"
them that there was not a nation under the sun which more detested the
"_name_ of slavery, or that bore the reality more patiently when managed"
with discretion.[763] He spoke whereof he knew.
§ 2. _The Revolt against Spain_
That the people who endured so much at the hands of a despot should have
"a pariah, except among the poor of Brussels in the Quartier des"
"Marolles. Here she was only regarded as a kind Englishwoman,"
"unwearied in her efforts to alleviate suffering, mental and bodily."
"And meantime, silence, a wall of silence as regarded"
England--England which she was beginning to look upon as the
paradise from which she had been chased. Not a word had come through
"from Rossiter, from Honoria, Bertie Adams, or any of her Suffrage"
friends. I can supply briefly what she did not know.
Rossiter at the very outbreak of War had offered his services as one
deeply versed in anatomy and in physiology to the Army Medical
"Service, and especially to a great person at the War Office; but had"
been told quite cavalierly that they had no need of him. As he
"persisted, he had been asked--in the hope that it might get rid of"
him--to go over to the United States in company with a writer of
"comic stories, a retired actor and a music-hall singer, and lecture"
on the causes of the War in the hope of bringing America in. This he
"had declined to do, and being rich and happening to know personally"
General Armstrong (Honoria's husband) he had been allowed to
accompany him to the vicinity of the front and there put his
theories of grafting flesh and bone to the test; with the ultimate
results that his work became of enormous beneficial importance and
"he was given rank in the R.A.M.C. Honoria, racked with anxiety about"
"her dear ""Army,"" and very sad as to Vivie's disappearance, slaved at"
War work as much as her children's demands on her permitted; or even
put her children on one side to help the sick and wounded. Vivie's
Suffrage friends forgot she had ever existed and turned their
"attention to propaganda, to recruiting for the Voluntary Army which"
"our ministers still hoped might suffice to win the War, to the"
"making of munitions, or aeroplane parts, to land work and to any"
"single-line title was the only title which existed, but as time went"
"on the demand of the public, on the one hand, for a decorated page at"
"the beginning of the book, together with the printer's desire, on the"
"other hand, to advertise himself, developed the bastard-title into the"
"dimensions of the title-page which we now know, containing the name"
"of the book, the name of the author, the publisher's device, and the"
publisher's name and address. At the present time the bastard-title is
used more to add elegance to the appearance of the volume than for any
"practical purpose, it being pleasanter for the eye to rest first upon"
"this page rather than at once upon the title-page, which extends over"
the full dimensions of the type area.
ADVERTISING CARD
"If an advertising card or limit notice is required, this page of"
display should be set up with careful consideration of the page it is
"to face, and of the typography of the book of which it is to be a part."
"Too frequently advertising cards are looked upon as separate jobs, and"
are set in types which do not harmonize with the typography of the rest
of the book.
TITLE-PAGE
The title-page offers the printer and the publisher a tempting
"opportunity for display and for artistic typography, and too few"
"realize the value of restraint. Cobden-Sanderson once remarked, as"
"explaining the high prices which he secures for his work, that he"
always charges more for what he leaves out than for what he puts in.
"The earliest volumes lacked the title-page, because vellum and"
"luckless Scotchmen, and in the 200 years that have elapsed they have"
clung to the tradition of friendship for the Briton and hatred for the
Spaniard. Dr. Pittier reports having found that Queen Victoria occupied
"in their villages the position of a patron saint, and that they refused"
to believe his assertion that she was dead. His account of the attitude
"of these Indians toward outsiders, recently printed in the National"
"Geographic Magazine, is an authoritative statement on the subject:"
“The often circulated reports of the difficulty of penetrating into the
"territory of the Cuna-Cuna are true only in part”, he says. “The"
"backwoods aborigines, in the valleys of the Bayano and Chucunaque"
"rivers, have nourished to this day their hatred for all strangers,"
especially those of Spanish blood. That feeling is not a reasoned one:
it is the instinctive distrust of the savage for the unknown or
"inexplicable, intensified in this particular case by the tradition of a"
long series of wrongs at the hands of the hated Spaniards.
"“So they feel that isolation is their best policy, and it would not be"
safe for anybody to penetrate into their forests without a strong escort
"and continual watchfulness. Many instances of murders, some confirmed"
"and others only suspected, are on record, and even the natives of the"
San Blas coast are not a little afraid of their brothers of the
mountains.
"“Of late, however, conditions seem to have bettered, owing to a more"
frequent intercourse with the surrounding settlements. A negro of La
"Palma, at the mouth of the Tuyra River, told me of his crossing, some"
"time ago, from the latter place to Chepo, through the Chucunaque and"
"Bayano territories, gathering rubber as he went along with his party. At"
the headwaters of the Canaza River he and his companions were held up by
"the ‘bravos’, who contented themselves with taking away the rubber and"
part of the equipment and then let their prisoners go with the warning
the saints were exposed if they find them too often preserved at the
last moment from the punishment they were brave enough to undergo. For
"one or other of these reasons, I should avoid the detailed history of"
"St. Juliana, St. Vincent, St. Quintin, St. Eustace, St. Winifred, St."
"Theodore, St. James the More, St. Katharine, St. Cuthbert, St. Alphage,"
"St. Peter of Milan, St. Quirine and Juliet, St. Alban and others."
The danger of telling children stories connected with sudden
conversions is that they are apt to place too much emphasis on the
"process, rather than the goal to be reached. We should always insist on"
the splendid deeds performed after a real conversion--not the details
"of the conversion itself; as, for instance, the beautiful and poetical"
work done by St. Christopher when he realised what work he could do
most effectively.
"On the other hand, there are many stories of the saints dealing with"
actions and motives which would appeal to the imagination and are not
"only worthy of imitation, but are not wholly outside the life and"
experience even of the child.[30]
Having protested against the elephantine joke and the too-frequent
"use of exaggerated fun, I now endeavour to restore the balance by"
suggesting the introduction into the school curriculum of a few purely
grotesque stories which serve as an antidote to sentimentality or
"utilitarianism. But they must be presented as nonsense, so that the"
"children may use them for what they are intended, as pure relaxation."
Such a story is that of “The Wolf and the Kids.” I have had serious
"objections offered to this story by several educational people, because"
"of the revenge taken by the goat on the wolf, but I am inclined to"
"think that if the story is to be taken as anything but sheer nonsense,"
it is surely sentimental to extend our sympathy towards a caller who
has devoured six of his hostess' children. With regard to the wolf
ONE AGAINST MANY.
The beautiful and socially popular Duchess de la Santoisie sat her at
"brilliantly appointed dinner-table, and flashed her bright eyes"
"comprehensively round the board,--her party was complete. She had"
secured twenty of the best-known men and women of letters in all
"London, and yet she was not quite satisfied with the result attained."
"One dark, splendid face on her right hand had taken the lustre out of"
"all the rest,--one quiet, courteous smile on a mouth haughty, yet"
"sweet, had somehow or other made the entertainment of little worth in"
"her own estimation. She was very fair to look upon, very witty, very"
"worldly-wise,--but for once her beauty seemed to herself defective and"
"powerless to charm, while the graceful cloak of social hypocrisy she"
was always accustomed to wear would not adapt itself to her manner
"tonight so well as usual. The author of ""Nourhalma"" the successful poet"
"whose acquaintance she had very eagerly sought to make, was not at all"
"the kind of man she had expected,--and now, when he was beside her as"
"her guest, she did not quite know what to do with him."
"She had met plenty of poets, so called, before,--and had, for the most"
"part, found them insignificant looking men with an enormous opinion of"
"themselves, and a suave, condescending contempt for all others of their"
"craft; but this being,--this stately, kingly creature with the noble"
"head, and far-gazing, luminous eyes,--this man, whose every gesture was"
"graceful, whose demeanor was more royal than that of many a crowned"
"monarch,--whose voice had such a singular soft thrill of music in its"
"tone,--he was a personage for whom she had not been prepared,--and in"
whose presence she felt curiously embarrassed and almost ill at ease.
And she was not the only one present who experienced these odd
"sensations. Alwyn's appearance, when, with his friend Villiers, he had"
"undergraduates, many of the thirty demies being graduates"
and non-resident. In the year of his matriculation there
"were only ten gentlemen-commoners; thus, as far as"
"undergraduates went, the College was a small one."
[3] Mr. Shirley was Member of Parliament for South
"Warwickshire, a well-known genealogist, and the author of"
_The Noble and Gentle Men of England_.
"It is known that Ferrier took his Bachelor's degree in 1832, and that"
he had by that time managed to acquire a very tolerable knowledge of
"the classics and begun to study philosophy, so that his time could not"
"have been entirely idle. For the rest, he probably passed happily"
"through his years at College, as many others have done before and after"
"him, without allowing more weighty cares to dwell upon his mind."
"Another friend of after days, the late Principal Tulloch, after noting"
the fact that Oxford had not then developed the philosophic spirit
"which in recent years has marked her schools, and which had not then"
"taken root any more than the High Church movement which preceded it,"
"goes on: 'It may be doubted, indeed, whether Oxford exercised any"
definite intellectual influence on Professor Ferrier. He had imbibed
"his love for the Latin poets before he went there, and his devotion to"
Greek philosophy was an after-growth with which he never associated his
Magdalen studies. To one who visited the College with him many years
"afterwards, and to whom he pointed out with admiration its noble walks"
"and trees, his associations with the place seemed to be mainly those of"
amusement. There is reason to think that few of those who knew him at
Magdalen would have afterwards recognised him in the laborious student
"at St. Andrews, who for weeks together would scarcely cross the"
"threshold of his study; and yet to all who knew him well, there was"
nevertheless a clear connection between the gay gownsman and the
hard-working Professor.'
to the chamber of bright-haired Persephone which none may escape.’
"There is naturally here a note of lament, as befits any epitaph, and"
more especially that of one who dies young and unmarried; but none
"the less there is an anticipation--justified, we may think, if we"
"will, by some ceremony of bridal ablution performed for the dead man"
by his friends--that his death is a wedding with the goddess of the
"under-world; and indeed the phrase Φερσεφόνης θάλαμος, ‘the bridal"
"chamber of Persephone,’ recurs with some frequency in this class of"
epitaphs[1502].
"Considered collectively, such epitaphs would suggest a distinctly"
"offensive conception of Persephone; but in each taken separately, as"
"it was composed, it will be allowed, I think, that if there is supreme"
"audacity, there is equal sublimity. It is just these qualities which"
"give pungency to a blasphemous parody of such epitaphs, in which the"
wit of Ausonius exposes the worst possible aspect of a religious
conception which to the pure-minded was wholly pure. My apology for
quoting lines which I will not translate must be the fact that a
caricature is often no less instructive than a true portrait. The mock
epitaph concludes as follows:
Sed neque functorum socius miscebere vulgo
Nec metues Stygios flebilis umbra lacus:
"Verum aut Persephonae Cinyreius ibis Adonis,"
Aut Jovis Elysii tu catamitus eris[1503].
Ausonius in jest bears an unpleasant resemblance to Clement in earnest;
both perverted to their uttermost a doctrine which commanded nothing
but reverence from faithful participants in the mysteries.
Akin to these epitaphs are certain tablets which recently have been
"fully discussed by Miss Jane Harrison[1504], and have been shown to"
"Infidels are not perfect. Many of them need reconstruction sadly, but"
the above data seem to indicate that they compare rather favorably with
their fellow-men in the matter of good citizenship.

"""Moreover, as Goethe has already shown, the celebrated Mosaic moral"
"precepts, the so-called Ten Commandments, were _not_ upon the tables"
upon which Moses wrote the laws of the covenant which God made with his
people.
"""Even the extraordinary diversity of the many religions diffused over"
the surface of the earth suffices to show that they can stand in no
"necessary connection with morals, as it is well known that wherever"
"tolerably well-ordered political and social conditions exist, the moral"
"precepts in their essential principles are the same, whilst when such"
"conditions are wanting, a wild and irregular confusion, or even an"
entire deficiency of moral notions is met with.* History also shows
incontrovertibly that religion and morality have by no means gone hand
"in hand in strength and development, but that even contrariwise the"
most religious times and countries have produced the greatest number
"of crimes and sins against the laws of morality, and indeed, as daily"
"experience teaches, still produce them. The history of nearly all"
"religions is filled with such horrible abominations, massacres, and"
boundless wickednesses of every kind that at the mere recollection of
"them the heart of a philanthropist seems to stand still, and we turn"
with disgust and horror from a mental aberration which could produce
such deeds. If it is urged in vindication of religion that it has

In the sea the conditions for preservation are more favorable than
on land; yet even here the proportion of animals and plants whose
hard parts are fossilized is very small compared with those which
either totally decay before they are buried in slowly accumulating
sediments or are ground to powder by waves and currents.
"We may infer that during each period of the past, as at the"
"present, only a very insignificant fraction of the innumerable"
organisms of sea and land escaped destruction and left in
continental and oceanic deposits permanent records of their
"existence. Scanty as these original life records must have been,"
they have been largely destroyed by metamorphism of the rocks in
"which they were imbedded, by solution in underground waters, and"
by the vast denudation under which the sediments of earlier
periods have been eroded to furnish materials for the sedimentary
"records of later times. Moreover, very much of what has escaped"
destruction still remains undiscovered. The immense bulk of the
"stratified rocks is buried and inaccessible, and the records of"
the past which it contains can never be known. Comparatively few
outcrops have been thoroughly searched for fossils. Although new
"species are constantly being discovered, each discovery may be"
"considered as the outcome of a series of happy accidents,--that"
the remains of individuals of this particular species happened to
"be imbedded and fossilized, that they happened to escape"
"destruction during long ages, and that they happened to be exposed"

SOME INFERENCES FROM THE RECORDS OF THE HISTORY OF LIFE UPON THE
"PLANET. Meager as are these records, they set forth plainly some"
important truths which we will now briefly mention.
gratified that a subject of his should be performing the important
"duties of Secretary to the Brussels Government, and his notice of"
"von Giesselin gave the latter considerable prestige, for a time; an"
influence which he certainly exercised as far as he was able in
softening the edicts and the intolerable desire to annoy and
exasperate on the part of the Prussian Governors of province and
kingdom. He even interceded at times for unfortunate British or
"French subjects, stranded in Brussels, and sometimes asked Vivie"
about fellow-countrymen who sought this intervention.
This caused her complicated annoyances. Seeing there was some hope
"in interesting her in their cases, these English governesses,"
"tutors, clerks, tailors' assistants and cutters, music-hall singers,"
grooms appealed to Vivie to support their petitions. They paid her
"or her mother a kind of base court, on the tacit assumption that"
she--Vivie--had placed Colonel von Giesselin under special
"obligations. If in rare instances, out of sheer pity, she took up a"
case and von Giesselin granted the petition or had it done in a
"higher quarter, his action was clearly a personal favour to her; and"
"the very petitioners went away, with the ingratitude common in such"
"cases, and spread the news of Vivie's privileged position at the"
Hotel Impérial. It was not surprising therefore that in the small
circles of influential British or American people in Brussels she
was viewed with suspicion or contempt. She supported this odious
"position at the Hotel Impérial as long as possible, in the hope that"
Colonel von Giesselin when he had realized the impossibility of
using herself or her mother in any kind of intrigue against the
British Government would do what the American Consul General
professed himself unable or unwilling to do: obtain for them
passports to proceed to Holland.
"Von Giesselin, from December, 1914, took up among other duties that"
"to expand itself into a broad, loving, sympathetic comprehension of the"
"wants and afflictions of human-kind; and he was writing a new poem, of"
which Villiers had seen some lines that had fairly amazed him by their
grandeur of conception and clear passion of utterance. Thus it was
"evident there was no morbidness in him,--no obscurity,--nothing"
"eccentric,--nothing that removed him in any way from his fellows,"
"except that royal personality of his,--that strong, beautiful,"
"well-balanced Spirit in him, which exercised such a bewildering spell"
"on all who came within its influence, He believed himself loved by an"
"Angel! Well,--if there WERE angels, why not? Villiers argued the"
proposition thus:
"""Whether we are Christians, Jews, Buddhists, or Mahometans, we are"
supposed to accept angels as forming part of the system of our Faith.
"If we are nothing,--then, of course, we believe in nothing. But granted"
"we are SOMETHING, then we are bound in honor, if consistent, to"
"acknowledge that angels help to guide our destinies. And if, as we are"
"assured by Holy Writ, such loftier beings DO exist, why should they not"
"communicate with, and even love, human creatures, provided those human"
"creatures are worthy of their tenderness? Certainly, viewed by all the"
"chief religions of the world, there is nothing new or outrageous in the"
"idea of an angel descending to the help of man."""
"Such thoughts as these were in his mind now, as he ever and anon"
"glanced across the glittering table, with its profusion of lights and"
"flowers, to where his poet-friend sat, slightly leaning back in his"
"chair, with a certain half-perplexed, half-disappointed expression on"
"his handsome features, though his eyes brightened into a smile as he"
"caught Villiers's look, and he gave the smallest, scarcely perceptible"
"shrug, as who should say, ""Is this your brilliant Duchess?--your witty"
"and cultured society?"""
No such commercial development had before been seen in Europe. About
"1560, according to Guicciardini,[800] 500 ships had been known to come"
and go in a day from Antwerp harbour in the island of Walcheren; but in
"the spring of 1599, it is recorded, 640 ships engaged solely in the"
"Baltic trade discharged cargoes at Amsterdam;[801] and in 1610,"
"according to Delacourt, there sailed from the ports of Holland in three"
"days, on the eastward trade alone, 800 or 900 ships and 1,500 herring"
boats.[802] At the date of the Peace of Münster these figures were left
"far behind, whence had arisen a reluctance to end the war, under which"
"commerce so notably flourished. Many Hollanders, further, had been"
averse to peace in the belief that it would restore Antwerp and injure
"their commerce, even as Prince Maurice of Orange, the republic's general"
"and stadthouder, had been averse to it as likely to lessen his power and"
revenue.[803] But between 1648 and 1669 the trade increased by fifty per
"cent.,[804] Holland taking most of the Spanish trade from the shipping"
"of England and the Hansa, and even carrying much of the trade between"
Spain and her colonies. When the Dutch had thus a mercantile marine of
"10,000 sail and 168,000 men, the English carried only 27,196 men; and"
the Dutch shipping was probably greater than that of all the rest of
Europe together.[805]
"This body of trade, as has been seen, was built up by a State which,"
"broadly speaking, had a surplus wealth-producing power in only one"
"direction, that of fishing; and even of its fishing, much was done on"
"the coasts of other nations. In that industry, about 1610, it employed"
"over 200,000 men; and the Greenland whale fishery, which was a monopoly"
"from 1614 to 1645, began to expand rapidly when set free,[806] till in"
"1670 it employed 120 ships.[807] For the rest, though the country"
"exported dairy produce, its total food product was not equal to its"
"consumption; and as it had no minerals and no vineyards, its surplus"
"wealth came from the four sources of fishing, freightage, extorted"
"colonial produce, and profits on the handling of goods bought and sold."
resemblance to his mother's. And his close connection with the Wilson
family had the result of bringing the young man into association with
"whatever was best in literature and art. While yet a boy, we are told,"
he sat upon Sir Walter's knee; the Ettrick Shepherd had told him tales
and recited Border ballads; while Lockhart took the trouble to draw
"pictures, as he only could, to amuse the child."
In surroundings such as these James Frederick Ferrier was born on the
"16th day of June 1808, his birthplace being Heriot Row, in the new town"
of Edinburgh--a street which has been made historic to us by the
"recollections of another child who lived there long years afterwards,"
and who left the grey city of his birth to die far off in an island in
the Pacific. But of Ferrier's child-life we know nothing: whether he
"played at 'tig' or 'shinty' with the children in the adjoining gardens,"
"or climbed Arthur's Seat, or tried to scale the 'Cats' Nick' in the"
"Salisbury Crags close by; or whether he was a grave boy, 'holding at'"
"his lessons, or reading other books that interested him, in preference"
to his play. Ferrier did not dwell on these things or talk much of his
"youth; or if he did so, his words have been forgotten. What we do"
know are the barest facts: that his second name was given him in
"consideration of his father's friendship with Lord Frederick Campbell,"
"Lord Clerk Register of Scotland; that his first name, as is usual in"
"Scotland for an elder son, was his paternal grandfather's; and that he"
"was sent to live with the Rev. Dr. Duncan, the parish minister of"
"Ruthwell, in Dumfriesshire, to receive his early education. Dr. Duncan"
"of Ruthwell was a man of considerable ability and energy of character,"
"though not famous in any special sphere of learning. He is well known,"
"however, in the south of Scotland as the originator of Savings Banks"
"there, and his works on the Seasons bear evidence of an interest in the"
natural world. At anyrate the time passed in Dumfriesshire would appear
to have left pleasant recollections; for when Ferrier in later life
"alluded to it, it was with every indication of gratitude for the"
it had to deal with the unravelling of the great mystery that underlies
memory and tracing it backwards to latent impressions even in the
"inorganic bodies which are capable of subsequent revival; and finally,"
the determination of the special characteristic of that vehicle through
which sensiferous impulses are transmitted and the possibility of
changing the intensity and the tone of sensation. All these
"investigations, Dr. Bose said, are to be carried out by new physical"
methods of the utmost delicacy. He had in these years been able to
remove the obstacles in the path and had lifted the veil so as to catch
a glimpse of the ineffable wonder that had hitherto been hidden from
"view. The real work, he said, had only just begun."
A SOCIAL GATHERING
"At the Social Gathering held on the 16th December 1915, in the compound"
"of the Calcutta Presidency College, to meet him after his highly"
"successful tour through Europe, America and Japan, Dr. Bose spoke as"
follows:--
He said that it was his rare good fortune to have been amply rewarded
for the hardships and struggles that he had gone through by the generous
and friendly feelings of his colleagues and the love and trust of his
pupils. He would say a few words regarding his experience in the
"Presidency College for more than three decades, which he hoped would"
serve to bring all who loved the Presidency College--present and past
pupils and their teachers--in closer bonds of union. He would speak to
"them what he had learnt after years of patient labour, that the"
impossible became possible by persistent and determined efforts and
adherence to duty and entire selflessness. The greatest obstacle often
"arises out of foolish misunderstanding of each other's ideals, such as"
"the differing points of view, first of the Indian teacher, then of his"
"There are distinct periods of good and bad luck in every man's life,"
"which may be felt in advance by one sensitive to occult influences,"
if one will but keep good watch on one's intuitions and leave them
"untrammelled by will or reason. At this time ""I felt it in my bones,"""
"as Betty would have said, that the day of our good luck was at hand."
"All conditions seemed to combine to our pleasure when, on a certain"
"bright spring morning, Betty, Frances, and I went down to the courtyard"
"of the Old Swan, where we found the coach, the horses, and even the"
drivers all glittering in the sunshine.
"There was ample room in the back seat of the coach for the three of us,"
"so Betty took one corner, Frances made herself comfortable in another,"
"and I took what was left, the pleasant place between them."
"After Betty had kissed her father at least a dozen times, and had shed a"
"few tears just to make her happiness complete, the driver cracked his"
"whip and away we went, out through the courtyard gate, down Gracious Hill"
and across London Bridge before a sleepy man could have winked his eyes.
"At first we thought we were in haste, but when we got out of Southwark"
"and into the country, the dark green grass, the flowering hedges, the"
"whispering leaves of the half-fledged trees, the violets by the roadside,"
"and the smiling sun in the blue above, all invited us to linger. So we"
"told the driver to slow his pace, and we lowered every window in the"
"coach, there being no one in the country whose wonder and envy we cared"
to arouse by a display of our glass.
There was not room in Betty's little heart for all the great flood of
"happiness that had poured into it, so presently, to give it vent, she"
"began to sing the little French lullaby we had so often heard, whereupon"
"Frances and I ceased listening to the birds, and I was more thoroughly"
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If the ears of a foetus are choked up[66], in place of a large king a"
small king will be in the land.
"In general, therefore, an excess number of ears points to enlargement,"
"increased power, stability of the government and the like; and this is"
probably due in part to the association of wisdom and understanding with
"the ear in Babylonian[67], for as a general thing an excess of organs or"
"of parts of the body is an unfavorable sign, because a deviation from the"
normal.
"In the same way as in the case of the ears, we have birth-omen texts"
"dealing with the head, lips, mouth, eyes, feet, joints, tail, genital"
"organs, hair, horns and other parts of the body[68]. In many of these"
texts dealing with all kinds of peculiar formations and abnormalities in
"the case of one organ or one part of the body or the other, a comparison"
is instituted between the features or parts of one animal with those of
another and the interpretation is guided by the association of ideas with
the animal compared. A moment's reflection will show the importance of
this feature in extending the field of observation almost =ad infinitum=.
"A lamb born with a large head might suggest a lion, a small long head that"
"of a dog, or a very broad face might suggest the features of a bull. From"
"comparisons of this kind, the step would be a small one to calling a lamb"
"with lion-like features, a lion, or a lamb with features recalling those"
"celestial visitant who, on noiseless pinions, comes flying divinely"
"into the poorest homes, transfiguring common life with ethereal"
"radiance, making toil easy, giving beauty to the plainest faces and"
"poetry to the dullest brains. Love! its tremulous hand-clasp,--its"
"rapturous kiss,--the speechless eloquence it gives to gentle eyes!--the"
"grace it bestows on even the smallest gift from lover to beloved, were"
such gift but a handful of meadow blossoms tied with some silken
threads of hair!
"Not for the poet creator of ""Nourhulma"" such love any more,--had he not"
"drained the cup of Passion to the dregs in the far Past, and tasted its"
mixed sweetness and bitterness to no purpose save self-indulgence? All
"that was over;--and yet, as he walked away from the bridge, back to his"
"hotel in the quiet moonlight, he thought what a transcendent thing Love"
"might be, even on earth, between two whose spirits were SPIRITUALLY"
"AKIN,--whose lives were like two notes played in tuneful"
"concord,--whose hearts beat echoing faith and tenderness to one"
"another,--and who held their love as a sacred bond of union--a gift"
"from God, not to be despoiled by that rough familiarity which surely"
brings contempt. And then before his fancy appeared to float the
"radiant visage of Edris, half-child, half-angel,--he seemed to see her"
"beautiful eyes, so pure, so clear, so unshadowed by any knowledge of"
"sin,--and the exquisite lines of a poet-contemporary, whose work he"
"specially admired, occurred to him with singular suggestiveness:"
"""Oh, thou'lt confess that love from man to maid"
"Is more than kingdoms,--more than light and shade"
"In sky-built gardens where the minstrels dwell,"
And more than ransom from the bonds of Hell.
"Thou wilt, I say, admit the truth of this,"
"And half relent that, shrinking from a kiss,"
"Thou didst consign me to mine own disdain,"
"Future,--he was, without knowing it, in the simple, unconsciously"
"perfect attitude of a Soul that is absolutely at one with God, and that"
"thus, in involuntary God-likeness, is only happy in the engendering of"
"happiness. He believed that, with the Divine help, he could do a"
"lasting good for his fellow-men,--and to this cause he was willing to"
sacrifice everything that pertained to his own mere personal advantage.
"But now,--now,--or so he imagined,--he was not to be allowed to pursue"
"his labors of love,--his trial was to end suddenly,--and he, so long"
"banished from his higher heritage, was to be restored to it without"
"delay,--restored and drawn back to the land of perfect loveliness where"
"Edris, his Angel, waited for him, his saint, his queen, his bride!"
"A thrill of ecstatic joy rushed through him,--joy intermingled with an"
almost supernal pain. For he had not as yet said enough to the
"world,--the world of many afflictions,--the little Sorrowful Star"
"covered with toiling, anxious, deluded God-forgetting millions, in"
"every unit of which was a spark of Heavenly flame, a germ of the"
"spiritual essence that makes the angel, if only fostered aright."
"Lost in a deep reverie, his footsteps had led him unconsciously to the"
"Rhine bridge,--paying the customary fee, he walked about half-way"
"across it, and stood for a while listening to the incessant swift rush"
of the river beneath him. Lights twinkled from the boats moored on
"either side,--the moon poured down a wide shower of white beams on the"
"rapid flood,--the city, dusky and dream-like, crowned with the majestic"
"towers of the Dom, looked picturesquely calm and grand--it was a night"
of perfect beauty and wondrous peace. And he was to die!--to die and
"leave all this, the present fairness of the world,--he was to depart,"
"with, as he felt, his message half unspoken,--he was to be made"
"eternally happy, while many of the thousands he left behind were,"
"through ignorance, wilfully electing to be eternally miserable! A"
"great, almost divine longing to save ONE,--only ONE downward drifting"
"instinctive desire to acknowledge and honor, by his noblest design and"
"work, the unseen but felt majesty of the Creator. He had a great"
"longing to enter it now, and ascended the steps with that intention;"
"but, much to his vexation, the doors were shut. He walked from the side"
to the principal entrance; that superb western frontage which is so
cruelly blocked in by a dwarfish street of the commonest shops and
"meanest houses,--and found that also closed against him. Disappointed"
"and sorry, he went back again to the side of the colossal structure,"
"and stood on the top of the steps, close to the central barred doors,"
"studying the sculptured saints in the niches, and feeling a sudden,"
"singular impression of extreme LONELINESS,--a sense of being shut out,"
"as it were, from some high festival in which he would gladly have taken"
part.
"Not a cloud was in the sky, ... the evening was one of the most"
"absolute calm, and a delicious warmth pervaded the air,--the warmth of"
"a fully declared and balmy spring. The Platz was almost deserted,--only"
"a few persons crossed it now and then, like flitting shadows,--and"
"somewhere down in one of the opposite streets a long way off, there was"
"a sound of men's voices singing a part-song. Presently, however, this"
"distant music ceased, and a deep silence followed. Alwyn still remained"
"in the sombre shade of the cathedral archway, arguing with himself"
"against the foolish and unaccountable depression that had seized him,"
and watching the brilliant May moon soar up higher and higher in the
"heavens; when,--all at once, the throbbing murmur of the great organ"
inside the Dom startled him from pensive dreaminess into swift
"attention. He listened,--the rich, round notes thundered through the"
"stillness with forceful and majestic harmony; anon, wierd tones, like"
"the passionate lament of Sarasate's ""Zigeunerweisen"" floated around and"
"above him: then, a silvery chorus of young voices broke forth in solemn"
unison:
"with the inscription, Liberatori Patriæ, S. P. Q. R.'"" The nepotism of"
"the learned, brilliant and witty Paul III. ""induced him to form Parma"
"into a duchy for his natural son Pierluigui, to build the Farnese"
"Palace, and to marry his grandson Ottavio to Marguerite, natural"
"daughter of Charles V."" John XII., the first Pope who took a new name,"
"""scandalized Christendom by a life of murder, robbery, adultery and"
"incest."" Of the tombs of the eighty-seven popes who were buried in the"
"old basilica of St. Peter's, only two were replaced when the present"
"building was erected, those of the two popes who lived in the time and"
"excited the indignation of Savonarola--""Sixtus IV., with whose cordial"
"concurrence the assassination of Lorenzo de' Medici was attempted,"
"and Innocent VIII., the main object of whose policy was to secure"
"place and power for his illegitimate children,"" sixteen in number, and"
who is represented on his tomb as holding in his hand the spear of
"""St. Longinus,"" which had pierced the side of Christ. This spear was"
"sent to Innocent VIII. by the Sultan Bajazet, nearly fifteen hundred"
"years after the crucifixion, and, as we have already seen, is now"
preserved in St. Peter's as one of its four chief relics. Guicciardini
"says of the death of Alexander VI.: ""All Rome ran with indescribable"
gladness to visit the corpse. Men could not satiate their eyes with
"feeding on the carcase of the serpent who, by his unbounded ambition"
"and pestiferous perfidy, by every demonstration of horrible cruelty,"
"monstrous lust and unheard-of avarice, selling without distinction"
"things sacred and profane, had filled the world with venom."""
"""Pope Paul V. granted dispensations and pensions to any persons who"
"would assassinate Fra Paolo Sarpi; Pope Pius V. offered, as Mr. Froude"
"tells us, 'remission of sin to them and their heirs, with annuities,"
"honors and promotions, to any cook, brewer, baker, vintner, physician,"
"grocer, surgeon, or others,' who would make away with Queen Elizabeth;"
and Pope Gregory XIII. offered a high place in heaven to any one who
"would murder the Prince of Orange; and the poor wretch, Balthazar"
THE HANSA
"Systematic commerce in the north of Europe, broadly speaking, begins"
"with the traffic of the Hansa towns, whose rise may be traced to the"
sudden development of civic life forced on Germany in the tenth century
"by the emperor Henry I, as a means of withstanding the otherwise"
"irresistible raids of the Hungarians.[711] Once founded, such cities for"
their own existence' sake gave freedom to all fugitive serfs who joined
"them, defending such against former masters, and giving them the chance"
of earning a living.[712] That is by common consent the outstanding
"origin of German civic industry, and the original conditions were such"
"that the cities, once formed, were gradually forced[713] to special"
"self-reliance. _Faustrecht_, or private war, was universal, even under"
emperors who suppressed feudal brigandage; and the cities had to fight
"their own battle, like those of Italy, from the beginning. As compared"
"with the robber baronage and separate princes, they stood for"
"intelligence and co-operation, and supplied a basis for organisation"
without which the long German chaos of the Middle Ages would have been
immeasurably worse. Taking their commercial cue from the cities of
"Italy, they reached, as against feudal enemies, a measure of peaceful"
union which the less differentiated Italian cities could not attain save
momentarily. The decisive conditions were that whereas in Italy the
"enemies were manifold--sometimes feudal nobles, sometimes the Emperor,"
"sometimes the Pope--the German cities had substantially one objective,"
"the protection of trade from the robber-knights. Thus, as early as the"
"year 1284, seventy cities of South Germany formed the Rhenish League, on"
which followed that of the Swabian towns. The league of the Hansa
"cities, like the other early ""Hansa of London,"" which united cities of"
"Flanders and France with mercantile London, was a growth on all fours"
"with these.[714] Starting, however, in maritime towns which grew to"
"commerce from beginnings in fishing, as the earlier Scandinavians had"
the superstition which made Christians akreophagous on Fridays and
fast-days and all through the forty days of Lent. When the plan of
"salting herrings was hit upon,[726] all Christian Europe helped to make"
the fortunes of the fisheries.
Net-making may have led to weaving; in any case weaving is the first
important industry developed in the Low Countries. It depended mainly on
the wool of England; and on the basis of the ancient seafaring there
"thus arose a sea-going commerce.[727] Further, the position of"
"Flanders,[728] as a trade-centre for northern and southern Europe,"
served to make it a market for all manner of produce; and round such a
market population and manufactures grew together. It belonged to the
"conditions that, though the territory came under feudal rule like every"
"other in the medieval military period, the cities were relatively"
"energetic all along,[729] theirs being (after the Dark Ages, when the"
work was largely done by the Church) the task of maintaining the
"sea-dykes[730] and water-ways, and theirs the wealth on which alone the"
feudal over-lords could hope to flourish in an unfruitful land. The
"over-lords, on their part, saw the expediency of encouraging foreigners"
"to settle and add to their taxable population,[731] thus establishing"
the tradition of political tolerance long before the Protestant period.
"Hence arose in the Netherlands, after the Renaissance, the phenomenon of"
a dense industrial population flourishing on a soil which finally could
"not be made to feed them,[732] and carrying on a vast shipping trade"
without owning a single good harbour and without possessing home-grown
"timber wherewith to build their ships, or home-products to freight"
them.[733]
One of the determinants of this growth on a partially democratic footing
was clearly the primary and peculiar necessity for combination by the
"inhabitants to maintain the great sea-dykes, the canals, and the"
embankments of the low-lying river-lands in the interior.[734] It was a
"eager spirit scorns so tardy a method: he will ""compel men to be"
"happy,"" and for this result there is but one practicable means, the"
"Social Contract, the State. Everything which mars the unity of the"
"Social Contract shall be shattered, so that the State may have a clear"
field for the exercise of its beneficent despotism. Such is
"Buonaparte's political and religious creed at the age of seventeen,"
and such it remained (with many reservations suggested by maturer
thought and self-interest) to the end of his days. It reappears in his
"policy anent the Concordat of 1802, by which religion was reduced to"
"the level of handmaid to the State, as also in his frequent assertions"
that he would never have quite the same power as the Czar and the
"Sultan, because he had not undivided sway over the consciences of his"
people.[10] In this boyish essay we may perhaps discern the
fundamental reason of his later failures. He never completely
"understood religion, or the enthusiasm which it can evoke; neither did"
"he ever fully realize the complexity of human nature, the"
"many-sidedness of social life, and the limitations that beset the"
action even of the most intelligent law-maker.[11]
His reading of Rousseau having equipped him for the study of human
"society and government, he now, during his first sojourn at Auxonne"
"(June, 1788--September, 1789), proceeds to ransack the records of the"
"ancient and modern world. Despite ill-health, family troubles, and the"
"outbreak of the French Revolution, he grapples with this portentous"
"task. The history, geography, religion, and social customs of the"
"ancient Persians, Scythians, Thracians, Athenians, Spartans,"
"Egyptians, and Carthaginians--all furnished materials for his"
encyclopædic note-books. Nothing came amiss to his summarizing genius.
Here it was that he gained that knowledge of the past which was to
astonish his contemporaries. Side by side with suggestions on
"regimental discipline and improvements in artillery, we find notes on"
"the opening episodes of Plato's ""Republic,"" and a systematic summary"
main success.[770] Such was the standing of Dutch Protestantism in 1555;
and no edict against heresy could be more searching and merciless than
that drawn up by Charles in 1550[771] without losing any upper-class
loyalty. Philip did but strive to carry it out.[772]
"Had Philip, further, maintained a prospect of chronic war for the"
"nobility of the Netherlands, the accruing chances of wealth[773] would"
in all likelihood have sufficed to keep them loyal. In the early wars of
his reign with France immense gains had been made by them in the way of
"ransoms and booty. When these ceased, luxury continuing, embarrassment"
became general.[774] But when Philip's energies were seen to be mainly
"bent on killing out heresy, the discontented nobles began to lean to the"
side of the persecuted commonalty. At the first formation of the
"Confederacy of the ""Beggars"" in 1566, almost the only zealous Protestant"
"among the leaders was William's impetuous brother Louis of Nassau, a"
"Calvinist by training, who had for comrade the bibulous Brederode. The"
"name of ""Gueux,"" given to the malcontents in contempt by the councillor"
"Berlaimont, had direct application to the known poverty or embarrassment"
of the great majority.[775] There was thus undisguisedly at work in the
"Netherlands the great economic force which had brought about ""the"
"Reformation"" in all the Teutonic countries; and the needy nobles"
insensibly grew Protestant as it became more and more clear that only
the lands of the Church could restore their fortunes.[776] This holds
despite the fact that the more intelligent Protestantism which latterly
spread among the people was the comparatively democratic form set up by
"Calvin, which reached the Low Countries through France, finding the"
readier reception among the serious because of the prestige accruing to
its austerity as against the moral disrepute which now covered the
German forms.

"Erasmus's mind: Ethical and aesthetic tendencies, aversion to"
"all that is unreasonable, silly and cumbrous--His vision of"
antiquity pervaded by Christian faith--Renascence of good
learning--The ideal life of serene harmony and happy
wisdom--Love of the decorous and smooth--His mind neither
"philosophic nor historical, but strongly philological and"
"moralistic--Freedom, clearness, purity, simplicity--Faith in"
nature--Educational and social ideas
What made Erasmus the man from whom his contemporaries expected their
"salvation, on whose lips they hung to catch the word of deliverance? He"
"seemed to them the bearer of a new liberty of the mind, a new clearness,"
"purity and simplicity of knowledge, a new harmony of healthy and right"
"living. He was to them as the possessor of newly discovered, untold"
wealth which he had only to distribute.
What was there in the mind of the great Rotterdamer which promised so
much to the world?
The negative aspect of Erasmus's mind may be defined as a heartfelt
"aversion to everything unreasonable, insipid, purely formal, with which"
the undisturbed growth of medieval culture had overburdened and
overcrowded the world of thought. As often as he thinks of the
"ridiculous text-books out of which Latin was taught in his youth,"
"disgust rises in his mind, and he execrates them--Mammetrectus,"
"Brachylogus, Ebrardus and all the rest--as a heap of rubbish which ought"
"to be cleared away. But this aversion to the superannuated, which had"
"become useless and soulless, extended much farther. He found society,"
"and especially religious life, full of practices, ceremonies, traditions"
"and conceptions, from which the spirit seemed to have departed. He does"
built a sanctuary for the statue of Isis sent to him from Memphis by
Ptolemy Euergetes.[14] In token of his friendship Ptolemy Soter introduced
"his god Serapis into Athens, where the latter had a temple at the foot of"
"the Acropolis[15] ever after, and Arsinoë, his mother or wife, founded"
"another at Halicarnassus, about the year 307.[16] In this manner the"
political activity of the Egyptian dynasty was directed toward having the
"divinities, whose glory was in a certain measure connected with that of"
"their house, recognized everywhere. Through Apuleius we know that under the"
empire the priests of Isis mentioned the ruling sovereign first of all in
their prayers.[17] And this was simply an imitation of the grateful
devotion which their predecessors had felt toward the Ptolemies.
"Protected by the Egyptian squadrons, sailors and merchants propagated the"
"worship of Isis, the goddess of navigators, simultaneously on the coasts of"
"Syria, {80} Asia Minor and Greece, in the islands of the Archipelago,[18]"
"and as far as the Hellespont and Thrace.[19] At Delos, where the"
"inscriptions enable us to study this worship somewhat in detail, it was not"
"merely practised by strangers, but the very sacerdotal functions were"
performed by members of the Athenian aristocracy. A number of funereal
"bas-reliefs, in which the deified dead wears the _calathos_ of Serapis on"
"his head, prove the popularity of the belief in future life propagated by"
these mysteries. According to the Egyptian faith he was identified with the
god of the dead.[20]
Even after the splendor of the court of Alexandria had faded and vanished;
even after the wars against Mithridates and the growth of piracy had ruined
"the traffic of the Ægean Sea, the Alexandrian worship was too deeply rooted"
"in the soil of Greece to perish, although it became endangered in certain"
"seaports like Delos. Of all the gods of the Orient, Isis and Serapis were"
the only ones that retained a place among the great divinities of the
Hellenic world until the end of paganism.[21]
"and the tithes being parcelled among the landowners, the king, and the"
"clergy. Naturally a large part of the lands, as before, was divided"
"among the nobles,[680] who were in this way converted to Protestantism."
Thus whereas heathen kings had originally embraced Christianity to
"enable them to consolidate their power, Christian kings embraced"
Protestantism to enable them to recover wealth and power from the
Catholic Church. Creed all along followed interest;[681] and the people
had small concern in the change.[682]
"Norway, being under the same crown, followed the course of Denmark. In"
Sweden the powerful Gustavus Vasa saw himself forced at the outset of
his reign to take power and wealth from the Church if he would have any
"of his own; and after the dramatic scene in the Diet of Westeras (1527),"
in which he broke out with a passionate vow to renounce the crown if he
"were not better supported,[683] he carried his point. The nobles, being"
"""squared""[684] by permission to resume such of their ancestral lands as"
"had been given to churches and convents since 1454, and by promise of"
"further grants, forced the bishops to consent to surrender to the king"
"their castles and strongholds, and to let him fix their revenues; all"
which was duly done. The monasteries were soon despoiled of nearly all
"their lands, many of which were seized by or granted in fief to the"
barons;[685] and the king became head of the Church in as full a degree
"as Henry VIII in England;[686] sagaciously, and in part unscrupulously,"
creating for the first time in Scandinavia a strong yet not wholly
"despotic monarchy, with such revenues from many sources[687] as made"
"possible the military power and activity of Gustavus Adolphus, and"
"later the effort of Charles XII to create an ""empire""--an effort which,"
"necessarily failing, reduced Sweden permanently to her true economic"
basis.
"Apart from those remarkable episodes, the development of the"
"Scandinavian States since the sixteenth century has been, on their"
In Flemish Ghent and Bruges the clashing interests of weavers and
"woollen-traders, complicated by the strife of the French (aristocratic)"
"and anti-French (popular) factions, led to riots in which citizens and"
magistrates were killed (1301). At times these enmities reached the
magnitude of civil war. At Ypres (1303) a combination of workmen
"demanded the suppression of rival industries in neighbouring villages,"
and in an ensuing riot the mayor and all the magistrates were slain; at
Bruges (1302) a trade riot led to the loss of fifteen hundred
"lives.[744] When later the weaving trade had flourished in Brabant, the"
same fatality came about: plebeians rebelled against patrician
magistrates--themselves traders or employers of labour--in the principal
cities; and Brussels (1312) was for a time given up to pillage and
"massacre, put down only by the troops of the reigning duke. A great"
"legislative effort was made in the ""Laws of Cortenberg,"" framed by an"
"assembly of nobles and city deputies, to regulate fiscal and industrial"
affairs in a stable fashion;[745] but after fifty years the trouble
"broke out afresh, and was ill-healed.[746] At length, in a riot in the"
"rich city of Louvain (1379), sixteen of its patrician magistrates were"
"slain, whereupon many took flight to England, but many more to Haarlem,"
"Amsterdam, Leyden, and other Dutch cities.[747] Louvain never again"
recovered its trade and wealth;[748] and since the renewed
Franco-Flemish wars of this period had nearly destroyed the commerce of
"Flanders,[749] there was a general gravitation of both merchandise and"
manufacture to Holland.[750] Thus arose Dutch manufactures in an organic
"connection with maritime commerce, the Dutch municipal organisation"
securing a balance of trade interests where that of the Flemish
industrial cities had partially failed.
The commercial lead given by the Hanseatic League was followed in the
"Netherlands with a peculiar energy, and till the Spanish period the main"
part of Dutch maritime commerce was with northern Europe and the Hansa
"cities. So far as the language test goes, the original Hansards and the"
to be considered. In fact considerable evidence is now available to show
that Babylonian-Assyrian astrological notions and in part also
astronomical data spread to China[9].
II
The observation of signs observed in young animals and in infants at the
time of birth constitutes a third division of Babylonian-Assyrian
"divination, quite equal in prominence to Hepatoscopy and Astrology. Here"
too we are justified in seeking for some rational or quasi-rational basis
"for the importance attached by Babylonians and Assyrians, and as we shall"
"see by other nations as well, to anything of a noteworthy or unusual"
character observed at the moment that a new life was ushered into the
world. The mystery of life made as deep an impression upon primitive man
"and upon ancient peoples as it does on the modern scientist, who endeavors"
with his better equipment and enriched by the large experience of past
"ages, to penetrate to the very source of life. A new life issuing from"
"another life--what could be stranger, what more puzzling, what more"
awe-inspiring? If we bear in mind that there is sufficient evidence to
"warrant us in saying that among peoples in a primitive state of culture,"
"the new life was not associated with the sexual act[10], the mystery must"
have appeared still more profound. The child or the young animal was
supposed to be due to the action of some spirit or demon that had found
"its way into the mother, just as death was supposed to be due to some"
malicious demon that had driven the spirit of life out of the body. The
"many birth customs found in all parts of the world[11], are associated"
with this impression of mystery made by the new life; they centre largely
round the idea of protection to the mother and her offspring at a critical
who will investigate it for themselves will see that the same idea of
death being followed by close intercourse with the gods is present
there also. That this was the inner meaning of the peculiarly offensive
"story is shown by a curious comment of Heraclitus upon it, which"
"Clement quotes--ωὐτὸς δε Ἀίδης καὶ Διόνυσος[1468], ‘Hades and Dionysus"
are one’; whence it follows that union with Dionysus is a synonym for
"that ‘marriage with Hades’ which elsewhere, in both ancient and modern"
"times, is a common presentment of death."
"Again in the Sabazian mysteries, which some connect with Dionysus and"
"others with Zeus, the little that is known of the ritual favours the"
view that here also the _motif_ was the marriage of the deity with his
"worshippers. According to Clement[1469], the subject-matter of these"
"mysteries was a story that Zeus, having become by Demeter the father"
"of Persephone, seduced in turn his own daughter, having as a means to"
"that end transformed himself into a snake. That story, it may safely be"
"said, is presented by Clement in its worst light; but the statement,"
"that in the ritual the deity was represented by a snake, obtains some"
"corroboration from Theophrastus, who says of the superstitious man,"
that if he see a red snake in his house he will invoke Sabazius[1470].
Now the token of these mysteries for those who were being initiated
"in them was, according to Clement[1471] again, ‘the god pressed to"
the bosom’ (ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός); which phrase he explains by saying
"that the god was represented as a snake, which was passed under the"
clothing and drawn over the bosom of the initiated ‘as a proof of the
incontinence of Zeus.’ Clearly then the act of initiation was the
symbolic wedding of the worshipper with the deity worshipped; and it is
probable that the union which was symbolized in this life was expected
to be realised in the next.
Finally in the orgiastic worship of Cybele the same religious doctrine
is revealed. Here to Attis seems to be assigned the same part as to
Greek conception of the goddess they must be treated as complementary.
They are well interpreted by Farnell. Rejecting the theory of physical
"symbolism, he suggests ‘a more human explanation. Hera was essentially"
"the goddess of women, and the life of women was reflected in her;"
their maidenhood and marriage were solemnised by the cults of Hera
"Παρθένος and Hera Τελεία or Νυμφευομένη, and the very rare worship of"
Hera Χήρα might allude to the not infrequent custom of divorce and
"separation[1490].’ With, Hera the Widow we are not here concerned,"
but only with the higher conceptions of Zeus and Hera as expressed in
the representation of the ‘sacred marriage’; the bride and bridegroom
"who looked upon that saw in it, we may be sure, not a symbolical"
"representation of the seasons and the productive powers of the earth,"
but rather the divine prototype of human marriage. It reminded them
"that deities, like mortals, were married and given in marriage, and it"
"imparted to their wedding a sacramental character, making it at once a"
"foretaste and a gage of that close communion with the gods which, when"
death the dividing line between mortals and immortals should once be
"passed, awaited the blessed among mankind."
Other small points too suggest the same trend of thought. The
preliminaries of a wedding often comprised a sacrifice to Zeus
"Teleios and Hera Teleia[1491], and were called προτέλεια being the"
"‘preliminaries of initiation’ into that mystery, of which the"
"sacred marriage, enacted before the now wedded pair, was the full"
revelation[1492]. Again these preliminaries always included the
"solemn ablution[1493] of which I have spoken above, and in this"
resembled the preparations for admittance to the mysteries. Moreover
an instance is recorded in which this ablution was itself invested
with the significance of a wedding between the human and the divine.
The maidens of the Troad before marriage were wont to unrobe and bathe
themselves in the Scamander; and the prayer which they made to the
"river-god, whose bed they entered, was, ‘Receive thou, Scamander, my"
is one which repeats the idea which we have already seen expressed
"in the formulary of Cybele’s rites, ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυν[1506], ‘I"
"was privily admitted to the bridal chamber,’ and in the token of the"
"Sabazian mysteries, ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός[1507], ‘the god pressed to"
the bosom’; and Lucian’s final phrase in his account of Alexander’s
"mock-mysteries shows a kindred phrase, τὰ ὑπὸ κόλπου[1508], as an"
euphemism of the same kind[1509]. The Orphic therefore no less than
others based his claim to future happiness on the fact that he had
"performed a ritual act, of the nature of a sacrament, which constituted"
a pledge that the wedlock between him and his goddess foreshadowed here
should be consummated hereafter.
Even more abundant evidence is furnished by sepulchral monuments;
and in support of my views I cannot do better than quote two high
authorities who coincide in their verdict upon the meaning of the
scenes represented. In reference to those scenes ‘in which death
is conceived in the guise of a marriage’ Furtwängler writes: ‘The
"monuments belonging to this class are extraordinarily numerous, and"
exhibit very different methods of treating the idea which they carry
out. A relief upon a sarcophagus from the Villa Borghese shows the God
of the dead in the act of carrying down the fair Kore to be his bride
"in the lower world. Above the steeds of his chariot, which are already"
"disappearing into the depths of the earth, flies Eros as guide. The"
bride however appears to be going only under compulsion and after some
struggle; the look of the bridegroom expresses sternness rather than
gentleness; and the mother who sits with face averted seems to exclude
all thoughts of the daughter’s return. Only in the torches which the
"guide carries in his hand, in the snakes which are looking upward, and"
"in the observant attitude of Hecate, can a suggestion of the return be"
found.
‘On another sarcophagus--from Nazzara--which represents the same
"was again removed by angels during the night, and set down in the"
"Province of Ancona, near the eastern coast of Italy, on the ground"
"of a widow named _Laureta_. Hence the name, _Loretto_, given to the"
town which sprang up around it for the accommodation of the thousands
"of pilgrims who flocked thither, and which is now a place of some six"
"thousand inhabitants, whose principal business is begging and the sale"
"of rosaries, medals and images. In a niche inside the Casa Santa is a"
"small black image of the Virgin and Child, of cedar, attributed, of"
"course, to St. Luke. We did not visit Loretto, but at Bologna we had"
"the satisfaction of seeing a _fac-simile_ of the Casa Santa, with its"
"little window and fireplace, and the replica of St. Luke's handi-work"
"in the niche above. A large number of women, some of them handsomely"
"dressed, were saying their prayers and counting their beads before"
the altar that had been erected in front of these images and the Holy
"House, and a few were kneeling in the narrow space behind the altar,"
"close to the fireplace of the house. As we passed, one of these women,"
"in plainer garb, interrupted her devotions long enough to hold out her"
"hand to us, begging for pennies, but without rising from her knees."
"There was nothing unusual about this, except that this beggar made her"
"appeal to us while actually on her knees to the image of the Virgin,"
for nothing is more common in Italy than for visitors to a Roman
"Catholic church to pass through such ""an avenue of palms"" when leaving"
it.
[Sidenote: The Wonder-working Bones of St. Anne in Canada.]
"I had even seen a few relics, not mere reproductions like that of the"
"Casa Santa at Bologna, but the relics themselves. For instance, three"
"summers ago, when in Quebec, I had made a special trip to the Church"
"of St. Anne Beaupre, some twenty miles below the city, for the purpose"
"of seeing the wonder-working relics of St. Anne, the alleged mother"
of the Virgin Mary--a bit of her finger bone and a bit of her wrist
"poisonings, assassinations, massacres, death.""[17]"
"One may smile at such papal peccadilloes as the vanity of Paul II.,"
"who was chiefly remarkable for his personal beauty, and was so vain"
"of his appearance that, when he was elected Pope, he wished to take"
the name of Formosus. One may be amused at the intense self-esteem of
"Urban VIII., of whose spoliation of ancient Rome Pasquino says, ""Quod"
"non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini,"" and who, in the Barberini"
"palace, had the Virgin and angels represented as bringing in the"
"ornaments of the papacy at his coronation, and in another room a number"
"of the Barberini bees (the family crest) flocking against the sun, and"
eclipsing it--to symbolize the splendor of the family. But our feeling
"changes when we read that ""he issued a bull by which the name, estates"
"and privileges of his house might pass to any living male descendant,"
"legitimate or illegitimate, whether child of prince or priest,"" lest"
the family of Barberini might become absorbed in that of Colonna. And
we do not go far in our reading about such popes before the feeling of
"amusement yields to one of sadness, indignation and horror. We need"
"not insist upon the story of the female Pope Joan, who is said to have"
"secured her election to the papal throne disguised as a man, and to"
"have reigned two years as John VIII., and then to have died a shameful"
"death; for, notwithstanding the indisputable fact that till 1600 her"
head was included among the terra cotta representations of the other
"popes in the Cathedral of Sienna, and was inscribed ""Johannes VIII.,"
"Femina de Anglia,"" and that it was then changed into a head of Pope"
"Zacharias by the Grand Duke, at the request of Pope Clement VIII.,"
the story is now generally discredited. But there are many other
"facts, established beyond controversy, which explain fully the feeling"
of the great majority of the Italian people and the verdict of the
"accredited historians of the world. When the penitential Pope, Adrian"
"VI. (1522-'23), died of drinking too much beer, ""the house of his"
"physician was hung with garlands by midnight revellers, and decorated"
"their credit be it said, risked their prospects of advancement for the"
"principles of freedom. In their days Toryism, we must recollect, meant"
something very different from what it might be supposed to signify in
our own. It meant an attitude of obstruction as regards all change from
established standards of whatever kind; it signified a point of view
which said that grievances should be unredressed unless it was in its
interest to redress them. The new party of opposition included in its
"numbers Whig lawyers like Gibson Craig and Henry Erskine, in earlier"
"days, and Francis Jeffrey and Lord Cockburn later on; a party of"
"progress was also formed within the Church, and the same within the"
"precincts of the University. The movement, as became a movement on the"
"political side largely headed by lawyers, had no tendency to violence;"
"it was moderate in its policy, and by no means revolutionary--indeed it"
may be doubted whether there ever was much tendency to revolt even
amongst those working men who expressed themselves most strongly. The
"advance party, however, carried the day, and when Ferrier began to"
"write, Scotland was in a very different state from that of twenty years"
"before. The Reform Bill had passed, and men had the moulding of their"
country's destiny practically placed within their hands. In the
"University, again, Sir William Hamilton, a Whig, had just been"
"appointed to the Chair of Logic, while Moncreiff, Chalmers, and the"
"rest, were prominent in the Church. The traditions of literary"
Edinburgh at the beginning of the century had been kept up by a circle
"amongst whom Lockhart, Wilson, and De Quincey may be mentioned; now"
"Carlyle, who had left Edinburgh not long before, was coming into"
"notice, and a new era seemed to be dawning, not so glorious as the"
"past, but more untrammelled and more free."
"How philosophy was affected by the change, and how Ferrier assisted in"
"its progress, it is our business now to tell; but we must first briefly"
"sketch the history of Scottish speculation to this date, in order to"
show the position in which he found it.
the aristocracy and were especially appreciated as litter-bearers.[8] The
"imperial and municipal administrations, as well as the big contractors to"
"whom customs and the mines were farmed out, hired or bought them in large"
"numbers, and even in the remotest border provinces the _Syrus_ was found"
"serving princes, cities or private individuals. The worship of the Syrian"
goddess profited considerably by the economic current that continually
brought new worshipers. We find her mentioned in the first century of our
"era in a Roman inscription referring in precise terms to the slave market,"
"and we know that Nero took a devout fancy to the stranger that did not,"
"however, last very long.[9] In the popular Trastevere quarter she had a"
temple until the end of paganism.[10] {107}
"During the imperial period, however, the slaves were no longer the only"
"missionaries that came from Syria, and Atargatis was no longer the only"
divinity from that country to be worshiped in the Occident. The propagation
of the Semitic worship progressed for the most part in a different manner
under the empire.
"At the beginning of our era the Syrian merchants, _Syri negotiatores_,"
undertook a veritable colonization of the Latin provinces.[11] During the
second century before Christ the traders of that nation had established
"settlements along the coast of Asia Minor, on the Piraeus, and in the"
"Archipelago. At Delos, a small island but a large commercial center, they"
"maintained several associations that worshiped their national gods, in"
particular Hadad and Atargatis. But the wars that shook the Orient at the
"end of the republic, and above all the growth of piracy, ruined maritime"
commerce and stopped emigration. This began again with renewed vigor when
the establishment of the empire guaranteed the safety of the seas and when
the Levantine traffic attained a development previously unknown. We can
trace the history of the Syrian establishments in the Latin provinces from
"the first to the seventh century, and recently we have begun to appreciate"
"their economic, social and religious importance at its true value."
always follows it. He never swears[21] or calls names or uses ill words
"to companions. He is never peevish and fretful, always cheerful and"
good-tempered.”
VII.--_Stories of exaggerated and coarse fun._ In the chapter on the
positive side of this subject I shall speak more in detail of the
educational value of robust and virile representation of fun and of
"sheer nonsense, but as a representation to these statements, I should"
like to strike a note of warning about the element of exaggerated and
"coarse fun being encouraged in our school stories, partly because of"
the lack of humour in such presentations--a natural product of stifling
imagination--and partly because the train of the abnormal has the same
effect as the too frequent use of the melodramatic.
"You have only to read the adventures of Buster Brown, which for years"
"formed the Sunday reading of millions of children in the United States,"
to realise what would be the effect of coarse fun and entire absence
"of humour upon the normal child in its everyday experience, an effect"
all the greater because of the real skill with which the illustrations
are drawn. It is only fair to state that this series was not originally
"prepared or intended for the young, but it is a matter of regret"
(shared by most educationists in the States) that they should ever have
been given to children at all.
"In an article in _Macmillan's Magazine_, Dec. 1869, Miss Yonge writes:"
"“A taste for buffoonery is much to be discouraged, an exclusive taste"
for extravagance most unwholesome and even perverting. It becomes
destructive of reverence and soon degenerates into coarseness. It
"permits nothing poetical or imaginative, nothing sweet or pathetic to"
"exist, and there is a certain self-satisfaction and superiority in"
making game of what others regard with enthusiasm and sentiment which
absolutely bars the way against a higher or softer tone.”
beginning of each chapter: the Contents gives a general idea of the
divisions into which the author has separated his subject; the Topical
Analyses still further divide each chapter; and the Index is ordinarily
"still more minute, with the further advantage of having its references"
arranged in alphabetical order.
"The proper person to make an index is, first of all, the author of the"
"book, provided that he possesses the natural characteristics. It does"
"not at all naturally follow, however, that all authors are competent to"
"do this, for the art of indexing is not as simple as many superficially"
"suppose. The author should be the one best fitted, because he knows"
better than any reader the exact meaning each of his sentences is
"intended to convey,--and this meaning should be expressed in the"
"index. The ideal index is that which gives every topic, thought, or"
"reference contained in the book itself, without a single superfluous"
"word, and with no description or comment."
To make an index requires a quick grasp of the idea contained in each
"sentence or paragraph, an immediate discernment of the main thought,"
"an instinctive classification, absolute accuracy in translating this"
"thought into its briefest expression, ability to condense, and a"
sensing of the reader's needs in adequate cross-references. All this
demands a mind more logical and more sensitive to codified detail
"than is possessed by many able writers. Under these circumstances,"
it is desirable to place the making of the index in the hands of one
"possessing these qualifications, either instinctively or as a result of"
experience.
Every publishing-house and most printing establishments of any
"consequence are in a position to have indexes prepared when required,"
"but the danger is always present that the indexer, approaching his"
"subject from the outside, will fail to place himself sufficiently in"
The Christian Faith in England is no longer hampered by certain
arbitrary axioms of the Puritan Divines. In the sixteenth century men
were almost compelled by the exigencies of the situation to discover
some Infallible authority which they could set up over against the
"Infallibility of the Church of Rome, and they endeavoured to treat"
Holy Scripture as though the great library of Jewish and Christian
writers contained a complete code of consistent legislation. A text
"was a convincing argument for the Divine right of Kings, or for"
"binding them in chains, for the burning of witches or the destruction"
"of a shrine, and although in the two following centuries the"
"Protestant ministers taught men to modify this conception, and to"
"realize the difference between the Old Testament and the New, the"
popular idea of Revelation allowed small scope for theological
inquiry. The biographies of our literary men of the Victorian period
have shown us how they were tempted to separate themselves from all
"public communion with the Church, by their misgiving that the Church"
was committed to an impossible position. Carlyle groaned for what he
"called an “exit from Houndsditch,” some deliverance from the Rabbinic"
"interpretation and use of the Bible. Things are very different to-day,"
as Henry Sidgwick says in a letter to Alfred Lord Tennyson published
"by his son in a recent memoir. “The years pass, the struggle with what"
"Carlyle used to call ‘Hebrew old clothes’ is over, Freedom is won.”"
And in the result a scientific criticism of the Old and New Testament
"is found to be compatible with, and often a compulsion to an"
"acceptance of the Christian creed, not the creed of Calvin, or the"
"Westminster Confession, but the reasoned statement of Nicæa. The"
student of physical science no longer believes that if he goes to
"church he must be taken to accept the cosmogony of Genesis, and on his"
side he no longer stumbles at the difficulty of miraculous events. He
knows too much about the influence of mind over matter to say that it
is impossible that Jesus Christ and His Apostles should have healed
the paralytic and made the blind to see and the deaf to hear. He is no
"four-and-a-half millions of Dutch are Catholics; while in Belgium, where"
"there are hardly any Protestants, the Flemish-speaking and"
French-speaking populations are nearly equal in numbers.
"Van Kampen, who anticipated Motley in disparaging the Walloons as being"
"Frenchly fickle (_Geschichte_, i, 366), proceeds to contend that even"
the Flemings are more excitable than the Dutch and other Teutons; but he
notes later that as the Dutch poet Cats was much read and imitated in
"Belgium, he was thus proved to have expressed the spirit of the whole"
"Netherlands (ii, 109). Once more, then, the racial theory collapses.]"
"Thus the systematic savagery of the Inquisition under Philip, for which"
"the people at first blamed not at all the king but his Flemish minister,"
"Cardinal Granvelle, served rather to make a basis and pretext for"
organised revolt than directly to kindle it. In so far as the people
"spontaneously resorted to violence, in the image-breaking riots, they"
compromised and imperilled the nationalist movement in the act of
"precipitating it. The king's personal equation, finally, served to make"
"an enemy of the masterly William of Orange, who, financially embarrassed"
"like the lesser nobility,[777] could have been retained as an"
administrator by a wise monarch. A matter so overlaid with historical
declamation is hard to set in a clear light; but it may serve to say of
"William that he was made a ""patriot,"" as was Robert the Bruce, by stress"
of circumstances;[778] and that in the one case as in the other it was
exceptional character and capacity that made patriotism a success;[779]
William in particular having to maintain himself against continual
"domestic enmity, patrician as well as popular. Nothing short of the"
"ferocity and rapacity of the Spanish attack, indeed, could have long"
united the Netherlands. The first confederacy dissolved at the approach
"of Alva, who, strong in soldiership but incapable of a statesmanlike"
"settlement, drove the Dutch provinces to extremities by his cruelty,"
caused a hundred thousand artisans and traders to fly with their
"inclined to frolic away from chastity or integrity, much as did the"
county members who pocketed the bribes of Sir Robert Walpole and
prated of patriotism.
"Fortunately for society the man in the street is a very decent fellow,"
and generally finds out before long that Wisdom’s ways are ways of
pleasantness. A man may enjoy posing as an agnostic when he wants an
"excuse for--as the negro said--“doing what he dam please,” but when he"
"takes to himself a wife, and children are born to him, a certain"
anxiety as to the continuity and perpetuation of these relationships
"begins to show itself. A man who has lost a little child, or waited in"
"agonizing suspense to hear the physician’s verdict, when sickness"
"overshadows his home, discovers that he needs something beyond"
"negations, something that will bring life and immortality to light"
again within his soul.
"Moreover, the man in the street finds it necessary to come to some"
decision on other problems of existence. He is a citizen and must
needs exercise his enfranchisement and give his vote at an election
now and again. He must help to decide whether the State shall ignore
"religion and establish a system of ethical education, of which the"
"ultimate sanction is social convenience, or maintain the thesis that"
Creed and Character are mutually inter-dependent.
"As he pays his poor rate wrathfully, or with resignation, its annual"
increase reminds him of the necessity of curing or eliminating the
"unfit. When he reads of Belgian and Prussian colonial enterprise, or"
ponders on the perplexing problem of the Black Belt which the Southern
"States must solve, he is compelled to consider whether it is true"
that “God has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all
"the face of the earth,” or whether this shall be accounted as another"
of the delusions of Saul of Tarsus whom Governor Festus found to be
"Mission preacher will use his magnetic power, the artist whose skill"
"it is to build or to paint, will make his appeal to the love of order"
"and beauty, the musicians will meet the heart through the ear. May not"
the writer of fiction use his psychological training and his knowledge
of many sides of human life to create a story which shall set men
thinking about the old doctrines which he believes to have lost none
of their regenerating power?
There is danger lest men with good intentions should go blindly to
work to redress and diminish social grievances. Individualism with its
"hateful cry, “Each man for himself and the devil take the hindmost,”"
"is now at a discount, but it may be replaced by a despotism of State"
"regulation which will destroy the family and the home. There is, I"
"believe, only one creed which can make the capitalist unselfish and"
"the sons of labour satisfied, which will tell men that wealth means"
"responsibility and that there is dignity in toil, which will teach the"
rich man to order himself lowly and reverently to those who are _his_
"betters and to hurt nobody by word or deed, which will teach the"
"labourer that his chief need is not other men’s wealth, but the"
“carrière ouverte aux talents” and the determination to do his duty in
"that state of life, whatever it may be, unto which God _shall_ call"
him.
It is the Holy Catholic Faith which makes equality of opportunity for
"all men its earthly ambition, and offers refreshment and hope to those"
who are not strong enough to strive with the rest. The old men saw
"visions and we have found that they were prophecies, a young man may"
dream dreams. My dream is that the men who are doing the work of the
world to-day may be taught that Christ is their best teacher and the
Incarnate God their refuge and strength.
There is a tale of an acrobat and juggler who knew well that his
car likewise becomes a triumphal car.
‘Just as the marriage of Zeus in the realm of light became a type for
"men in this life, so the marriage of Hades, or of Dionysus representing"
"him, developed into a similar prototype for the dead. Since that which"
"is true of Death bears directly upon the actual dead, it was quite"
natural that gradually the process of death came to be considered in
general as a wedding with the deities of death. With this conception
too harmonize those wedding-scenes which are so common and conspicuous
"on funeral monuments, as well as the often-recurring scenes from the"
joyous cycle of Dionysus-myths[1510].’
"Two brief comments may be made upon this passage. First, Furtwängler"
"clearly recognises in Dionysus a mere substitute for Hades, and thus"
confirms my interpretation of the strange legend concerning Dionysus
and Prosymnus[1511]. We noticed that the somewhat obscure observation
of Heraclitus (as quoted by Clement) upon that story contained the
words ‘Dionysus and Hades are one and the same’; and we now see that
"in art too the same identification was made, and that the marriage of"
a mortal with Dionysus was used to typify the future marriage of the
dead with their gods. The reason for this identification seems simply
"to be that the cults in which the two gods figured, although differing"
"in outward form, were felt to express one and the same idea--namely the"
conception of death as a form of marriage; and the tendency to identify
"in such cases was carried so far that the god Dionysus was even, we are"
"told, identified with the mortal Adonis[1512], presumably because the"
"worship of each, as I have shown above, turned upon this one cardinal"
doctrine.
"Secondly, Furtwängler points out that the marriage of Zeus and Hera"
represented for living men the same doctrine as the marriage of Hades
and Persephone (or of Dionysus and Ariadne) represented for the dead.
The truth of this is well illustrated by the close resemblance between
to illustrate and to inculcate the doctrine of the marriage of men
"and gods, the information given by Clement with respect to the ritual"
makes it clear that such was their object. But in that other rite of
"the same goddess, that namely which celebrated the story of Adonis,"
the whole _motif_ of the drama was the continuance of Aphrodite’s love
"for him after his death, a love so strong that it prevailed upon the"
gods of the lower world to let him return for half of every year to
"the upper world and the arms of his mistress. Here, though expressed"
"in different imagery, is the same doctrine as that which underlay the"
"drama of Eleusis. Here again is an illustration, or rather, for those"
"who were capable of religious ecstasy, a proof, of the doctrine that"
"the dead yet lived, and in that life were both in body and in soul one"
with their gods. For ‘thrice-beloved Adonis who even in Acheron is
beloved[1458]’ was the type and forerunner of all those who had part in
his mysteries.
In another version this legend of Adonis is brought into even closer
relation with the Eleusinian mysteries by the introduction of
"Persephone[1459]. To her is assigned the part of a rival to Aphrodite,"
and being equally enamoured of the beautiful Adonis she is glad of his
"death whereby he is torn from the arms of Aphrodite in the upper world,"
and enters the chamber of the nether world where her love in turn may
"have its will; but in the end Aphrodite descends to the house of Hades,"
and a compact is arranged between the two goddesses by which each in
turn may possess Adonis for half the year. This version of the story is
"cruder, but its teaching is obviously the same--Adonis, the favourite"
"of heaven in this life, and the precursor of all who by initiation in"
"the mysteries win heaven’s favour, survives in the lower world with"
"both body and soul unimpaired by death, and is admitted to wedlock with"
the great goddess of the dead.
The same doctrine again seems to have been the basis of certain
"industry and capital, exasperated even the Catholic ministers in"
"Flanders by his proposed taxes, and finally by imposing them enraged"
"into fresh revolt the people he had crushed and terrorised, till they"
were eager to offer the sovereignty to the queen of England. When
"Requesens came with pacificatory intentions, it was too late; and the"
Pacification of Ghent (1576) was but a breathing-space between grapples.
What finally determined the separation and independence of the Dutch
"Provinces was their maritime strength. Antwerp, trading largely on"
"foreign bottoms, represented wealth without the then indispensable"
weapons. Dutch success begins significantly with the taking of Brill
"(1572) by the gang of William van der Marck, mostly pirates and"
"ruffians, whose methods William of Orange could not endure.[780] But"
they had shown the military basis for the maritime States. It was the
"Dutch fleet that prevented Parma's from joining ""the"" Armada under"
"Medina-Sidonia,[781] thereby perhaps saving England. Such military"
genius and energy as Parma's might have made things go hard with the
"Dutch States had he lived, or had he not been called off against his"
judgment to fight in France; but his death well balanced the
"assassination of William of Orange, who had thus far been the great"
sustainer and welder of the movement of independence. Plotted against
"and vilified by the demagogues of Ghent, betrayed by worthless fellow"
"nobles, Teutonic and French alike; chronically insulted in his own"
"person and humiliated in that of his brother John, whom the States"
treated with unexampled meanness; stupidly resisted in his own
"leadership by the same States, whose egoism left Maestricht to its fate"
"when he bade them help, and who cast on him the blame when it fell;"
thwarted and crippled by the fanaticism and intolerant violence of the
Protestant mobs of the towns; bereaved again and again in the
"vicissitude of the struggle, William turned to irrelevance all"
imputations of self-seeking; and in his unfailing sagacity and fortitude
he finally matches any aristocrat statesman in history. Doubtless he
From ocean to ocean the territory which is called the Canal Zone is
"about forty-three miles long, ten miles wide and contains about 436"
"square miles, about ninety-five of which are under the waters of the"
"Canal, and Miraflores and Gatun Lakes. It is bounded on the north by the"
"Caribbean Sea, on the south by the Pacific Ocean, and on the east and"
west by the Republic of Panama. It traverses the narrowest part of
"Panama, the waist so to speak, and has been taken out of that body"
politic by the diplomatic surgeons as neatly as though it had been an
obnoxious vermiform appendix. Its territory does not terminate at low
"water-mark, but extends three marine miles out to sea, and, as I write,"
a question of jurisdiction has arisen between the two Republics--hardly
twin Republics--of Panama and the United States concerning jurisdiction
over three malefactors captured by the Zone police in a motor boat out
at sea. It may be noted in passing that Panama is properly tenacious of
"its rights and dignity, and that cases of conflicting jurisdiction are"
continually arising when any offender has only to foot it a mile or two
to be out of the territory in which his offense was committed. The
police officials of the Zone affect to think that the Panama authorities
are inclined to deal lightly with native offenders who commit robbery or
murder on the Zone and then stroll across the line to be arrested in
their native State.
[Illustration: A SQUAD OF CANAL ZONE POLICE OFFICERS]
There was a quarrel on while I was on the Zone over the custody of a
"Panamanian who killed his wife, with attendant circumstances of"
"peculiar brutality, and then balked the vengeance of the Zone criminal"
authorities by getting himself arrested in Panama. “We want to show
"these fellows”, remarked a high police official of the Zone, “that if"
they do murder in our territory we are going to do the hanging”. That
[Sidenote: The Chapel of the Great Relic.]
"At last one of the priests, attended by an acolyte, took up a censer,"
"placed a little incense on the coals with a teaspoon, and, swinging it"
"in his hand by the chain, led us back into the cathedral, turned to"
"a chapel on the left, unlocked an iron gate in a tall railing which"
"separated this chapel from the body of the building, closed the gate"
"again when our party had come inside, and, while a dozen or so of"
the people who had been at their devotions crowded up to the railing
"and peered curiously through, he and his attendant began to kneel"
repeatedly before the altar and to swing the smoking censer on every
"side. Above the altar was a strong, square steel box, over which, in"
"plain view, was suspended a _fac-simile_ of the Iron Crown, made of"
"cheaper materials, while the real crown was still concealed within the"
steel safe.
[Sidenote: The Great Relic itself.]
"Handing the censer to his attendant, that it might be kept swinging"
"without intermission, the priest produced another series of keys and"
proceeded to unlock a succession of small doors in the side of the
"metal safe, which proved to be a ""nest"" of caskets, one within another,"
"the last of which was a glass case. Drawing this out, he brought into"
"full view the venerated crown of the Lombard kings, and told us to step"
up on the stool by the altar so as to see it better. It is made of six
"plates of gold, joined end to end, richly chased, and set with splendid"
"jewels. But one would see at a glance that neither the material, nor"
"the workmanship, nor the gems, could account for the unique reverence"
"with which it has been regarded for centuries, and an indication of"
which we had just seen in the service conducted by the priest. Among
"the regalia in the Tower of London, and at several other places in"
"continuance of the severer medieval destructive checks. They must,"
"therefore, have put a high degree of restraint on marriage, and probably"
observed parental prudence in addition.
"When it is found that in Sweden, where the conditions and usages were"
"once similar, there was latterly at once less prudential restraint on"
"marriage and population, and a lower standard of material well-being,"
the two cases are seen to furnish a kind of _experimentum crucis_. The
comparatively late maintenance of a powerful military system in Sweden
having there prolonged the methods of aristocratic and bureaucratic
"control while they were being modified in Denmark-Norway, Swedish"
population in the eighteenth century was subject to artificial stimulus.
"From about the year 1748, the Government set itself, on the ordinary"
"empirical principle of militarism, to encourage population.[700] Among"
its measures were the variously wise ones of establishing medical
"colleges and lying-in and foundling hospitals, the absolute freeing of"
"the internal trade in grain, and the withdrawal in 1748 of an old law"
limiting the number of persons allowed to each farm. The purpose of that
law had been to stimulate population by spreading tillage; but the spare
"soil being too unattractive, the young people emigrated. On the law"
"being abolished, population did increase considerably, rising between"
"1751 and 1800 from 1,785,727 to 2,347,308,[701] though some severe"
"famines had occurred within the period. But in the year 1799, when"
"Malthus visited the country, the increased population suffered from"
"famine very severely indeed, living mainly and miserably on bark"
bread.[702] It was one of Malthus's great object-lessons in his science.
On one side a poor country was artificially over-populated; on the
"other, the people of Norway, an even poorer country, directly and"
"indirectly[703] restrained their rate of increase, while the Government"
during a long period wrought to the same end by the adjustment of its
military system and by making a certificate of earning power or income
"necessary for all marriages.[704] The result was that, save in the"
"“Panama” was first attached to them years ago, because their chief"
"market was found in Panama City, whence they were distributed to more"
northern countries. The palm of which they are made however grows
generally in Panama and the government has established in the Chiriqui
province a school in which native boys are taught the art of hat making.
In the National Institute at Panama City there is also a government
trades school where boys are given a three years’ course in the elements
of the carpenters’ and machinists’ trades. Indeed the rulers of the
"Republic, which was so abruptly created, deserve great credit for the"
steps they are taking for the creation of a general system of public
"education, both literary and practical. The school system is not yet on"
"a par with that of states of longer existence, nor will it in all"
probability ever quite conform to more northern ideas of an educational
"establishment. For example, the National Institute is closed to girls,"
who for their higher education are limited to the schools maintained by
"the church. A normal school, however, in which girls are prepared for"
teaching in the primary grades is maintained with about 125 students.
The school system of Panama must be regarded merely as a nucleus from
which a larger organism may grow. Yet when one recalls the state of
society which has resulted from revolutions in other Central American
"states, one is impelled to a certain admiration for the promptitude with"
which the men who erected the Republic of Panama gave thought to the
educational needs of people. They were suddenly put in authority over an
"infant state which had no debt, but, on the contrary, possessed a"
"capital of $10,000,000 equivalent to about $30 for every man, woman and"
"child of its population. Instead of creating an army, buying a navy and"
thus wasting the money on mere militarism which appeals so strongly to
"the Latin-American mind, they organized a civil government, equipped it"
"with the necessary buildings, established a university and laid the"
foundation of a national system of education.

in the revolutionary epoch and to his own exceptional endowments.
"Evidently, then, the characteristics of his family claim some"
attention from all who would understand the man and the influence
which he was to wield over modern Europe.
It has been the fortune of his House to be the subject of dispute from
first to last. Some writers have endeavoured to trace its descent back
"to the Cæsars of Rome, others to the Byzantine Emperors; one"
"genealogical explorer has tracked the family to Majorca, and, altering"
"its name to Bonpart, has discovered its progenitor in the Man of the"
"Iron Mask; while the Duchesse d'Abrantès, voyaging eastwards in quest"
"of its ancestors, has confidently claimed for the family a Greek"
origin. Painstaking research has dispelled these romancings of
"historical _trouveurs_, and has connected this enigmatic stock with a"
"Florentine named ""William, who in the year 1261 took the surname of"
"_Bonaparte_ or _Buonaparte_. The name seems to have been assumed when,"
amidst the unceasing strifes between Guelfs and Ghibellines that rent
"the civic life of Florence, William's party, the Ghibellines, for a"
brief space gained the ascendancy. But perpetuity was not to be found
in Florentine politics; and in a short time he was a fugitive at a
"Tuscan village, Sarzana, beyond the reach of the victorious Guelfs."
"Here the family seems to have lived for well nigh three centuries,"
maintaining its Ghibelline and aristocratic principles with surprising
"tenacity. The age was not remarkable for the virtue of constancy, or"
any other virtue. Politics and private life were alike demoralized by
"unceasing intrigues; and amidst strifes of Pope and Emperor, duchies"
"and republics, cities and autocrats, there was formed that type of"
Italian character which is delineated in the pages of Macchiavelli.
From the depths of debasement of that cynical age the Buonapartes
"were saved by their poverty, and by the isolation of their life at"
Sarzana. Yet the embassies discharged at intervals by the more
talented members of the family showed that the gifts for intrigue were
"communions.[38] Towards the end of the empire, moral ideas were"
particularly connected with the assimilation of sacred liquor and meats
taken from the tambourine and cymbal of Attis. They became the staff of the
spiritual life and were to sustain the votary in his trials; at that period
"he considered the gods as especially ""the guardians of his soul and"
"thoughts.""[39]"
"As we see, every modification of the conception of the world and of man in"
the society of the empire had its reflection in the doctrine of the
mysteries. Even the conception of the old deities of Pessinus was
constantly changing. When astrology and the Semitic religions caused the
"establishment of a solar henotheism as the leading religion at Rome, Attis"
"was considered as the sun, ""the shepherd of the twinkling stars."" He was"
"identified with Adonis, Bacchus, Pan, Osiris and Mithra; he was made a"
"""polymorphous""[40] being in which all celestial powers manifested {70}"
themselves in turn; a _pantheos_ who wore the crown of rays and the lunar
"crescent at the same time, and whose various emblems expressed an infinite"
multiplicity of functions.
"When neo-Platonism was triumphing, the Phrygian fable became the"
traditional mould into which subtle exegetists boldly poured their
philosophic speculations on the creative and stimulating forces that were
"the principles of all material forms, and on the deliverance of the divine"
soul that was submerged in the corruption of this earthly world. In his
"hazy oration on the Mother of the Gods, Julian lost all notion of reality"
on account of his excessive use of allegory and was swept away by an
extravagant symbolism.[41]
Any religion as susceptible to outside influences as this one was bound to
yield to the ascendancy of Christianity. From the explicit testimony of
ecclesiastical writers we know that attempts were made to oppose the
Phrygian mysteries to those of the church. It was maintained that the
the gas leaped into flame.
The old attic was gone.
In its place was a picturesque medieval room of quaint nooks and
"demure corners, with stiff wooden settles of curving line against the"
"wall, and low bookshelves round the rest of the walls; and above, on a"
"deep coloured frieze under the low ceiling, was a long space of rigid"
"trees from the land of Morris, green trees that yielded vasty purple"
and golden fruits on close-bunched foliage--and in the blue intervals
between the stilted trees sailed white-sailed many-coloured galleons
and purple triremes--and on the wall beneath the frieze and above
the long curves of the low bookshelves was a yellow space splashed
"with huge orange-coloured dogs, with emerald eyes and scarlet mouths,"
that leaped along on hind legs to the chasing of each other and an
occasional orange stag amidst mighty flowering plants that seemed
"to whirl in autumn tints with cunning running lines half-flower,"
"half-leaf. And here and there was a knight in armour, and a hawk upon"
"his wrist, and clothes upon his horse, and about him was always written"
_Soe sirre Gallahydde gotte hyme pryckynge to hys pilgrymmynges_; and
when the knight was faded blue the writing was russet green; but when
the knight was russet green the writing about him was faded blue. And
"here and there was a lady with hair in plait, and she wove at a loom,"
"and sang with ruddy lips, and the writing about her was _Chaunted the"
Queene ande weaved hyre tale righte Fyttyngelye_; and when the queen
"was orange yellow the writing was white, and when the queen was white"
"the writing was orange yellow. The old bookshelves, with their gay"
"untidiness of many-coloured books, were gone; and in their place in"
more severe order on dark oaken bookshelves of suave design were ranked
books all bound exactly alike in uniform yellow half-calf bindings. The
"floor was rich-stained and polished, and in the middle of it lay a rug"
of the yellow of saffron.
"Villiers flashed back an amused, responsive glance, and then"
conscientiously strove to pay more attention to the irrepressible
"feminine philologist beside him, determining to take her, as he said to"
"himself, by way of penance for his unremembered sins. After a while"
"there came one of those extraordinary, sudden rushes of gabble that"
"often occur at even the stiffest dinner-party,--a galloping race of"
"tongues, in which nothing really distinct is heard, but in which each"
talks to the other as though moved by an impulse of sheer desperation.
This burst of noise was a relief after the strained murmurs of trite
"commonplaces that had hitherto been the order of the hour, and the fair"
"Duchess, somewhat easier in her mind, turned anew to Alwyn, with"
greater grace and gentleness of manner than she had yet shown.
"""I am afraid,"" she said smilingly, ""you must find us all very stupid"
"after your travels abroad? In England we ARE dull,--our tristesse"
"cannot be denied. But, really, the climate is responsible,--we want"
"more sunshine. I suppose in the East, where the sun is so warm and"
"bright, the people are always cheerful?"""
"""On the contrary, I have found them rather serious and contemplative"
"than otherwise,"" returned Alwyn,--""yet their gravity is certainly of a"
"pleasant, and not of a forbidding type. I don't myself think the sun"
"has much to do with the disposition of man, after all,--I fancy his"
"temperament is chiefly moulded by the life he leads. In the East, for"
"instance, men accept their existence as a sort of divine command, which"
"they obey cheerfully, yet with a consciousness of high"
"responsibility:--on the Continent they take it as a bagatelle, lightly"
"won, lightly lost, hence their indifferent, almost childish,"
"gayety;--but in Great Britain""--and he smiled,--""it looks nowadays as"
"if it were viewed very generally as a personal injury and bore,--a kind"
of title bestowed without the necessary money to keep it up! And this
"money people set themselves steadily to obtain, with many a weary grunt"
"responsibility. You will find this difficult,--as the virtue implied is"
"intangible, unseeable;--one cannot say of it, lo here!--or lo"
there!--it is as complicated and subtle as any other of the
manifestations of pure Spirit. Then you must decide on one universal
"standard, or reasonable conception of what 'morality' is. Again, you"
"are met by a crowd of perplexities,--as every nation, and every tribe,"
has a totally different idea of the same thing. In some countries it is
"'moral' to have many wives; in others, to drown female children; in"
"others, to solemnly roast one's grandparents for dinner! Supposing,"
"however, that you succeed, with the aid of all the philosophers,"
"teachers, and scientists, in drawing up a practical Code of"
Morality--do you not think an enormous majority will be found to ask
you by whose authority you set forth this Code?--and by what right you
"deem it necessary to enforce it? You may say, 'By the authority of"
Knowledge and by the right of Morality'--but since you admit to there
"being no spiritual or divine inspiration for your law, you will be"
"confronted by a legion of opponents who will assure you, and probably"
"with perfect justice, that their idea of morality is as good as yours,"
"and their knowledge as excellent,--that your Code appears to them"
"faulty in many respects, and that, therefore, they purpose making"
"another one, more suited to their liking. Thus, out of your one famous"
"Moral System would spring thousands of others, formed to gratify the"
"various tastes of different individuals, precisely in the same manner"
as sects have sprung out of the wholly unnecessary and foolish human
arguments on Christianity;--only that there would lack the one
"indestructible, pure Selfless Example that even the most quarrelsome"
"bigot must inwardly respect,--namely, Christ Himself. And 'morality'"
would remain exactly where it is:--neither better nor worse for all the
trouble taken concerning it. It needs something more than the 'moral'
"sense to rightly ennoble man,--it needs the SPIRITUAL sense;--the"
"fostering of the INSTINCTIVE IMMORTAL ASPIRATION OF THE CREATURE, to"
"make him comprehend the responsibility of his present life, as a"

"The most interesting feature was offered by the temperature, as this was"
very liable to lead one astray. A primary rise always occurred with the
"collection of blood in the pleura, this reaching its height on the third"
"or fourth day, usually about 102° F. in well-marked cases; it then fell,"
"and in favourable instances remained normal. In a large number of cases,"
"however, where the amount of blood was considerable, this was not the"
"case, the primary fall not reaching the normal, and a second rise"
occurred which reached the same height as before or higher. The second
"rise was accompanied by sweating, quickened pulse, and the probability"
of the development of an empyema had always to be considered. I believe
in most cases this secondary rise was an indication of a further
"increase in the hæmorrhage, for the dulness usually increased in extent,"
and such rises were often seen when the patient had been moved or taken
"a journey. Again, the temperature often fell to normal after"
"paracentesis and removal of the blood, to rise again with a fresh"
"accumulation, which was not uncommon. I have already mentioned the large"
proportional incidence of hæmothorax observed in the patients who had
"to travel down from Paardeberg, and I might instance another case"
"related to me by Dr. Flockemann of the German ambulance, which was very"
"striking. A Boer, wounded at Colesberg, developed a hæmothorax which"
"quieted down, and he was removed to Bloemfontein; on arrival at the"
"latter place the temperature rose, and other signs of fever suggested"
"the development of an empyema; an exploring needle, however, only"
brought blood to light. After a short stay at Bloemfontein the symptoms
"entirely subsided, and the man was sent to Kroonstadt, when an exactly"
"similar attack resulted, again quieting down with rest."
"Similar recurrent attacks of hæmorrhage and fever occurred, however, in"
patients confined to their beds without moving after the first journey.
being largely determined by the nature of the voice and of the things it
"uttered: it would, further, be quite easy to enter into conversation with"
the person we had thus constructed. That is what seems to occur in dreams.
"We hear a voice behind the curtain of darkness, and to fit that voice and"
"the things it utters we instinctively form a picture which, in virtue of"
"the hallucinatory aptitude of sleep, is thrown against the curtain; it is"
then quite easy to enter into conversation with the person we have thus
constructed. It no more occurs to us during sleep to suppose that the
"voice we hear is only a voice and nothing more, than it would occur to us"
awake to suppose that the voice behind the curtain is only a voice and
nothing more. The process is the same; the difference is that in dreams we
"are, without knowing it, living among what from the waking point of view"
are called hallucinations.
This process by which dreams are formed in sleeping consciousness
through the splitting of the dreamer's personality for the construction
of other personalities has been recognised ever since dreams began to
be seriously studied. Maury referred to the scission of personality in
dreams.[168] Delboeuf dealt with what he termed the altruising by the
dreamer of part of his representations.[169] Foucault terms the same
process personalisation.[170] Giessler attempts elaborately to explain
the enigma of self-diremption--the formation of a secondary self--in
"dreams; if, he argues, a touch or other sensation exceeds the dream-body's"
"capacity of adaptation--_i.e._, if the state of stimulus is above the"
apperceptive threshold--only one part of the perception is referred to the
dream-body and the other is transferred to a secondary self.[171] This
"explanation, while it very fairly covers the presentative class of dreams,"
"directly connected with sensory stimuli, cannot so easily be applied to"
"the dramatisation of our representative dreams, which are not obviously"
traceable to direct bodily stimulation.
The splitting up of personality is indeed a very pronounced and widely
"trade, they had become at the date of their assured independence the"
chief trading State in the world. Whatever commercial common sense the
world had yet acquired was there in force. And inasmuch as the wealth
"and strength of these almost landless States, with their mostly poor"
"soil and unavoidably heavy imposts, depended so visibly on quantity of"
"trade turnover, they not only continued to offer a special welcome to"
"all immigrants, but gradually learned to forego the congenial Protestant"
strife of sects. It was indeed a reluctantly-learned lesson. Even as
local patriotisms constantly tended to hamper unity during the very
"period of struggle, so the primary spirit of self-assertion set the"
ruling Calvinistic party upon persecuting not only Catholics and
"Lutherans, but the new heresy of Arminianism:[785] so little does"
"""patriotic"" warfare make for fraternity in peace. The judicial murder of"
the statesman John van Olden Barneveldt (1619) at the hands of Maurice
"of Orange, whom he had guarded in childhood and trained to"
"statesmanship, was accomplished as a sequel to the formal proscription"
of the Arminian heresy in the Synod of Dort; and Barneveldt was formally
"condemned for ""troubling God's Church"" as well as on the charge of"
treason.[786] On the same pretexts Grotius was thrown into prison; and
the freedom of the press was suspended.[787] It was doubtless the shame
of the memory of the execution of Barneveldt (the true founder of the
"Republic as such),[788] on an absolutely false charge of treason, and"
"the observation of how, as elsewhere, persecution drove away population,"
that mainly wrought for the erection of tolerance (at least as between
Protestant sects) into a State principle.
"The best side of the Dutch polity was its finance, which was a lesson to"
"all Europe. Already in the early stages of the struggle with Spain, the"
"States were able on credit to make war, in virtue of their character for"
"commercial honour. Where the king of Spain, with all his revenues"
"mortgaged past hope,[789] got from the Pope an absolution from the"
payment of interest on the sums borrowed from Spanish and Genoese
"suppressed, perhaps because of his great humility, was informed in a"
"vision that the emperor alluded to was Diocletian, and at the same"
time the torments and persecutions suffered by the Christian virgin
"Filomena, as well as her wonderful constancy, were also revealed to"
"him. There were some difficulties in the way of the Emperor Diocletian,"
which _incline_ the writer of the _historical_ account to incline
to the opinion that the young artist in his wisdom _may_ have made
"a mistake, and that the emperor may have been not Diocletian, but"
"Maximian. The facts, however, now admitted of no doubt; the relics"
were carried by the priest Francesco da Lucia to Naples; they were
enclosed in a case of wood resembling in form the human body; this
"figure was habited in a petticoat of white satin, and over it a crimson"
tunic after the Greek fashion; the face was painted to represent
"nature, a garland of flowers was placed on the head, and in the hands"
"a lily and a javelin with the point reversed, to express her purity"
and her martyrdom; then she was laid in a half-sitting posture in a
"sarcophagus, of which the sides were glass, and, after lying for some"
time in state in the chapel of the Torres family in the Church of Sant'
"Angiolo, she was carried in grand procession to Mugnano, a little town"
"about twenty miles from Naples, amid the acclamations of the people,"
working many and surprising miracles by the way.... Such is the legend
"of S. Filomena, and such the authority on which she has become within"
"the last twenty years one of the most popular saints in Italy.""--_Mrs."
"Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 671."
"But, after all, the most extraordinary case of saint-manufacture is"
"not that of Philomena, but that of _Buddha_! I have not room for the"
"story here, but if any one wishes to know how the papacy made Buddha a"

"""Then you have never thought,"" went on Villiers, with a thrill of"
"earnestness in his manly, vibrating voice--""that it might be quite as"
"impossible to 'interview' a great Poet?--who, if great indeed, is in"
every way as royal as any Sovereign that ever adorned a throne! I do
"not speak of petty verse-writers,--I say a great Poet, by which term I"
imply a great creative genius who is honestly faithful to his high
vocation. Such an one could no more tell you his methods of work than a
"rainbow could prattle about the way it shines,--and as for his personal"
"history, I should like to know by what right society is entitled to pry"
"into the sacred matters of a man's private life, simply because he"
happens to be famous? I consider the modern love of prying and probing
into other people's affairs a most degrading and abominable sign of the
"times,--it is morbid, unwholesome, and utterly contemptible. Moreover,"
I think that writers who consent to be 'interviewed' condemn themselves
"as literary charlatans, unworthy of the profession they have wrongfully"
"adopted. You see I have the courage of my opinions on this matter,--in"
"fact, I believe, if every one were to speak their honest mind openly, a"
"better state of things might be the result, and 'interviewing' would"
"gradually come to be considered in its true light, namely, as a vulgar"
"and illegitimate method of advertisement. I mean no disrespect to you,"

the 'interviewer' open to you. I can scarcely imagine such work to be

"inaudible polite murmurs, while the ""Tiger-Lily"" marched steadily"
toward the door.
"""Oh dear, no, I am not in the least offended!"" she retorted"
"contemptuously,--""On the contrary, this has been a most amusing"
what it was to so many of the youth of the country from which it
"came--the expression of their deepest, and likewise of their freshest"
aspiration. The poetry of other countries and other tongues--English
"and Latin, for example--meant much to him, but that of Germany was"
nearest to his heart. French learning did not attract him; neither its
literature nor its metaphysics and psychological method appealed to his
"thoughtful, analytic mind; but in Germany he found a nation which had"
not as yet resigned its interest in things of transcendental import in
favour of what pertained to mere material welfare.
"Such was the Germany into which Ferrier came in 1834. He did not, so"
"far as we can hear, enter deeply into its social life; he visited it as"
"a traveller, rather than as a student, and his stay in it was brief."
"Considering the shortness of his time there, and the circumstances of"
"his visit, the impression that it made upon him is all the more"
"remarkable, for it was an impression that lasted and was evident"
"throughout all his after life. Since his day, indeed, it would be"
difficult to say how many young Scotsmen have been impressed in a
similar way by a few months' residence at a University town in Germany.
"For partly owing to Ferrier's own efforts, and perhaps even more owing"
"to the 'boom'--to use a vulgarism--brought about by Carlyle's writings,"
and by his first making known the marvels of German literature to the
"ordinary English-speaking public, who had never learned the language or"
"tried to understand its recent history, the old traditional literary"
alliance between Scotland and France appeared for the time being to
have broken down in favour of a similar association with its rival
"country, Germany. The work of Goethe was at last appreciated, nothing"
was now too favourable to say about its merits; philosophy was suddenly
"discovered to have its home in Germany, and there alone; our insularity"
"in keeping to our antiquated methods--dryasdust, we were told, as the"
"old ones of the schools, and perhaps as edifying--was vigorously"
"denounced. Theology, which had hitherto found complete support from the"
"Attis, or Papas, was regarded as her husband, but the first place in this"
"divine household belonged to the woman, a reminiscence of the period of"
matriarchy.[4]
When the Phrygians at a very early period came from Thrace and inserted
"themselves like a wedge in the old Anatolian races, they adopted the vague"
"deities of their new country by identifying them with their own, after the"
habit of pagan nations. Thus Attis became one with the Dionysus-Sabazius of
"the conquerors, or at least assumed some of his characteristics. This"
Thracian Dionysus was a god of vegetation. Foucart has thus admirably
"pictured his savage nature: ""Wooded summits, deep oak and pine forests,"
ivy-clad caverns were at all times his favorite haunts. Mortals who were
anxious to know the powerful divinity ruling these solitudes had to observe
"the life of his kingdom, {49} and to guess the god's nature from the"
phenomena through which he manifested his power. Seeing the creeks descend
"in noisy foaming cascades, or hearing the roaring of steers in the uplands"
"and the strange sounds of the wind-beaten forests, the Thracians thought"
"they heard the voice and the calls of the lord of that empire, and imagined"
a god who was fond of extravagant leaps and of wild roaming over the wooded
"mountains. This conception inspired their religion, for the surest way for"
"mortals to ingratiate themselves with a divinity was to imitate him, and as"
far as possible to make their lives resemble his. For this reason the
Thracians endeavored to attain the divine delirium that transported their
"Dionysus, and hoped to realize their purpose by following their invisible"
"yet ever-present lord in his chase over the mountains.""[5]"
"In the Phrygian religion we find the same beliefs and rites, scarcely"
"modified at all, with the one difference that Attis, the god of vegetation,"
"was united to the goddess of the earth instead of living ""in sullen"
"loneliness."" When the tempest was beating the forests of the Berecyntus or"
"Ida, it was Cybele traveling about in her car drawn by roaring lions"
mourning her lover's death. A crowd of worshipers followed her through
Yet in this posture of things there had grown up a burden which
"represented, in the warring commercial State, the persistent principle"
of class parasitism; for at the Peace of Münster (1648) the funded
public debt of the province of Holland alone amounted to nearly
"150,000,000 florins, bearing interest at five per cent.[797] Of this"
"annual charge, the bulk must have gone into the pockets of the wealthier"
"citizens, who had thus secured a mortgage on the entire industry of the"
"nation. All the while, Holland was nominally rich in ""possessions"""
"beyond sea. When, in 1580, Philip annexed Portugal, with which the Dutch"
had hitherto carried on a profitable trade for the eastern products
"brought as tribute to Lisbon, they began to cast about for an Asiatic"
"trade of their own, first seeking vainly for a north-east passage. The"
"need was heightened when in 1586 Philip, who as a rule ignored the"
"presence of Dutch traders in his ports under friendly flags, arrested"
all the Dutch shipping he could lay hands on;[798] and when in 1594 he
"closed to them the port of Lisbon, he forced them to a course which his"
successors bitterly rued. In 1595 they commenced trading by the Cape
"passage to the Indies, and a fleet sent out by Spain to put down their"
enterprise was as usual defeated.[799] Then arose a multitude of
"companies for the East Indian trade, which in 1602 were formed by the"
"government into a great semi-official joint-stock concern, at once"
"commercial and military, reminiscent of the Hanseatic League. The result"
was a long series of settlements and conquests. Amboyna and the Moluccas
"were seized from the Portuguese, now subordinate to Spain; Java, where a"
"factory was founded in 1597, was in the next generation annexed; Henry"
"Hudson, an English pilot in the Dutch Company's service, discovered the"
"Hudson River and Bay in 1609, and founded New Amsterdam about 1624. In"
"1621 was formed the Dutch West India Company, which in fifteen years"
"fitted out 800 ships of trade and war, captured 545 from the Spanish and"
"Portuguese, with cargoes valued at 90,000,000 florins, and conquered the"
greater part of what had been the Portuguese empire in Brazil.
"of Burgundy, after her father's overthrow by the Swiss; again in the"
case of her husband Maximilian after her death; and previously in the
"reaffirmation of the ill-observed Laws of Cortenberg, secured from the"
Duke of Brabant by the Louvainers in 1372; but they could never deliver
"themselves from the feudal superstition, never evolve the republican"
"ideal. When the rich citizens exploited the poor, it was the local"
"sovereign's cue, as of old, to win the populace; whereupon the"
"patricians leant to the over-lord, were he even the King of France; or"
it might be that the local lord himself sought the intervention of his
"suzerain, who again was at times the first to meddle, and against whom,"
"as against rival potentates, the cities would at times fight desperately"
"for their recognised head, when he was not overtaxing or thwarting them,"
or endangering their commerce.[754] It was a medley of clashing
"interests, always in unstable equilibrium. And so when sovereign powers"
"on a great scale, as the Dukes of Burgundy, followed by the Archduke"
"Maximilian, and later by the Emperor Charles, came into the inheritance"
"of feudal prestige, the Dutch and Flemish cities became by degrees"
"nearly as subordinate as those of France and Germany, losing one by one"
their municipal privileges.[755] The monarchic superstition overbore the
passions of independence and primary interest; and a strong feudal ruler
could count on a more general and durable loyalty than was ever given to
"any citizen-statesman. James van Arteveldt, who guided Ghent in the"
"fourteenth century, and whose policy was one of alliance with the"
"English king against the French, the feudal over-lord, was ""the greatest"
"personality Flanders ever produced.""[756] But though Arteveldt's policy"
"was maintained even by his murderers, murdered he was by his"
"fellow-citizens, as the great De Witt was to be murdered in Holland"
three hundred years later. The monarchised Netherlanders were
"republicans only in the last resort, as against insupportable tyranny."
"Philip of Burgundy, who heavily oppressed them, they called ""The Good."""
"At the end of the fifteenth century Maximilian was able, even before he"
"became Emperor, not only to crush the ""bread-and-cheese"" rebellion of"
"of this combination, and any slight thoracic disturbance even in healthy"
"persons, arising from heart or stomach, and acting on the respiration,"
serves to bring these conditions to sleeping consciousness and to
determine the dream of flying.
"Dreams of flying are sometimes associated with dreams of falling, the"
falling sensation occurring either at the beginning or at the end of
the dream; such a dream may be said to be of the Icarus type.[116]
"Jewell considers that the two kinds of dream have the same causation,"
the difference being merely a difference of apperception. The frequent
connection between the two dreams indicates that the causation is
"allied, but it scarcely seems to be identical. If it were identical,"
we should scarcely find that while the emotional tone of the dream of
"flying is usually agreeable, that of the dream of falling is usually"
disagreeable.[117]
I have no personal experience of the sensation of falling in normal
"dreaming, although Jewell and Hutchinson have found that it is more"
"common than flying, the latter regarding it, indeed, as the most common"
"kind of dream, the dream of flying coming next in frequency. A friend"
"who has no dreams of flying, but has experienced dreams of falling"
"from his earliest years, tells me that they are always associated with"
"feelings of terror. This suggests an organic cause, and the fact that the"
"sensation of falling may occur in epileptic fits during sleep,[118] seems"
further to suggest the presence of circulatory and nervous disturbance.
It would seem probable that while the same two factors--respiratory and
"tactile--are operative in both types of dream, they are not of equal"
"force in each. In the dream of flying, respiratory activity is excited,"
and in response to excitation it works at a high level adequate to the
needs of the organism. In the dream of falling it may be that respiratory
"activity is depressed, while concomitantly, perhaps, the anaesthetic state"
of the skin is increased. In the first state the abnormal activity of
"_Par excellence_, it was, in the phrase of Louis XIV, the nation of"
"shopkeepers, of middlemen; and its long supremacy in the business of"
buying cheap and selling dear was due firstly to economy of means and
"consumption, and secondarily to command of accumulated money capital at"
low rates of interest. The sinking of interest was the first sign that
the limits to its commercial expansion were being reached; but it
"belonged to the conditions that, with or without ""empire,"" its advantage"
must begin to fall away as soon as rival States were able to compete
"with it in the economies of ""production"" in the sense of transport and"
transfer.
In such economies the Dutch superiority grew out of the specially
practical basis of their marine--habitual fishing and the constant use
of canals. There is no better way than the former of building up
seamanship; and just as the Portuguese grew from hardy fishers to daring
"navigators, so the Dutch grew from thrifty fishers and bargemen to"
"thrifty handlers of sea-freight, surpassing in economy the shippers of"
"England as they did in seamanship the marine of Spain. Broadly speaking,"
"the navies which owed most to royal fostering--as those of Spain,"
"France, and in part England--were the later to reach efficiency in the"
degree of their artificiality; and the loss of one great Spanish navy
after another in storms must be held to imply a lack of due experience
on the part of their officers.
One of the worst military mistakes of Spain was the creation of
great galleons in preference to small cruisers. The sight of the
"big ships terrorised the Dutch once, in 1606; but as all existing"
"seacraft had been built up in small vessels, there was no"
sufficient science for the navigation of the great ones in stress
"of weather, or even for the building of them on sound lines. The"
"English and Dutch, on the other hand, fought in vessels of the kind"
"they had always been wont to handle, increasing their size only by"
"If Grey Dumaresq was a man who craved a variety of experiences, and"
"wished to see life under different aspects, he was getting his wish now;"
"for the gay world of fashion, into which he suddenly found himself"
"plunged, differed _in toto_ from any of his former experiences; and so"
"swift was the pace, and so shifting the throng amid which he moved, that"
"he often felt as though his breath were fairly taken away, and as though"
he had suddenly stepped into a new existence.
Lord Sandford had chanced upon the young baronet at a moment when a
blank had been made in his own life by the sudden and violent death of
"one who had been his boon companion and friend.  The gay young man, who"
"had fallen in a foolish duel a few weeks before, had been the inmate of"
"his house and the companion in all his freaks and follies; so much so,"
that without him the young nobleman felt for the moment bewildered and
"lost, and had absented himself from town with a view to ""getting over"
"it,"" as he hoped: for he despised himself for any sign of weakness, and"
would not for worlds have had his comrades and boon companions know how
the loss had affected him.
"Then, as it seemed just by a lucky chance, this young and attractive man"
"had fallen as from the very skies at his feet.  Grey Dumaresq, new to"
"the world of London, curious and speculative, willing to see all, learn"
"all, participate in all, seemed exactly the person to fill the gap in"
"his life.  Grey had no place of abode; why, then, should he not occupy"
the vacant chambers in the wing of the great mansion in the Strand which
"Lord Sandford used as his customary lodging, when he was not spending"
"his time with friends, or making one of a gay party elsewhere?  Grey had"
no valid reason for declining the invitation pressed upon him. Lord
"Sandford was a masterful man, and his strong personality impressed"
"itself upon Grey with something between attraction and repulsion.  But,"
"on the whole, attraction seemed the stronger power, and curiosity to"
"say, that the usually coherent elements of our mental life are split up,"
"and some of them--often, it is curious to note, precisely those which are"
at that very moment the most prominent and poignant--are reconstituted
"into what seems to us an outside and objective world, of which we are the"
"interested or the merely curious spectators, but in neither case realise"
that we are ourselves the origin of.
"An elementary source of this tendency to objectivation is to be found,"
"it may be noted, in the automatic impulse towards symbolism by which all"
sorts of feelings experienced by the dreamer become transformed into
"concrete visible images. When objectivation is thus attained, dissociation"
may be said to be secondary. So far indeed as I am able to dissect the
"dream-process, the tendency to symbolism seems nearly always to precede"
"the dissociation in consciousness, though it may well be that the"
dissociation of the mental elements is a necessary subconscious condition
for the symbolism.
Sensory symbolism rests on a very fundamental psychic tendency. On the
"abnormal side we find it in the synaesthesias which, since Galton first"
"drew attention to them in 1883, in his _Inquiries into Human Faculty_,"
"have become well known, and are found among between six to over twelve per"
cent. of people. Galton investigated chiefly those kinds of synaesthesias
which he called 'number-forms' and 'colour associations.' The number-form
is characteristic of those people who almost invariably think of
"numerals in some more or less constant form of visual imagery, the"
number instantaneously calling up the picture. In persons who experience
"colour-associations, or coloured-hearing, there is a similar instantaneous"
"manifestation of particular colours in connection with particular sounds,"
"the different vowel sounds, for instance, each constantly and persistently"
"evolving a definite tint, as _a_ white, _e_ vermilion, _i_ yellow,"
"etc., no two persons, however, having exactly the same colour scheme of"
"sounds.[130] These phenomena are not so very rare, and, though they must"
"Composed of boric acid, 310 parts; glycerin to make 1,000; prepared by"
heat (303° F.).
"ACTIONS.--Boric acid is a non-volatile, non-irritating antiseptic,"
"deodorant and astringent, it arrests fermentation of minute organisms,"
"free of irritating effects in solution, when applied to wounds; it"
"lessens suppuration, and is as effective as carbolic acid; can be used"
in any strength from the pure powder or saturated solution to the
mildest form.
USES.--Boric acid is indicated for all purposes for which an antiseptic
"is used; it is used in diarrhoea in foals, calves and dogs, combined"
with other drugs; it has a slightly astringent action of itself; it is
"excreted in the urine, consequently would exert its influence on the"
"bladder in cystitis, cystic catarrh; 1 part in 800 prevents the"
"development of anthrax-bacilli; useful in skin diseases, also used in"
"keratitis and catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis, six to ten grains"
"to the ounce, with atropine or cocaine when very painful. Useful in"
"distemper of dogs where the bowels are affected, as an antiseptic."
Boric acid is preferred to carbolic acid as an antiseptic for dogs. On
"account of the paralyzing effect of carbolic acid on the nerves, it"
"hinders the healing of wounds to a certain extent, while the boracic"
acid does not.
Boric acid may be applied pure to wounds and sores or mixed with other
suitable drugs as a dusting powder. Equal parts of boric acid and zinc
oxide make a cheap and effective healing powder; to an itching wound the
addition of an equal quantity of acetanilide increases its value. A
saturated solution (four per cent) is useful as a vaginal and uterine
douche and to flush the bladder in cystitis.
"though their fighting ships were manned by men of all nations, the"
tendency was to feed them in the native fashion. Such a practice
would tell fatally in the sea-fights with the English. Cp.
"Gardiner, _Commonwealth and Protectorate_, ii, 123."
"In addition to this expertness in handling, the Dutch traders seem to"
"have bettered the lesson taught them by the practice of the Hansa, as to"
the importance of keeping up a high character for probity. At a time
when British goods were open to more or less general suspicion as being
"of short measure or bad quality,[808] the Dutch practice was to insure"
"by inspection the right quality and quantity of all packed goods,"
"especially the salted herrings, which were still the largest source of"
Dutch income.[809] And that nothing might be left undone to secure the
"concourse of commerce to their ports, they maintained under almost every"
stress[810] of financial hardship the principle of minimum duties on
imports of every description. The one notable exception to this policy
of practically free trade--apart from the monopoly of the trade in the
Indies--was the quite supererogatory veto on the importation of fish
from other countries at a time when most of the fishing of Northern
Europe was in Dutch hands.[811] Where imports were desirable they were
encouraged. Thus it came about that landless Amsterdam was the chief
"European storehouse for grain, and treeless Holland the greatest centre"
of the timber trade. Before such a spectacle the average man held up his
hands and confessed the incomparable ingenuity of the Hollanders. But
"others saw and stated the causation clearly enough. ""Many writing on"
"this subject,"" remarks Sir William Petty, ""do magnifie the Hollanders"
"as if they were more, and all other nations less, than men, as to the"
"matters of trade and policy; making them angels, and all others fools,"
"brutes, and sots, as to those particulars; whereas,"" he continues,"
"giving a sound lesson in social science to his generation, ""I take the"
foundation of their achievements to be originally in the situation of
"the country, whereby they do things inimitable by others, and have"
Slowly the great side-doors of the Cathedral swung back on their
"hinges,--and out on the steps in a glorious blaze of sunlight came Poet"
"and Angel together. The one, a man in the full prime of splendid and"
"vigorous manhood,--the other, a maiden, timid and sweet, robed in gray"
"attire with a posy of white flowers at her throat. A simple girl, and"
"most distinctly human,--the fresh, pure color reddened in her"
"cheeks,--the soft springtide wind fanned her gold hair, and the"
sunbeams seemed to dance about her in a bright revel of amaze and
curiosity. Her lustrous eyes dwelt on the busy Platz below with a
vaguely compassionate wonder--a look that suggested some far
"foreknowledge of things, that at the same time were strangely"
"unfamiliar. Hand in hand with her companion she stood,--while he,"
"holding her fast, drunk in the pureness of her beauty, the love-light"
"of her glance, the holy radiance of her smile, till every sense in him"
was spiritualized anew by the passionate faith and reverence in his
"heart, the marvellous glory that had fallen upon his life, the nameless"
"rapture that possessed his soul!--To have knelt at her feet, and bowed"
"his head before her in worshipping silence, would have been to follow"
"the strongest impulse in him,--but she had given him a higher duty than"
"this. He was to ""LEAD HER,""--lead her ""into the world!""--the dreary,"
"dark world, so unfitted to receive such brightness,--she had come to"
him clad in all the sacred weakness of womanhood; and it was his proud
"privilege to guard and shelter her from evil,--from the evil in others,"
but chiefly from the evil in himself. No taint must touch that spotless
"life with which God had entrusted him!--sorrow might come--nay, MUST"
"come, since, so long as humanity errs, so long must angels"
"grieve,--sorrow, but not sin! A grand, awed sense of responsibility"
"filled him,--a responsibility that he accepted with passionate"
gratitude and joy ... he had attained a vaster dignity than any king on
"any throne, ... and all the visible Universe was transfigured into a"
"golden pageant of loveliness and light, fairer than the fabled Valley"
"strengthening the memory, whilst the stories of “Jehu and those other"
Johnnies you know” were by no means devoid of picturesque incident.
Greek Testament could also be made useful in the acquisition of a
"vocabulary, or in a lesson showing the difference between classical"
and vernacular Greek. “Of course we must leave the application of
"these studies to conduct to _Home influence_,” the headmasters would"
"blandly observe, and between parent and pedagogue the teaching of the"
Christian Faith fell neglected to the ground.
"What chance had the boys so brought up, of forming any conception of"
the essential truths of Religion? A superficial acquaintance with the
"stories of Hebrew history, a perfunctory attendance at chapel, some"
"well-meant exhortations on the subject of temperance and chastity, as"
the catechism was revived in their memories before they were brought
"to be confirmed by the Bishop, and some ability “to translate and give"
"the context” of a few phrases from the Greek texts of the Gospels,"
these were their intellectual religious equipment for a life of fierce
temptation from within and without. And when they encountered the
storm and stress of modern social life they found that the critics had
"taken from them the old reverence of nursery days for “God’s Book,”"
"their school training had taught them only a rough code of honour, and"
their chief restraint from any ignoble impulse was a feeling that to
do certain deeds was not “good form.”
A little lower down the social ladder the man in the street has fared
no better in his boyhood. In the public elementary schools he has had
"a half-hour’s lesson in Scripture and catechism five days of the week,"
"and annually the Diocesan, or the School Board, Inspector came round"
to ascertain whether the Syllabus of religious teaching had been duly
followed. But only when devout parish priests had a talent for
teaching and a love for boys and girls was any attempt made to give
"children a _religion_, and even in this case not very much could be"
extent of territory in the richest region of the globe--that comprised
"within the tropics--to remain undeveloped, with its resources running"
"largely to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency,"
will be brought home with ever-growing force to the minds of the Western
"(Northern) peoples. The day is probably not far distant when, with the"
"advance science is making, we shall recognize that it is in the tropics"
and not in the temperate zones we have the greatest food-producing and
material-producing regions of the earth; that the natural highways of
commerce in the world are those which run north and south; and that we
have the highest possible interest in the proper development and
"efficient administration of the tropical regions, and in an exchange of"
products therewith on a far larger scale than has yet been attempted or
"imagined.... It will probably be made clear, and that at no distant"
"date, that the last thing our civilization is likely to permanently"
tolerate is the wasting of the resources of the richest regions of the
earth through lack of the elementary qualities of social efficiency in
the races possessing them”.

This is one of the chief shipping points for the cattle ranches of
Chiriqui. The industry is one little developed]
Some of the modern psychologists who are so expert in solving the
riddles of human consciousness that they hardly hesitate to approach the
supreme problem of life after death may perhaps determine whether the
"indolence of the Panamanian is racial, climatic, or merely bred of"
consciousness that he does not have to work hard in order to get all the
comforts of which he has knowledge. The life-story of an imaginary
couple will serve as the short and simple annals of tens of thousands of
the stoical theories in the sacerdotal traditions of his country.[39] When
"the eclectic Plutarch speaks of the character of the Egyptian gods, he"
"finds it agrees surprisingly with his own philosophy,[40] and when the"
"neo-Platonist {88} Iamblichus examines them, their character seems to agree"
with his doctrines. The hazy ideas of the Oriental priests enabled every
one to see in them the phantoms he was pursuing. The individual imagination
"was given ample scope, and the dilettantic men of letters rejoiced in"
molding these malleable doctrines at will. They were not outlined sharply
"enough, nor were they formulated with sufficient precision to appeal to the"
multitude. The gods were everything and nothing; they got lost in a
_sfumato_. A disconcerting anarchy and confusion prevailed among them. By
"means of a scientific mixture of Greek, Egyptian and Semitic elements"
"""Hermetism""[41] endeavored to create a theological system that would be"
"acceptable to all minds, but it seems never to have imposed itself"
"generally on the Alexandrian mysteries which were older than itself, and"
furthermore it could not escape the contradictions of Egyptian thought. The
religion of Isis did not gain a hold on the soul by its dogmatism.
"It must be admitted, however, that, owing to its extreme flexibility, this"
religion was easily adapted to the various centers to which it was
"transferred, and that it enjoyed the valuable advantage of being always in"
"perfect harmony with the prevailing philosophy. Moreover, the syncretic"
tendencies of Egypt responded admirably to those that began to obtain at
Rome. At a very early period henotheistic theories had been favorably
"received in sacerdotal circles, and while crediting the god of their own"
"temple with supremacy, the priests admitted that he might have a number of"
"different personalities, under which he was worshiped simultaneously. In"
"this way the unity of the supreme being was affirmed for the thinkers, and"
polytheism with its {89} intangible traditions maintained for the masses.
In the same manner Isis and Osiris had absorbed several local divinities
"under the Pharaohs, and had assumed a complex character that was capable of"
indefinite extension. The same process continued under the Ptolemies when
"advanced and elevated human civilization, even this merit appears very"
"doubtful in presence of the facts of history, and at least as very"
"rarely or isolatedly the case. In general, however, it cannot be denied"
that most systems of religion have proved rather inimical than friendly
"to civilization. For religion, as already stated, tolerates no doubt, no"
"discussion, no contradiction, no investigations, those eternal pioneers"
of the future of science and intellect! Even the simple circumstance
that our present state of culture has already long since left far
behind it all and even the highest intellectual ideals established and
elaborated by former religions may show how little intellectual progress
is influenced by religion. Mankind is perpetually being thrown to and
"fro between science, and religion, but it advances moro intellectually,"
morally and physically in proportion as it turns away from religion and
to science.
"* ""In China, where people are, as is well-known, very"
"indifferent or tolerant in religious matters, this fine"
"proverb is current: Religions are various, but reason is"
"one, and we are all brothers.'"""
"""It is therefore clear that for our present age and for the future a"
"foundation must be sought and found for culture and morality, different"
from that which can be furnished to us by religion. It is not the fear
"of God that acts amelioratingly or ennoblingly upon manners, of which"
the middle ages furnish us with a striking proof; but the ennobling of
the conception of the world in general which goes hand in hand with
the advance of civilization. Let us then give up making a show of the
"profession of hypocritical words of faith, the only purpose of which"
seems to be that they may be continually shown to be lies by the actions
and deeds of their professors! The man of the future will feel far more
happy and contented when he has not to contend at every step of his
intellectual forward development with those tormenting contradictions
"blood in the pleura, convalescence was more prolonged, and an average"
time of six to eight weeks often elapsed before the patients could be
safely discharged from hospital. In the more serious a certain amount of
"dulness always persisted at this time over the base of the lung, and the"
"chest was usually somewhat contracted on the injured side, with evidence"
in the way of decreased vesicular murmur that the lung was still not
free from compression. With regard to the persistence of dulness on
"percussion, it is well to bear in mind that a thin layer of blood"
apparently produces as serious impairment of resonance as a much larger
quantity of serum. The signs appeared to favour the view that the space
necessary for the location of the hæmorrhage had been obtained at the
"expense of the lung rather than by distension of the thoracic parietes,"
"and also, I think, denoted the presence of adhesions. Possibly they will"
entirely disappear with the return of full excursion movements of
"respiration, the latter being often still somewhat restricted when the"
patients left hospital. All the patients with such signs were liable to
attacks of pain and shortness of breath on actual bodily exertion. I
"happened to meet with an officer, the subject of a Lee-Metford wound of"
"the thorax, sustained five years previously, and he told me that he was"
nine months before he could take active exercise without feeling short
of breath.
"As to the cases of hæmothorax and empyema which needed drainage, all did"
well; but expansion of the lung was much less satisfactory than would
"have been expected, probably on account of especially firm adhesions."
The importance of concurrent injury I need hardly dwell on; but I might
"add that perforation of one or both arms, the most common one, did not"
materially affect the general statements above made.
_Treatment._--In the early stages of the pulmonary wounds rest was the
"all-important indication, and when this was assured few serious cases of"
"hæmothorax occurred. Beyond simple rest, the administration of opium"
her--so sudden was the suddenness with which he had stepped into the
realm of his manhood!
The young fellow had been too restless to stay in the dingy mute rooms
of the hotel; he could think it out better in the open--striding to his
thinking. It was in the blood--he smiled at the restless walk of Lord
"Wyntwarde up and down that library, of the strange trick that came out"
in his mother at times....
"Ah, London, thou queen of cities, that filchest for ever the hearts of"
"them that dare to love thee! Radiant in thy sunshine, fantastic in thy"
"murk, it is when thou puttest on the habit of thy lilac twilight that"
"thou showest all thy majesty--thy tiring maids, the handsomest women"
"of the world, helping thee to thy wondrous mantle of many hues--pale"
"whitenesses and opal greys, beribboned with purple and ultramarine and"
"the sooty tinge of dusky shadows, adorned with diamonds of a hundred"
"flames and wrought through and through with gold and silvery strands,"
"and thus and so, with smoky art, spinning thyself a mystic robe that it"
is full fit only the Queen of all cities shall wear.
"And what a splendid stage, thy realm, to strut it in! Thy large drama"
"knows no curtain, thy magnificence no boundary but man’s narrow sight."
"Thy whisper and the song of thee, and thy strange melodies, no strings"
of violins nor the resounding hollows of deep orchestral ’cellos
"can yield. From the music of thy ways, where goes thy multitudinous"
"traffic with roll of many wheels, and lurches the gaudy omnibus with"
"reeking horses twain, and lumbers the thundering dray, and winds in"
and out the teeming welter the quick black hansom seeking the hackney
"fare, with jigging of horse-bells that sound a catchy measure to the"
"shuffle of many feet, from out thy swarming hive there comes the breath"
of vigorous life and thinkingness and the atmosphere of quick wits
and alert wills that have the habit of decisive action and of dogged
"was contained in germ in those early polemics, vaguely and mythically"
"in Bruno, and much more consciously in Vico, is substantially that of"
Croce's identification of philosophy with history.
"We do not expect of a new philosophy that it should suddenly, as a"
"revelation or illumination, give us a key to all the problems of"
"reality, and resolve, once and forever, the so-called mystery of the"
"universe. If such a thing should ever happen, it would mean the end of"
"life, which cannot be conceived, in its ultimate essence, otherwise"
than as a perpetual positing and solution of problems. It must not be
"forgotten that a philosophy is the work of one man, and, therefore,"
contains only the answers to the problems that are real to him.
But if we stop to consider the whole course of thought in the last
"two centuries, we shall realize that the idea of Progress, in many"
"different and even in contrasting forms, is the one around which all"
"our life, theoretical and practical, has centred in modern times. And"
"of that idea, Croce's philosophy is the most powerful and coherent"
expression that has ever appeared. It is only by considering the
"whole of reality as activity, and the values of reality as coinciding"
"with the forms of that activity, that Progress acquires a definite"
meaning: a progress which should be a constant approximation towards
"a preÃ«xistent ideal, or a material process external to ourselves,"
"would be a purely illusory one. In one case, our whole life would tend"
"towards making a duplicate of that which already is--a work, therefore,"
"without intrinsic worth, and without a real end; in the other, there"
"would be no work at all, no activity, no life."
But nothing seems more difficult to our mind than to keep together
the two ideas of progress and of truth. The natural sciences have
"made a gallant attempt at assimilating the idea of progress, and at"
"transforming themselves, ultimately, into history. But the static"
"concepts of naturalism resist that assimilation, and scientific"
"PROPERTIES.--A white, crystalline powder, without odor, having a"
sweetish and afterwards astringent taste; permanent in the air; soluble
in one part of water; insoluble in alcohol.
DOSE.--Same as alum.
"ACTIONS.--Astringent, at first excites flow of saliva, then markedly"
"decreases it; coagulates pepsin, thus it would derange or entirely"
"arrest digestion; it also stops peristalsis and produces constipation,"
though sometimes it induces diarrhoea by irritation. It arrests
secretions in general and in the circulation contracts the capillaries;
"it is in this way it arrests secretions, especially those of mucous"
"surfaces, and stops capillary hemorrhage. The sulphate of aluminum is"
"mildly caustic, astringent and antiseptic. Dried alum is caustic and"
astringent.
"EXTERNALLY.--Dried alum is a caustic, in contact with raw sores, on"
"account of its affinity for water. Alum has no action on unbroken skin,"
but applied to mucous membranes or denuded parts it is antiseptic and
astringent; coagulates albumin of discharges; precipitates or coagulates
albumin of the tissues; squeeze blood out of the vessels; reduces
"inflammation and makes the part whiter, brings together and denser. Alum"
"is a hemostatic, stopping bleeding by compression of the structures"
surrounding the vessels and by causing blood to clot.
"USES.--In diarrhoea and dysentery, but other astringents are safer and"
"better, as it may lock the bowels too tight, may be used in weeping"
sores or weeping skin diseases; in long standing nail wounds by putting
"one-half to one pound into the soaking tub, also in same way for injured"
"coronets, with raw bulging surfaces that bleed easily, also for sore"
"mouth, sometimes mix a little boric acid; useful in bleeding piles, and"
in mild solution alum one ounce to water one pint for sore throat; also
legends and of mysteries founded thereon; its settings and its
"harmonies may be different, but the essential melody is the same. At"
"Eleusis Demeter’s daughter was the representative of mankind, for she"
went down to the house of Hades as is the lot of men. But Crete had
another legend wherein Demeter was the representative deity with whom
mankind might hope for union. Was it not told how Iasion even in this
life found such favour in the goddess’ eyes that she was ‘wed with
him in sweet love mid the fresh-turned furrows of the fat land of
Crete[1452]’? And happiness such as was granted to him here was laid
up for all the initiated hereafter; else would there be no meaning in
"those lines, ‘Blessed, methinks, is the lot of him that sleeps, and"
"tosses not, nor turns, even Endymion; and, dearest maiden, blessed I"
"call Iasion, whom such things befell, as ye that be profane shall never"
come to know[1453].’ Surely that which is withheld from the profane is
"by implication reserved to the sanctified, and to them it is promised"
that they shall know by their own experience hereafter the bliss which
"Iasion even here obtained. It was, I think, in this spirit and this"
belief that the Athenians in old time called their dead Δημητρεῖοι
‘Demeter’s folk[1454]’; for the popular belief in the condescension
"of the Mistress, great and reverend goddess though she was, was so"
"firmly rooted, it would seem, that even to this day the folk-stories,"
"as we have seen, still tell how the ‘Mistress of the earth and of the"
"sea,’ she whom men still call Despoina and reverence for her love"
"of righteousness and for her stern punishment of iniquity, has yet"
"admitted brave heroes to her embrace in the mountain-cavern where, as"
"of old in Arcady, she still dwells[1455]."
Nor did the cults of Demeter and Kore monopolise these hopes and
"beliefs. In the religious drama of Aphrodite and Adonis, in the"
"Sabazian mysteries, in the holiest rites of Dionysus, in the wild"
"worship of Cybele, the same thought seems ever to recur. It matters"
little whether these gods and their rites were foreign or Hellenic in
immaculate and incorruptible life.[27]
Purgation of the soul was not effected solely by liturgic acts but also by
self-denial and suffering.[28] The meaning of the term _expiatio_ changed.
"Expiation, or atonement, was no longer accomplished by the exact"
performance of certain ceremonies pleasing to the gods and required by a
"sacred code like a penalty for damages, but by privation and personal"
"suffering. Abstinence, which prevented the introduction of deadly elements"
"into the system, and chastity, which preserved man from pollution and"
"debility, became means of getting rid of the domination of the evil powers"
"and of regaining heavenly favor.[29] Macerations, laborious pilgrimages,"
"public confessions, sometimes flagellations and mutilations, in fact all"
forms of penance and mortifications uplifted the fallen man and brought him
nearer to the gods. In Phrygia a sinner would write his sin and the
punishment he suffered upon a stela for every one to see and would return
thanks to heaven that his prayer of repentance had been heard.[30] The
"Syrian, who had offended his goddess by eating her sacred fish, dressed in"
"sordid rags, covered himself with a sack and sat in the public highway"
humbly to proclaim his misdeed in order to obtain forgiveness.[31] {41}
"""Three times, in the depths of winter,"" says Juvenal, ""the devotee of Isis"
"will dive into the chilly waters of the Tiber, and shivering with cold,"
will drag herself around the temple upon her bleeding knees; if the goddess
"commands, she will go to the outskirts of Egypt to take water from the Nile"
"and empty it within the sanctuary.""[32] This shows the introduction into"
Europe of Oriental asceticism.
But there were impious acts and impure passions that contaminated and
defiled the soul. Since this infection could be destroyed only by
"expiations prescribed by the gods, the extent of the sin and the character"
of the necessary penance had to be estimated. It was the priest's
prerogative to judge the misdeeds and to impose the penalties. This
circumstance gave the clergy a very different character from the one it had
mystic rites associated with Dionysus. From the speech against Neaera
attributed to Demosthenes we learn that at Athens there was annually
celebrated a marriage between the wife of the chief magistrate
(ἄρχων βασιλεύς) and Dionysus. The solemnity was reckoned among
things ‘unspeakable’; foreigners were not permitted to see or to
"hear anything of it; and even Athenian citizens, it seems, might not"
enter the innermost sanctuary in which the union of Dionysus with the
‘queen’ (βασίλιννα) was celebrated[1460]. There were however present
"and assisting in some way fourteen priestesses (γεραραί), dedicated to"
the service of the god and bound by special vows of chastity. These
"priestesses, we are told, corresponded in number to the altars of"
"Dionysus[1461], and they were appointed by the archon whose wife was"
wed with Dionysus[1462]. There our actual knowledge of the facts ends;
but there is material enough on which to base a rational surmise. The
correspondence between the number of priestesses bound by vows of
purity and the number of the altars suggests that in this custom is to
be sought a relic of human sacrifice. The selection of the priestesses
by the magistrate who held the title of ‘king’ suggests that in bygone
"times it had been the duty of the king, as being also chief priest, to"
select fourteen virgins who should be sacrificed on Dionysus’ altars
"and thereby sent to him as wives. Subsequently maybe, as humanity"
"gradually mitigated the wilder rites of religion, the number of victims"
was reduced to one; and later still the human sacrifice was altogether
"abolished, and, instead of sending to Dionysus his wife by the road"
"of death, the still pious but now more humane worshippers of the god"
contented themselves with a symbolic marriage between him and the wife
of their chief magistrate.
The conception of human sacrifice as a means of sending a messenger
"from this world to some power above, which receives clear expression in"
that modern story from Santorini which I have narrated in an earlier
"chapter[1463], was, I have there argued, known also to the ancient"
"paw, as if in contact with water, after any disagreeable experiences."
"The symbolism that to-day interpenetrates our language, and indeed our"
"life generally, has mostly been inherited by us, with the traditions of"
"civilisation, from an antiquity so primitive that we usually fail to"
interpret it. The rare additions we make to it in our ordinary normal
life are for the most part deliberately conscious. But so soon as we
"fall below, or rise above, that ordinary normal level--to insanity and"
"hallucination, to childhood, to savagery, to folk-lore and legend, to"
poetry and religion--we are at once plunged into a sea of symbolism.[140]
"There is even a normal sphere in which symbolism has free scope, and that"
is in the world of dreams.
"Oneiromancy, the symbolical interpretation of dreams, more especially as"
"a method of divining the future, is a widespread art in early stages of"
culture. The discerning of dreams is represented in the Old Testament as
a very serious and anxious matter (as in regard to Pharaoh's dream of the
"fat and lean cattle), and, nearer to our time, the dreams of great heroes,"
"especially Charlemagne, are represented as highly important events in the"
mediæval European epics. Little manuals on the interpretation of dreams
"have always been much valued by the uncultured classes, and among our"
"current popular sayings there are many dicta concerning the significance,"
"or the good or ill luck, of particular kinds of dreams."
Oneiromancy has thus slowly degenerated to folk-lore and superstition.
But at the outset it possessed something of the combined dignities of
religion and of science. Not only were the old dream interpreters careful
"of the significance and results of individual dreams, in order to build"
"up a body of doctrine, but they held that not every dream contained"
in it a divine message; thus they would not condescend to interpret
"dreams following on the drinking of wine, for only to the temperate,"
"they declared, do the gods reveal their secrets.[141] The serious and"
off (by death) from her parents was simply a bride betrothed to the
"infernal god, and was identified with Demeter’s maiden daughter, the"
victim of the passion and violence of Hades; a young man cut off by an
"early fate figured as the beautiful Adonis, snatched away by Persephone"
"from the love of Aphrodite, and brought, in spite of himself, to the"
bed of the queen of the lower world[1518].’ The identification which
"Lenormant sees in these several instances is an identification, I"
"suppose, not of personalities but of destinies. The popular religion"
of ancient Greece shows little trace of any pantheistic view which
would have contemplated the absorption of the personality of the dead
man or woman into that of any god or goddess. Indeed the very number
"of the personally distinct deities with whom, on such an hypothesis,"
"the dead would have been identified, as well as that continuance of"
sexual difference in the future life which is postulated by the very
"doctrine before us, precludes all thought of personal identification."
Rather it is the future destiny of the dead person which was identified
with the destiny of the deity or hero whose marriage was represented on
sarcophagus or _cippus_ or commemorative vase[1519]. The lot of Kore or
Ariadne or Orithyia prefigured the lot of mortal women hereafter; the
fortunes of Adonis or Cephalus typified those of mortal men; and all
"the marriage-scenes alike, whatever the differences of presentation,"
revealed the hope and the promise of wedlock hereafter between mankind
and their deities.
But Lenormant mentions one vase-painting[1520] in which this
"fundamental doctrine is taught not by parables of mythology, but more"
"overtly and directly. The scene depicted is the marriage of a youth,"
"whose name, Polyetes, is in pathetic contrast with his short span of"
"years spent upon earth, with a goddess Eudaemonia (or ‘Bliss’) in the"
lower world. In this deity Lenormant sees ‘the infernal goddess under
an euphemistic name.’ Nor could any more significant name have been
used. It has already been pointed out that εὐδαιμονία was a term much
mode of life with the serene indifference of a veteran. We naturally
"supposed that, being so young, she would give us more or less trouble"
"on so long a journey, and this proved to be true on the cold and rough"
"sea voyage, but, from the day that we landed on this side of the ocean,"
"she has been a delight to our whole party, a maker of friends wherever"
"we have gone, and an immensely interesting object to the populace of"
"the cities through which we have passed. At Leyden, in Holland, as we"
"passed along the streets, we were followed all over town by an admiring"
"throng of Dutch children, just out of school, to whom our baby's bright"
red coat and cap were no less interesting than their wooden shoes were
to us; and so we found out how the elephants and monkeys and musicians
and other people who make up the street parade of a circus may be
supposed to feel when they pass through a town followed by the motley
"gang of school boys, ragamuffins, and general miscellanies of humanity."
[Sidenote: Something New in Venice.]
"At Wiesbaden, in Germany, we bought one of those odd little German"
"baby carts with two wheels and two handles, like plow handles, between"
"which the person who pushes it walks, the baby really riding backwards,"
"instead of forwards, as in our American baby carriages. You will see"
from this description that German baby carriages are like the German
"language--all turned the wrong way, though it must be said for this"
arrangement that the baby is not so likely to be lonesome as when
"riding face forward, since she always has some one to look at. Well,"
"at Venice, which is almost a dead town now, so far as business is"
"concerned, and which has perhaps as large a leisure class--that is,"
"street loafers--as any city of equal size on this terraqueous planet,"
a lady of our party essayed to take the baby out for an airing in her
German cart. It would appear that it was the first time since the
foundation of that pile-driven city in the sea that a pair of wheels
"was ever seen on her streets. At any rate, from the moment that the"
the same time affirm that one of the essential conditions for its
existence is lacking. A history without relation with the document
would be an inverifiable history; and since the reality of history
"lies in this verifiability, and the historical narrative in which it"
realizes itself is an historical narrative only in so far as it is the
"critical exposition of the document, a history of that kind, without"
"meaning and without truth, would be inexistent as history. How could"
ever a history of painting be composed by a man who should not see and
enjoy the works of which he intends to describe critically the origin
"and development? How, a history of philosophy, without the works, or"
"at least the fragments of the works of the philosophers? How, the"
"history of a feeling or a custom, for instance, of Christian humility"
"or of chivalresque honour, without the capacity to re-live, or rather,"
without actually re-living those particular states of mind? On the
"other hand, having established the indissoluble connection of life"
"and thought in history, the doubts that have been advanced about the"
"certainty and utility of history suddenly and totally disappear, and"
it becomes almost impossible to understand them. How could that ever
"be uncertain, which is a present product of our spirit? How could a"
"knowledge be useless, which solves a problem rising from the womb of"
"life?""[1]"
"If history is thus regarded not as an object but as an activity, not as"
"the irrevocable past but as the living present, the difference between"
"history and chronicle, which is one of the puzzles of historical"
"thought, becomes an important and significant distinction. We are used"
"to think that the original form of historical writing is the chronicle,"
and history a later and maturer development. Now if history is the
"consciousness of a present, it follows that history is contemporary"
"with the event; that, therefore, the most meagre chronicle, in the mind"
"of its writer, moved by the actuality of the facts which he records,"
is already a history in the full sense of the word. And the records of
"alcalde of the district is appealed to, who settles the matter. This"
"informal system is always stoutly defended by the women, even more than"
"by the men, for, as among all people low in the scale of civilization,"
it is generally held that the women receive better treatment when not
bound and therefore free to depart at any time. Recently an effort has
"been made to bring more of the inhabitants under the marriage laws, with"
rather amusing results in many instances. The majority of the population
"is nominally Catholic, but the teachings of the church are only vaguely"
"understood, and its practices consist in the adoration of a few battered"
images of saints whose particular degree of sanctity is not even guessed
"at and who, when their owners are displeased with them, receive rather"
"harsh treatment, as these people have usually no real idea of"
Christianity beyond a few distorted and superstitious beliefs. After the
"widespread surveys of the French engineers, a sincere effort was made to"
re-Christianize the inhabitants of the towns in Darien as well as
"elsewhere, for, until this time, nothing had been done toward their"
spiritual welfare since the days of the early Jesuits. In the last
thirty years spasmodic efforts have been made to reach the people with
"little result, and, excepting at Penonome, David, and Santiago, there"
are few churches where services are held outside of Panama and the towns
along the railroad.

"“The chief amusements of the Isthmian are gambling, cock-fighting, and"
"dancing, the latter assisted by the music of the tom-tom and by dried"
"beans rattled in a calabash. After feasts or burials, when much bad rum"
"and whisky is consumed, the hilarity keeps up all night and can be heard"
"for miles, increased by the incessant howls of the cur dogs lying under"
every shack. Seldom does an opportunity come to the stranger to witness
"the really characteristic dances, as the natives do not care to perform"
"before them, though a little money will sometimes work wonders."
"their deceased god and later, after he had revived, celebrated with"
exultation his birth to a new life. Or else they joined in the passion of
"Mithra, condemned to create the world in suffering. This common grief and"
"joy were often expressed with savage violence, by bloody mutilations, long"
"wails of despair, and extravagant acclamations. The manifestations of the"
extreme fanaticism of those barbarian races that had not been touched by
Greek skepticism and the very ardor of their faith inflamed the souls of
the multitudes attracted by the exotic gods.
The Oriental religions touched every chord of sensibility and satisfied the
thirst for religious emotion that the austere Roman creed had been unable
to quench. {31} But at the same time they satisfied the intellect more
"fully, and this is my second point."
In very early times Greece--later imitated by Rome--became resolutely
rationalistic: her greatest originality lies here. Her philosophy was
purely laical; thought was unrestrained by any sacred tradition; it even
pretended to pass judgment upon these traditions and condemned or approved
"of them. Being sometimes hostile, sometimes indifferent and some times"
"conciliatory, it always remained independent of faith. But while Greece"
"thus freed herself from the fetters of a superannuated mythology, and"
openly and boldly constructed those systems of metaphysics by means of
"which she claimed to solve the enigmas of the universe, her religion lost"
its vitality and dried up because it lacked the strengthening nourishment
"of reflection. It became a thing devoid of sense, whose _raison d'être_ was"
no longer understood; it embodied dead ideas and an obsolete conception of
the world. In Greece as well as at Rome it was reduced to a collection of
"unintelligible rites, scrupulously and mechanically reproduced without"
addition or omission because they had been practised by the ancestors of
"long ago, and formulas hallowed by the _mos maiorum_, that were no longer"
understood or sincerely cherished. Never did a people of advanced culture
have a more infantile religion.
hereditary impurity of a guilty ancestor who had aroused the wrath of
"heaven against his posterity, much as the original sin with which Adam's"
disobedience had stained the human race was to be wiped out. The custom
observed by the votaries of Sabazius of dedicating votive hands which made
the liturgic sign of benediction with the first three fingers extended (the
_benedictio latina_ of the church) was probably taken from the ritual of
"the Semitic temples through the agency of the Jews. The initiates believed,"
"again like the Jews, that after death their good angel (_angelus bonus_)"
"would lead them to the banquet of the eternally happy, and the everlasting"
joys of these banquets were anticipated on earth by the liturgic repasts.
This celestial feast can {65} be seen in a fresco painting on the grave of
"a priest of Sabazius called Vincentius, who was buried in the Christian"
"catacomb of Prætextatus, a strange fact for which no satisfactory"
explanation has as yet been furnished. Undoubtedly he belonged to a
Jewish-pagan sect that admitted neophytes of every race to its mystic
"ceremonies. In fact, the church itself formed a kind of secret society"
"sprung from the synagogue but distinct from it, in which Gentiles and the"
Children of Israel joined in a common adoration.
"If it is a fact, then, that Judaism influenced the worship of Sabazius, it"
"is very probable that it influenced the cult of Cybele also, although in"
this case the influence cannot be discerned with the same degree of
certainty. The religion of the Great Mother did not receive rejuvenating
"germs from Palestine only, but it was greatly changed after the gods of"
more distant Persia came and joined it. In the ancient religion of the
"Achemenides, Mithra, the genius of light, was coupled with Anâhita, the"
goddess of the fertilizing waters. In Asia Minor the latter was assimilated
"with the fecund Great Mother, worshiped all over the peninsula,[32] and"
when at the end of the first century of our era the mysteries of Mithra
"spread over the Latin provinces, its votaries built their sacred crypts in"
the shadow of the temples of the _Magna Mater_.
audience does not desire discussion of difficulties. When the honest
instinct of devotional worship is gratified by common praise and
"prayer, the people who regularly go to church, elderly, and orthodox"
"in their own way, resent a demand upon their intellectual exertion,"
"and the Northern farmer of Tennyson hardly misrepresents them, “I"
thought he said what he ought to ha’ said and I comed away.” The great
"Nonconformist societies may, in some congregations, give a larger"
"latitude to the preacher, but his freedom is rather in the direction"
of divinity than of ethics. Mr. Rockefeller is a prominent pillar of
"Protestantism in the States, and Mr. Jabez Balfour, in another"
"congregation at Croydon, apparently knew no qualms of conscience"
"before his actual conviction, which was public, of sin."
There is an old proverb which tells us that “A man is either a fool or
"a philosopher at forty”--and, though proverbs are often only venerable"
"prejudices in disguise, it is true that a man, who has attained his"
"eighth lustrum and is of average ability, generally has come to"
certain definite conclusions as to the rudimentary laws of health. He
"knows enough about his body to avoid fatal errors in diet, and has"
learned the necessity of exercise and fresh air. But when he is called
"upon, as a member of the body politic, to decide questions of ethics"
"on which the sanitation of society must depend, he feels himself at a"
loss. To many people it will seem a hard saying that a man must be
"either a fool or a philosopher at forty, but long ere he has reached"
that age he will have encountered problems of philosophy which it is
impossible to shirk if he is to do his duty as a free man.
"St. Paul, it is true, when writing to a Christian Community in Asia"
"Minor, bids them “beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy.”"
"And the unfortunate habit of Bible Christians, of tearing a text from"
"a treatise and making it into a precept, has thrown a sort of"
"discredit upon philosophic thinking, while the mass of mankind will"
"the inventors of the legend of Icarus onwards, men have firmly cherished"
"the belief that under some circumstances they could fly, and we may well"
"suppose that that belief partly owes its conviction, and the resolve to"
"make it practical, to the experiences that have been gained in dreams."
"No dreams, indeed, are so vivid and so convincing as dreams of flying;"
none leave behind them so strong a sense of the reality of the experience.
"Raffaelli, the eminent French painter, who is subject to the dreaming"
"experience of floating in the air, confesses that it is so convincing that"
he has jumped out of bed on awaking and attempted to repeat it. 'I need
"not tell you,' he adds, 'that I have never been able to succeed.'[102]"
"Herbert Spencer mentions that in a company of a dozen persons, three"
testified that in early life they had had such vivid dreams of flying
"downstairs, and were so strongly impressed by the reality of the"
"experience, that they actually made the attempt, one of them suffering in"
consequence from an injured ankle.[103] The case is recorded of an old
French lady who always maintained that on one occasion she actually had
succeeded for a few instants in supporting herself on the air.[104] No
one who is familiar with these dreaming experiences will be inclined to
"laugh at that old lady. It was during one of these dreams of levitation,"
"in which one finds oneself leaping into the air and able to stay there,"
"that it occurred to me that I would write a paper on the subject, for"
I thought in my dream that this power I found myself possessed of was
"probably much more widespread than was commonly supposed, and that in any"
case it ought to be generally known.
People who dabble in the occult have been so impressed by such dreams
that they have sometimes believed that these flights represented a
real excursion of the 'astral body.' This is the belief of Colonel de
"Rochas.[105] César de Vesme, the editor of the French edition of the"
"_Annals of Psychical Research_, has thought it worth while to investigate"
the matter; and after summarising the results of a _questionnaire_
addition of a puncture by an exploring needle between the first and
"second rise. After a wider experience, however, I abandoned the"
"infection theory, as it seemed opposed by the very infrequent sequence"
of suppuration. The effect of simple removal of the blood or serum was
also often so striking as to strongly suggest that it alone was
"responsible for the fever. Exactly the same result, moreover, followed"
evacuation of the interstitial blood effusions already mentioned
elsewhere.
The common course of all the cases of hæmothorax was to spontaneous
"recovery, the rapidity of the subsidence of the signs depending mainly"
"on the quantity of the primary hæmorrhage, and the occurrence of further"
increases. The blood serum tended to collect at the upper limit of the
"original blood effusion (as was often proved on tapping), and this was"
first absorbed; the clot deposited on the pleural surface and at the
"basal part of the cavity was, however, not absorbed with the same"
"rapidity. In the majority of the patients when they left the hospitals,"
"at the end of six weeks on an average, some dulness and deficiency of"
"vesicular murmur always remained, and the clot and the surrounding"
"surface, irritated by its presence, will, no doubt, be responsible for"
permanent adhesions in many cases. That such adhesions do form in the
"majority of cases I feel certain, as, although these patients when they"
"left the hospital were to all intents and purposes apparently well, few"
of them could undertake sustained exertion without getting short of
"breath, and sometimes suffering from transitory pain, and for this"
reason it became customary to invalid them home.
In a small proportion of the cases empyema followed; but I never saw
"this in any case that had neither been tapped nor opened, and I saw"
only one patient die from a chest wound uncomplicated by other injuries.
This case was an interesting one of recurrent hæmorrhage followed by
inflammatory troubles:--
say that both the aerial element and the actual rhythmic movement of the
ribs become accentuated during sleep.
That the respiratory element is the chief factor in dreams of flying is
clearly indicated by the fact that many persons subject to such dreams
are conscious on awaking from them of a sense of respiratory or cardiac
"disturbance. I am acquainted with a psychologist who, though not a"
"frequent dreamer, is subject to dreams of flying, which do not affect"
"him disagreeably, but on awaking from them he always perceives a slight"
"flutter of the heart. Any such sensation is by no means constant with me,"
but I have occasionally noted it down in exactly the same words after this
"kind of dream.[114] It is worth while to observe, in this connection, how"
"large a number of people, and especially very young people, associate"
their dreams of flying with staircases. The most frequent cause of cardiac
"and respiratory stimulation, especially in children, who constantly run up"
"and down them, is furnished by staircases, and though in health this fact"
"may not be obvious, it is undoubtedly registered unconsciously, and may"
thus be utilised by dreaming intelligence.
"There is, however, another element entering into the problem of nocturnal"
aviation: the state of the skin sensations. Respiratory activity alone
would scarcely suffice to produce the imagery of flight if sensations of
"tactile pressure remained to suggest contact with the earth. In dreams,"
"however, the sense of movement suggested by respiratory activity is"
unaccompanied by the tactile pressure produced by boots or the contact
"of the ground with the soles of the feet. In addition, also, there is"
"probably, as Bergson also has suggested, a numbness due to pressure on"
the parts supporting the weight of the body. Sleep is not a constant and
uniform state of consciousness; a heightened consciousness of respiration
may easily co-exist with a diminished consciousness of tactile pressure
"due to anaesthesia of the skin.[115] In normal sleep it may, indeed, be"
said that the conditions are probably often favourable to the production
are as disconnected from the immediate claims of desire and even of
association as those of dreams seem so largely to be. It sometimes occurs
to me--as doubtless it occurs to other people--that at some moment when
"my thoughts are normally occupied with the work immediately before me,"
there suddenly appears on the surface of consciousness a totally unrelated
"picture. A scene arises, vague but usually recognisable, of some city"
"or landscape--Australian, Russian, Spanish, it matters not what--seen"
"casually long years ago, and possibly never thought of since, and"
possessing no kind of known association either with the matter in hand or
with my personal life generally. It comes to the surface of consciousness
"as softly, as unexpectedly, as disconnectedly, as a minute bubble might"
arise and break on the surface of an actual stream from ancient organic
material silently disintegrating in the depths beneath.[156] Every one who
"has travelled much cannot fail to possess, hidden in his psychic depths,"
"a practically infinite number of such forgotten pictures, devoid of all"
"personal emotion. It is possible to maintain, as a matter of theory, that"
"when they come up to consciousness, they are evoked by some real, though"
"untraceable, resemblance which they possess to the psychic or physical"
state existing when they reappear. But that theory cannot be demonstrated.
"Nor, it may be added, is it more plausible than the simple but equally"
unprovable theory that such scenes do really come to the surface of
consciousness as the result of some slight spontaneous disintegration in
"a minute cerebral centre, and have no more immediately preceding psychic"
cause than my psychic realisation of the emergence of the sun from behind
a cloud has any psychic preceding cause.
"Similarly, in insanity, Liepmann, in his study _Ueber Ideenflucht_, has"
forcibly argued that ordinary logorrhœa--the incontinence of ideas linked
together by superficial associations of resemblance or contiguity--is a
"linking _without direction_, that is, corresponding to no interest, either"
"practical or theoretical, of the individual. Or, as Claparède puts it,"
logorrhœa is a trouble in the reaction of _interest_ in life. It seems
It is needless to say that for a time at least Croce shared with
"Bertrand Russell and with Romain Rolland, two thinkers in many respects"
"very distant from him, and yet as impervious as he was to the rhetoric"
"of the war, the privilege of a vast unpopularity. Looking back now on"
his writings which were later collected in the volume _Pagine sulla
"guerra_, it is possible to discover among them many attitudes which"
were justified and useful only as a reaction against the current
fallacies of the time; and also to realize that the man who speaks to
"us through them is not always and only a pure philosopher, but a man"
with a given complex of moral and political tastes and passions. But
"this is, in a way, as it should be; in the same way, between Croce the"
"philosopher of Ã¦sthetics and Croce the critic of poetry, there is a"
difference which is inherent in the nature of the two different forms
"of intellectual activity; the philosopher is a man of understanding,"
"the critic a man of tastes and passions. In both cases, his ideal"
has always been to make the critic or the moralist worthy of the
"philosopher, his particular comprehension of history adequate to his"
"concept of the universal. To say that the equation is never perfect,"
is only another way of saying that every particular historical problem
"continually raises new problems of thought, and that Croce's thought"
"finds therefore in itself the motives of its own development, the"
"springs of its own life. Where passion and reason ultimately coincide,"
"the roots of the development are taken away, and death takes the place"
of life.
"Yet, notwithstanding these limitations, I know of no man whose thought"
on the war is on the whole more acceptable to those among us who lived
"through the war not as spectators, looking on it as on a vast moral"
"abstraction, but as humble actors, in the midst of its human reality. A"
"sense of collaboration between one side and the other, of being, here"
"as there, employed in a common task, whose meaning was much deeper"
"high and remote, is set to the living spirit, no longer recognised"
as the creator of its own Ã¦sthetic and moral world. To the mind that
"has grasped this relation of the universal to the individual, of the"
eternal to the present (and the artist or the saint grasps it in his
"own unphilosophical way, to which his work or his action is witness),"
"the whole of reality, human and natural, appears as linked by a bond of"
"spiritual solidarity, moving towards the same end, engaged in the same"
sacred task.
"Truth is the value of the logical activity, and therefore it coincides"
with the positive history of human thought. Its actuality is an
"infinite progress or development, but not in the sense that the value"
itself may be subject to increase or change from century to century.
At no particular point in that history is it possible to point to a
"conversion from error to truth, to a total illumination or revelation."
"Every single affirmation of truth, from the simplest and humblest"
"to the most elaborate and complex, takes possession of the whole of"
"reality, in the fulness of its relations; since it is manifestly"
"impossible to affirm the truth of one individual subject, without"
"implicitly determining its position in the universe. Truth, as all"
"other values, has no extension; it is incommensurable either with space"
"or with time, it is not augmented by accumulation. Degrees in truth,"
"and a more and a less, are inconceivable; but each act that affirms"
"it contains its whole, since truth itself does not live except in the"
spirit that perpetually creates and recreates it. Truth belongs to the
"thinking mind, that is, to reality as a logical consciousness, as life"
"belongs to the living body. It belongs to us, individually, in relation"
"to that universal consciousness, in the mode and measure of our"
"partaking of it: which means that however much of it we may conquer,"
"however constant, laborious, honest, intense our efforts towards"
"truth may be, yet our duty towards it will always remain infinite,"
inexhaustible. The conquered truth is dead in the mind that rests in
"and motor imagery, but there is an indirect but equally instinctive"
"association between sounds and visual imagery which, though not itself"
"motor, has motor associations. Thus Bleuler considers it well established"
that among colour-hearers there is a tendency for photisms that are light
"in colour (and belonging, we may say, to the 'high' part of the spectrum)"
"to be produced by sounds of high quality, and dark photisms by sounds"
"of low quality; and, in the same way, sharply-defined pains or tactile"
"sensations, as well as pointed forms, produce light photisms. Similarly,"
"bright lights and pointed forms produce high photisms, whole low photisms"
"are produced by opposite conditions. Urbantschitsch, again, by examining a"
"large number of people who were not colour-hearers, found that a high note"
"of a tuning-fork seems higher when looking at red, yellow, green, or blue,"
but lower if looking at violet. Thus two sensory qualities that are both
symbolic of a third quality are symbolic to each other.
"This symbolism, we are justified in believing, is based on fundamental"
"organic tendencies. Piderit, nearly half a century ago, forcibly argued"
that there is a real relationship of our most spiritual feelings and
ideas to particular bodily movements and facial expressions. In a similar
"manner, he pointed out that bitter tastes and bitter thoughts tend to"
produce the same physical expression.[137] He also argued that the
"character of a man's looks--his _fixed_ or _dreamy_ eyes, his _lively_"
or _stiff_ movements--correspond to real psychic characters. If this
"is so we have a physiological, almost anatomical, basis for symbolism."
"Cleland,[138] again, in an essay, 'On the Element of Symbolic Correlation"
"in Expression,' argued that the key to a great part of expression is"
"the correlation of movements and positions with ideas, so that there"
"are, for instance, a host of associations in the human mind by which"
"'upward' represents the good, the great, and the living, while 'downward'"
represents the evil and the dead. Such associations are so fundamental
"that they are found even in animals, whose gestures are, as Féré[139]"
"remarked, often metaphorical, so that a cat, for instance, will shake its"
"cities, especially at Amphipolis in Macedonia, graves have been found"
adorned with earthenware statuettes representing the shepherd Attis;[22]
and even in Germany the gravestones are frequently decorated with the
"figure of a young man in Oriental costume, leaning dejectedly upon a"
"knotted stick (_pedum_), who represented the same Attis. We are ignorant of"
the conception of immortality held by the Oriental disciples of the
"Phrygian priests. Maybe, like the votaries of Sabazius, they believed that"
the blessed ones were permitted to participate with Hermes Psychopompos in
"a great celestial feast, for which they were prepared by the sacred repasts"
of the mysteries.[23] {60}
"Another agent in favor of this imported religion was, as we have stated"
"above, the fact of its official recognition. This placed it in a privileged"
"position among Oriental religions, at least at the beginning of the"
imperial régime. It enjoyed a toleration that was neither precarious nor
limited; it was not subjected to arbitrary police measures nor to coercion
on the part of magistrates; its fraternities were not continually
"threatened with dissolution, nor its priests with expulsion. It was"
"publicly authorized and endowed, its holidays were marked in the calendars"
"of the pontiffs, its associations of dendrophori were organs of municipal"
"life in Italy and in the provinces, and had a corporate entity."
"Therefore it is not surprising that other foreign religions, after being"
"transferred to Rome, sought to avert the dangers of an illicit existence by"
an alliance with the Great Mother. The religion of the latter frequently
"consented to agreements and compromises, from which it gained in reality as"
much as it gave up. In exchange for material advantages it acquired
complete moral authority over the gods that accepted its protection. Thus
Cybele and Attis absorbed a majority of the divinities from Asia Minor that
had crossed the Ionian Sea. Their clergy undoubtedly intended to establish
a religion complex enough to enable the emigrants from every part of the
"vast peninsula, slaves, merchants, soldiers, functionaries, scholars, in"
subjective sensation to the objective imagery of flying. By means of this
symbolic imagery we find sleeping consciousness commanding the hurried
heart to beat in a more healthy manner.
"Although, in youth, my dreams of flying were of what may be considered"
"normal type, after the age of about thirty-five they tended, as"
"illustrated by the example I have given, to take on a somewhat objective"
"form. A further stage in this direction, the swinging movement being"
"transformed to an inanimate object, is illustrated by a dream of"
"comparatively recent date, in which I seemed to see an athlete of the"
"music-hall, a graceful and muscular man, who was manipulating a large"
"elastic ball, making it bound up from the floor. On awaking there was a"
distinct sensation of cardaic tremor and nervousness.[122]
"It may seem strange that dreams of flying, if so often due to organic"
"disturbances, should usually be agreeable in character. It is not,"
"however, necessary to assume that they are caused by serious interference"
"with physiological functions; often, indeed, they may simply be due to"
the presence of a stage of consciousness in which respiration has become
"unduly prominent, as it is apt to be in the early stage of nitrous oxide"
"anaesthesia, that is to say, to a relative wakefulness of the respiratory"
"centres. It would seem that the disturbance is frequently almost, or"
"quite, imperceptible on waking, and by no means to be compared with the"
"more acute organic disturbances which result in dreams of murder, although"
"it may be of nervous origin.[123] In some cases, however, it appears"
that dreams of flying are accompanied by circumstances of terror. Thus a
"medical correspondent, who describes his health as fairly good, writes"
"in regard to dreams of flying: 'I have often had such dreams, and have"
"wondered if others have them. Mine, however, are not so much dreams of"
"flying, as dreams of being entirely devoid of weight, and of rising and"
falling at will. A singular feature of these levitation dreams is that
they are always accompanied by an intense and agonising fear of an evil
"Herodotus, Osiris had been identified with Dionysus, and Isis with Demeter."
M. Foucart has {77} endeavored to prove in an ingenious essay that this
"assimilation was not arbitrary, that Osiris and Isis came into Crete and"
"Attica during the prehistoric period, and that they were mistaken for"
Dionysus and Demeter[8] by the people of those regions. Without going back
"to those remote ages, we shall merely say with him that the mysteries of"
"Dionysus were connected with those of Osiris by far-reaching affinities,"
not simply by superficial and fortuitous resemblances. Each commemorated
the history of a god governing both vegetation and the underworld at the
"same time, who was put to death and torn to pieces by an enemy, and whose"
"scattered limbs were collected by a goddess, after which he was"
miraculously revived. The Greeks must have been very willing to adopt a
worship in which they found their own divinities and their own myths again
with something more poignant and more magnificent added. It is a very
remarkable fact that of all the many deities worshiped by the Egyptian
"districts those of the immediate neighborhood, or if you like, the cycle of"
"Osiris, his wife Isis, their son Harpocrates and their faithful servant"
"Anubis, were the only ones that were adopted by the Hellenic populations."
All other heavenly or infernal spirits worshiped by the Egyptians remained
strangers to Greece.[9]
In the Greco-Latin literature we notice two opposing attitudes toward the
Egyptian religion. It was regarded as the highest and the lowest of
"religions at the same time, and as a matter of fact there was an abyss"
between the always ardent popular beliefs and the enlightened faith of the
official priests. The Greeks and Romans gazed with admiration upon the
"splendor of the temples and ceremonial, upon the fabulous {78} antiquity of"
the sacred traditions and upon the erudition of a clergy possessed of a
wisdom that had been revealed by divinity. In becoming the disciples of
"that clergy, they imagined they were drinking from the pure fountain whence"
their own myths had sprung. They were overawed by the pretensions of a
"clergy that prided itself on a past in which it kept on living, and they"
and his conception of a purely spiritual ‘daemon’ is a failure; but at
"the same time, save for this invention, he is following the popular"
belief of both ancient and modern Greece that carnal intercourse
between man and nymph is possible but is fraught with grave peril to
the man[1465]. It is impossible then to doubt that in the earlier part
of the passage he was explaining away a popular belief by means of
the same hypothesis. He himself would hold that spiritual ‘daemons’
demanded human sacrifice because they lusted after a soul or spirit
confined out of their reach in a body until death severed it therefrom;
"but the popular belief, which he is at pains to emend, was that"
corporeal gods demanded human sacrifice because they lusted after the
"person who, by death, would be sent, body and soul, to be wed with them."
There is good reason then to suppose that in old time death may have
been even inflicted as the means of effecting wedlock between men and
gods; and that the mystic rite of union between Dionysus and the wife
of the Athenian magistrate was based on the same fundamental idea as
the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone or of Aphrodite. Though in this
"instance, when once human sacrifice had been given up, all suggestion"
"of death was, so far as we know, removed from the solemnity, yet the"
repetition year by year of a ceremony of marriage between the god and
a mortal woman representing his worshippers might still keep bright
in their minds those ‘happier hopes’ of the like bliss laid up for
themselves hereafter.
"This particular rite escaped the notice, or at any rate the malice,"
of Clement; but Dionysus does not for all that go unscathed. Clement
"fastens upon a legend concerning him, which, however widely ancient"
"Greek feeling in the matter of sex differed from modern, cannot but"
have seemed to some of the ancients[1466] themselves to be a reproach
and stain upon the honour of their god. The story of Dionysus and
"Prosymnus, as told by Clement[1467], must be taken as read. But those"
"set to our labour. We shall therefore confine ourselves to examining,"
"in this chapter, the latest developments of Croce's Ã¦sthetics,"
"especially in relation with the history of art and poetry; and, in the"
"following and concluding one, to considering his theory of truth or of"
"the function of thought, in relation to other types of contemporary"
thought.
"We have followed the evolution, or rather the deepening, of Croce's"
"concept of art as pure intuition, into lyrical intuition, through"
which the movement and life which might seem to have been denied to
the products of the Ã¦sthetic activity considered as a mere form of
"knowledge, were recognised as intrinsically belonging to them by reason"
"of the very nature of that cognitive activity, and of its relations"
"with the practical sphere of the spirit, the states of mind, which can"
be abstracted as the matter or content of the Ã¦sthetic form. Another
"difficulty, however, still persisted in Croce's theory, due to the"
"sharp distinction between the Ã¦sthetic and the logical activity, which"
"reserved to the first the field of individual, to the second that of"
"universal knowledge--constituting a double-grade relation, in which the"
"Ã¦sthetic was implied by the logic activity, but not vice-versa. The"
"corresponding distinction of the two forms of the practical spirit,"
"the economic and the ethic, evolved by Croce at a maturer stage of his"
"speculation, establishes not only a double-grade relation, but also"
a reciprocal implication. Croce's essay on _Il carattere di totalitÃ
della espressione artistica_ (1917) is an attempt at interpreting his
"first distinction in the light of the second, thereby recognising the"
universal or cosmic character of art. That universality which becomes
"explicit in the logical judgment is implicit in the intuition, already"
"identified with the category of feeling, with the concrete states of"
"mind, on which it imposes its form: ""Since, what is a feeling or a"
state of mind? is it something that can be detached from the universe
"and developed by itself? have the part and the whole, the individual"
investigator of dreams must always bear in mind the risk of falling into
morbid extrospection.
Such considerations seem to indicate that it is not true that every
"dream, every mental image, is 'worth while,' though at the same time they"
by no means diminish the validity of special and purposive methods of
investigating dream consciousness. Freud and those who are following him
"have shown, by the expenditure of much patience and skill, that his method"
of dream-interpretation may in many cases yield coherent results which it
"is not easy to account for by chance. It is quite possible, however, to"
recognise Freud's service in vindicating the large place of symbolism in
"dreams, and to welcome the application of his psycho-analytic method to"
"dreams, while yet denying that this is the only method of interpreting"
"dreams. Freud argues that all dreaming is purposive and significant,"
and that we must put aside the belief that dreams are the mere trivial
"outcome of the dissociated activity of brain centres. It remains true,"
"however, that, while reason plays a larger part in dreams than most"
"people realise, the activity of dissociated brain centres furnishes one"
of the best keys to the explanation of psychic phenomena during sleep.
It would be difficult to believe in any case that in the relaxation of
sleep our thoughts are still pursuing a deliberately purposeful direction
under the control of our waking impulses. Many facts indicate--though
Freud's school may certainly claim that such facts have not been
"thoroughly interpreted--that, as a matter of fact, this control is often"
"conspicuously lacking. There is, for instance, the well-known fact that"
our most recent and acute emotional experiences--precisely those which
might most ardently formulate themselves in a wish--are rarely mirrored
"in our dreams, though recent occurrences of more trivial nature, as well"
"as older events of more serious import, easily find place there. That"
is easily accounted for by the supposition--not quite in a line with a
generalised wish-theory--that the exhausted emotions of the day find rest
at night.
"virtues, whether in man or woman, are no more sacred than nuts to a"
monkey. The suave charm of a polished civility sat on M le Due's smooth
"brow, and beamed in his urbane smile,--his manners were exquisite, his"
"courtesy irreproachable, his whole demeanor that of a very precise and"
"elegant master of deportment. Yet, notwithstanding his calm and"
"perfectly self-possessed exterior, he was, oddly enough, the frequent"
prey of certain extraordinary and ungovernable passions; there were
"times when he became impossible to himself,--and when, to escape from"
"his own horrible thoughts, he would plunge headlong into an orgie of"
"wild riot and debauchery, such as might have made the hair of his"
"respectable English acquaintances stand on end, had they known to what"
an extent he carried his excesses. But at these seasons of moral
"attack, he ""went abroad for his health,"" as he said, delicately"
touching his chest in order to suggest some interesting latent weakness
"there, and in these migratory excursions his wife never accompanied"
"him, nor did she complain of his absence. When he returned, after two"
"or three months, he looked more the ""chevalier sans peur et sans"
"reproche"" than ever; and neither he, nor the fair partner of his joys"
"and sorrows, even committed such a breach of politeness as to inquire"
into each other's doings during the time of their separation. So they
"jogged on together, presenting the most delightful outward show of"
"wedded harmony to the world,--and only a few were found to hazard the"
"remark, that the ""racy"" novels Madame la Duchesse wrote to wile away"
"her duller hours were singularly ""bitter"" in tone, for a woman whose"
lot in life was so extremely enviable!
"On this particular evening, the Duke affected to be utterly unconscious"
of the meaning looks his beautiful spouse shot at him every now and
"then,--looks which plainly said--""Why don't you start some interesting"
"subject of conversation, and stop these people from talking such"
"every-day twaddle?"" He was a clever man in his way, and his present"
"mood was malign and mischievous; therefore he went on eating daintily,"
"required to verify our knowledge, but they were far from satisfactorily"
attaining to their goal. The very name of 'common-sense' was
"misleading--making people imagine, as it did, that there was nothing in"
philosophy after all that the man in the street could not know by
applying the smallest modicum of reflection to the subject. Philosophy
"thus came to be considered as superfluous, and it was thought that the"
sooner we got rid of it and were content to observe the mandates of our
"hearts, the better for all concerned."
"What, then, was the work which Ferrier placed before himself when he"
commenced to write upon and teach philosophy? He was thoroughly and
"entirely dissatisfied with the old point of view, the point of view of"
"the 'common-sense' school of metaphysicians, to begin with. Sometimes"
it seems as though we could not judge a system altogether from the best
"exponent of it, although theoretically we are always bound to turn to"
"him. In a national philosophy, at least, we want something that will"
"wear, that will bear to be put in ordinary language, something which"
"can be understood of the people, which can be assimilated with the"
"popular religion and politics--in fact, which can really be _lived_ as"
well as thought; and it is only after many years of use that we can
really tell whether these conditions have been fulfilled. For this
reason we are in some measure justified in taking the popular estimate
"of a system, and in considering its practical results as well as the"
"value of its theory. Now, the commonly accepted view of the"
eighteenth-century philosophers in Scotland is that there is nothing
very wonderful about the subject--like the _Bourgeois Gentilhomme_ of
"Molière, we are shown that we have been philosophising all our lives,"
only we never knew it. 'Common-sense'--an attribute with which we all
believe we are in some small measure endowed--explains everything if we
"simply exercise it, and that is open to us all: there has been much"
"talk, it would seem, about nothing; secrets hidden to wise men are"
"revealed to babes, and we have but to keep our minds open in order to"
"Locke--that is, the relations so called by Locke--might be separated"
"from sensation in itself; in fact, that these first pertained to mind."
"Hence we have a dualistic system given us to start with, and the"
question is how the two sides are to be connected? What does this
"theory of Immediate Perception, which Reid puts forward as the"
"solution, mean? Is it just a mechanical union of two antitheses, or is"
it something more?
"As to this last, perhaps the real answer would be that it both is, and"
"is not. That is, the philosophy of Reid would seem still dualistic in"
its nature; it certainly implies the mechanical contact of two
"confronting substances whose independence is vigorously maintained, in"
opposition to the idealistic system which it superseded; but in
reference to Reid we must recollect that his theory of Immediate
"Perception was also something more. As regards sensation, for example,"
"he says that we do not begin with unrelated sensations, but with"
"judgment--that is, we refer our sensations to a permanent subject, 'I.'"
Sensations 'suggest' the nature of a mind and the belief in its
existence. And this signifies that we have the power of making
"inferences--how we do not exactly know, but we believe it to be, not by"
"any special reasoning process, but by the 'common-sense' innately born"
within us. Common-sense is responsible for a good deal more--for the
"conceptions of existence and of cause, for instance; for Reid"
acknowledges that sensations alone must fail to account for ideas such
"as those of extension, space, and motion. This standpoint seems indeed"
"as if it did not differ widely from the Kantian, but at the same time"
Reid appears to think that it is not an essential that feelings should
be perceptively referred to an external object; the first part of the
process of perception is carried on without our consciousness--the
mental sensation merely follows--and sensation simply supposes a
"sentient being and a certain manner in which that being is affected,"
"which leaves us much where we were, as far as the subjectivity of our"
"such further specifications as that it also suggested human features, or"
"looked like an ass or a dog, or that while it came under the category of a"
"lion-lamb, it yet had some of the features of a normal lamb. At all events"
we must not credit the Babylonians or Assyrians with so absurd a belief as
that an ewe could actually produce a lion. Such a supposition is at once
disposed of when we come to other texts where we find entries of an ewe
"producing a whole series of animals--a jackal, dog, fox, panther, hyena,"
"gazelle, etc. and where we must perforce assume resemblances between a"
young lamb and the animals in question and not any extravagant views of
"possible cross-breeding[79]. To clinch the matter, we have quite a number"
of passages in which the preposition 'like' is introduced[80] instead of
"the direct equation, showing that when the texts speak of an ewe giving"
"birth to a lion, a jackal, a dog, etc., the priests had in mind merely a"
resemblance as the basis of such statements.
The general idea associated with the lion in divination texts is that of
"power, success, increase and the like. The sign, therefore, of an ewe"
producing a lion is a favorable one; it is only through attendant
circumstances that the character of the sign is transformed into an
unfavorable or partly unfavorable omen. So in case the lion-lamb has a
"head suggestive of the variegated colors of the rainbow bird, the sign"
"still points to power, but to a power exercised by the crown prince"
against the father. If some of the features suggest those of an ass or of
"a dog or of a pig, the ideas associated with these animals convert what"
would otherwise have been a favorable sign into an unfavorable one. The
"mouth of a wild cow or of a bull, thus interfering with the complete"
"identification of the young lamb as a lion-lamb, similarly, brings about"
an unfavorable interpretation. Fatty flesh by a natural association points
"to increased prosperity, while mutilations of the head, tail or of any"
other part naturally carry with them unfavorable prognostications.
It is interesting to see from a long list of comparisons of a new-born
processes without which the mind of man is unable to grasp and to
"express itself, he would have taken refuge in an ineffable, though"
"not necessarily silent, contemplation of the underlying unity. This"
hypothesis is not a criticism of Croce's philosophy; it is merely the
"indication of the fact that, when the system appeared as completed,"
"new problems, and therefore new errors or new truths, were bound to"
grow out of the elements of the system itself. And nobody was more
"conscious of this fact than Croce himself, who concluded his volume on"
the _Filosofia della Pratica_ by expressly warning his readers of the
"inexhaustibility of thought, which is one with the infinity of reality"
"and of life. No philosophical system is final, because life itself"
"has no end. Every system of philosophy, being conditioned by life,"
"can do no more than solve a group of problems historically given, and"
prepare the conditions for new problems and new systems. Of his own
"work in relation to his readers, he conceived as of nothing more than"
an instrument of work.
In these last few chapters we shall see Croce himself at work on
"the new problems generated by his own system, trying ""more rigidly"
"to eliminate the last remnants of naturalism, and to put a stronger"
"accent on the spiritual unity,""[1] yet constantly defending his"
"conception of the spirit as the unity of distinctions, especially"
against the mystical tendencies of the new actual idealism. While
"never, in the course of his whole life, has he limited his activity to"
"mere systematic thinking, during the last eleven years he has shown"
"a more marked tendency to return from a philosophy, which is all a"
"meditation of the formal problems of history, to those concrete works"
"of history, by which he was started on his philosophical career; to"
"return to them, however, with a mind in which the original uncertainty"
and obscurity has given place to a definite consciousness of the nature
and purpose of history. The passage from the more philosophical to the
more historical stage is marked by the publication of a fourth volume
There is another consideration which may be put forward to account for
one group of dream-symbolisms. It has been found that certain hysterical
subjects of old standing when in the hypnotic state are able to receive
"mental pictures of their own viscera, even though they may be quite"
"ignorant of any knowledge of the shape of these viscera. This _autoscopy_,"
"as it has been called, has been specially studied by Féré, Comar, and"
Sollier.[149] Hysteria is a condition which is in many respects closely
"allied to sleep, and if it is to be accepted as a real fact that autoscopy"
occasionally occurs in the abnormal psychic state of hypnotic sleep in
"hysterical persons, it is possible to ask whether it may not sometimes"
occur normally in the allied state of sleep. In the hypnotic state it
is known that parts of the organism normally involuntary may become
subject to the will; it is not incredible that similarly parts normally
insensitive may become sufficiently sensitive to reveal their own shape
"or condition. We may thus, indeed, the more easily understand those"
premonitory dreams in which the dreamer becomes conscious of morbid
conditions which are not perceptible to waking consciousness until they
have attained a greater degree of intensity.[150]
The recognition of the transformation in dream life of internal
sensations into symbolic motor imagery is ancient. Hippocrates said that
"to dream, for instance, of springs and wells denoted some disturbance of"
"the bladder. In such a case a disturbed bladder sends to the brain, not"
"the naked message of its own needs, but a symbolic message of those needs"
"in motor imagery, as (in one case known to me) of a large cistern with"
a stream of water flowing from it.[151] Sometimes the symbolism aroused
by visceral processes remains physiological; thus indigestion frequently
"leads to dreams of eating, as of chewing all sorts of inedible and"
"repulsive substances, and occasionally--it would seem more abnormally--to"
agreeable dreams of food.
"It is due to the genius of Professor Sigmund Freud, of Vienna--to-day"
"favoured by the initiated in the mysteries, and was openly used by them"
to denote that future bliss which secretly was understood to consist in
divine wedlock. Hence the scene upon this vase would at once suggest to
"those who were familiar with the doctrines of the mysteries, that the"
"youth, being presumably of the number of the initiated, had found in"
death the realisation of his happy hopes and had entered into blissful
union with the goddess of the lower world.
*       *       *       *       *
To sum up briefly: we have seen alike in the literature of ancient
Greece and in the folk-songs of modern Greece that death has commonly
been conceived by the Hellenic race in the guise of a wedding; a review
of marriage-customs and funeral-customs both ancient and modern has
"re-affirmed the constant association of death and marriage, and has"
shown how deep-rooted in the minds of the common people that idea must
have been which produced a deliberate assimilation of funeral-rites
to the ceremonies of marriage. Next we investigated the connexion
"of the mysteries with the popular religion, and saw reason to hold"
"that, far from being subversive of it or alien to it, they inculcated"
doctrines which were wholly evolved from vaguer popular ideas always
"current in Greece. Finally we traced in many of those legends, on which"
the dramatic representations of the mysteries are known to have been
"based, a common _motif_, the idea that death is the entrance for men"
into a blissful estate of wedded union with their deities. And this
"religious ideal not only satisfies the condition of agreement with,"
"and evolution from, those popular views in which death figured somewhat"
"vaguely as a form of wedding, but also proves to be the natural and"
necessary outcome of two religious sentiments with which earlier
"chapters have dealt; first, the ardent desire for close communion with"
"the gods, and secondly, the belief that men’s bodies as well as their"
souls survived death and dissolution; for if the body by means of its
"obvious to every one, the place of science. It is not the less true,"
"however, that wherever that method is applied, it reduces the living"
"reality of life and thought to a heap of dead, immovable abstractions."
There is no real danger in this as long as the abstractions are taken
"for what they are, and used as instruments for the purposes of our"
doing and understanding; but when they are considered as a complete
"equivalent of the living reality, then we become their prisoners, and"
are shut out by them from all possibility of true understanding.
It is especially from the misuses of this method in the historical
"and moral sciences, from the degenerations of sociology, psychology,"
"and philology, that we must be constantly on guard; lest in the very"
sciences of the human spirit we should miss that which is their true
"object, the human activity which creates the world of history and the"
values of life.
"Modern thought, at the end of the Renaissance, begins with an attempt"
"at eliminating that static conception of truth, in which both Platonism"
and naturalism find the roots of their transcendence. This is the
"origin of the idea of Progress, first established by Bruno, by Bacon,"
"by Pascal, by Vico, in the form of a correlation between truth and"
time. MediÃ¦val thought had been shackled for centuries by the authority
"of the ancients; the new thinkers invoked the authority of antiquity,"
"of old age, and, therefore, of wisdom, not for the distant ages, in"
"which the world could be said to be still young and inexperienced, but"
"for their own times, in which it was possible to add a perpetually"
new experience and thought to that which had been bequeathed by the
thinkers of Greece and Rome. The consequence of this attitude was the
"discovery of the immanence of truth in life, the liberation from the"
principle of authority (which had been the characteristic mediÃ¦val
"form of transcendence), and a vigorous impulse towards the recognition"
"of the dynamic nature of reality, of what an American philosopher"
called the continuity of the ideal with the real. The thought that
"extended tendency of the mind, and has, during recent years, been"
elaborately studied. We thus have the basis of that psychic phenomenon
"which is variously termed secondary personality, double personality,"
"duplex personality, multiple personality, alternation of personality,"
"etc.,[172] and in earlier ages was regarded as due to possession by"
demons. Such conditions seem to be usually associated with hysteria.
"The essential fact about hysteria is, according to Janet, its lack of"
"synthetising power, which is at the same time a lack of attention and"
"of apperception, and has as its result a disintegration of the field of"
"consciousness into mutually exclusive parts; that is to say, there is a"
"process of dissociation. Now that is a condition resembling, as we have"
"seen, the condition found in dreaming. It is not, therefore, difficult to"
"accept the view of Sollier and others, that hysteria is a condition allied"
"to sleep, a condition of vigilambulism in which the patients are often"
"unable to obtain normal sleep, simply because they are all the time in a"
state of abnormal sleep; as one said to Sollier: 'I cannot sleep because I
am asleep all the time.' It may thus be the case that hysterical multiple
personalities[173] furnish a pathological analogue of that tendency to the
dramatic objectivation of portions of our personality which is normal and
healthy in dreams.
Similarly in insanity we have an even more constant and pronounced
tendency for the subject to attribute his own sensations to imaginary
"individuals, and to create personalities out of portions of the real"
"personality. All the illusions, delusions, and hallucinations of the"
insane are merely the manifold manifestations of this tendency. Without it
the insanity would not exist. It is not because he is subjected to unusual
"sensations--visionary, auditory, tactile, olfactory, visceral, etc.--that"
a man is insane. It is because he creates imaginary personalities to
account for these sensations; if his food tastes strange some one has
given him poison if he hears a strange voice it is some one communicating
with him by telephones or microphones or hypnotism; if he feels a strange
"miraculous, world-commanding;--smoothing the way for all greatness and"
"all goodness, and guiding the happy Soul from joy to joy, from glory to"
"glory, till Heaven itself is reached and the perfection of all love and"
"life begins. For true humility is not slavish, as some people imagine,"
"but rather royal, since, while acknowledging the supremacy of God, it"
"claims close kindred with Him, and is at once invested with all the"
"diviner virtues. Fame and wealth, the two perishable prizes for which"
"men struggle with one another in ceaseless and cruel combat, bring no"
absolute satisfaction in the end--they are toys that please for a time
and then grow wearisome. But the conquering of Self is a battle in
"which each fresh victory bestows a deeper content, a larger happiness,"
"a more perfect peace,--and neither poverty, sickness, nor misfortune"
"can quench the courage, or abate the ardor, of the warrior who is"
absorbed in a crusade against his own worser passions. Egotism is the
"vice of this age,--the maxim of modern society is ""each man for"
"himself, and no one for his neighbor""--and in such a state of things,"
"when personal interest or advantage is the chief boon desired, we"
"cannot look for honesty in either religion, politics, or commerce. Nor"
can we expect any grand work to be done in art or literature. When
"pictures are painted and books are written for money only,--when"
"laborers take no pleasure in labor save for the wage it brings,--when"
no real enthusiasm is shown in anything except the accumulation of
"wealth,--and when all the finer sentiments and nobler instincts of men"
"are made subject to Mammon worship, is any one so mad and blind as to"
think that good can come of it? Nothing but evil upon evil can accrue
"from such a system,--and those who have prophetic eyes to see through"
"the veil of events can perceive, even now, the not far distant"
"end--namely, the ruin of the country that has permitted itself to"
"degenerate into a mere nation of shopkeepers,--and something worse"
"than ruin,--degradation!"
"It was past eight in the evening when Alwyn, after having spent a"
"usefulness is, to say the least, very doubtful."
By some of his adversaries Croce himself has been classed as a
pragmatist. It is no wonder that certain distinctions should escape
"the attention of men who live to-day as exiles from distant centuries,"
"and whose critical sight is, therefore, not clearer then that of an"
owl fluttering in the noonday sun. But the only relation that I
can think of between Croce and the pragmatists is that he advocates
"an economic theory not of truth, but of error; that he finds in the"
passions and practical interests of men the root of intellectual
error. The problem of the positive relations between life and thought
"has been treated by him, as we know, in a very different spirit from"
"that of the pragmatists; and in the circle of the human spirit, the"
"ideal precedence is given by him, not to the practical but to the"
"theoretical. On the other hand, in the actual process of time, all"
"forms of human activity are reciprocally conditioned, and under"
"this respect Croce's thought can be called, and has been called by"
"himself, a new pragmatism, but ""of a kind of which pragmatists have"
"never thought, or at least which they have never been able to discern"
"from the others, and to bring out in full relief. If life conditions"
"thought, we have in this fact the clearly established demonstration of"
the always historically conditioned form of every thought: and not of
"art only, which is always the art of a time, of a soul, of a moment,"
"but of philosophy also, which can solve but the problems that life"
"proposes. Every philosophy reflects, and cannot help reflecting, the"
"preoccupations, as they are called, of a determined historical moment;"
"not, however, in the quality of its solutions (because in this case it"
"would be a bad philosophy, a partisan or passional philosophy), but in"
"the quality of its problems. And because the problem is historical,"
"and the solution eternal, philosophy is at the same time contingent and"
"eternal, mortal and immortal, temporary and extratemporary.""[1] Croce's"
"conception of truth is his philosophy, and it is not my intention to"
"culture, but of the sheer break-up of the intellectual ice of the old"
"regimen. In Denmark the process is curiously instructive. Christian II,"
"personally a capable and reformative but cruel tyrant, aimed throughout"
"his life at reducing the power alike of the clergy and the nobles, and"
to that end sought on the one hand to abolish serfdom and educate the
"poor and the burghers,[674] and on the other to introduce Lutheranism"
"(1520). From the latter attempt he was induced to desist, doubtless"
surmising that the remedy might for him be a new disease: but on his
enforcing the reform of slavery he was rebelled against and forced to
"fly by the nobility, who thereupon oppressed the people more than"
"ever.[675] His uncle and successor, Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein,"
accepted the mandate of the nobles to the extent of causing to be
publicly burned in his presence all the laws of the last reign in favour
"of the peasants, closing the poor schools throughout the kingdom,"
"burning the new books,[676] and pledging himself to expel Lutheranism."
"He seems, however, to have been secretly a Protestant, and to have"
"evaded his pledge; and the rapid spread of the new heresy, especially in"
"the cities, brought about a new birth of popular literature in the"
"vernacular, despite the suppression of the schools.[677] In a few years'"
"time, Frederick, recognising the obvious interest of the crown, and"
"finding the greater nobles in alliance with the clergy, made common"
"cause with the smaller nobility, and so was able (1527) to force on the"
"prelates, who could hope for no better terms from the exiled king, the"
"toleration of Protestantism, the permission of marriage to the clergy,"
and a surrender of a moiety of the tithes.[678] A few years later (1530)
the monasteries were either stormed by the populace or abandoned by the
"monks, their houses and lands being divided among the municipalities,"
"the king and his courtiers, and the secular clergy.[679] After a stormy"
"interregnum, in which the Catholic party made a strenuous reaction, the"
"next king, Christian III, taking the nobles and commons-deputies into"
"partnership, made with their help an end of the Catholic system; the"
"remaining lands, castles, and manors of the prelates going to the crown,"
"played so large a part in religious manifestations, it is well known"
that the sense of rising and floating in the air has often prominently
"appeared. St. Theresa occasionally felt herself lifted above the ground,"
and was fearful that this sign of divine favour would attract attention
"(though we are not told that that was the case), while St. Joseph of"
"Cupertino, Christina the Wonderful, St. Ida of Louvain, with many another"
"saint enshrined in the _Acta Sanctorum_, were permitted to experience this"
sensation; and since its reality is as convincing in the ecstatic state as
"it is in dreams, the saints have often been able to declare, in perfect"
"good faith, that their levitation was real.[127] In all great religious"
"movements among primitive peoples, similar phenomena occur, together"
"with other nervous and hallucinatory manifestations. They occurred, for"
"instance, in the great Russian religious movement which took place among"
the peasants in the province of Kief during the winter of 1891-2. The
"leader of the movement, a devout member of the Stundist sect, a man with"
"alcoholic heredity, who had received the revelation that he was saviour"
"of the world, used not only to perceive perfumes so exquisite that they"
"could only, as he was convinced, emanate from the Holy Ghost, but during"
"prayer, together with a feeling of joy, he also had a sensation of bodily"
lightness and of floating in the air. His followers in many cases had
"the same experiences, and they delighted in jumping up into the air and"
shouting. In these cases the reality of the sensory obtuseness of the skin
"as an element in the manifestations was demonstrated, for Ssikorski, who"
"had an opportunity of investigating these people, found that many of them,"
"when in the ecstatic condition, were completely insensible to pain."
The sensation of flying is one of the earliest to appear in the dreams
of childhood.[128] It is sometimes the last sensation at the moment of
"death. To rise, to fall, to glide away, has often been the last conscious"
"sensation recalled by those who seemed to be dying, but have afterwards"
"been brought back to life. Those rescued from drowning, for instance, have"
sometimes found that the last conscious sensation was a beatific feeling
"other European languages; on one hand it denotes the actual doing, the"
"immediacy of life, on the other, the thinking that seems to follow"
"the doing, the consciousness of life. In a rough, approximate way, we"
"speak of men who make history, and of other men who think or write"
history--though we are all perfectly aware of the fact that we cannot
"make history without first thinking history, that the action, in other"
"words, follows a judgment of the situation, which is an elementary form"
"of historical thought, and is accompanied by its own consciousness,"
"which is its immediate history. In this sense, the action cannot be"
materially severed from its history: the distinction between the two
"is a purely formal and ideal one. And again, the thinking of history,"
"in the second meaning of the word, consists in making present to our"
"spirit, in re-living, an action or group of actions, which thus"
"become as actual an experience as any practical doing, a fragment"
"of our own life, and, ultimately, the consciousness of our own"
individual experience. Thus the two meanings which stand out as sharply
"contrasting when we objectify and solidify them, as an external,"
"chronological series of happenings, and as a formal discipline"
"attempting to give, in innumerable books, a description and as it were"
"a verbal duplicate of that series, once we examine them in the light"
"of our consciousness, reveal themselves merely as different aspects or"
moments of the same spiritual process.
Croce's latest writings on history may be puzzling to the average
reader because this ambiguity cannot be overcome by him unless he is
"willing to penetrate to the heart of Croce's doctrine, in which the"
word history acquires a more pregnant and fundamental meaning. In
many of us there is a tendency to balk at any attempt at filling old
words with deeper and more precise connotations; but philosophy is
not a matter of words. A new thought will in any case alter the whole
"physiognomy of our vocabulary, and to stand up for the old meanings"
"is as much as to refuse to think, or rather, to refuse to live. For"
So far we have been concerned with the tendency in dreams to objectify
portions of the body by constructing out of them new personalities.
But precisely the same process goes on in sleep with regard to our
thoughts and feelings. We split off portions of these also and construct
"other personalities out of them, and sometimes even endow the persons"
thus formed with thoughts and feelings more native to our own normal
personality than those which we reserve for ourselves. Thus a lady who
dreamed that when walking with a friend she discovered a species of
"animal fruit, a kind of damson containing a snail, expressed her delight"
at finding a combination so admirably adapted to culinary purposes; it
"was the friend who, retaining the attitude of her own waking moments,"
uttered an exclamation of disgust. Most of the dreams in which there is
any dramatic element are due to this splitting up of personality; in
our dreams we may experience shame or confusion from the rebukes or the
"arguments of other persons, but the persons who administer the rebuke or"
apply the argument are still ourselves.[167]
Some writers on dreaming have marvelled greatly at this tendency of
"the sleeping mind to objectify portions of itself, and so to create"
imaginary personalities and evolve dramatic situations. It has seemed
to them quite unaccountable except as the outcome of a special gift of
"imagination appertaining to sleep. Yet, remarkable as it is, this process"
is simply the inevitable outcome of the conditions under which psychic
life exists during sleep. If we realise that a more or less pronounced
"degree of dissociation of the contents of the mind occurs during sleep,"
"and if we also realise that, sleeping fully as much as waking, mind is"
"a thing that instinctively reasons, and cannot refrain from building up"
"hypotheses, then we may easily see how the personages and situations of"
"dreams develop. Much the same process might, under some circumstances,"
"occur in waking life. If, for instance, we heard an unknown voice speaking"
"behind a curtain, we could not fail to build up an imaginary person in"
"connection with that voice, the characteristics of the imaginary person"
"survivals of Platonism are relics of formalistic logic, still very"
"frequent in contemporary culture, and a belief in what might be called"
"average truth, mechanically extracted from an external and material"
"consensus of opinions. But with this conception of truth, we touch the"
border line between idealistic and naturalistic transcendentalism.
The most common attitude of contemporary thought (and the one that is
"therefore usually designated as common sense, and as such opposed to"
philosophy) is a naively naturalistic one. But it would be a mistake
"to regard it as a simple and spontaneous attitude, and to identify it,"
"for instance, with the naÃ¯ve intuition of the artist, with a first"
grade of knowledge as yet untroubled by logical problems. The artist's
"vision is more distant from naturalism than the philosopher's concept,"
"since common sense, however unreflected and illogical, is in itself"
"a philosophy, and, though it may sound paradoxical, a transcendental"
one. The artist constantly identifies himself with his object; in his
"consciousness, the distinction between subject and object has not"
yet arisen. But the naÃ¯ve naturalism of which we are now speaking
"is posterior to the logical judgment, in which that distinction"
first appears; and is obtained by keeping separate the two terms of
"the judgment, each of which exists only in relation to the other,"
and by transforming that relation into a quality of the object. The
unity thus disrupted is artificially reconstituted by abolishing the
"subject, that is, by treating the subject itself as merely an object"
"among many objects, or as a mere abstract intersection of objects. It"
"is with this form of naturalism that realism generally coincides, and"
its abstracting process is the one that has been recently systematized
by the New Realists. The justification of the naturalistic conception
"of truth, as truth of description, and the motive of its present"
"popularity, is that it rests on a method of knowledge which is"
"indispensable to the natural and mathematical sciences, and that the"
"sciences have come to usurp, in modern times, for reasons which are"
"practical nature, and subjecting itself entirely to the form which"
"expresses it. Thus the Ã¦sthetic activity, because bent on realizing"
"its own universality, which is the perfection of its form, imposes on"
the artist a morality and a discipline which cannot be identified with
"practical morality, with the discipline of life. The sincerity of the'"
"artist is of another order than that of the practical man, though (we"
can never repeat it too often) Ã¦sthetic virtues being incommensurable
"with moral values, his work as an artist does not exempt him from his"
duties as a man.
This further determination of the concept of expression is used by
Croce to clarify a distinction which had already been adumbrated
"in the Estetica; the distinction between poetic, intellectual, and"
"practical expression, between the word in which the pure intuition"
"embodies itself, the word which is a sign or symbol of thought, and"
"the word which is an instrument for the awakening of the emotions, a"
"preparation for action. Thus the old categories of poetry, prose, and"
"oratory reappear, but no longer as criteria of material classification,"
no longer to be identified with classes or genres of expression. They
"become synonyms, respectively, of the Ã¦sthetic, the logical, and the"
practical activity; to be used as instruments of literary and artistic
"criticism, if the critic is willing to renounce all external helps and"
"material standards, and to penetrate into the ""individuality of the"
"act, where only it is given to him to discern the different spiritual"
"dispositions, and what is poetry from what is not poetry. Under the"
"semblance of prose, in a comedy or in a novel, we may find a true and"
"deeply felt lyric; as under that of verse, in a tragedy or in a poem,"
"nothing but reflection and oratory.""[3] It is easy to perceive how this"
distinction will also react on Croce's theory of language as intuition
"and expression, not by altering its initial position, but by offering"
"new means for the empirical analysis of the facts of language, the"
nature of which is obviously determined by the kind of impulse which

Itwas Bob Engel.
"Oh, well, I know all aboutthat."
I don't understand that.
Track 2 is Chile.
"[Nixon] Yeah, Chile, the Congo, Guadalajara, Iran, Cuba."
"Whereverthere was need for an executive action capability, there's Track 2."
"In Cuba, Track 1 was, uh, the Bay of Pigs invasion."
[Chuckles] Track 2 was our idea.
We thoughtthat the invasion wouldn'twork... unless we got rid ofCastro.
"So we asked ourselves, uh, who else wants Castro dead?"
Was itthe Mafia ormoney people?
So we puttogether Track 2.
[Gunfire]
"Firstassassination attempt was, uh, in '60."

"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."

"Kyoko."""
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane."" So this is our Grandma, right?"
-eleven!

"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."

A film by AKIRA KUROSAWA
RHAPSODY IN AUGUST
A Kurosawa Production
Presented by Feature film Enterprise 2
"Today, Supreme Allied headquarters reported American combat troops and aircraft have completely routed the attacking German army at the Ardennes front."
"American troops have discovered the frozen corpses of over 70 fellow GIs, taken prisoner then fiendishly executed by their German captors."
Investigating officers at the nightmarish scene say the massacre happened at a small crossroads near the Belgian town of Malmedy.
"General Eisenhower has vowed that upon war's end, all German officers and soldiers responsible for this unspeakable act will be vigorously tried for war crimes and swiftly punished."
"This is Armed Forces Radio, London."
"Ah, cigarettes."
What is this?
My wife.
You speak German?
Hmm.
Please...
Here.
Thanks.
Halt!
Halt!
Out!
Out!
Now!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I surrender!
"Get down, get down low."
Hello!
Is anyone home?
Come in.
It's cold in here.
Light the stove.
Ach!
It's foul.
Not like mom's house.
"Yeah, a little louder."
I do not ...
"WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM WHAT OPPONENTS COULD EXPECT FROM HIM,"
"ROBINSON REPLIED, ""THEY BETTER BE ROUGH ON ME,"
"BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE ROUGH ON THEM."""
RACHEL ROBINSON:
"JACK SAID, ""WE'VE GOT THIS THING GOING."
"""THE TEAM IS WINNING."
I'M DOING WELL.
"I'M GONNA SPEAK OUT."""
AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHALLENGE OTHER BALLPLAYERS
AND CHALLENGE UMPIRES WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE.
MAN AS JACKIE:
SPORTSWRITERS SEEMED TO COME DIRECTLY TO ME
WHENEVER THERE WAS A HINT OF A STORY.
THEY KNEW I WOULD SAY WHAT I THOUGHT.
THEY KNEW I WOULDN'T BACK DOWN IF I GOT INTO TROUBLE...
THAT I WOULDN'T WHINE THAT I WAS MISQUOTED.
"IT FELT GOOD TO BREATHE FREELY, TO SPEAK OUT WHEN I WANTED TO."
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, ROBINSON PLAYED BETTER THAN HE EVER HAD."
"BY MID-JULY, HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN HITS, BATTING AVERAGE,"
"STOLEN BASES, AND RUNS BATTED IN."
"WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE TALLIED FOR THE 1949 ALL-STAR GAME,"
ONLY RED SOX OUTFIELDER TED WILLIAMS HAD RECEIVED MORE.
CARL ERSKINE:
"YOU KNOW, KIDS, THEY'RE HONEST."
"AND WHEN A KID CAME BACK 3 TIMES FOR MY AUTOGRAPH, I SAID,"
"""WHY WOULD YOU WANT THREE OF MINE?"""
"WELL, HE WAS HONEST."
"HE SAID, ""ACTUALLY I WANT SIX."""
"""IF I CAN GET SIX OF YOURS,"""
"""I COULD TRADE IT FOR ONE OF JACKIE ROBINSON'S."""
NARRATOR:
--It's been called off --Who called off?
--Sorokin called me.
"--Why didn't you say anything, moron?"
But our main thing was to liquidate this military cell in a touristy spot
--So you haven't knocked down a single garage?
--Sure did.
Gaeva's.
--Did it early in the morning --Gaeva's was permanent and not subject to demolition
"You're mistaken, Pavel Ivanovich."
It was subject to it
I started off with hers.
You need to see me?
"--He's not in, Pavel Ivanovich --I know, I know, he's at the clinic"
"When he shows up, connect us"
Why are you following me?
I thought I explained it all in detail
What else?
"Natalya, where's Galkina."
Don't you hear me?
--I'm talking to you --I'm on my break
--Everyone has a right to take a rest --We know all about that right
--Run out and find her --Let those with bonus pay run around
"--In that case, you're fired --Oh, I'm so scared"
"Comrade, are you Vasin?"
Vasin speaking.
Hello.
Hello?
"Comrade, so then you are Vasin?"
I am Vasin
--Hello --Semenov?
--Yeah
--Is your bulldozer gone?
Mother who is she?
She is Shiau Fu's daughter?
Should we kill her too to prevent future problems?
"No, you can't kill her"
You can't kill her why?
Because she's my wife
I am a member of wu Dong wu Dong School
Let's go
Sister Bu Huei
Mom
"Sister Bu Huei, don't cry any more"
Sister Bu Huei
Please don't cry
Sister Bu Huei
"""The tomb of wang Nan Gou"""
"""The tomb of wu Ching Niu"""
"""The tomb of Ji Shiau Fu"""
Let's go
You know where my father is?
I don't
Regardless of whether I know
I'll take you to him
"Okay, you'll be alright in a few days"
How come you know how to treat wounds?
I have lived at wu Ching Niu's place for 1 0 years and he taught me
You are from wu Dong why did you stay at a Ming Cult member's home?
My foster father was a member of Ming Cult who was he?
Golden haired lion Tse Shun
Golden haired lion
Isn't the Dragon Sabre with him?
"True, that's why so many people are looking for him"
"I know where he is, but I won't tell"
"... rightoutfromunderme, and now she sashays into town..."
... andsellsit  to those unfortunate scoundrels...

[LAUGHS]
"-Well, this is a fine deal, Mr. Brown."
"-We can still drink here, right?"
"-Hello, boys."
-Mary.
"-Ezra, may I speak to you for a moment?"
-Of course.
I just got this wire from a certain Preston Wingo.
He owns the Cattle Baron Hotel over in Snellville.
It concerns your mother.
"Oh, Mother?"
Are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Preston Wingo?
I know a fat little weasel called Preston Wingo.
-What about him?
"-Well, this Wingo has slandered you."
Mary just received a telegraph...
... claimingthatyouabsconded with a pair of diamond cuff links.
He's demanding you be jailed until he arrives.
Jailed?
I'm no thief.
"Yes, of course not..."
"... butunfortunately, the burden of proof is on you."
"Now, I would suggest that Mary search your bag..."
... justsoyoumightacquityourself of these ridiculous charges.
MARY:
"Sorry, Maude."
This is so tiresome.
My own son.
Looks like Mr. Wingo was wrong.
Surely a few hours' sleep wouldn't--
Contact me if you find anything else.
[Solemn instrumental music]
"-Is there a problem, Corporal?"
"-No, ma'am."
-Why are you guarding this chamber?
-Captain's orders.
[Solemn instrumental music continues]
-Lieutenant Reed's report.
-What?
You requested a tactical analysis of the Insectoid ship.
Later.
ARCHER:
Are we ready?
TRIP:
"Just a few seconds, Captain."
T'POL:
There are two macos posted outside.
I asked Major Hayes to assign them.
These eggs are vulnerable.
There are breaches in the outer hull.
ARCHER:
There could be predators around.
"Aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on this planet."
ARCHER:
Trip.
TRIP:
We're ready.
"Start at 40 megajoules, but keep an eye on that matrix converter."
Take it up to 50.
Trip?
ARCHER:
Please:!
What are you waiting for?
- Pull her out of there!
"- Buck, please:!"
Hurry:!
Pull her out of there:!
Help her before it's too late!
"Buck, please!"
[Screaming]
How can you ignore her?
She's...
[Explosion]
I cannot believe it:
Wilma a fake like the others?
How did you know?
Wilma doesn't frighten easily:
She was too upset when she was alone with me and too convinced you were an impostor:
Watch your legs:
Then it was the: : :
Double of Wilma who: : :
Somehow let the others know where we were going:
We're no closer to finding that hangar deck than we were before:
But at least we know where not to look:
Let's go:

Om!
My sister-in-law is here
Whose sister-in-law?
"Agesha, your bride"
Be seated
Your only daughter?
Yes
Lovely...
What...?
Tree
That tree is about a hundred years old
And this is a lovely house
And this house is also about a hundred years old
Even my brother is hundred years old
Can I ask you something?
Straight from the heart...
Love's no tv show for fun
Love is life.
"Love is an emotion... that touches hearts, enthralls for a lifetime, forever"
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?"
How do you manage that candour?
I remember the sincerity with which you showed me your childhood photo
That sincerity I liked.
I see that candour in you again
Can I ask you one more thing?
What will it be for you?
An arranged marriage or love marriage?
Love marriage
"One day, I met her... and she enthralled me"
When she held my gaze...

It's quicker
"--Keep going --Come now, Pavel Ivanovich, don't I know this city?"
Spending government money driving around in zig-zags
So you caught me now?
"Yes, we caught you"
--Wait here.
--It was supposed to be 20 minutes and it's been almost 2 hours now
You may go.
I no longer need you.
--Aren't you ashamed?
No?
--Pavel Ivanovich...!
"I called but couldn't reach you, try to understand me"
Knock it down!
--Young people why are you stealing the materials?
"--No, the guard let us take it"
--Hello --Howdy
"OK, guys, stand up, get closer, let's take the photo"
"--Hello --Hello, Comrade Vasin"
"Sasha, look who's here"
"Comrade, please move over to the left"
Cut in a little more
--Ready?
--One second.
Sasha!
"Comrades, I want to know what is happening here?"
A wedding
"In that case, I wish to congratulate the young couple"
--that's first of all.
And second...
--The young couple is us
"Then I congratulate you, but I request that you clear the premises."
Full alert.
"Tricorder readings, Mr. Spock."
Life detection.
"Those messages we got, captain, the one directing us here yesterday..."
Faked.
All this happened several days ago.
"Lang, over there."
Look for survivors.
"Kelowitz, that way."
"O'Herlihy, stick with me."
"Captain, impulses that direction."
"Very weak, possibly a survivor."
"Come on, Bones."
"Captain's log, stardate 3045.6."
The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus III.
"On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed."
"Captain, over there."
- Careful.
- Careful.
"Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain."
"He's in a bad way, captain."
"Keep him alive, Bones."
I want to know what's been happening here.
"Getting another life reading, captain."
- Survivors?
- Not survivors.
Not warm-blooded.
"Living creatures, but not human."
Where?
"Azimuth, 93 degrees."
"Range, 1570 yards."
O'Herlihy.

Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sailed
To a dream that ended too soon
Now I know exactly
Who I am and what I'm here for
You are a toy!
You can't fly!
And I will go sailing
No more
"But no, it can't be true"
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believed I could fly
"Why, I'd fly"
To infinity and beyond!

"You know, if Hunt and the others are C.I.A., why don'twe just dump this back in the C.I.A.'s lap, let Dick Helms take the fall?"
- Because.
- [Drink Pouring]
"Because Helms knows, knows too much."
"Lfthere's anyone in this country who knows more than me, it's Hoover and Helms, and you don'tfuck with Dick Helms, period."
All right.
"Butwhy, if Kennedy was so clean in all this,"
- didn't he cancel Track 2?
- Because he didn'teven know about it.
"The C.I.A., uh, nevertold him."
They just kept it going.
"It had a life of its own like itwas some, uh, kind of a thing, you know?"
It doesn'teven know itexists.
Iteats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.
"[Nixon On Tape] Two days afterthe Bay of Pigs,"
- Kennedy called me and reamed me out.
"- [""Fever""]"
He justfound out aboutTrack 2.
- You nevertold him?
- I didn'twant him to getthe credit.
He said I'd stabbed him in the back... and called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
Fever if I kissed you fever if I held you tight
- Huh.
- Fever in the morning
- Feverall through the night
- That's the lasttime I ever saw him.

"[Newscaster] In a surprise Christmas bombing of Hanoi,"
Nixon delivered more tonnage than was used at Dresden in World War II.
It is without doubt the most brutal bombing in American history.
Newspapers are calling it a Stone Age tactic... and Nixon a maddened tyrant.

"""When the Vietnamese take the Paris peace talks seriously, I'll stop. """

"STUDY THEIR CUSTOMS, OBEY THEIR RULES,"
AND WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP THIS PLANET SAFE.
"DURING THIS MISSION, YOU FOUR MUST APPEAR TO THE HUMANS"
"AS MACHINES, ROBOTS IN DISGUISE."
WHAT?
WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
"ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"
THE IDEA THAT ALIEN BEINGS ARE LIVING AMONG THEM
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE PANIC.
SO WE CAN HELP THE HUMANS AS LONG AS WE HIDE OUR TRUE SELVES?
"YOU ARE RIGHT TO QUESTION WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR TEAM, HEATWAVE."
THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAD THIS MISSION.
"TO MAINTAIN YOUR COVER,"
YOU WILL EACH ADOPT A VEHICLE MODE BASED ON EARTH TECHNOLOGY.

"I don't like being tied down, treated like a servant."
"I would never treat you that way, Maudie."
Never ever.
Would you be willing to put that in writing?
"If it meant Maudie would marry me, yes, I would."

So be it.
The mayor loves BankExchange but can't afford infrastructure.
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp...

Every man in this territory has a right to a fair trial.
I couldn't agree more.
Which is why I have been retained by the good people of Eagle Bend...

-Hell you will.
"Crime was committed in Eagle Bend, Your Honor."
It's their right.

But the folks gossip about it here and there
What did my father say?
"He quoted book ofDante Alighieri's, my prince"
"You follow me, the others can keep talking"
"It is enough for today, my Mustafa."
But no dodging.
You'll study hard
"Are our horses ready, İbrahim?"
"Yes, your Majesty"
"WHEN BOBBY HIT THE HOME RUN,"
EVERYBODY STARTED LEAVING THE FIELD.
JACKIE STOOD AT SECOND BASE
AND MADE SURE THAT BOBBY THOMSON STEPPED ON EACH BAG.
TYPICAL.
"YOU KNOW, WITH EVERYTHING ELSE,"
"UH, HE WAS STILL DOING HIS JOB."
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK SUDDENLY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.
AND HE BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN HIS LEGS.
NARRATOR:
"IN 1952, AT AGE 33,"
JACKIE ROBINSON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
THE DOCTOR ALSO FOUND
THAT HIS HEART WAS DETERIORATING.
IT WAS A SHOCK TO BOTH OF US
BECAUSE IT MEANT OUR LIVES WERE GOING TO CHANGE
FOREVER AFTER THAT.
AND THEY DID.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE
AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHAT CHANGES HE HAD TO MAKE
IN ORDER TO KEEP PLAYING.
NARRATOR:
KONO:
"All right, so it looks like she came alone."
"I'll pull up the surveillance footage from outside the Palace as well as nearby traffic cams, see where they went."
We got to find her before she forces Dalton to decrypt these files.
"Danny, grab some earplugs."
DANNY:
Why?
'Cause you're gonna need 'em.
"What are you doing, sir?"
If what I want doesn't happen I'll kill both of you
"Shiva, he killed Nitin"
"Yes, I killed him"
"Run, Maya"
"I waited for 2 years for this day, Shiva"
You cannot escape from me
Tell me where you have hidden Nitin
Grab him
"Shiva, don't"
I don't have time
My plan has to succeed
Aiyo!
Must keep this clean
This place looks abandoned
Look at the cobwebs
First check if he is breathing
"No, madam"
I did it for the welfare of the students
"How can you justify a murder, sir?"
Who is he?
He is Sridhar Our school teacher
Who is he?
He is Rangasamy
Correspondent of Alamelu school
What are you doing here?
Came to meet madam
Who is this?
Ravikumar the new teacher
I didn't kill him to get you caught
"Don't spare him, Shiva"
Oh God!
The City hunter... is you!
He recklessly ran around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor... became like that because of you!
You killer!
"Entered the country on April 13, 2011."
"On May 2nd, he came to work in Network Security and Communication in the Blue House."
"When the Blue House's IP was used during the Lee Kyung Wan incident, I met Professor Lee Yoon Sung in this room."
"When the Blue House's IP was used to hack the police CCTV system, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo came."
He was even there in the library looking for the Blue House Security Agent Album from 83'.
Is it Lee Yoon Sung?
Seoul Prosecutor's Office's Investigator Jang Pil Jae is here.
Okay.
Let him in.
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo was investigating two people he thought might be the City Hunter...
Lee Jin Pyo and professor Lee Yoon Sung.
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung?
Lee Jin Pyo was part of the Special Forces team.
And before 1983 he was definitely a bodyguard at the Blue House.
"However, he went missing after that."
So Prosecutor Kim Young Joo thought he definitely has something to do with the Sweep Mission.
"He now uses a new identity as Steve Lee, a Korean living in America."
But that's actually fake.
He was a drug lord in the Triangle...
although it's not confirmed yet.
Triangle.
Then Lee Yoon Sung?
"As expected, another Blue House bodyguard in 1983 who came from the Special Forces named Park Mu Yeol, and a woman named Lee Kyung Hee gave birth to him."
Park Moo Yeol and Lee Kyung Hee's...?
From what I found out...
Lee Jin Pyo took Lee Yoon Sung when he was 1 month old and raised him in the Triangle.
Wait.
I think the president noticed something.
Gretchen!
-My congratulations!
- Thanks.
-Take care!
-You too.
"Comrade mayor, the assignment has been fulfilled."
-Are you going back to the corps headquarters?
- l have my orders.
"Well, thanks, Olya."
This is the order number...
Considering the circumstances I order and declare Konstantin Gorelov and Lidia Kostromina a husband and a wife so that they may become a real family.
- My congratulations!
"- Thanks, comrade mayor."
I saw many parties.
Most ofthem were sad mourning occasions.
"Some were festive, but this party is the first one that can be called... a wedding one with the hope that both spouses will return home from this war alive."
Good luck to you!
For our victory!
-For our victory!
- For our victory!
- For our victory!
- Forthe newfamily!
-Thank you for coming.
- Thanks a lot.
You know I haven't forgotten all ofyou and recognize your voices...
-We'll neverforget you.
- Thanks to all ofyou.
-And for our victory!
- For our victory!
-Where they are?
-Where are the newly-weds?
"So, make wayfor me!"
We had an agreement...
--That doggy playground!
--The district will put it on this spot --What playground?
--What do you have in mind?
--A place to walk the dogs.
Cuz they've crapped all over town
And some people are following the dogs' example
--Is this some kind of a joke?
--This is no place for jokes
"--Pavel Ivanovich, did you call me?"
"--Comrades, that's all I have."
"--Alright, we'll talk elsewhere --We'll tell Efimov about your ideas."
He'll give you dogs to remember!
--Don't intimidate us.
Efimov is also quite manageable --We'll see about that
"No, comrade general, no exceptions for any Gaeva, sorry!"
Gaeva has a permanent garage that is not subject to demolishion

She's a dedicated worker
She works saturdays and sundays

"--No, she's here to get a piece of my apartment"
--Yep --Did I guess it right?
"You're mistaken, Comrade Vasin"

"SO, SAM, YOUR MOTHER --"
"UM, YOU'VE CITED HER AS BEING A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION --"
WAS ARRESTED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS
IN PROTESTS DURING THE '70s.
WHAT DOES SHE THINK ABOUT YOU BECOMING A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR?
"WELL, SHE PASSED AWAY BEFORE I GOT THE JOB, BUT..."
I HOPE SHE'D BE PROUD OF ME.
"WOULD SHE HAVE SUPPORTED YOUR PROSECUTION OF,"
"UH, MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES, FOR EXAMPLE?"
"WELL, NIGEL, MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME FROM AN EARLY AGE"
"TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE, PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE."
THE LAW'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.
THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PROSECUTES THOSE WHO BREAK IT.
WE DON'T DECIDE WHAT THE LAWS ARE.
"NO, BUT YOU PICK THE CASES YOU PURSUE."
"SO, THAT MEANS THERE IS A MORAL INTENT."
"NOW, IF 20 STATES HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION"
"FOR IT, UH,"
HOW CAN THE ISSUE BE BLACK-AND-WHITE?
BECAUSE IT IS.

"That makes me look bad, so no"
"Anyways, the report please"
Yes.
Someone seems to be home since last night
Ok.
Please lead us there
Yes ma'am.
Please follow me
He's been on a stakeout since last night?
Of course
"If he stayed, this old beast may have attacked me"
I was so scared!
I'm so sorry
Don't look this way evil one!
Yes
The final battle with this party...
They're on the fourth floor
I'm calling the police if they aren't there
They're there
Their lights were on until really late last night
I was watching his door from across the street
Didn't stop you from going shopping
I'm sorry...
Lin...
Let's go in!
Let's persuade her and bring her back home
I've never been so nervous
Are you ready?
Mr. Sexual Demon?
Ready baby!
"Stop using that gross language, Anti-sex-ed-man"
But we had permission
Nobody could permit to have a drinking binge in an unfinished building.
"You are all adults here, you should..."
I knew this would happen.
Shouldn't have lied to people!
"Attention, I am taking it now!"
Smile!
Only hurry up.
"Pavel, I came for you"
"--Hello, Pavel --Hello, Dina"
"--Hello, Pavel --Hello, Dina"
"Pavel, there's a therapist, Sklyansky, a brilliant professor"
"People wait for 2 years to see him, but he agreed to see you now"
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Pavel, I know all your principles, but could you get him into a co-op garage?"
"He's a worthy person, and it's nothing so bad really..."
--With pleasure --Really?
Yes.
This instance.
With great pleasure.
"Pavel...well... get in, let's go"
--I cannot --Why not?
"Dina, I already cured myself"
I used cowberry leaf!
"Galkina, write this down: fire the guard from construction site 3 for negligence"
--Where should I write it down?

--You may not
I wish to knock down my garage with my own hands
No I'll show you
Dare say I'm impotent?
Help
What happened to you?
I...
I've lost
Who are you?
Are you two having an affair?
"I'm calling the police, you are illegal immigrants I'll report you"
I'll sue you for breaking in
He's calling the police
"Never mind him, he's crazy..."
You say I'm crazy?
I'll beat you...
You want me to buy everything
Cassette player
Buy the whole of Hong Kong if you can
You want to buy everything

"--Pasha, the thought has nevereven crossed my mind..."
"--Excuse me, I must wake up early tomorrow"
Good night
"Pasha, you and I never used to fight"
"Just tell me, what has happened?"
"Have you fallen ill, my little hampster?"
--What's with you?
--What for?
"--What, my little one?"
--What do you paint your lips for in your old age?

Good boy!

I am at Dina's
"Dina, good morning, this is Vasin"
Lightened up a bit?
"Pavlik, listen to me carefully"
"First, you need to seek treatment."
"Take a vacation, drink some herbs, and so on"
"Second, Irina doesn't see that you're having a nervous breakdown And you must keep that in mind"
--Third...
"--Dina, tell her that I regret last night"
There you go!
Only you will say it to her yourself
I'm listening.
"Go ahead, Pavel"
--Desert --What?
"--Nothing --Pasha, do you recall the first word little Masha said?"
Remember?
"There is a place called Congo Square and this was the only place in the South where black people could actually have drums, 'cause that was outlawed."
"Sunday at Congo Square, these cats played that music to commune with their ancestral spirits."
That caused Europeans to start coming out on Sundays to check what was going on.
"This famous pianist,"
"I think his last name was Gottschalk, he wrote this thing called the ""Bamboula."""
His music was based on what he heard being played at Congo Square.
That was part of our natural evolution.
"What you doing tomorrow, Dave?"
- What's that?
- What you doing tomorrow?
Singing.
Nothing.
Feel like coming by my aunt's house and jamming?
- Yeah!
Absolutely.
- Cool.
- Could I?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Okay.
"- Sure, yeah!"
"She'll cook for us, too."
"That's the way we used to do it back in the day, with Jessie Hill, Professor Longhair, Dr. John."
- Go by her house...
"- Oh, my God, I would love to."
That'd be so fun.
The importance of the music to the people is what really blew me away.
How you doing?
"- How you making out, man?"
- All right.
"- This is my aunt, man."
- Hello.
Whoever doesn't think before talking will surely accept their punishment
I fell asleep.
How long did I sleep?
Plenty of time.
I didn't want to wake you up
What are the noises?
I have no idea
"Look, they are nicely shaped"
That's right

"İbrahim, these..."
These sculptures are the gift of his Majesty for me
Don't you like them?
"No, not that"
But what will my mother think about them?
"My Sultana, if you allow me I'd like to introduce someone to you"
Who?
Malkochoğlu
It is a great honor to meet you
"I wanted you to meet to Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey, my Sultana"
"He's a very brave, valuable Bey"
He brought the sculptures to here
So that's you
I heard nice things about you
How are you?
"We are praying for your health, my Sultana"
"Daye, keep an eye on Hatice"

Iwon't get to see her frequently
I charged Nigar.
She'll always be there

I feel like they-- They spit.
I pay attention to lyricists.
'Cause y'all might not know this.
I've been rapping 13 years of my life.
No?
She--
"The Black girl, ""Spit something."""
"I said, um..."
"I said, uh--"
That's what rappers always do.

"I think it's there, yeah."
Araucarians.
Lavoisier.
It is Lavoisier.
"Well done, Helen."
"Antoine Lavoisier, correct."
Well!
"I don't know about you, that was absolutely nailbiting!"
"Araucarians, you were breathing hot on the heels of you, Lutrophiles."
"Lutrophiles, you have won with 23."
"Araucarians, a valiant effort with 21, very well done."
"That means Lutrophiles, you're the winners, you go through to the semifinal, congratulations."
"Araucarians, bad luck, but valiantly played, my goodness me."

"I'm Marianne, I'm a quantitative analyst from London."
"Pascallywags, over to you."

Don't worry.
They did not notice whatsoever
Well done

Grand Vizier İbrahim Paşa his lordship
Welcome my Paşa

Everyone should know that those sculptures are the gifts of Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness for me
They are brought here as the spoilf of war in Buda
It will be known as such
Of course
We didn't forget about you after the victory in Mohacs
Have a nice day
Thanks to our Paşa
May god bless you.
Long live our Paşa
Shame on all of you
Are you renting your tongue for a few coins?
Go home!
"Yoshimura, stop picking on them"

Watan Robo is getting married We've got some preparations to do
Tado?
Baso?
I heard your father Mouna Rudo has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?
"Yeah, but what can we hunt in those disappearing forests?"
You've about hacked down all the trees on our hunting grounds
If we don't go hunting now we'll have nothing left once the trees are all gone
Tado Mouna!
You'd better watch your mouth!
Savages will always be savages
They have no manners at all
Wait!
Pawan?
What is the kid doing there?
Pawan!
Chief Mouna!
My hunting ground is right here!
Temu Walis?
You red-foot pheasant!
Don't you know this is the Mehebu hunting ground?
Mouna!
It's just a misunderstanding
This is the first time my eldest son goes hunting
Well then I'll go now
Ok
Why does Lin call you Big Sis?
Maybe because I'm his BL teacher
I've been a fan of anal since elementary school
"And thanks about the ""Sex Slave"" thing"
"Yeah, no problem"
He's such a fake
"I think you just wanna say ""Fake"""
Look at this
A picture of your Big Sis and an old man
What's this?
They're in Tokyo.
Your Big Sis and my big brother
What's that?
How dare they?
The world's gonna wanna punish them for that
"You forgot the initial ""These two are fucking idiots"""
You know my boobless Big Sis's earlobes are virgins too?
How would I know that?
"Anyways, who's that chubby old man?"
"Apparently he's helping with the ""Sex Slave"" rescue mission"
"Oh, the ""Sex Slave"" thing..."
"What's ""Sex Slave's"" real name?"
It's Miyu
"She's a pretty cute girl, right?"
Yeah
"Then why is she a ""Sex Slave""?"
Not a very nice nickname
They became really good friends in high school and the three of us played together a lot
We named our local shopping mall the save point
That's so Otaku
"No, like Teto"
Still an animal?
"No, a sex beast"
"Big Sis, you're too open"
It's because you passed out even without drinking
My role was supposed to be yours
"No, Bebi as Lin, and me as Bebi, I guess"
It's not like I got my tits sucked or had my anal fingered
All he did was hug me.
And only for a couple of seconds
Even so...
Good boy
What now?
It's just love... hug!
Still think you are treating me like a sexual beast
Hee hee
Umm...
"You're late, sex criminal."
I told you to come in 10 secs!
That's why you'll never have sex without paying for it
What's that bag?
It's my breakfast
"Mr. Animalistic Desire, you ditched your stakeout?"
"Sorry, I've been on since midnight and I got hungry..."
You're complaining?
Even after the crime you committed?
I'm sorry...
Your heart wasn't in it
Really?
"Well then, I guess it's time I send this pic to your company"
I'm so sorry...
I truly appologize.
Enjoy!

I'm sorry.
"- What do you mean, no?"
Ring him.
"- No, he wasn't."
He wasn't the first.
Magellan was killed in the Philippines halfway round.
He never finished.
He never finished.
His ship was the first to.
"The laurels go to his second in command, the almost completely unknown J S Elcano, aka Juan Sebastian del Cano."
"I don't suppose they'll rename the Magellan Straits the del Cano Straits, but nonetheless, it's good to help out people who've been deprived by history."
"So, what was the nationality of the inventor of the helicopter?"
- British.
"- (Stephen) British, you think?"
"No, not correct."

What's this thing?
I wondered where I put it.
REED:
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
REED:
They were opening a vortex.
They would have escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
If you'd explained to them why we were here... you might have avoided a fire-fight.
"With all due respect, sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
ARCHER:
Archer to Major Hayes.
HAYES:
"Go ahead, Captain."
ARCHER:
"Report to my Ready Room, on the double."
HAYES:
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as Tactical Officer.
ARCHER:
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain!
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
ARCHER:
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.

The police came just before we were to leave.
A family was removed from the ship.

"A theorist named Zena sent us an old French map that has a bunch of locations that correspond to the island,"
-that are known.
-Okay.
And one of them that's unknown is a hatch.
"Themapis avery rudimentary sketch, if you will, of the island."
"You know, I mean, are we hoping that it's a trap door?"
- Absolutely.
But perhaps you have an explanation of it.
"And, really, the only way to do it is to set eyes on it, so..."
Yeah.
Why don't...
why don't we take a look.

"This is all flat, then sometime later,"

I heard you were a cruel Barbarian
Now I see with my own eyes
You haven't seen anything yet
Don't be that sad
"Look, everyone treats us good"
He told me that I have seen nothing yet
Who?
That barbarian called Süleyman
He thinks I get above myself.
Who do you think he is ?
Sultan doesn't look as a terrible barbarian.
I was surprised
True
At least fire doesn't blow out of his eyes
But his tongue is poisoned
"Your Majesty, Hürrem Sultana is here"
Let her in

I can't close my eyes without seeing you

Here they are
Good luck

That's the one
As much as the 131 is well liked

We'll need another one coming
We can't have that one

I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
His name is lain Risdale.
I think he was involved in the death of his commanding officer.
The man smells corruption.

Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould.
Gould had stepped down from the day to day running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being linked with the illegal arms trade.
"Police confirmed that Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin, targeting gun-running networks in Britain."
There was also speculation that the killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control gun-running in London.

That poor girl wore a red color dress
You should not have chased a one legged girl
One legged?
Were you not running?
Running?
"No, I am one legged?"
How can I run?
Let me think about it
"Oh no, it seems you have come running"
Holding my sister I was leaping
You might not have noticed the leg because of the skirt
"You are right, you may go"
She is one legged
You are deceiving him as one legged....
The truth will come out one day
He is going to make you one legged

America is a great country.
People here are very hard-working
This is a land full of opportunities if you want to make it in life
All I miss are Ma's love and home-cooked food
Tell Ma that my taste buds are always tingling to memories of her dishes
"Jags, take a look, is Ma in tears?"
- Bees.
You know anything about bees?
I know somebody who knows somebody.
Ahem.
"Well, let me just say that I am sorry about your loss and I do accept credit cards."
The facts were these:
"One Kentucky Fitz, wife of Dusty  was the number-one Bee-Girl of Betty's Bees."
"Betty's Bees, trademark, was all the buzz in beauty and well-being  with honey and honey-based moisturizers  anti-aging creams, soaps and lip balms."
"Kentucky was 26 years, 3 weeks, 5 days and 39 minutes old  when found stung to death  behind the wheel of her Betty's Bees Bee Mobile."
- Which one is Kentucky Fitz?
- Biscuits.
- Biscuits?
"- You got biscuits, you got shrimps."
Biscuits.
Shrimps.
- You got something to flip her over?
- Why you gotta flip her over?
Front don't look no different and it ain't like you gonna be having a conversation.
It sure ain't.
Ooh.
Kentucky?
Maybe she's paralyzed from all the bee stings.
I'm just taking in my surroundings.
"Apparently, I'm dead."
- Really?
"Oh, I'm sorry but was your death accidental?"
Was I accidentally swarmed by bees?
No.
I may have been up to some mischief.

"We'll beam down immediately, commodore."
Kirk out.
"Captain, I wonder why he's so insistent that our tactical aides come down."
"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of nowhere."
He probably wants additional advice.
"Perhaps, captain, but nevertheless, I..."
"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality?"
"I, for one, could use a good nonreconstituted meal."
"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
You bet your pointed ears I am.

Why did you ask about him?
"Nothing, it's just that I've heard about"

He is pretty skillful
A pity that he didn't come from a decent school
Just in case you run into him in future
You better turn away

"He claimed there was a fourth,but it was never found."
All right.So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean war.
Something bad happened in Wonju...
schoolchildren killed by U.S.land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
********
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh,my God."
"On March 21,1963,Alcatraz officially closed."
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.

"You're checking her for TBI,right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly,I barely bumped my head.Thanks."
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore,so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,Hastings and Sylvain their guns."
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean,maybe unfreezing 'em."

Dad has a lei.
"""We knew that Suzujiro's deceased wife was an American..."
"""but were somewhat surprised to find..."
"""that all the family members were 100 percent Americans. """
Terrific!
This is a Cadillac limousine!
"His son Clark and wife, Natalie... and their children Michael and Emily."
This Michael and Emily look like they are just about our age.
"And Emily, she's a very beautiful girl."
"- Tateo, are you falling for her?"
- Stupid!
"""But all of them speak broken Japanese, which set our minds at ease. """
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with English.
"""After a comfortable drive of about 20 minutes..."
"""we arrived at Suzujiro's residence."
"I hope you appreciate this moment, lieutenant."
"You see, I am a cavalry man."
All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men.
"Well, you know what happened to the cavalry."
"Just give me 5 minutes on that couch, will you?"
Five minutes.
The young ones they put into the panzer divisions.
"The older ones, they put in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers, or wardens, like me."
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.
"In Berlin, they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists."
But they will remember now.
Berlin?
General von Pfeffinger?
"Oberst von Scherbach, Stalag 17."
"Jawohl, Herr General."
Name:
"Dunbar, Leutenant Dunbar."
Sabotage.
"Jawohl, Herr General."
"Well, there will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin."
You will be interrogated by the general staff.
When it comes to the part about your arrest I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I just want to sleep.
I haven't slept in three days.
You will remember the name.
"Scherbach, von Scherbach."
"Well, Herr Inspektor, how did you find the camp'?"
"Crowded, but gemutlich, shall we say?"
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar.
- Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
-It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
- Donnatella.
"- Good evening, Mr. President."
"Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish brigadier general who vanquished the Russian and Prussian military, came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the Revolution."
- I will.
"- It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s, when the Madison superintendent banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing understanding a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her home on Saturdays to read it."
"I didn't know that, sir."
Josh wrote you a memo on Molly Morello?
"Yeah, because all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho."
"It says,""She came in two hours early to teach an AP English class she developed, because the school didn't offer one."""
- I was in that class.
- She deserves a proclamation.
"- I wish I could give her one, but I can't."
- I understand.
"It's just too much inside baseball, you know?"
You're very nice to even talk to me about it.
"Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now."

There's a phone call for Donna?
Good evening.
This is the White House.
For whom are you holding?
I'm holding for Donna Moss.
This is Mrs. Morello.
"- Oh, my God."

"- Mrs. Morello, it's me."
- Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.
"I hadn 't heard from you in a long time, so I..."
No.
These are photographs of Patton's Allied invasion force in East Anglia.
The Germans think there are only two possible places for an Allied invasion of Europe.
And they're right.
"From East Anglia here to the Pas-de-Calais, or from the south coast of England to the beaches of Normandy."
Operation Overlord has decided on Normandy.
Then what is General Patton's army doing in East Anglia?
There is no army.
These planes are made out of plywood.
We did it to fool the Germans.
The man who took those photographs knows it.
"Consequently, he must also know that we intend to invade Normandy."
"Find him, Godliman."
It could cost us the bloody war.
"Well, sir, if you were at this station and wanted to get out of the country, you could go to Holyhead or Liverpool or Glasgow and then catch a ferry to Ireland."
He wouldn't risk Holyhead because of the passport control.
How about Liverpool to Belfast?
A car across Ireland and a U-boat on the coast.
You're talking about our 11.45 Marylebone to Inverness.
"stopping at Stafford, Crewe, Liverpool..."
Liverpool.
That's where he'll get off.
You're right.
- The 11.45 left on time.
- How do we get on it?
- You could stop the train...
- Yes.
Get us a plane.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Come on, Billy."
"- Fancy a game of poker, mate?"
- Why not?
We're stopping again.
- What was your last assignment?
The assignment was to rate Officer Hardy's competence   and to monitor his interest in the Three Rivers murder case.
You state that Officer Hardy neglected his duties   to pursue an illegal investigation into the Three Rivers murder case.
To what do you attribute his unusal interest in the case?
He feels the murders were committed by the Polish Hill murderer.
A case he worked on.
A prosecution witness in the case   said that Officer Hardy threatened him.
And that you were forced to protect him with your own weapon.
"No, that's incorrect."
- I drew my weapon as backup.
- Backup?
Officer Hardy was not...
out of control and dangerous?
At no time whatsoever.
Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
I wish we had more officers...
- Excuse me...
- Don't you want my evaluation?
"Thank you, Detective, you may step down."
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
- Why'd you change your testimony?
- Why do you think?
- You cheat good.
- Hardy.
"Hi, Emily, it's your father."
Sarah just wanted to say hello.
She's enjoying her visit.
We'll see you Sunday.

"The queen, the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead."
- Oh!

Belake thee to nothing but despair.
"Go on, go on, I have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest."
Prithee bring me to the bodies of my queen and son - one grave shall be for both.
Upon them shall the uses of their deaths appear unto our shame perpetual.

So we won't make any hasty conclusions.
"There is no evidence, nor are there any witnesses."
Oh...

I told you before...
That if I find out that you made any money from anything outside of your job
I will make sure to have you fired.

A man as ridiculous as you.
"Hong Gyu Man, a secretary-general, three years ago."
"Jung Soo Hyuk, Team Leader of the mission in Macau, three years ago."
Park Seon Woo of Yong Moon Plan.
"Yoon Sang Min, who is building the Hallyu Core Mall."
The man who ordered for the Macau mission to be aborted.
And this man executed that plan.
An intimate relationship in which they help each other.
"Bay Star Hong Kong, who took over Korean Commerce Bank."
And I heard that there were...
"strong Koreans, backing them up."
"Behind the Hallyu Core Mall, there are many investors."
Among them...
Bay Star Hong Kong.
In terms of industries that require proper licensing from the government
Bay Star Hong Kong is involved in almost all of them.
They're very impressive...
but that's why it's risky.
"Does Bay Star Hong Kong have a direct relationship with Yoon Sang Min, or not?"
"The main investor of Hallyu Core Mall, is Lockfield Infra Investment."
The representative is Kang Moon Soo.
Grandson to the owner of Kyunghee Bank.
I've been expecting something from work.

This works of art must have been made by an artist working in turbulent 20th century.
He expressed the tragedy and dignity of a man of our times.
His name is Xawery Dunikowski.
"Sculptor, painter, educator, builder of the People's Republic of Poland."
"During 60 years of his career, hands of the artist knew no rest searching forms for ideas that were always original and full of humanism."
In 1955 we were celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of creative work.

"Why, hello, ladies."
"Good morning, sir."
"Mr. Carrington, is there anybody here that you are particularly fond of or have a preference for?"
"Yeah, there is very much somebody"
I'm specifically very close to and feel an enormous attachment to and that's Miss Hopkins.
"As Miss Hopkins' chaperone, it's Lady Devonport's job to keep impoverished playboys at arm's length."
"But having experienced the pitfalls of Regency propriety herself, she's in two minds."
"And as you know,"
I support your interest in her completely.
So next!
No.
How do you propose to support Miss Hopkins?
"Um, with my massive amounts of charm and talent and no money."
And so modest.
"As the chaperones debate the charms of Mr. Carrington,"
"Mr. Everett soldiers on with his maze, helped by old friend Miss Braund."
And then this one here...
So what's this rounded one here?
"When Mr. Everett comes in,"
I know that he's going to...
"Yeah, I agree."
"In fact, either of them are perfectly wonderful."
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, morning."
Do sit down.
Thank you so much.
"The first question is, is there a particular lady here that you like?"
I like Miss Hopkins.

I'm an illegal immigrant I still owe people a large sum of money I've told Uncle Kwai before
He said he can give you $300 a month to pay your debt and another $200 as pocket money ls that enough?
Yes...
What if there are no children after the debt is paid?
I have no problem with that
But I don't know about him...
Then the three hundred dollars are for you
Five hundred dollars in total per month ls that correct?
Then you don't have to think about it anymore
Just stay here tonight to save yourself money and efforts youneedn'tworryaboutgettingyouridchecked  impossible

My father made me promise no fighting outside the academy
That's pretty useless
I'll teach you
Come here
Hold this
Grab this tight Hold it in front of your belly
Hold it really straight
Lift it straight up and...
Bring it down
What's going on here?
Shinbo's practicing vengeance
For the play?
"No, the genuine article"
Swing it down hard And shout
Oto san What would you do in his place?
I'd learn how to take a punch without getting hurt
How's that?
Let 'em hit you where it doesn't hurt and call it quits
Who taught you that pathetic trick?
"My dad, before he died"
What a legacy!
Your mom's a real terror...
"Yup, it's come in real handy."
"Thanks, Dad"
Don't force it
"Give it here Hold this, straight, straight"
When you're ready to strike...
That's it
"Shinbo, come on, hit me like you mean it"
"Hey, that's dangerous"
"Come and get me, crybaby"
"You want to win, right?"
She's so cute
Miyu... must be amazing to have a girlfriend like her
"No, we need to take her back"
Taking her back to where?
Back to her hometown obviously
I wanna go home too
So give me some train money
"Come on, please"
Come on
I still don't get it
Why'd we have to pay money to that guy?
We should have bought that BL book
"Those guys only have 5, no 3 years left"
Their lives are peaking right now
Grandpa said that people who are nasty will always fail at life
It was just two guys.
"We have two guys too, you know?"
I don't know...
Bebi... ..you're a grown man
Sorry
I've always been like this
I was bullied a lot too by guys like that
But even at this age...
I'm so sorry
Bebi it's ok.
They looked even stronger than Big Sis
"Their smirks were weirder than Big Sis's and they're a lot bigger than her, too"
"They had bigger boobs than her, too"
Hey there
Thanks
It just irritates me.
"Not only them, but with myself"
You have left me crippled
"Jagadish, my son..."
"Mamma, where have Uncle Jai and Uncle Jagadish gone away?"
"They have gone out for a while, they're going to be back"
Don't lie to the child
"Om... my son, this house is rooted on rock-solid foundation"
Jai and Jagadish will be back.
Surely
Only if we have this house.
What does that mean?
"As of now, this house belongs to Shekhar Malhotra"
What...?
- I borrowed forJai's education
Then I couldn't repay.
Now he has claimed this house
Joys you have always shared
Will you keep your sorrows to yourself?
Why...?
Because he is Om and he wishes to become a god among men
"High time that you thought about yourself, my son"
When must we leave this house?
Tomorrow morning
"Rita, they're married."
Let them take their decisions in life
Like her decision about getting married
"Mamma, I'm happy I married Jai."
- Great!
I'm elated
Your mother will never change
Work with their research teams?
Give up my claim to my design?
Then don't.
Results?
As expected
I topped the college
Is this how you deliver great news?
Yes!
Why are you underplaying?
"I'm so happy, I could hug you!"
Get back to India right away
One more good news.
Tell me
An automobile giant has offered me a job.
It's about my project
I don't want to lose out on this opportunity
So returning home will be a bit difficult
You have bagged such a good offer and that's just as well
People with education go out to serve that country
I'd rather that you returned to serve your country
"Daddy used to say, lose your land, and you have lost everything"
"We ought to be together, Jai."
"Right now, I need you, Jai"
E-mail from Jai?
Jai has topped his college.
"Congratulations, son."
Bless you
"Enough of it, now come home."
For five years...
I have only seen you growing up in pictures.
Now I want to see you
"Om, why did it black out?"
"Broken connection, happens sometimes"
"Ma told me, at the end of the story... everything works out fine"
"If not, the story isn't over yet"
My career will be gone.

Now's the time to get back to the old themes.
The ones that made you president.
Letthe Communists know you're onto them.
Those bastards.

Let's get some things straight here.
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.

Something nowhere to be found around Europe.

I'm so glad you show initiative for a change.
"To Plaka, Yannis!"

I'm sure you'll enjoy.
- Welcome!
Any preference?

It's a nice little tavern!
"You were right, Aliki."
- What will you serve us?
- Old Yiannis will take your order.
"I hope the cuisine is good, too."

"Um, sorry, there are security cameras on each floor"
"Um, so would it be Ok If I report this to the police?"
Give us a second.
We are friends
Bebi!
Come out and explain
Bebi!
"Wait, wait a sec"
My lust was just...
Shut up
You pathetic loser!
Only with professional fucking experience
The only way you'd lose your virginity is by putting your dick in your own ass
That's so mean
Please stop making so much trouble
Our business suffers from people like you
Sorry

It means that whatever's up there must be able to take information from databanks anywhere in the Federation.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
"What, you mean, troop movements, that sort of thing?"
"An open book, General."
Then put a stop to it at once.
"Yes, sir, well, if you would authorise a search and destroy mission..."
Absolutely.
"No, Commissioner, the video system's been destroyed."
"All right, Leitz."
- See nothing's touched and inform the General.
- I already have.
He's here.
Good.
Tell him I'll take charge of the investigation.
We need an arrest before Headquarters are told of Practor's death.
"Somebody wanted to make very sure of him, eh?"
"Commissioner Sleer said to touch nothing, sir."
- Sleer's taking charge?
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, it's a police job, I suppose."

"- Yes, General."

My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure
"In the heart of London, I've kept India alive!"
Still staring?
"Lajjo, your daughter's wedding!"
Celebrate it with sweets
Chutki!
I'm so happy today
Can I say one thing?
- Say four things
It'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?
"Ever since she was a baby, she has known that she is engaged to Kuljit"
That she knows.
But20 years...
- Don't you worry!
Simran is going to be so happy... you'll pray that she never gets the evil eye!
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God!
Look down

"(Wushe, 1930)"
"Schools, clinics, grocery stores post offices, hotels, boardinghouses..."
We've managed to civilize all the Wushe savages
It's not an easy task
Hard to imagine that this was once the most uncivilized heartland here
"Carrying logs... and walking from the lumberyard uphill to here takes them a whole day, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
These savages are strong
And they're more than happy to earn some money for millet wine
Come on.
This way please
"Mr. Satsuka, how long have you been in Wushe?"
Over a decade
So you know this region very well?
I'm sorry.
I thought this office was vacant.
I'm Kitty Pimms.
I've just been hired.
- By whom?
- Woolsey Nicholls.
Woolsey?
So you're replacing Kentucky?
A little soon after her death.
"Seems distasteful, don't you think?"
"It does, but it also speaks to the efficiency of your Human Resources department."
- Mm-hm.
I wonder how else you'll be replacing Kentucky.
Since I'm a withered hag tattered by every grain in the hourglass Betty's Bees still needs a fresh face.
"And after what happened, well no one wants to think about that when they're buying lip balm."
Welcome to Betty's Bees.
Kentucky's affairs were clearly a bee in Betty Bee's bonnet.
"Oh, I just wanted to say what an honor it is to be working with you..."
Thank you.
Get out.
And so Chuck got out.
But the question remained:
Betty Bee:
Coconspirator or killer?
"Kentucky was the new face of Betty's, which does give Betty motive."
Being replaced by better-looking always gives you motive.
"But Kentucky was sabotaging Betty's Bees, trademark which was owned by Woolsey, which gives Woolsey motive."
Woolsey's a businessman.
"Somebody sabotage him he'd send in a swarm of lawyers, not bees."
I know.

Yeah
It's a shame to leave those resources undeveloped but those savages up there...

"She dares not lead you past Hakaw Supeitei, Captain"
She'll spend the night in her father's house in Meisi
She won't accompany you to the hunting grounds of other clans

Those savages in the mountains are rather ferocious
Please be careful!

What about the speech?
I will take care of it before we arrive in Brussels.

I will write it myself.

Local disruption of structure is now irreversible.

Entropy has taken over.
What's he done?
Everything began to waste away when he interfered.
But why?
-The numbers were supporting the whole system.
-I don't believe it.

-The degradation is random.
"-No, Monitor."

The 32 year old woman was taken from her home by homicide detectives and is assisting them with their inquiries.

Yes... these are receipts I wrote out when I borrowed money from Shekhar
Yes.

How did these papers reach you?
Shekhar is my fiance.
And your house is my wedding gift
Don't tell me you want to make a singer out of Tanya
She can't sing.

"And emily, she's a very beautiful girl."
"-Tateo, are you falling for her?"
-Stupid!
"""But all of them speak broken Japanese, which set our minds at ease."""
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with english.
"""After a comfortable drive of about 20 minutes..."
"""we arrived at Suzujiro's residence."
"""immediately we met Suzujiro, who was sick in bed."""
Is he Grandma's elder brother?
"""Suzujiro looked better than we had anticipated."
"- No, no, no."
"Go ahead and take him, and I'll do my best to be there, okay?"
Just come back safely.
I will.
Bye.
"Everybody, meet agent Prentiss."
The other day.
I've been filling her in on protocol.
- Derek Morgan.
- Emily Prentiss.
We can make nice later.
What do we know?
"The DEA raided what they thought was a hardened meth lab right here, in Northern Virginia, but they found this instead."
That could be a dispersal device for a chemical weapon.
- Sophisticated.
- Homeland security's thinking Al Qaeda.
"They've developed devices that span the spectrum of sophistication, some as simple as soda bottles and paint cans."
They're called al ikhteraa.
"Literally ""the invention""."
They are.
Do we know what the biological or chemical agent is yet?
"No, not yet."
The cell members bailed out through a tunnel.
The DEA recovered a nextel 2-way and managed to intercept a message.
- That's not the transcript.
It's...
"- No, it's in arabic."
Our friends surprised us and eloped.
We can no longer wait for the wedding as planned.
We can deliver our gift at the next crescent.
I lived in several middle-eastern countries
- growing up.
What is she thinking?
"What are you laughing about, Lola?"
"Based on the script, Lola should now say..."
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and I accidentally laughed.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and couldn't help laughing.
That line is exactly what's in the script...
But the tone is completely different.
This jie jie is different from the script.
She's not gentle at all.
I'm sorry.
Such a murderous aura.
"The dialogue didn't change, but the mood is completely different."
She has totally overturned the character's personality concept.
Gong Xi jie is amazing.
"Next, in the script, Lola gently says,"
"""Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say... """
"Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say, you already know the answer in your heart."
"Then Lola will gently say,"
"""Daddy is human too. """
"""Sometimes he's irrational. """
Daddy is human too.
Sometimes he is irrational and unintentionally says hurtful things.
"Angel, you ought to know that parents don't resent their children."
"Angel, you ought to know that parents... do resent their children."
She changed the dialogue.
What is she doing?
Jie Jie is supposed to make Mei Mei realize that their dad loves her.
Congratulation ...
Sir.
Werner Heisenberg!
"Dont leave, wait for me please!"
Damn!
"370 wifes or mistresses, or anything else..."
They allways lead with that they dont lnow anything about physics.  but that it was interesting.

"For exmaple ""strategic withdraw"""
"We withdraw with success, and show ""victoriouse resistance""."
But i like you
I've allways liked you Wanted you to know that
You are not one of those that give up to easily
"Stay with me, I want to show you something."
Its not only you that have been busy!
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any ""hocus pocus"""
"Or what, It looks like this."
but we arent stopping there!
Extracted uranium.
What happens then?
look.
I had to do something easier than drop a bomb on them
Like for example put it in lube form.
A kind of cream
But it is very different.
"Effect and result, look."
For example number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
"Exposion of radiation, for several minutes."
"And if it happens, I will say that it has been by love to ltalia."
"You stop, Moroni."
"By the way, one does not take advantage during the visits to touch to me..."
It does not say that.
"Itself I sound with you, with caressing the Alps to him..."
"With seeing that wonderful Sicily, Calabria and Campania..."
With putting my head on those rich and prosperous Romans.
"And then, by the breach of Pia Porthole, to penetrate triumphally in Rome."
"Bravo, Moroni, honour degree in Geography."
What has been believed?
The university is not a gymnasium for its erotic exercises.
Shame on you!
"And you learn to respect the nurses, those celestial beings who sacrifice all their life by the patients."
They do not have to be used like vulgar prostitutes.!
Get out!
"-pardons, Professor..."
-Outside!
-Italia.
Italy.

-Professor.
"-Of saints, navigators."
-What does?
Now?
-You already know that here you excites more to me.
-If we are in the operating room.
"Indeed, wanted."
"As I announced to you, today you will see the recording of a apencicectomía realised by Prof. Ciotti the past times."
I will be in charge personally of comentároslaa measured that...

"Good morning, Professor."
"Please, you continue."
"""Immediately we met Suzujiro, who was sick in bed. """
Is he Grandma's elder brother?
"""Suzujiro looked better than we had anticipated."
"""He was so pleased that he held our hands tightly..."
"""and did not want to let go for quite some time."
"""But he was very disappointed that Grandma did not come."
"""He repeatedly asked us what was wrong with her..."
"""and we didn't know how to answer him."
"""Since Grandma had said no..."

- Going to...

- Who?
- In accounting.
"You know, that Mr. Sandover whose dumpy little wife used to be Mr. Devro's boss lady."
- In accounting?
- He's been with us almost 20 years.
Mr. Sellers says he's the only man in the company who's never had an expense-account trip.
"All right, all right."
"You're the #1 spark plug now, so spin the wheels, roll 'em down the runway."
"Your necktie is crooked, Mr. Banks."
"[door opens, closes]"
Sandover?
Sandover!
Sandy?
Sandy?
"White paper, three reams;"
"yellow, two;"
"ledger books, seven."
Now let's see.
"I have one full box of black pencils, four red, one, two, three extra pen fillers, seven air-mail stamps, and a full roll of 4¢."
"Sandy, old boy, what in the name of--"
Level of my sherry is precisely at the top of the letter S.
"Sandover, why the devil don't you answer?"
"Shh, Mr. Sellers, we're busy counting paperclips."
And let me warn you-- if a single one is missing when my desk buddy returns--
"All right, never mind."
"Here, Sandy, you won't need this."
I'm having a briefcase loaded with all the estimates.
"Yes, I expected that, sir."
"I'm taking along some work of my own, that's all."
Oh.
"Well, if you're a little overweight on the plane..."
"I plan to travel by rail, sir."
Uh...
"Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a..."
a German communiqué that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
"-Now, to Cairo..."
"-See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts."
Hitler's a nut on the subject.
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.
"And, right now, apparently, there's some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo."
"Now, we've got some information here, but we can't make anything out of it, and maybe you can."
"""Tanis development proceeding."
"""Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra."
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."""
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
"Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?"
"Well, it.."
The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
The Lost Ark?
"Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant."
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
"What do you mean, ""commandments""?"
You talking about the Ten Commandments?
"Yes, the actual Ten Commandments."
"The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing."
Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
"Well, I..."
"Oh, look."
The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark.
"When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon."
In Jerusalem.
Where it stayed for many years.
"Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone."
You're neither and I don't think I like it.
Another drink?
"You pride yourself on it, don't you?"
It's important to you.
Very important.
What?
Being brave all the time.
Loads of physical courage.
"What is this, truth or consequences?"
"You're quite right, let it pass."
I didn't know you were interested.
"It's purely academic, I assure you."
You don't look academic to me.
"Mr McKendrick, it may interest you to know that a great many women are not partial to the superman type."
They prefer a little human weakness.
A little humility.
Look everybody's scared of something.
That coming from you could be quite an admission.
I gather you two gentlemen know each other.
"Pinky, this is Mr McKendrick."
Pleased to meet you.
"Sit down, McKendrick."
Here is the news.
It was announced from Washington today that President Roosevelt has transferred 50 American destroyers to His Majesty's government as part of a Lend Lease grant.
Lend Lease.
"In exchange, leases have been to the United States for the construction of airfields and naval bases in British Commonwealth Territory as part of America's Defence Programme."
Defence.
What are the Yanks defending?
Who's shooting at them?
That's right.
50 stinking tin cans.
Lousy old tubs that ain't been at sea since WW1.
Okay.
Here he comes.
Tonight I'm offering a reward of $2 million for any information leading to my wife's safe return.
Go in tight.
I urge anyone with information to call the 800 number issued by the FBI.
I would...
"For the sake of my family, for the sake of Sara's family,"
just please...
Please give her back.
Senator!
Senator!
"And that was Senator Jeffrey Collins speaking from his home in Buckhead, Georgia."
The disappearance of his wife Sara has aroused national attention.
"Judy, does the FBI have any leads in this investigation?"
"Well, Jeff, all we know is, Senator Collins' ex-wife, Jessica Nevins, is being sought as a person of interest."
Officials now confirm she was registered at the Biltmore Hotel on the night of the current Mrs. Collins' disappearance.
Officials urge anyone with information to contact the Sara Collins hotline immediately.
"Thanks, Jeff."
"All right, thank you, Judy."
That was Judy Nash...
"Cap, forget about it."
It's not her.
"Messages of support and concern have been flooding in from around the country, as Sara Collins' disappearance approaches the 48-hour mark."
WCN has been covering the story since...
Sara Collins hotline.
Yeah.
I have information about the missing woman.
What is the nature of this information?
I know her.
Or I knew her.
But she had a different name:
Nicky Johnson.
Here´s the situation.
We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.
We believe he is headed to Los Angeles or is here already.
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area.
"Our only lead is Nina Myers, who´s being brought back to CTU right now."
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.
Adam´s done a workup on him.
"We have some background, but nothing places him definitively in Los Angeles today."
That´s it?
What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?
"Our data tracking´s a little behind, so we weren´t able to access that report."
Why are we behind?
We didn´t update the European contact logs while I was down.
"- Michelle, you were the ranking agent."
- l didn´t think Europe was a priority.
- Obviously it was.
- There was a lot going on at the time.
All right.
Let´s get back to work.
"Let´s try to ease up on the mistakes, as there are millions of lives depending on us."
Michelle.
- (knocking)
- Come.
I just got off with CTU.
- What´s the status on the virus?
- lt´s not good.
The limited intelligence they have supports their suspicion.
- lt´s on its way to Los Angeles?
"- David, it may already be here."
We should prepare in case they target other cities.
Our people in the security envelope have been alerted. lt´s being handled.
What do you mean?
The instrument for your ship's destruction has already been placed aboard her: : :
And by a member of your own crew:
[Laughs]
"Discover him in time, and you will have won all:"
Reardon:
"The man we picked up here was a fake, wasn't he?"
And Wilma... the real Wilma...
took him on board the Searcher:
And it was he who was able to tell this creature how to duplicate our ship:
[Laughs] You are indeed worthy of admittance to my masters' planet!
Such intuition is a rare thing:
"We are sick and tired of playing your stupid game, old man:"
"I want some answers from you, and I want them now!"
How is Reardon going to destroy the ship?
How's he gonna do it?
"Oh, perhaps not so intelligent after all:"
Anger and violence do not provide solutions:
"Tell me, old man:"
I overestimated you:
[Clicking Tongue]
What a pity:
[Explosion]
Gone like the others:
We gotta get back to the ship:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Yes, Buck:"
What have you found?
"We're returning to the ship, Admiral:"
You've got a saboteur on board:
Very good.
- What's he done?
"(Stephen) Peter, explain."
"Well, I think this is what it is."
"When a director directs a film, and, like, say if the studio interfere and they re-edit it and the director disowns the film, they can choose to put Alan Smithee instead of their real name."
- Absolutely right.
Absolutely right.
Yes.
- (applause)
"Alan Smithee is the name used when directors disown a film, either because they've lost control of the final cut, or it's simply too awful to admit to."
"Smithee's oeuvre include such classics as Hobgoblins II,"
"Boggy Creek III, Hellraiser IV and, most famously, Dune, where he codirected with David Lynch."
"So, very well done."
How did you know about that?
You just knew?
I...
"Well, Tony Kaye did that - tried to do that."
- (Stephen) With American History X.
- Yeah.
"And I never saw American History X because I didn't see any of the first nine, you know, so..."
"Oh, you literate fellow."
"Now, The Boy on a Dolphin isn't a Smithee film,"
- but it did star the very short matinee idol...
- (elephant trumpets)
- Alan Ladd.
- (Stephen) Yes.
Another half point to take you up to a full one point for your two splendid intrusions.
- Sophia Loren was in it.
I've actually seen it.
- Very good.
And what can you tell me about the making of the film that's quite interesting?
(laughter)
# Rock you #
# Sing it #

"Hey, Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
I joined the basketball team.
I gave up singing and dancing forever.
I'm just not into it.
You gave it up?
That's right.

[alarm sounds] [radio announcer] ...
many consider Cezanne to be the bridge between Post-Impressionism and Cubism.
"In fact, both Matisse and Picasso called him ""the father of us all."""
He was a remarkable innovator...  [grunting]
Little-known fact:
Cezanne was rejected by the Paris Salon for 18 years.
"But he never gave up, until 1882, when they finally exhibited his 1866"
"""Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cezanne,"""
"the father of the artist, reading L'Évenement, his first and last successful submission."
"[Eddie] What the fuck you mean, it won't play?"
"I'm telling you, it won't play."
"It won't play, or you won't play with your brother?"
Ah!
Thought you guys were supposed to eat about it.
"Can you not yell, please?"
"What, do I gotta sit you two punks down again"
- and talk about family values?
"- Eddie,"
I cannot work with him.
And I will not work with that psycho girlfriend of his.
"- For Chrissake, she attacked Sonja."
- So what?
"A couple broads, they get handsy with each other and you wanna call the whole goddamn thing off with all that money just sittin' there waitin' for us."
Listen to me.
It's not.
"These people that you're tryin' to rob, they're not just some banditos from down South."
Okay?
They're degenerate killers.
"Yeah, well, they ain't never met Eddie Cruickshank."
Which firm have you decided to join?
All three offers are equally good

"Jai, just do it"
What's all this?
Nothing much
"Just my stuff, my stock of mineral water, juices"
"My exercise kit, etc."
Mamma sent it
Did you have to get it from your Mummy?
We would've bought it for you
"I guess, that's a mother's love."
Like when Jai was in America... his mother would send over...
what do you call those... those sweet gramflour-balls and the mango pickle
So my Ma sent me this stuff

"- Okay, thank you."
"Brother, do not worry."
Everything is fine.
"Wonderful, in fact."
Dr. Cairn made me understand that the root cause of my ailment is decadence.
"But I just feel so much more relaxed, and lighter even, just being around all these women who've truly embraced their healing."
"- Isabel, please!"
I can't follow a word you're saying.
"In fact, I think it'd be best if you came home."
- No.
I have to stay until I'm healed.
- Of what?

What sort of nonsense are they feeding you?
"- I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you're afraid of what you don't understand, but I will not be leaving with you."
"Good day, brother."
- Isa...
- I'm afraid it's gonna be a while before Isabel's ready to receive another visit.
- That is not for you to decide.
"- Mr. Porter, visits are made at the discretion of our patients."
So we will let you know the next time your presence is requested here at Rosewood.

She wasn't gonna let us take her back.
Yeah.
I know.

"All I know is I joined this army to kill Johnny Rebs, and so far, I ain't even seen one."
You've been lucky.
"It's all right, Bill."
I know him.
"Glad to see you, Mr. Andrews."
What's your regiment doing this far south of Nashville?
General Buell moved out with most of the army to reinforce Grant.
There's a big fight shaping up around Corinth.
I probably don't have to tell you.
I didn't know Buell was gone.
Who's in command here now?
General Mitchell.
He's madder than a wet hen to be left behind.
So were we.
- Why are you left behind?
- To guard Nashville.
"It's nice to talk with you again, Corporal."
"Mr. Andrews... if you ever want help on a Secret Service mission, don't forget the name Pittenger."
William Pittenger.
"In all of East Tennessee, there's no concentration of Confederate forces worth the mention."
The Southern army at Knoxville is barely able to defend the city
- from Union General Morgan.
- What about Chattanooga?
Buell was certain a great army was gathering there.
"General Mitchell, there are only 2,000 raw recruits in Chattanooga, and another 2,000 that aren't even armed!"
"Here we wait with 10,000 choice troops under strict orders to guard Nashville."
"If only I'd been given some latitude, I'd march right into Chattanooga."
- Wouldn't that be defending Nashville?
"- Yes, by George!"
"As long as I keep the enemy in front of me, Nashville will be fully protected."
But I don't want Chattanooga unless I can hold it.
It might be two weeks before Buell could reinforce me.
"Mr. Dinamo,"
Yes?
"I did not know that not only are you efficient, and a good observer, you are a photo enthusiast."
What?
May I see your lighter?
My lighter?
"Yes, your photographic device."
"Very well, you lot already found out?"
I only wanted to take pictures of the important people attending the conference.
That was all.
Mr. Dinamo
"It is logical that you should fail as a vulgar detective, unlike us, who are specialized agents."
So I would suggest for you to not move!
"It was a good idea of yours, that."
"My picture could have been identified by the intelligence service, but I can assure you, that will not be so."
"Freeze, Mr. Dinamo!"
"It seems you fail to understand that behind this book is a machine pistol with silencer, ready to fire."
"Very well, I will demonstrate."
Lucrecia?
Report in.
"Calling HQ, calling HQ?"
"Go ahead, Lucrecia."
We have Dinamo.
"Understood, hand him over to S.O.S. so they can take care of him."
"S.O.S. recieving,"
"Agents S.O.S. one and S.O.S. two bring Dinamo onboard, alive, or dead if necessary."
General advisory!
General advisory!
"We will hold a meeting immediatedly, over."
"Mr. Dinamo, thanks to you, we will have to rush our plans."
Take care of him!
"Very well, shall we?"
Let me know if you ever need me
It's a treacherous world and I'm honest
"Like that, Shekhar?"
These KK-Mix guys are trying to pass off a re-mixed old number
This song isn't working
"Shekhar, he says KK's mix won't work!"
Better give him on anotherjob
What's wrong with my number?
"Not one, several"
The original is a classic.

I have raped so many songs but all my rapes are super-duper hits
My liftman can sing better
Then call your liftman
Yes sir?
- Here's the moment... you've awaited all your life.

This is an insult to KK-Mix!

"All this my friend, by dint of money"
Not because of money.

But love cannot beget you money;

You are with me.

"Viking calling Yacht club, over."
"Yacht club, Yacht club answering, go ahead Viking."
"Miss, call the police Inspector, advise him that I am chasing the yacht, of the S.O.S. organisation, twelve miles high, by the Salty Estuary, twelve miles, over"
"Understood, Mr. Dinamo."
"Understood, out."
"One moment, we will finish him my way, fetch the girl!"
untie her.
"here, were he can see her."
"Mr. Dinamo, get closer if you dont't want something to happen to your partner."
"Hide your weapons, when he gets close,we will anihilate him."
"Fire, finish them!"
"Attention, amphibian fly to HQ,"
Go ahead fly.
"We are ready at the estuary to carry out plan two,"
"We are ready at the estuary to carry out plan two,"

"Hello, hockey fans!"
Welcome to tonight's game.
It should be a real barn burner!
"Charlestown, 1978."
"We should have lost hope when the steel mill closed down, but that was the year our beloved Chiefs won the Federal Cup, led by the infamous Hanson Brothers."
"Their aggressive style of hockey brought passion to the team, hope to the town."
"Metropolis had its Superman, Gotham City had its Batman, and Charlestown had the Hansons."
"And like everyone, though, eventually, they disappeared."
"Bounced, bolted, vanished, deep-sixed."
"But this, my friend, is the story of how they were found again, resurrected and transformed, together with a group of ragtag orphans."
It was their task to defend Charlestown against a heinous villain like none other.
"A real estate developer, a devil in a black pantsuit who hornswoggled me out of my own town."
"Her name, Bernie Frazier."
"Well, 30 years later and your vision has finally come true, Mayor Kenneth."
This wasn't my vision.
"Another done deal, done right."
- Go ahead.
- You got it.
"Out with the old, in with the new."
"I ask you again, sir, here and now under oath... were you at any time a member of a crime organization"
led by michael corleone?
I don't know nothing about that!
I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.
We have a sworn affidavit.
"Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered on the orders of michael corleone."
"Do you deny this confession, and do you realize what will happen if you do?"
"The FBI guys promised me a deal so I made up a Iot of stuff about michael corleone, just to please them."
But it was all lies.
Everything!
"They kept saying,"
"""michael corleone did this"" and ""michael corleone did that""."
"So I said, ""Yeah, sure."
"Why not?"""
"Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify the gentleman sitting to your left?"
I can answer that.
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
-Is he related to the witness?
"-He is, I believe, his brother."
-will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand english.
He came at his own expense to aid his brother.
He's not under subpoena and has an impeccable reputation.
-He knows nothing about this?
"-To my knowledge, nothing."
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.
-The witness is excused.
-Senator!
Senator!
This committee owes an apology!
This committee owes an apology.
On what they want to buy on a supermarket shelf.
And that's the way it should be.
India is the largest democracy on earth.
"It has an advanced and growing economy, a highly-educated population,"
"And cutting-edge technological capabilities,"
Such as space and nuclear weapons programs.
"But like many countries around the world,"
"India's still struggling to provide for its poor,"
Particularly when it comes to sanitation and clean water.
"In fact, a recent un report predicts that, globally,"
"Without dramatic change in the way we manage our water,"
In only 15 years 40% of the world
Will not have adequate access to usable water.
So we sent tania rashid to india
To find out just how bad the problem is there.
♪
(horns honking)
Rashid:
"We're in meerut, a small town in northern indi."
There's all these open gutters everywhere
"And you can smell the shit, brown water,"
And it's in the corner of every alleyway.
It's in open-air sewers like this
Where india's water crisis begins.
(man speaks)
Rashid:
There's no sewage here?
Man:
No.
Can I see your bathroom?
This is the toilet.
"So, basically, someone poops in here"
"Now scoot, huh?"
"Young lady, you are getting to be a pest."
"Now, look, you can't go with us."
"You'd only be in the way, understand?"
"Here, hold her."
(CHATTERING)
"Judy, shame on you."
"You know, today, there just happens to be a chimp far more important than you."
(CHATTERING)
(PAULA):
"You know, somewhere out in the bush there's a chimp just like you."
Only she's been on a long trip through outer space.
And now she's waiting for somebody to rescue her.
Poor thing.
"All alone, frightened, and lost."
(TRUMPETS)
(MAN OVER RADIO):
"This is Radio Nagoro interrupting again to give you the latest news on the fate of Sally, the missing American astro-chimp."
The space capsule which carried her on her epic round-trip to the moon has apparently landed somewhere deep in the confines of the Wameru game reserve.
"Natives at nearby Katanga village reported sighting a large, metal object floating from the sky under the canopy of a red, white, and blue parachute... (MARSH, OVER RADIO):"
Paula.
"Paula, do you read me?"
"Yes, Dad."
Have you found little Sally yet?
(MARSH):
Not yet.
"Look, Hedley and I are near Manduli, and Jack and Mike are headed for the river crossing."
"Look, honey, I hate to ask you this, but, um, do you feel up to walking over to the north waterhole?"
If Sally's wandering around she's probably pretty thirsty by now.
"Well, sure, Dad."
(MARSH):
"Why, and take Clarence and Judy."
"In my opinion, a Candor trial would have the greatest chance of achieving true justice."
So are you asking me to petition the Council to grant Candor sole judiciary power?
No.
"As part of Candor's initiation, you administer a truth serum."
Correct?
We don't typically discuss such matters out of faction.
That's a pretty evasive answer.
Evasion is not dishonest.
It's not exactly honesty either.
Yes.
We possess such a serum.
Then use it on us.
- Four.
"-if we're guilty, we'll surrender to the Council."
All right?
"If not, you've just saved two lives."
And made some loyal allies.
JACK:
All right.
But you should know that the serum can be quite brutal.
It was designed for Candor applicants who are already predisposed to honesty.
Not everyone finds it so easy to share their secrets.
Don't wanna do this.
We have to.
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
May the truth set you free.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
"JACK: (DISTORTED) Tobias Eaton,"
you are accused of conspiring with your fellow Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation.
Is this true?
"Conspiring, no."
"The film became the studio's top box-office musical and won nine Academy Awards, including one for this lovely song."
The film stars Louis Jourdan and the lovely Leslie Caron.
"Oh, no"
Overnight there's been A breathless change
In you
"Oh, Gigi While you were trembling on the brink"
Was I out yonder somewhere Blinking at a star?
"Oh, Gigi"
Have I been standing up too close?
Or back too far?
When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?
"Oh, what miracle"
Has made you the way
You are?
What a time it was.
Life was simpler then.
And so was the movie business.
"MGM's dream factory created a rich, romantic..."
And although we may not see anything like it again we're blessed with memories and miles and miles of film.
In the words of Irving Berlin:
"""The song is ended but the melody lingers on. """
A show that is really a show
Sends you out with a kind of a glow
And you say as you go on your way
That's Entertainment
A song that is winging along
Or a dance with the touch of romance
Is the art that appeals to the heart
That's Entertainment
The world is a stage
The stage is a world
How come you are here?
I was rescued by Miss
I was supposed to... we'll talk about this later
Tell me whether there's any hidden path in this house that leads to some other places
Hidden path?
I was stalking someone but he just disappeared here!
I've served Miss for almost 3 years and have never heard that there's any hidden path
It's here
Shing Kwun
Shing Kwun... where are he going?
what's inside?
I don't know
Shing Kwun...
Chian Kuen shifting Technique!
This is a superior technique of the Ming Cult
Right
This is where their head Yeung Po Tin used to practise his martial arts
"Never mind him, let's see how this kung fu works"
How come there're no words in it?
How did you know its secret?
"Never mind, just look at the creed inside"
The first level of the technique
"Unite heart and spirit, lotus position"
Start from...
Mr. Chang
It's you
How come you're behind me?
I don't know either
This must be the secret power working
"Once you move, I'll automatically dodge you and move to this spot"
That means you've accomplished your training
"I unintentionally acquired knowledge of the skill, never meaning to steal it"
"Did I hear right, or did we get the convention?"
It's not signed and sealed...
... butitis delivered.
And you were the closer.
I thought I had him with the second-city stuff.
Of course you did.
You know why?
It belongs here.
New York City.
This is the place.
Excuse me.
"All right, the story's on the 1 0:00 news."
A little slow.
--took the life of an innocent 6-year-old on his way to school during a police action.
They're all over it like a cheap suit.
It's gonna stick to us like one too.
--6-year-old James Bone on his way to school.
Ballistics from the police lab confirm  the wayward bullet that killed the boy came from Zapatti's gun....
"Here you are, Mr. Zapatti."
Michael.
Find Vinnie.
I wanna have a little talk with him.
"Yesterday, on the corner of Broadway and Marcy Street, gunfire broke out claiming 6-year-old James Bone along with 2 1-year-old Tino Zapatti. .."
"...a convicted felon on probation and a 32-year-old police detective, Eddie Santos."
The police commissioner has disclosed  that an investigation is under way into Santos ' activities.
Question:
What was Santos doing with a drug dealer  wanted for probation violations?
Good morning.
It will raise serious questions of corruption in the courts.
"Stern gave Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer probation instead of sending him to prison."
"The question everyone is asking because of this unusual disposition is, why did the judge do that?"
"Good morning, Mrs. Santos."
Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
If I knew now
What I knew then
I'd run from these blues-soaked hills
And I'd go back to the well
And chew her white lipstick
"And her long, slow kisses"
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
I'll tell the keeper
Bring us something else to smoke
While we're naked and alone
So they make us immortal
So they make us a deal
Will it matter when we're naked and alone?
Such a beauty with a smile
There'll be opportunity
And abundance for all
But if I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
She been planning this affair for over 20 years.
If only Charles were here.
My condolences
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision
I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes
Of course not.
I'm pleased that you've purchased the company.
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance
Charles thought so too
"Hamish, do you ever get tired of quadrille?"
On the contrary.
I find it envigorating
Do I amuse you?
No.
"I had a sudden vision, of all the ladies in trousers and the men wearing dresses"
It would be best to keep your visons to yourself.
"When in doubt, remain silent."
"Pardon us, sir."
Ms. Kingsley is distracted today.
- Where is your head?
- I was wondering what it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking about such an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things before breakfast.
"Alice, meet me at the Gazebo in precisely ten minutes."
We have a secret to tell you.
"If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret"
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.
"- If you tell us, we won't be surprised."
- Will you be surprised?
Yang-Jeong.
Yes.
"I have decided,"
I will not be sending reinforcements.
"Your Majesty,"
Do you realize that your decision will catalyse the collapse of BuYeo's diplomacy with the Hans?
"This decision does not lie in your hands, but in mine."
"However, if the Hans will forsake our ties just because of this, then it only goes to show how unreasonable they are."
You have gone too far..
"Compared to... the way you have insulted BuYeo over the years,"
This is nothing.
I will give you more time.
Do think this over carefully.
"Even if I think it over a thousand more times,"
My answer will remain unchanged.
Dismissed!
Those barbarians who dare stand up against us Hans will disappear like ashes from the face of this world.
"And after this, the Emperor might consider doing exactly the same thing to BuYeo."
PREPOSTEROUS!
"You go back and tell your Emperor,"
BuYeo will be well prepared for it.
"The one that will turn to ash is not BuYeo, but the Han Dynasty."
I will convey this message.
Listen up!
"Regarding my decision,"
Don't ever bring it up again.
"Yes, Your Majesty."
Chief General!
"Yes, Your Majesty."
"From this moment onwards,"
Move the entire BuYeo's military into battle position.
We must stand prepared for any provocation from the Hans.
"That helps her, not me."
I got it.
Why don't we charge one of the personalities with harbouring a fugitive?
Or I could just audition as the court's new jester.
"Look, here's the point, this is not about evidence, this is about insanity."
"The voice, the voice."
We sent the tape to the Feds to be analysed.
It makes no difference which personality is talking
- if that voice is hers on the tape.
- How many ways do I have to...
"Danvers, you ride with me."
"Megan, Frank, meet me at Russem's office   she's confessing."
- Wilgis is confessing?
Matt Rhodes rang me.
She's going before the cameras live
- to confess to eight murders.
- All eight?
"She wouldn't give me a confession but she's willing to tell all to 150,000 viewers?"
- Excuse me.
"- She's using you, y'know?"
For giving me a live on-camera confession
"- she can use me, use me, use me."
"- Matt, you only got ten seconds."
"Can you people wait outside, we got a lot of bodies in here?"
Police.
Good evening.
I'm Alison Chandler with the Late 8 news.
"Tonight, a stunning revelation in the murder of three local women."
"Our Matt Rhodes is in the law offices of Baltimore attorney, Darren Russem with a Channel Eight exclusive."
"Thanks, Alison."
Channel Eight has just learned that the brutal murders of three Baltimore women over the past two days were all committed by the same person.
These killings are tied to the deaths of five women in two other cities.
That's what I do.
"Sometimes they say the smartest thing, sometimes they say the dumbest thing, but either way, it's fucking awesome."
"I was watching the other day, and this rapper was just like this."
"He goes, ""Yo."""
¶ I put the iron to your dome like I'm ironing clothes ¶
"I was like, ""Yeah."""
"Steam that nigga, yeah."""
"But sometimes they say stupid stuff, right?"
"Like, I'm watching the other day and this rapper goes just like this."
"¶ Yo, I'll melt your face like mozzarella ¶"
Proceed.
Then he was like... ¶ So be cool 'cause it's some real werewolves ¶
¶ Around you Bella
"I said, ""Wait a minute."""
"""Werewolves?"
Bella?
"""Since when do gangsters watch Twilight?"
"What the hell?"""
And this is what messed me up.
"As soon as he said that lyric, everybody in the battle at the same time was like,"
"""Nigga!"""
"""We just saw that on demand this morning."""
"I said, ""Gangsters watching Twilight?"
"That makes no sense."""
And don't think it's all fun and games with me though.
'Cause I watch CNN.
Makes no sense.
"You got people that get robbed, stabbed, raped, and killed."
Some of them can't even get the front page of a newspaper.
"Meanwhile, you got Kim Kardashian who seemed like she had more exposure for her divorces and marriage than Barack had his first year in office."
That didn't make any sense to me.
"Even Barack was like, ""Uh..."""
Teen accuser:
"I have often seen the operation of Martha Coery, and she very often afflicted me by her acts of witchcraft."
Judge:
"Martha Corey, tell me why you hurt these persons."
Narrator:
Martha's only hope is that the judge will see through the girls' hysteria.
[man speaking: the Devil coming to rule] [screams]
Martha:

I am a Gospel woman.

[sounds of a wagon]
Narrator:
"In Salem, over 100 hundred people are accused of witchcraft, among them a four year old girl."
20 executions.
"Fourteen years later, one teenager withdraws her testimony, claiming to have been deceived by Satan."
[voice:
It's time.]
[music]
Narrator:
Mercy Lewis never speaks of it again.
Salem is among the last of the mass witch hunts.
The era of fear and superstition is ending.
"Now, the hunt for profit is opening up the wilderness, beckoning a new breed of pioneer, in search of the earth's natural resources:"
"hunters, frontiersmen."
Dolin:
"Much like explorers and adventurers of today, they had a certain mettle to them, but they were also driven by the desire to make money."
Profit is a amazing motivator.
I was the Odyssey.
"I enlisted powerful men, courageous men, to the task of fulfilling my artistic destiny."
Your fairness cleanses me.
"To make love to you, is to make love to all of Germany."
Eva:
My Führer.
( Hitler whispers ) My angel.
Eva:
Wolfie?
Eva:
What?
I represented the rejection of the modern.
"What is it, Adolf?"
"A return to the world of Homer, in which war isn't about massive destruction,"
but remains first and foremost... an instrument-- ( coughs )
to enhance a hero's personal glory.
Hitler:
Modern art is the enfevered fantasies of an incurably sick people.
"The fact that nine-tenths of artistic rubbish-- literary filth, theatrical idiocy-- can be traced to the account of one people,"
of all the country's inhabitants can simply not be talked away.
It is the plain truth.
"The Jewish-Christian creed, with its effeminate ethics undermines our vitality."
"Morality is a decay, a blemish like the Hebrew circumcision."
"The German people must learn to distrust reason, the dirty and degrading idea of conscience."
What number was the last footnote?
"28, mein Führer."
Footnote 29.
"The Führer wrote these words for the first draft of Mein Kampf,"
"the morning of May 2, 1924, in Landsberg Prison."
"In other countries, why do they keep the German title Mein Kampf, instead of translating it to..."
My struggle?
Hitler:
She shaun't be alone
It is Hatice's first baby.
She's very worried
You'll calm her down with your experience
You were absent all day long
I miss you.
Where have you been?
I had things to do
Will I always be yearning for you ?
Won't this pain have an end?
You'll always be in love and yearning for me
"This is the love, Hürrem"
I miss the sky and clouds of Castilla
Signore Gritti should have sent a message
Your fiance Prince Friedrich will absolutely find a way
I don't know if we can really rely on Gritti
She lives in this Ottoman hell willingly
He's among the barbarians
A wagon arrived
Can it be Sultan Süleyman?
What's she saying?
She's asking why we came here
We are here with the order of İbrahim Paşa
By now Melek Hatun will be at the service of Princess Isabella.
She'll teach her Turkish
She doesn't want to learn our language
She won't stay here for a long time
She doesn't need it
It would be for her sake to learn Turkish
She'll be more comfortable as long as she lives here

The universe long ago passed the point of total collapse.

But we have the means to postpone the time.
So that's why you adapted the Pharos Project.
Yes.
We opened the system by creating voids into other universes.
-The Charged Vacuum Emboitments.
"-We passed through one of your voids, Monitor."
It all depended on our continual endeavours.
"A temporary solution, while the advanced research unit worked on a more permanent plan."
But nothing will come of that now.
Our labour's wasted.
The voids will be closing.
There must be something we can do.
This will teach you to meddle in things you don't understand!
We are beyond recriminations now.
Beyond everything.
Not quite.
We must pool our resources.
-The creature that killed my father...

-Please.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO:
My first visual memories are of this framed poster above my crib.
I would stare at it every night before I went to bed.
My father was an underground comic distributor.
He's always been this sort of Zelig of the counterculture as I like to call him.
"Having painted in Warhol's studio, being roomies with Lou Reed, he knew R. Crumb and all these great artists of his generation."
"I mean, I was brought up on all kinds of wacky visuals as a kid."
So I would stare at this painting over and over:
The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.
It was painted around 1500.
"And if you look at these panels long enough, they start to tell a story."
In the first panel you have Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
"Birds flying off into the distance, elephants and giraffe and a lot of religious iconography."
The second panel is where it starts to become more interesting.
"- Hey, where's the costume?"
- It's itchy.
Did you try the long sleeves on underneath?
I don't want to be Spider-Man anymore.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Okay.
"Well, you have to make up your mind by tomorrow, okay?"
- Okay.
- Okay.
You did a good job on the cookies.
"- Teamwork, right?"
- Teamwork.
Right.
Can I have one?
You want a cookie?
Can I have a cookie?
"What do you want, black cat or a pumpkin?"
Black cat.
"I mean, despite it's obvious origins in the Celtic festival of Samhain and the Christian All Saints Day, it really is a melting pot of various immigrants' traditions and beliefs."
"It became a little more commercialized in the 1950s with trick-or-treat, and today it rivals only Christmas in terms of popularity."
All I asked was what he was doing this weekend.
I'm toying with the notion of either going to the Edgar Allan Poe Shadow Puppet Theater or the reenactment of the 19th century Phantasmagoria.
- I don't want to know.
"- Oh, yeah, you do."
"Phantasmagorias are these amazing pre-cinema projected ghost shows invented in France, where the showman attempted to spook the audience using science magic."
And it just so happens that I have an extra ticket.
Tempting.
"Guys, I wouldn't have to worry about losing my feminine curves if you all paid more attention to all the trees we're consuming around here."
When did you become an eco-freak?
"- Baby, I was born green."
- We're going to Detroit.
I'm gonna give you guys 20 minutes for questions and answers.
"So keep them short and, hopefully, sweet."
And you can roll starting now.
"I'll introduce him in five... thousand... four... thousand, three... thousand, two."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States."
Welcome.
Good afternoon.
Please.
- Thank you for coming here on such short notice.
"- Laine Hanson, from Ohio."
As I embarked on the task of selecting a vice president...
"I was driven by the emotion of wanting to make a choice... that would've made Troy Ellard, my friend, proud."
Senator Laine Billings Hanson of Ohio is that person.
"Sherri, you are first."
"Ms. Hanson, do you feel being a woman played any type of role in the president's decision?"
"Well, I, uh..."
First I would like to say... what an honor it is to be here before you in this position.
And I hope to serve up to the standards which President Evans set for me in that introduction.
"Thank you so much, sir."
To answer your question...
"- First rate, Mrs. Hanson."
- Thank you.
I learned a lot from Will.
"Ah, yes, Will."
"You, sir, are gonna have to make yourself scarce."
"- No, of course."
I'll give you your privacy.
"- No, I mean scarce."
"During the confirmation period, I want you out of sight."
- Pardon me?

"For God's sake, don't say you want to go to the theater?"
I just have to talk to someone who has understanding.

"Excuse me, my child."

- Are you arranging a masquerade ball here?

May I...
What does he say?
Are you afraid that he doesn't come?
Or that he already has?
"Well, read it already!"
- Who is't you mean?
"- Why, your lieutenant, Cassio."
Good my lord.
If I have any grace or power to move you... his present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you... that errs in ignorance and not in cunning...
I have nojudgement in an honest face:
"- I prithee, call him back."
- Went he hence now?
"Ay, sooth: so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me... to suffer with him."
"Good love, call him back."
"Not tonight, sweet Desdemona;"
some other time.
- But shall't be shortly?
"- The sooner, sweet, for you."
- Shall't be to-night at supper?
"- No, not to-night."
"- To-morrow dinner, then?"
- I shall not dine at home;
- I meet the captains at the citadel.
"- Why, then, to-morrow night;"
or Tuesday morn;
"On Tuesday noon, or night;"
on Wednesday morn:
"I prithee, name the time... but let it not exceed three days;"
"in faith, he's penitent;"
"Prithee, no more:"
let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.
"Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this..."
To leave me but a little to myself.
Shall I deny you?
No:
A woman better be pretty damn qualified to have nobody to answer to... and Laine Hanson is not that.
Look me in the eyes and tell me... that Laine Hanson is your first choice for the vice presidency.
Laine Hanson is my absolute first choice.
I'd so want you in my poker game.
Country needs a smooth confirmation.
The president needs a smooth confirmation.
The country needs a competent vice president.
Excuse me a minute.
There's only one person in the world that has that phone number.
So who's the second choice?
We haven't really settled on anybody yet.
"Tell me, if Laine Hanson were to be hit by a flying car... who would the president then select?"
"I think the president still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman."
You know...
"Jack Hathaway, there's a good man..."
for a Democrat.
There's a man I would say would have... a smooth confirmation.
- Jack Hathaway?
- Smooth as a baby's ass.
"- He's already taken himself out of it, so..."
- Right.
Right!
"Well, who the hell knows?"
Perhaps Lainey will shock the world... by pulling out her brilliance... and erudition at the hearings that none of us know she has.
"So, Shelly, can we ask for basic fairness?"
"- Fifty-fifty, Democrat and Republican at the hearings?"
- Of course you can.
Congressman!
Congressman!
Mr. Runyon.
Just wanted to steal you for a second.
I'm Reg Webster.
"I have no further questions, Your Honor."
"[murmuring] Tell me now, Merle."
I got to know Danny through Gina.
That's how we used to meet.
He couldn't have forgotten.
Who is Gina?
Gina Gilbert.
"She's sitting in the back row, next to Corbett."
I asked her to come and be moral support.
"[Judge] Mr. Mason, We await your pleasure."
"My apologies, Your Honor."
"What is your occupation, Mr. Pierce?"
I'm unemployed at the present.
And when you are working?
A salesman.
"Mr. Pierce, have you ever been convicted of a felony?"
- No.
- No?
"Isn't it true you that two years ago, in Fort Worth, Texas, you were arrested for robbery?"
But I was cleared.
"Your Honor, I object to that."
The police are quite properly investigating everyone who conceivably could have taken that necklace.
"But a mere arrest is not evidence of bad character which can impeach a witness, and counselor very well knows that."
"If it please the court, I'm not trying to impeach this witness."
I'm just attempting to cross-examine him on his claim that the objections of the deceased to his marrying my client were unreasonable.
"I think you've made your point, Mr. Mason."
Objection overruled.
"Now, Mr. Pierce, are you married?"
No.
Certainly not.
"Are you acquainted with a woman by the name of Jayne Simmons of Fort Worth, Texas?"
Yeah.
-Not-not in slate.
"I definitely agree with that, yeah."
"So, it could have been a lot deeper."
"Maybe there was a wood hatch, and then it rotted away, and that's what made it slump all of a sudden."
"Jack, we can ""what if"" till the cows come home."
Exactly.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
-That's exactly what I was gonna ask.
-No.
No.
that'sstrange.
"Yes, it is strange."
"Onthewesternside of the island,"
"Rick,Marty and members of the team have invited area archaeologist Laird Niven tohelpin theirinvestigation of a strange, square-shapedhatch."
"Ifthehatchcan be identified as man-made, andofancientorigin, thenthebrothersmay have found another important clue tohelpthemsolve the Oak Island mystery."
It does seem like rocks have been removed.
That's been cut.
"That's not natural, and this..."
this is pretty loose fill.
"It keeps going for a bit, you can see."
"You... so, you think it goes off to the side?"
At least for a little bit.
Thethingwe obviously want it to be is the entrance to a tunnel.
Andtherewere some evidence of that.
"Hethoughtthreeofthesides  were solid, but on... at least on one side, he thought it might go off, somewhat."
It warrants further investigation.
"So, where should we go?"
Who should we notify?
How do we do this?
"Well, if I was to investigate it as an archaeologist,"
"I'd get a permit, probably remove"
-some of these small trees.
Who are you?
I am Casshern.
"Luna,"
I'm going to kill you.
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
I try to escape this harrowing reality
Everything I hoped for in my life turned out to be an illusion
"A flood of emotions, struggles that lead me astray..."
"I just want to cling onto them and move forward, forward!"
"On these shattered hills, under a sky of rust, you and I are fraught with life like azure flowers"
"We dream that we're bubbles, nestled together, and yet I'm not ready to wither yet!"
"Hey, for what reason were we born?"
"Hey, for what reason did our lives cross?"
"I'm scared because I don't know, so I take your hand"
"Right now, I want you to firmly squeeze mine back"
That's the day the Ruin began.
"From the moment Luna was killed, the world as we knew it began its unstoppable descent towards destruction."
And the name of the man who killed her is Casshern!
Yes.
Casshern!
He must pay the price for what he's done to the world.
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Kill Casshern!
Casshern...
Kill Casshern!
"The harbinger of the Ruin of the world,"
My name is Dayna.
This is Tarrant.
We're Federation outlaws.
Yes.
"Yes, I remember those names."
There was a reward for your capture.
You and your friends have a ship called the Liberator.
- Am I right?
"- We had a ship called the Liberator, it was destroyed fairly recently."
Memory is one of the few faculties I have left that still functions perfectly.
"My name, by the way, is Forbus."
The inventor of Pylene-50.
"Forbus, you weren't really going to press that contact, were you?"
"The explosion would have killed you, too."
That would seem a waste at the present time.
"When I die, I should like Commissioner Sleer right beside me."
"But you work for Sleer, manufacturing Pylene-50."
I am compelled to work for Sleer.
That inhuman devil is the cause of it.
Sleer is responsible for what you see.
"And now, only Sleer keeps me alive."
"What happened, what do you mean?"
Pylene-50 used homoeopathically is simply a muscle relaxant.
"Sleer discovered that 100 times normal dosage totally subverts the will, tried to force me to part with the formula."
I refused.
I didn't understand Sleer's nature then.
"Totally callous, savage ambition."
There is a poison called Tincture of Pyrellic.
- Perhaps you've heard of it?
- No.
"It is the extract of Pamporanian fungi, it cripples and eventually kills."
Death is agonising and there is no cure.

"The owner, Sam Bertram, was killed during the robbery."
"Now after that, Marquesa killed a police officer, gained access to the precinct using his uniform in an attempt to get at a police captain."
That's where I became intrigued.
I couldn't figure out why Marquesa went after a police captain after he pulled off a heist.
So I did a little more digging on your behalf.
And that's when I found out...
There were three gold coins discovered in that jeweler's stomach the night he was killed.
Now I got all this from the coroner's report.
How did you get this report?
"'Cause ex New York City cops generally get what they want, which brings me to my next subject."
These are the two detectives that handled the case and killed Marquesa.
"This is captain Renard, the guy Marquesa went after."
This guy?
I don't know how he figures into everything.
He's a local guy.
Repairs clocks.
I believe he's a police informant.
Conservative politician - politicians generally are arguing with each other which is the best situation but nothing ever gets done and they use the argument to delay it.
They probably think Lowestoft doesn't deserve it.
Really?
Yes.
"Of course, the town needs another bridge - everyone agrees on that."
The people can't build it themselves.
It will cost a fortune.
It has to be a political decision.
And the politicians have been squabbling about it for 50 years.
No wonder the people are angry.
"So, the bridge is closing."
"Any minute now, the town is about to get on the move again."
Where's it going?
"Well, nobody's quite sure."
What they are sure of is that they can't rely on the politicians to take them there.
They know that they will have to do it for themselves.
Are they hopeful?
Yeah.
There's plenty of hope.

Kurukshetra!
Situated in the heart of India... clustered by Haryana and... surrounded by the Saraswati river... is this historical place.
The Kaurava's and the Pandava's... fought an epic battle at this very place.
Centuries have passed ideologies have changed... but the battle is still being fought here.
These days there's one warrior in Kurukshetra... who fights to protect the honour of truth.
Tauji!
We also know him as Big Boss.
Although he's called the transport king... of this area but the Big Boss' real job... is to abduct stumble and deliver bad guys.
Big Boss conjures blessings... as well as enemies.
Today he's off to Mirzapur in regard of anew contract.
But Big Boss doesn't know that... life has already put a death contract on him.
Move the car.
Why did you park it here?

Did you have to take the station road?

The highway's closed.
This is the only alternate route to Mirzapur.

Or else I'll wet my pants.
Go on.
Hurry up or you'll pee in your pants.
Big Boss.
For you.
It's really hot.

"They get under your skirting boards and floorboards, into your cavity walls."
-
- You don't want them in your cavity walls.
-
- A property of this age has cavity walls?
We didn't have cavity walls till the damn frats got in!
-
- What are these frats?
-
- A nasty cross between a ferret and a rat.
A ferret and a rat?
!
Do they interbreed?
Interbreed?
"That's all they ever do, night and day!"
It only takes a jiffy.
It happened first by accident when two of the creatures tried to force themselves through the same aperture.
Like that.
"Of course, once having got the knack..."
-
- The knack?
-
"- Yes, the knack of producing frats, or, as we say locally, fraternisation."
-
- And you have them here?
-
- Everywhere.
They spread like wildfrats!
"Surely if there was an epidemic, the health authorities..."
"No, no, no."
"They daren't risk a panic, you see."
They send someone to bore a couple of holes in your walls and tell you you've got nothing.

Today he is up till his neck in debts..

"Jyoti, its very simple."

"But rather, Saeko-san, lately carries a faint smell of cigarette smoke..."
"Well, it's fine anyway."
I began dating Saeko-san one week before last Christmas.
"And, our first kiss was on Christmas Eve."
"That was the only time we kissed, after that things have been in a unclear state of deadlock."
"We met on the spring of my 15th year,"
Ah!
"- Ow, that hurt."
"I'm sorry, are you okay?"
"Ah, cute."
- Are you okay?
"The me that just started high school, fell in love with Saeko-san, who was one year my senior, at first sight."
The girl who went out with the good looking guys of every year one after the other.
"Hearing such a rumor, I got all excited thinking that next would be me from the first year, but,"
"Saeko-san,"
didn't even consider me as a partner.
"I don't know if our first year was a bad crop, but, before I realized, Saeko-san had began going out with good looking guys from other schools."
She was someone I couldn't reach.
That hairstyle is super awesome.
- Really?
"That's why, in order to get closer to Saeko-san,"
I began trying to butter up her boyfriends.
Can you go buy yakisoba bread and melon bread?
With pleasure.
"I'm Koyurugi Souta from year 1, class 1."
"In the end, I would be made into a gofer,"
"I would join the crafts club as the only guy, even though I have no interest in it, just because Saeko-san is there."
I'm done.
"Wow, amazing!"
- Thank you.
I'm Koyurugi Souta from year 2 class 2.
"Anyway, I kept hanging around Saeko-san."
"""there ain't no one that can get through to this woman."
"""and every day,"
"""with the train wreck of a life that you've led,"

"sir, i understand this is an emotional time, but i can't let you hurt these flowers."
- i was just leaving.
- [sighs]
- uncle bob.
- who's that?
- i'm glad you came.
"- oh, that must be skoal."
he always had a wild streak.
"- what happened with tim, that was my fault and not hers."
- wait -- what?
what happened with tim?
did -- did he come out or something?
- keep watching.
"- no, champ, it was hers... and mine, a little bit, for letting it happen, but not -- not you."
"you were a victim, son... just like tim."
"you know, harley, you were always special to me."
- harley?
"- i love you, uncle bob."
i'm sorry again.

he would make me throw back pennies from the wishing well.
he would -- he would never steal from anybody.
"- the money was running out, the bills were piling up, wayne's paycheck from the dollar king just went into the negatives with all your spending, and that damn harley kept breaking down and needing to be fixed."
This is scary.
This isn't natural?
This is all fire?
FARHAN:
This is not natural at all.
DICAPRIO:
I've never seen anything like this.
ALLEN:
There are three big tropical rainforest areas left in the world.
"The Amazon in South America, the Congo Basin in Africa, and the South East Asian rainforest which spans"
Indonesia.
"In Indonesia, we're seeing fires being intentionally set in order to create palm oil plantations, which grow the cheapest vegetable oil in the world."
"It's in cooking oils, in processed foods, in your cosmetics, in your detergents."
This really cheap commodity is making companies tremendous profits.
DICAPRIO:
Just as far as you can see.
Rows of palm oil.
"They have destroyed so much of this forest, it's unbelievable."
DICAPRIO:
What a beauty!
DICAPRIO:
I can't even comprehend what these forests must have looked like.
Forests where rhino and elephant and orangutan would be populated into the thousands.
DR. SINGLETON:
These guys are a byproduct of the forest lost because of the palm oil industry.
"You know, they're effectively refugees from forests that no longer exist."
DICAPRIO:
"Wow, that's a good grip."
Yeah!
Strong.
"Hey, I'm gonna get you some fruit, don't be scared."
The carrot or the fruit?
"- First off, you'd better be driving either a kick-ass Camaro or The A-Team van."
That's priority número uno.
And by now your rat tail should hang down to your freaking knees.
"You can still slam dunk, obviously, and you've legally changed your name to ""Vanilla Thunder."""
"Your wife, let me break it down, blonde, six-feet tall, has an awesome rack and caters to your every need."
"- Sorry, babe."
- That's okay.
- You just described your mother.
- Ew!
- Keep going.
"- ""You're still rocking..."""
"You're still rocking the stone-washed overalls, because this look is working."
"Oh, and most importantly, you'd better be saving the world."
"If you became some lame corporate sellout, just throw yourself off a cliff, because you suck."
And I licky boom-boom down.

I gotta do something at work.

What's up with Marshall?
"Oh, no."
- Next crescent?
Muslims sometimes use a lunar calendar.
- I'd have to look it up...
- Next crescent moon is in two days.
"So whatever they're attacking, it's happening in less than 48 hours."
"That sounds like it, sir."
Payment for the nextel is linked to this man.
Jind Allah.
"Literally ""soldier of God""."
That's pretty poor operational security for a sophisticated plot.
"Two months ago, Jind Allah was captured leaving the U.S."
Using a forged pakistani passport via Richmond international airport.
He's been held as a ghost detainee in Guantanamo Bay ever since.
"So technically, he doesn't exist."
Soldier of God isn't a name.
"No, it's most likely a name taken on for the Jihad, meaning struggle."
Extremists claim it's a holy war.
"Yet the words ""holy"" and ""war"" never appear together in the Qu'ran."
- Do we know his real name?
- CIA interrogators
- have gotten nothing out of the guy.
- They need us to break him.
We do know from past intercepts that he's a recruiter.
"He came into this country to assemble the omega cell, a sleeper cell with an unknown mission."
We have 48 hours to do what the CIA hasn't been able to manage in two months.
We could be looking at the first attack on our soil since 9/11.
- Hey.
- Car here?
I told Reid 5 minutes.
I think you should take Prentiss with you to Guantanamo.
- Excuse me?
- She could be of help.
"Lynn Wilson, present residence:"
the state morgue.
Familiar?
"Sorry, no."
What about Stefan Kreiner?
Present residence: nowhere.
"A steady client of yours, I believe."
I'm familiar with Mr. Kreiner.
I prepared some contracts for him.
What kinds of contracts?
Sales contracts.
"Sales contracts for what, Mr. Schoubya?"
"Listen, it's useless for me to play innocent."
The contracts involved tattoos.
"I agree, quite unusual objects, but it's no reason to get upset."
The transactions were legal and carried out by mutual agreement.
"So you negotiated for a third party, a collector."
That's right.
Who is the collector?
- I regret.
What does it cost to skin someone?
I'm only a businessman.
If you are planning to contact the DA in order to gain access to my files...
No crime has been committed.
So there's no necessity to reveal my client's identity.
You're a businessman.
So let's make a deal.
A Hiromitsu.
"If your clientis so hot on this shit, he can have this, provided he tells us something about the tattoo trade."
It's too bad you folded it.
That drastically lessens the value.
"Nevertheless, I'll see what I can do."
I'm supposed to be meeting Philip downstairs.
He should be done with his paperwork by now.
Elevators are the other way.
"Flirting, my ass."
You don't make a bite mark like that unless you're fighting for your life.
"Lying or not, with the victim's mother casting doubt on the only physical evidence against him,"
Reinhardt's practically in the clear.
"APARTMENT OF PHILIP REINHARDT 665 WEST 56TH STREET FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24"
"Bagged his concert jacket, concert shoes, concert shorts."
Let's hope Laura remembered to bleed on them.
Tortious interference.
What do you got?
Lawsuits and countersuits.
Otherwise known as Gillian and Philip's on and off again relationship.
"1994, he broke off their engagement."
She sued him for emotional distress.
She couldn't sing for a month.
"And here, four years ago, another broken engagement."
He sued her for trying to get him fired.
"Well, they looked pretty cozy here."
"Oh... ""It was truly the season to be nice and naughty."""
"""Your little elf, Gillian."""
"Christmas, 2004."
"Ah, they get engaged, they break up."
They get back together.
But she can never quite land him.
Maybe this time she figured out how.
Gillian and Philip applied for a marriage license just two hours after his arraignment.
This is what she bartered her testimony for?
"She wouldn't marry her daughter's killer, would she?"
Love of her life.
She'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
"Go on, go on, go on."
[Gunfire]
No!
No!
[Gunfire exchange]
[Splashing]
Nice shooting.
Thanks.

"That's right, the killer is a woman -"
Annabella Wilgis.
"She's joined here tonight by her attorney, Darren Russem."
Mr Russem?
The murders result from the illness from which Miss Wilgis suffers -
"Multiple Personality Disorder, which in turn was caused by abuse and abandonment exacted on her in her early childhood."
"By having her confess and tell her side of the story first, he's defining the issues before we get to court."
"This isn't about murder anymore, it's about abuse, about psychology."
Why don't we appoint Ricki Lake and Phil Donahue to the supreme court?

We might as well tattoo 'helpless victim' to her forehead.
I would look at a crucifix the whole time that he was hurting me.
Miss Wilgis is here asking for help and understanding.
I'm truly sorry for what I did.
Did you murder Katherine Goodrich?
Yes.
- And Jennifer Lundy?
- Yes.
- And Marilyn Callisto?
- Yes.
- And Mary Ann Newcomb?
- Yes.
"She has presence, you gotta admit it."
She knows exactly what she did.

"I understand Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film,"
- the role of the inebriated uncle.
- No.
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother, I would say,"
"""What have you got to lose by being honest, Sammy?"
"Explain to the man he is 63, not 36."
"And that his brief moment of fame as Inspector Charnfort..."""
Charnforth!
Inspector Charnforth!
"Please be calm, Mr. Hilliard."
I am perfectly calm.
What you are seeing is controlled anger tempered with icy detachment.
It's one of the many subtle emotions of which a good actor is capable.
"Three weeks on location in Devon, followed by three in a London studio."
There are currently only nine films in pre-production in British studios.
None of the others holds a role for you.

"A hundred and fifty years ago, the Gates Falls Mill stood here."
It employed 200 men and women.
"Good Yankees, all."
Sixteen-hour shifts during the Civil War... when the Gates Falls Mill made uniforms for the Union Army.
The job of the men wearing those uniforms... was to end the peculiar institution.
The peculiar institution being slavery.
When the mill burned in 1869... most of them got out.
The fire started in the first floor.
Most of the adult mill workers escaped.
Most of the children...
Most of the children did not.
This is the realm of darkness.
"Years later, a hospital was built here."
Kingdom Hospital.
The bleaching and dyeing vats have given way to doctors and researchers... and operating rooms filled with modern equipment.
"Here, life is charted with lasers... and EKGs and MRIs."
There is no place for superstition.
"Rational thought has replaced whispered myths... about the unquiet, hungry dead."
But there is such a thing as intellectual arrogance.
And arrogance is blind.
Perhaps the ground Kingdom Hospital stands on... is still uneasy... for the cold and damp have returned.
"Time for your enema, Mr. Stillmach."
"By tonight, that impacted colon will be a thing of the past."
Is someone there?
Little girl?
Girl-watching is thirsty work.
I brought you this.
You scared the hell out of me.
"Or, am I just love-crazed about you"
No one's crazy.
Not you.
"Not I. You are my strength, my family"
"Else, how long does it take for a man to break under these circumstances?"
"You have reposed trust in me, I'm grateful."
Thank you
I'll deliver that order
I'll deliver this one

"Sir, please give me one chance."
I came to Bangalore... hoping I'd work for this company.
"Given a job, I'll prove... how profitable I can be for this company"
Perseverance and perspective leads to success... not impetuousness and impatience
I've read much about you in the papers.
I know your story
I'm a fan of yours.

I only ask for 100 seconds to prove my capabilities.

Pistol belong to Mr Malhotra.
Bullet and guns matches
We got gun powder traces.
Location of gun power is bullet is correct
Unless Mr Malhotra knew it his life is in danger
Thats why he called us here in Samos and his 4 guests whom he blamed
is he a murderer?
If its true than his career will be finished
His name must be on all the wanted list of the world
After knowing that truth does he really hates him that he killed him
He will get all the property lt was it Mr Malhotra's will
But we found his will burned in dust bin
Where is that proof of which Mr Malhotra discussed?
Why Mr Malhotra commit suicide?
These days I seldom see you
Have you ever think of wearing glasses?
Where you were when bullet was shot?
I dont have time for silly questions
I was in Samara in my hall
Last night he came into my room to say sorry
he agreed
He only had 1 key.
He never lock door
Key was useless.
Did you break the door?
I tried to break it I tried to break glass with candle stand?
so that I can open door
He shooted himself here
What you touched in the room?
I checked his heartbeat
Why he blame you?
We'll need to make sure of the dimensions of the building first.
I already talked about it.
How big do they want it?
"Including the basement, about 130 pyeong*."
(*one pyeong is equal to 3.954 sq yd or 35.586 sq ft)
They also want a noraebang and wine bar in the basement.
And the amount?
They don't care.
They visited Chairman Oh's house at Pangyo.
"They're friends, and it looks like they're rivals."
They want it to be better than that house.
I said it was our first project and they were shocked.
And the conditions of the site?
You won't need to worry about that.
"I uploaded the pictures, go take a look."
Itaewon lady wants to redo the kitchen!
Again?
"She picked it out happily enough, and even yesterday she was perfectly happy with it, and while we were finishing up she said it looked like a room salon, and wants it done all over again!"
"No, my memory was actually very good."
I've never thought my memory was bad.
"But at some point, although I can't pinpoint the exact date..."
Last fall?
Or maybe last winter?
"Anyway, remembering my phone, struggling to find my car keys, completely forgetting to make a phone call, suddenly forgetting the name of an actor while watching TV."
And it's gotten worse recently?
Yes.
And I'm tired.
Did you perhaps hit your head in a car accident?
No.
Do you think you suffer from a lot of stress?
Stress...
I don't think it's because of stress.

Some traders and collectors aren't very particular about the voluntary aspect.
Who are they?
They don't know each other.
"Everything is organized in an anonymous chat room where skins are auctioned, always available and for everyone."
Only hand-picked intiates are aware of what really happens.
"Was Lynn Wilson's tattoo, Hiromitsu No. 3, also auctioned there?"
I also made a bid.
"2 million, then I dropped out."
Millions?
"Gunzel got 254,000, but who got the rest?"
Somebody who won't allow anyone to interfere with his business.
Irezumi?
"Translate to ""tattoo"" in Japanese."
No one knows more.
At least I don't.
You're a liar.
- I was always overbid.
That's why I couldn't resist when you offered me the Hiromitsu.
I should have known.
"If everything is so secret, how did you find the chat room?"
I didn't.
Irezumi found me.
You first need a buyer or a supplier before you can get close to him.
"But since they only deal with lrezumi and not with each other, you can only discover their identity through lrezumi."
The system is perfect.
You'll never find him.
But we'll get you for being an accessory.
Mr:
"Reardon, what are you doing down here?"
This area is off-limits:
And I've been looking all over this ship for you:
"I'm sorry, Colonel:"
I was just getting bored up there in the sick bay:
I thought I'd take myself a little walk:
"Well, this is the third time you've decided to take a little walk, Mr:"
Reardon:
How do you expect that leg to heal if you keep putting your weight on it?
I really didn't think I'd hurt it any:
"Well, come along before Dr:"
Goodfellow finds out you've been playing hooky again:
"Whatever you say, Colonel:"
[Hawk] Do you think they will attempt to pursue us?
"That's hard to tell, Hawk:"
No telling what capabilities that fake Searcher has:
But if they do...
Buck!
Look:
It disintegrated:
"Yeah, just like the fake people who were on board it:"
Any word yet?
No:
Nothing:
"Sir, what do you make of this?"
The photon energy reading's practically off the scope:

And then it goes straight outside.
The poop flows in out of the toilet into these open gutters.
(woman speaks foreign language)
Rashid:
"They're pouring water out from within the building,"
And she literally just scoops it out.
"To deal with these gutters running through their streets,"
Locals hire manual scavengers.
(geeta speaks foreign language)
Rashid:
"This is literally sitting contaminated water,"
And people are breathing and smelling this every day.
(speaks foreign language)
Rashid:
"From here, the water drains,"
"Untreated, directly into local waterways."
"One of the most polluted is the yamuna river,"
A vital waterway that runs directly through new delhi.
So that is where
The sewage comes out.
All the human waste is dumped into this river.
The yamuna river is considered one of the holiest rivers in india.
"People come to pray here,"
People come here to cremate dead bodies.
They offer blessings.
The stark irony of it all is there's so much waste.
"The water that's released here is untreated,"
So it's literally contaminated water.
People are consuming it.
People are bathing in it.
"To find out how widespread this problem is in india,"
"We spoke with sunita narain,"
About what?
About your returning to America.
- I haven't told him
You ought to.
But he insists... on returning the money right away and that's impossible
Then make it possible.
To keep This family together... throw yourself into the fires.
Om threw himself in the fires too
But I never heard him complain.
When did I talk About Om?
"Ma says, in this country those who put up with suffering are deified"
"Not Gods, we want to live human lives"
"At least, be a brother to him"
"He gave you strength, made a man out of you."
Do your duty as a brother
"I will do my duty, but I'll do it my way."
Not the way Om wants
I must go back to America

Ferris is probably pretty pissed.
Vestiges of that day I had forgotten
Faint in the direction of the sky
Our hearts should have been connected
The trembling eyes don't answer
No matter how much I believe
No matter how much I want to convey
This voice won't reach
Filaments of light
Carve everything into my body
From here where I set out walking
Memory segments
Untie the strings of fate that now bind me
I want to grow strong
So that when we meet again
I can give you more protection
Crap.
I left in such a rush that now I'm almost out of pocket money.
Why do monetary economies even exist?
This sucks!
"Ugh, I want to go to a world where I can just nap all the time."
"I really, fervently want that."
That could be a big mistake.
What do you mean?
"I mean, we just discovered a fucking time-traveling camera!"
We need to consider the possibilities.
"Well, one possibility is we've all been dosed with lethal amounts of radiation... that, you know, could've killed Mr."
"Okay, Negative Nancy, but what if we could use this thing?"
How?
"Remember how Mr. ""B"" took a photo of himself holding that sign?"
"What if we put up, like, the newspaper?"
We would know what happens in the future.
"Yeah, the newspaper, Jasper?"
What are you thinking?
Arts and Entertainment?
- Or are you thinking the race results?
- Oh.
"Well, what if?"
Think about how much money we could make.
"Callie, I foretell that tonight is your last night waiting tables."
"And instead, you can pursue writing full time."
Callie?
No!
Absolutely not!
We're calling the police.
"Finn, I foretell that you live the rest of your life in pathetic obscurity... and die penniless and insane."
"- I'm serious, Jasper."
- So am I.
Does it look like the cops are here?
That people are buzzing about the charred corpse in the storage unit?
Everything looks fine.
"If we reported it, we probably wouldn't have had the party anyway."
We'd have canceled it altogether.
"Uh, we can't cancel it."
"Until you hear different, I'm placing you, on Modified Assignment."
"As soon as we're done here, you can surrender your gun and your shield to the Lieutenant downstairs."
What ever happened to giving a guy the benefit of the doubt?
Take a look in my personnel folder.
Not one civilian complaint.
Not one allegation of excessive force.
Nothing.
Now come on.
That's gotta account for something!
The only thing that counts for something is what happened inside this room.
"Look, Detective Flack did everything by the book."
The guy's a total professional.
"Unlike your relationship with him, which I understand is less than professional?"
"Not only is that none of your business, but it has nothing to do with Todd Fleming's death."
Say hello to the newest member of the rubber gun squad.
I've been officially removed from active duty.
"How do they know we're seeing each other, Don?"
- Who?
- Internal Affairs.
But I thought we were trying to keep this thing quiet?
I didn't say anything to anyone.
That only leaves you.
People talk.
They make assumptions.
"Because of those assumptions now, my word doesn't mean squat with IA."
"- I mean, who could've told them?"
"- Look, Jess, I'm sorry."
But I got bigger things to worry about right now than squad room gossip.
Right.
Detective Angell's working this case until IA's finished with their inquiry.
Inquiry?
Is that what they're calling it?
The Bridge is secure.
Tell Phlox to get the imaging chamber ready.
We've got a patient for him.
"T'POL: [On tape] Acting Captain's Starlog, supplemental."
We've resumed our course for Azati Prime.
Major Hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty.
Dr. Phlox believes he has found an explanation for the Captain's behaviour.
-Where is he?
"-In his quarters, resting."
Do you recall when the Captain was attacked by one of the eggs?
-It sprayed something in his face.
-And I thought it was a defence reflex.
But it was actually something far more sophisticated.
The substance contained a unique neurochemical.
PHLOX:
It infiltrated the Captain's synaptic pathways... causing him to reverse-imprint on the baby Insectoids.
It's the opposite of what happens when a young animal bonds with its mother.
Are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things?
"Well, more likely, a caretaker."
"Of course, the Captain didn't realize this on a conscious level."
"Eventually, he became obsessed with protecting the eggs..."
-to the exclusion of everything else.
-Including our mission.
"I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind."
He'll be awake in a few hours.
He should be fully recovered by then.
I want you and your men to return to duty.
"Yes, ma'am."
Not the sort of thing they trained us for at West Point.
I imagine not.
"You could have come to me, explained the situation."
We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the Captain.
Why do you need a vacuum cleaner?
"We have no carpets I don't care, get some carpets then"
I can get them but give me a son quickly
My dead wife never bore me a son and she just died
"Damn you, you're cursing me I didn't mean it"
"Si Sun, bear me a son to continue my line and I will reward you well"
Even if you were arrested and sent back I'll buy you a house in Shenzhen
and will come to see you whenever I have time
What if there are no children?
Don't say such things
You know I am superstitious
"Alright, never mind..."
Really?
You can get a car for nine hundred dollars?
"Of course it's real, it's been advertised I called just now"
A lot of people have been asking
Better be quick if you want to buy one
"This is it, not too bad Like it or not?"
"No, it's 1997 here lt can't be"
Look
"How can that be, the screw is loose, it's 1967"
This car isn't bad
Do you want to test it?
Sit tight
Come inside and talk
This car will be yours for nine hundred dollars
"Recently driving license fees are up, and so is the gas"
That's why cars are sold cheap
That's right
Okay
Where's the license?
I can't give it to you now
Dr Alexander could take it if you agree.
Fine.
I'm happy to be of help.
OK.
Dave Stubbs attended a family funeral on December the 7th.
It was a Tuesday.
Can you remember where you were?
Yes.
I was here.
In London.
I remember that much because he asked me to hold the fort while he went to his grandmother's funeral.
Grandfather's.
Whatever.
He said he'd be attending a funeral.
"Well, we have found your editor."
Gosh.
Where?
In Africa?
"No, in a grave near his parents' home in Surrey."
He was buried alive.
How extraordinary.
"What's particularly extraordinary about it, well apart from the fact that he'd been buried alive, was that he'd been made to swallow a page from his own magazine."
An article he'd written.
"A piece you described as ""mumbo jumbo""."
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.
It's just an odd coincidence.
"I object to the insinuation, both personally and philosophically."
"Coincidence is a by-product of the random universe, separate events linked by nothing more than man's desire to create meaning."
Some people see meaning in connected events.
That's because you are desperate for answers that are not forthcoming and attributing meaning to events where there really is none.
"I strongly disliked Mr Stubbs' world view and objected to him infecting the journal with it, but I'm not so callous as to not see the tragedy in all of this."
The UV light is set at a frequency that allows even pigment...
"Yeah, it's OK, Frank."
Resurrection of Je...
Jesus...drama... plications...for 'nkind.
"""The resurrection of Jesus has dramatic implications for mankind."""
We probably don't have enough words here to determine which article this came from.
I know where this came from.
This was a piece by David Stubbs.
It was the piece that Paul Fordyce objected to so forcefully.
It makes perfect sense.
"Perfect, sick sense."
"""If the resurrection of Jesus has dramatic implications for mankind"
"""then it must have dramatic implications for philosophy."
"""It dares to answer the question that philosophers have been seeking an answer to."
"""The fact that it's an unexpected, outrageous answer is no grounds for dismissing its veracity."""
How does this help us?
He killed Dave Stubbs.
Who did?
Paul Fordyce.
"Paul Fordyce showed utter contempt towards Stubbs and his, how does he put it, metaphysical mumbo jumbo."
Don't you see it?
"He made him eat his own words, literally."
He buried him alive.
He was making a sick point about the resurrection.
It's a bit of an imaginative leap.
It's a symbol with an obvious meaning.
So he killed Lucy Philips?
Yes.
"And Tony Lane, Henry Elliot?"
What was the name given by the person who called Tony Lane out?
Jeremy Bentham.
A philosopher's name.
"In my case, I was always the lab technician."
Didn't you say tbat tbe lower animals bad no natural enemies...
-...as long as tbey were well fed?
-Sometbing like tbat.
We all sort of bung out.
"Clint didn't Hang out as much with everyone because Clint, I think, to my knowledge, was the only one married."
And He was seriously married.
Maggie was a batHing-suit model.
Gorgeous.
SHe was with Him.
"SHe was His wife, and that was that."
SHe was very quiet.
A very quiet woman.
"Clint, you know, was the star."
Even before He was the star.
Tbey'd bave directors come in wbo were also very important.
Brando was probably one of the biggest.
Brando didn't want to talk too much about it because I don't think He wanted to intellectualize.
I tbink be always looked down on acting as sort of sometbing tbat be sbouIdn't be doing as an American male.
"And really, tbe only one tbat bad anytbing in common witb Brando in tbat class was clint."
"Brando played those bongos, and Clint, of course, played piano and they were both aficionados of jazz."
"both in and out of His Universal classes, Eastwood was learning to be an artist."
He developed His skills watching and listening to His favorite performers.
From jazz soloists like Lester Young Eastwood learned the lesson of impassivity of keeping your cool while pouring out your Heart.
"""Cool"" Had also been discovered by other artists of the '50s."
"Figures like James Dean, Jack Kerouac and chet Baker made detachment seem sexy and glamorous."
"Eastwood watched, and when the time came, remembered."

"""Hitler."
"Salvation and Human Evolution."""
"What about ""Hitler, Wagner and Voyeurism""?"
"And then there will be artists, too, all striving for comprehension."
"Careers devoured, trying to bridge the distance."
"There's my 1,000-year Reich."
"We gave them all much to brood over, didn't we, Joseph?"
Hitler:
We were each islands of strength and will surrounded by great muttonherds of sheep-like followers.
"Stalin, you little babushka, you were going to invade me, but I invaded you first."
"We knew that liberty, equality, and democracy are the grandest nonsense."
But war is the most simple affirmation of life.
But I do not admire him.
Envy?
Stalin?
Paah!
A footnote.
A footnote if he's fortunate.
"Stalin killed millions of his own people, but he killed without grace."
He ruled by fear.
"I ruled by passion, and ecstasy!"
Stalin had no sense of form.
"Yes, he got people's attention, but with force and random brutality."
He's a barbarian of genius.
So what!
He offered nothing to hypnotize or transform his people.
Where is the drama in slaughtering well-to-do farmers?
Stalin misunderstood the principals of opera.
Show me Gyuri!
-Ágika!
- Here you go!
My sweet parents and Ágika!
"I announce it gladly, for our loved major lord the person about who I wrote so much beautiful one already deteriorated very much his nervous system because of the partisans' constant harassment ."
And travel home onto 2 weekly sick-leave now because of this.
I discussed with him that he should take advantage of my kind parents' hospitality...
Go on Ágika.
What was not an easy matter because in him mental state he not wants to be in nobody's inconvenience.
"Hear, Lajos?"
"I hear, yes."
"But I wrote our village's climatic benefits, our beautiful glassy porch and the beautiful view, and the our major lord accepted the invitation."
You may think what this means to me.

Our Gyula's commander comes here!
A glass of wine for the postman.
"Come,Gyuri boy!"
Gyuri's 7 pictures hanged on the wall of the big room of Tót.
All guests had to admire these.
"This, when he were 8 monthly."
The rice pudding until all of them scattered spat.
"Was born blond, but his 1 year age his hair was black."
Everybody was surprised at this very much.
He 7 years old on this picture.
My mom said that a lot were trouble with him.
I was not me then on the world yet.
I was born in the next year only.
This picture when it was made a scout.
Went into a camp in one summer.
He got dysentery.
"Well, we got frightened very much then."
This his high school graduation is picture.
They show up in cave paintings.
They're a normal condition ofthe planet.
They're just not part of our consensus of what constitutes... physical reality.
"What are they part of, then?"
You're asking for an explanation... for something... that can't be explained rationally.
You know the buildup of energy before something happens?
The way your hair stands up before lightning strikes?
"""Before something happens""."
Do you mean they cause disasters?
Why would they need to?
"All right, then... are they trying to warn me?"
Their motivations... aren't human.
"All right, then what do they want?"
I have no idea.
What you really want is to know... why you?
Yes.
"You noticed them, and they noticed that you noticed them."
Most people aren't sensitive enough to see them... without some kind of... trauma.
"What happened toyou, Mr. Klein?"
"Last week my friend got a strange phone call... from an entity... a spirit, whatever."
It seemed to know everything.
Like God?
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.
His name was Indrid Cold.
"It's perception, John."
They appear differently to everyone.
"A voice, a light, a man, a monster."
"If your friend thinks it's God he spoke to, he's off by more than a few degrees."
Then how do you explain that it knows everything?
Look at that.
"If there was a car crash 10 blocks away, that window washer could likely see it."
"Right, just bow it."

Morton:
Mm-hm.

Morton:
Yeah.
Have you seen this plant before...
In the jungle?
This is the first time?
Wow.
(wiart speaks)
When dr.
"Wiart goes out into the jungle and finds plants, they have to be tested."
"This is his lab at the university of nottingham, malaysia campus."
We're gonna see how plants get turned into drugs.
Mogana rajagopal:
This is the lab where we have the fresh plants.
"So once we actually grind them, place it in a vessel like this,"
"And we'll fill it up with the solvent,"
Then we will have all the goodies here.
Morton:
Plant matter is run through a battery of tests
"To extract its constituent chemicals, figure out what they are,"
And then try them against an array of bacterial antagonists
To see if they'll make good medicine.
"Unfortunately, this process can take years for each chemical,"
And that's not even getting into the human trials that are required
"To bring a new drug to market, which can take up to a decade."

Will you win?
Very likely
"You're against Ah Mut Sha, the Thai Boxing Champion"
He fights fiercely
But I might not necessarily lose I won't see you fight
I can't stand your being a boxer
Are you going with me or not?
I don't know English
You can learn it
Those foreigners are weird
They're either blacker than coal or insipid white I would say you don't want to give up that old man
It's not good leaving him like this
Do you really want to bear a son for him?
Have you suffered so much to come here just to bear a son for an old man?
I can't say whether the child you are pregnant with is his or mine
It's mine
Alright...it's yours
What about me?
You want the child but not his father?
Disgusting
is it the neighbour upstairs again?
It's my husband

The whole nation has been busily preparing for the funeral.
The people are barely coping!
"The people that were caught, are people who were recruited to plant the bomb."
"In fact, the North Korean military reconnaissance team belongs to Bureau agents."
Their task is to kill the President.
They are initiating a war.
How dare their country's leader do such a thing!
Myanmar is recommending a diplomatic approach.
To think such a thing can happen.
This is a shame for our country.
Both countries are now scrutinizing each other.
What do you plan to do?
I'm speechless.
"Well then, we'll attack too."
Do you all agree?
All right.
Let's fight.
Of course we must fight.
No need to look at his face.
Fine.
"Well, we'll just hit them then."
The terrorist attacks on Aung San must be punished in the name of our country.
Even the President is unaware of the plan.
- The reactor room:
- Hangar bay:
Hold on:
How do you know that that sign means what it says?
"I understand your caution, but we must take the risk:"
"Hawk, think about it:"
Nothing has been as it seems:
Let's go:
"Buck, Hawk!"
"Oh, there's no need for that, Hawk:"
We're on the same side:
[Dr:
"Goodfellow] Yes, of course we're on the same side, Buck, dear boy:"
"Listen, listen to me:"
"You know, you were quite right about the influence of that planet:"
I was able to synthesize a serum which counteracts its effects:
"That was good, wasn't it?"
Yes:
Dr:
"Goodfellow and I have both been immunized, Buck:"
But we need your help to round up the rest of the crew: : :
So that they can be inoculated as well:
"Nice try, Admiral:"
"If that door does lead to the reactor room, the radiation will kill us:"
"You won't find your way out through there, Rogers:"
That's the fusion reactor room:
You ever hear the one about the lady and the tiger?
No:
Just as well:
[Hawk] The shuttle:!
"[Buck] We got the lady, not the tiger:"
Let's hope it's for real:
My ear stud has fallen in the tank
Will you take it out for me?
Is your stud in this tank?
"For your sake, I will jump into the sea also, just see"
I will not come without the stud
Is it stinking too much?
this is our house septic tank
Is it a septic tank?
"It is ok, after all it is our tank"
What a stink is this?
This is a trade secret
- Just like we sieve the gold sand I can get your stud
- Take it
Thank God!
This is the last bucket this must be seived thoroughly
Has the tank been cleaned?
Many thanks
"Yet to get your ear stud, why do you thank me now?"
-You have already taken it
-Which one?
- The sludge
- What about stud?
- Here it is
"Don't be upset, the drain was blocked for the last 1 0 days"
..the corporation guys asked for Rs 50
So I told you I have lost my ear stud But you are really fast
You have cleaned it Good boy!
Sinner
She has made me clean this sludge
"Come, what do you want?"
Want to check the voter's list Give us your ration card
"We are newly married, we don't have a card for us"
No!
Hamchunk?
"You always knew it could happen, didn't you?"
But I didn't want it to.
None of us did.
Was my Peter-san brave?
He was very brave.
Are you going to be?
L'll try.
I know you will.
And I'm sure that your Peter-san would want you to have that.
What will happen to me now?
"You let me worry about that, Green Beret."
You're what this is all about.

"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- J ust a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."
To me being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.
Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job I knew I wanted to be part of them.
It was there that I knew I belonged.
"To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies."
"They weren't like anybody else, I mean they did whatever they wanted."
They double parked in front of a hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket.
"In the summer, when they played cards all night nobody ever called the cops."
Tony Stacks.
How are you?
Tuddy Cicero.
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?
Tuddy.
"Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria and a few other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss over everybody in the neighborhood."
Paulie might have moved slow but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.
-lt's your fault.
-You started it!
I started it?
It's your fault.
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.
"My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of 11."
He liked that I got myself a job.
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.
Henry!
Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
And my mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros came from the same part of Sicily as she did.
To my mother that was the answer to all her prayers.
I was the luckiest kid in the world.
"I could go anywhere, I could do anything."
"I knew everybody, and everybody knew me."
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys and let me park their Cadillacs.

We must be in some sort of light warp or we would have picked it up earlier.
Put it on visual.
"Iron silica body, planet size-- magnitude 1-E."
We'll be passing close.
Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on our records.
"And yet, here it is."
No time to investigate.
"Science stations, gather data for computer banks."

"A strong interference on subspace, Captain."

"Veer 40 degrees to starboard, Mr. Sulu."
40 degrees.
Sulu!
"Mr. Spock, they're gone!"
Emergency!
Full reverse power!
Space-- the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Ship 's log-
- Stardate 2124.5.
First Officer Spock reporting for Captain James Kirk.
We are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert.
"For four hours, we have made every possible instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted for."
I have placed the ship on red alert.
We've searched again from stem to stern.
"If they're not down on that planet, they're now here."
"No sign of human life on the surface, sir, unless the instruments aren't functioning."
I offer you a sincere and unconditional apology for your wrongful conviction in respect of the offence of conspiracy to murder.
Ted.
Uh...
"As the senior investigating officer,"
I acknowledge your feelings regarding your conviction.
Wrongful...conviction.
And you haven't actually said sorry.
"Maybe you'll do better, DS Arnott."
You require me to sign off that I accept your apology.
I won't unless it comes from the officers who wronged me.
You're out.
What more do you want'?
An...apology.
Jesus Christ.
"This isn't going very well at all, is it'?"
Ted.
"As senior investigating officer, I apologise for your conviction."
"You omitted ""wrongful""."
"But thank you, that's very gracious."
DS Arnott'?
We're all waiting.
Your allegation that I planted incriminating evidence against you is false.
Point of information.
I've made two allegations.
"One, you engaged in inappropriate sexual relations whilst on an undercover operation and, two, you planted £50,000 to simulate a bribe."
- And it's all crap.
- Steve.
Really?
Do tell.
Lindsay Denton knows our procedures inside out.
She exploited grey areas to tie our investigation in knots.
"Oh, you did that all by yourself."
To take their breath away.
"The broad, sweeping historical gesture."
"As the gleam of conquest faded, the SS needed a new mission to sustain vitality."
To brand the German people with this crime for all time.
"My final enigmatic act, my postwar surprise to the world."

Where does that fit in?

Hitler:
What drives a leader beyond his destiny?
Answer me.

"Germany needs free men who feel and know that Wotan is within them, in their own destiny, in their own blood."
One is either a German or a Christian.
We cannot be both!
"We will tear out Christianity root and branch, annihilate it."
Are you afraid the Christian way of life would lead to the dissolution
- of masculine vitality?
- Bolshevik hogwash!
What are you looking at?
Perhaps shame leads to concealment.
Freud's voice:
Your search for perfection... the untainted.
Germany is not worthy of me!

Russia...
Russia was my abyss.

The dark valley of that defeat in 1941 was unbearable.

- If Ray Spies interviewed me... he'd refuse to put me on the committee even for a minute... because he'd find out that when it comes to Laine Hanson...
"I went to my dictionary and crossed off the word ""objectivity."""
Are you suggesting Mrs. Hanson may not be your first choice for vice president?
I'm suggesting that Laine Hanson has stricken our party with policies and attitudes... that are best served across the aisle from where she came.
"I take it, like most members of your party... your selection would be Governor Hathaway."
Governor Hathaway's a great man.
"He's a visionary, a bona fide hero."
- But he withdrew his name from consideration.
- Minds can be changed.
- How much discretion can I count on from you?
"- A hundred percent, sir."
- Even from your own leadership?
- I said a hundred percent.
Good.
Good man.
Good man.
"I think if I make the rounds, do the Sunday morning talk shows... raise the level of the game a bit, outtalk her on the issues..."

What kind of fucking campaigns are they running in Virginia?
Not the kind I'm used to.
"Jack, this whole thing with the girl drowning..."
It's bullshit!
"- I was there, Shelly."
The president told me himself.
- It's an excuse.
Jackson Evans has chosen to make putting a woman in office his swan song.
Laine Hanson is the only reasonable choice in your party.
He's not going with Boxer.
She's too liberal.
He's not going with Jones because she's older than he is.
Out there lies the prairie

"Oh, we don't know where we're goin'"
But we're on our way
- Me for a campfire out on the trail
- Me for an old cayuse
- Me for the sound of the coyote's wail
- And I'm all set to vamoose
"- You for a pipe, when the evenin' is still"
- You for your own backyard
- I'll be the first fella over the hill
- Me for a campfire out on the trail
An old cayuse and a coyote's wail With nothin' to do
And nobody asking me why Give me a cowhand song
And I'll be gettin' along
March on along
March on The doagies on the trail
Are marching' on
Until the last grand swale
Out there lies the prairie
Out there breaks the day
"Oh, we don't know where we're goin'"
But we're on our way
"In Summer Stock, Judy was seen for the first time wearing what was to become her trademark for years to come."
The top half of a tuxedo.
"Two years before, however, she had worn the same outfit in a scene removed from the released version of Easter Parade."
"Irving Berlin had based a song on just a few notes and called it ""Mr. Monotony. """
This is Judy at the top of her career.
Playing on his slide trombone
In a certain monotone
He was known as Mr. Monotony

"Once these waters have been traversed, I will lead my force across the land."
I will remind the cowards of Greece that we have not forgotten their insolence.
Rest and water the horses.
It's best I go alone.
Spartans don't get along well with others.
- Spartans.
- Themistokles.
You old snake.
- What brings you this far south?
- I've come to see Leonidas.
- To warn him that the Persians are on the march.
- You're too late.
Persian messenger already presented his terms to Leonidas.
Symbolic offering of earth and water.
Spartans!
Know this and know it well.
That any Spartan's finest moment the greatest fulfillment of all he holds dear is that moment when he has fought his heart out for the preservation of Sparta and lies dead on the battlefield victorious.
Now.
who is willing to die at our king's side?
Themistokles.
You've come a long way to stroke your cock whilst watching real men train.
Queen Gorge.
Shouldn't he be training them to live at their king's side?
"A new age is dawning, Gorgo."
Won't be long before men rise up and shed the yoke of mysticism and tyranny.
- That sounds like a threat.
- No.
An opportunity to join the rest of free Greece and stand against a true tyrant.
"Unless, of course, you and Leonidas have already made a deal with Xerxes."
No terms were reached.
Xerxes' messenger was
"Well, he was rude and he lacked respect."
Afraid?
You should be.
"Well, the world of fashion is no exception."
"It thrives on fear and on hatred, Michelangelo."
"Fear of failure, hatred of the non-entity."
And why?
Cos only the brightest sparks will gleam for longer than a moment.
None of us seek oblivion.
"In fact, we are all secretly foot soldiers, marching in a great army against time."
It's a hopeless cause.
Hopeless.
"Speaking of which, I'm sure you are aware of the students standing around outside with their..."
Their tacky placards and clichéd slogans.
Listen.
"To a worker in the Dominican Republic, or a village in China a garment factory is not a sweatshop."
It's an employment opportunity.
"You know something, Michelangelo?"
Merlin kept this collection under wraps.
He said it would be a wonderful surprise.
"He promised there would be music, dancing, beading."
"Now, you put that together with a fragrance and a brand name that works any time, any place, any language, you are on to a winner."
And they came up with M.
Mysterious.
Magical.
Mother.
Excellent name for an excellent investment.
Excellent.
Very secure.
"And now some clever journalist, in a paper I do not yet own, writes that M is for murder."
"My marketing people did not warn me of this possibility, Michelangelo."
"No, they did not."
"This was not what I had in mind, not at all."
I asked him to do something for me.
To run a background check on Im Tae Ho.
You investigated Im Tae Ho's records?
This murder case...
"Im Tae Ho reported it himself, didn't he?"
And I'm sure that you found no fingerprints at the scene.
Are you suspecting that Im Tae Ho is the killer?
"Last time, you forced Chan Gyu to make a false statement."
"But this time, you want to turn a police officer into a murderer?"
"That time, I wanted to figure out his relationship with Baek Shi Yoon."
I wanted to see if he would side with Baek Shi Yoon after hearing my orders.
I wanted to figure that out.
Do you understand what he's saying?
"That time, Choi Chan Gyu took Baek Shi Yoon's side!"
"So, that means, they already have a relationship some emotional ties."
Between Choi Chan Gyu and Baek Shi Yoon!
"As well as with his boss, Im Tae Ho."
"If you don't believe me, let's go."
I'll show you the truth.
"After the murders started unfolding, you did nothing... and you never will."
President Hwang rescued me...
"I'm just a life... that was extended, thanks to President Hwang..."
He never should have acted alone.
He may have involved himself even deeper because he worked with Park Seon Woo.
"He knew, the kind of person he was dealing with."
Everyone had the wrong idea about Yong Moon Plan and Park Seon Woo.
"They say that they're a legal company, associated with the agency externally."
"But really, they're a private group, moving secretly according to orders."
Who could be controlling them?
The person who ordered them to monitor us...
Think about it carefully.
"Who was involved in the mission in Macau, three years ago and also involved in Seo Jun Suk's murder and President Hwang's murder?"
"Oh, yeah, she gave him a no-bid contract to maintain all the parks and the medians the minute she got elected."
"He overcharges like Halliburton, but you've got to love the flowering jacaranda trees he put out by the ball fields."
And Tom Bender owns all of our school buses.
"He bought them from the town and then rents them back to us for twice what he paid, which was actually my idea."
But he went behind my back and made the deal himself when Dana and I were on vacation in Hawaii.
- Where did you stay?
"- The Four Seasons, Maui."
"- See, I prefer the Kea Lani."
"- Me, too."
But Dana likes the macadamia-nut pancakes at the Four Seasons.
Twenty-eight dollars for fucking crunchy pancakes that she takes two bites of and throws out.
- You want another one?
"- No, no,"
I should probably save that for the next council meeting.
"Oh, right, it's your vodka."
"Well, thank you for this, the 411."
I never realized there was such a method to your madness.
"Six years on a job, and you learn how things work."
"- Are you heading out, too?"
- Me?
- Are you leaving?
- Now?
- Should we go out together?
- What?
"Not ""should we go out together."""
"Just should we go out together, out of this office, outside?"
"Well, it is lunchtime out there."
Do you want to try this new little Mongolian-barbecue place before they go out of business?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- I have condoms in my desk.
"- Do you have herpes, warts, anything?"
An obvious attempt to cripple the Faction System by attacking its most vulnerable members.
These Divergents despise our system because they are incapable of conforming to it.
"These latest rumors, for example, that I was somehow behind the attack on Abnegation?"
Nothing more than Divergent propaganda.
I am devoting myself to bringing these fugitives to justice.
I've exercised my right
-as acting Council leader...
-(WOMEN SCREAMING) ...to declare martial law until I'm confident that any threat to our security has been eliminated.
Tell Jeanine we got it.
JEANINE:
We are all that is left of humanity.
"The vast wall that encloses this city may protect us from our toxic surroundings, but it is up to us to confront any element that could poison us from within."

"Sorry, you have to leave."
You just don't belong here.
CHRISTINA:
It's all her fault.
Why are you only telling me about Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan?
"Among the 5 individuals, I understand Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan the most."
"As long as those 5 forget about the incident, it will be all right."
What about Lee Kyeong Wan?
Stay close to Lee Kyeong Wan.
The other four will expose themselves.
So first we eliminate Lee Kyeong Wan and let the remaining four individuals show themselves.
"I understand, but why send me to Cheong Wa Dae?"
"This, I will let you know in the future."
"When you begin your plan,"
"As long as you believe in me, it is enough."
I will use my plan to eliminate them.
In a way that it will be unforgivable by others.
Really?
You also have thoughts.
I will follow you from the side.
I will try to track the source of the maritime construction account.
Go to the assistant Officer's wife account.
Find out if Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan used her to cover up his construction plans.
I've already told you who is behind the maritime construction.
"You haven't seen the invoice, have you?"
A few days ago I wrote this down in a rush.
That...
That can be written any time when there is mutual trust.
Investigator Jang.
Proceed with the source of the maritime construction research.
And prepare the arrest warrant.
That's great!
I will prepare the arrest warrant for Investigator Jang.
Who permitted the arrest?
Lee Kyeong Wan has become very powerful.
He is immune from prosecution.
Or would his talent have been buried  in some graphic design studio sketching commercial ads?
"Pavlos remained a true artist, a bohemian, who never cared about being broke, and being broke was his permanent condition."

"Such was the case when he remembered his forgotten gold sovereign in the pot, the sovereign that had united him and Aliki once upon a New Year's Day..."
How many memories it brought back!
And the sovereign?
The sovereign was still there.
"No use keeping it any more, though."
Hello!
Can you please change this sovereign for me?
"- It's counterfeit, unfortunately."
- Counterfeit?
All right then...
Counterfeit?
He couldn't help it.
He would be just penniless for yet another day...
He couldn't care less as long as he could enjoy the autumn sunshine... and head to Zappeion Park to browse around a new painting exhibition...
Pavlos!
Aliki!
"How are you, Pavlos?"
"Long time, no see."
"Yes, it's been too long."
We never happened to meet.
"Is it too late for me now, 7 years later, to apologize for what I said to you in that gallery?"
Your first exhibition.
I feel terribly guilty for the things I said.
Well...
when I saw you with....
He was my husband.
"Yes, I know."
You must have hated me that day.
"I didn't hate you, Pavlos."
- Take it up.
"- Come on, poor babe."

There was a man on deck who got crushed to death by train coaches   trying to get a lifeboat out.

"Could we get Pete an oven, please?"
Hey.
"The GE Tri-vection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven, because it uses three kinds of heat."
Thermal technology for consistent temperature.
"GE Precise Air convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed."
"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes."
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
Retool what now?
I'm the new vice president of east coast television and microwave oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much younger woman.
"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
"When I played that lady rapist on Law  Order, guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out?"
Hemorrhoid cream.
Ms. Maroney?
Electronic?
"Nothing, sir."
"This is Captain James Kirk, of the starship Enterprise."
"Whoever finds this, please get it to Starfleet Command."
I am engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn.
He's immensely strong.
"Already, he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being."
"Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile."
"The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine."
"The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons."
There's very little here.
"Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense."
"Still, I need to find one."
Bare-handed against the Gorn I have no chance.
"Leave channel one open, lieutenant, just in case."
"Aye, aye sir."
"What are you gonna do, Mr. Spock?"
"I'm going to wait, doctor."
- There's little else I can do.
- What about the captain?
"If I could help him, I would."
I cannot.
"Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic."
What about some logic now?
"Where is the captain, Mr. Spock?"
"He's out there, doctor."
"Out there somewhere in 1,000 cubic parsecs of space."
And there is absolutely nothing we can do to help him.
A large deposit of diamonds on the surface.
Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe.
"Beautifully crystallised and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon."
An incredible fortune in stones.
All is calm on the water according to reconnaissance.
The archery competition between Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops was completed as scheduled.
The results of the battle formation drills are satisfactory as well.
"We've completed spread formation and single file formation drills, so we'd like to begin the overlapping reversed V formation drills tomorrow."
"Well done, everyone."
"Oh, at any rate, when will the High Commander be back with us?"
I'm getting so anxious waiting for him...
Sir.
"Was the artillery training conducted on land again, Captain Chung?"
Yes.
I believe my Soon-chun and Kwang-yang troops are scheduled for an onboard artillery training tomorrow.
There will be no training onboard.
Captain Chung!
"Let me make it clear, Constable Kwon."
There will be no more naval training as far as the artillery is concerned.
Ensign Chung!
"Yes, sir."
I want the cannons mounted on Soon-chun and Kwang-yang galleys tomorrow.
Constable Kwon!
I will do it.
"From now on, I will conduct the artillery training."
The High Commander is wrong!
He's making a bad mistake!
You have got to stop confusing the soldiers by blindly following the
High Commander!
We are trying to do our duty as naval officers of Left Cholla.
Constable Kwon!
Have the cannons mounted by 09:00!
"Yes, sir!"
Give it up now.
Some things are just not possible.
We have to reduce the weight of the iron plates.
"Well, Merle was annoyed because Olivia objected to the elopement, if that's what you mean."
"Wasn't she more than annoyed, Mr. Kirk?"
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that she was fighting mad?
She was angry.
Perhaps the degree of her irritation could be estimated if you would tell us what the defendant shouted at her aunt.
She said--
"Yes, Mr. Kirk?"
"Well, she said, ""If you try to stop me, I'll kill you."""
Your witness.
"Mr. Kirk, when the bulk of your grandmother's estate was left to your cousin Miss Telford, were you annoyed, irritated, perhaps even angry?"
"Furious, I think, would be the best description."
But I recovered nicely in time.
You were on good terms with your cousin?
As much as Olivia would permit.
"One night, Merle walked in her sleep and came directly toward my house."
"Subconsciously, she preferred me to Olivia--"
"Objection, Your Honor."
The witness has previously testified to having had no training in psychiatry.
Sustained.
Let us turn now to the night of the party.
Where were you at the approximate time the murder occurred?
"Well, in the living room, for one thing, looking out into the garden."
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Yes.
Mr. Paul Drake.
"He asked if I knew where he could find Danny Pierce, and I asked him if he'd seen Margo Stevens."
I'm sure he'd recall the conversation.
"Mr. Kirk, since you were looking out into the garden, perhaps you saw Howard Langley out there."
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did."
That's why I asked Drake about Margo Stevens.
They were necking in the bushes.
That's a lie!
The blood of those two people...
You're going to have to clean it for a while now.
Please don't steal our subs and I hope you enjoy the rest of the episode!
"I, Seo Yong Hak..."
Now in front of the people.
In front of all the citizens...
To have to reveal the truth...
I do with my deepest apologies.
"However,"
"Because the citizens deserve to know, I have gathered up my courage and"
I now stand here.
The next person the City Hunter is after.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
Because of the sweep mission 28 years ago.
"Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, Chairman Kim Jong Shik, Chairman Cheon Jeon Man and I, all of us, were scapegoats of revenge."
However!
"The person who directed the Sweep Mission 28 years ago... is now the current President, President Choi Eung Chan."
He personally planned it... and personally implemented it.
Director!
Seo Yong Hak said the President planed it!
The sweep mission involved 5 people but he still didn't disclose the details.
President Choi Eung Chan Emergency Press Conference.
Why was the sweep mission set up?
It's not something I know of (or familiar of)
Is it really true that in '83 November you did not direct this plan?
That's right.
"Former member of the supreme council, Seo Yong Hak said that... the City Hunter's last target was the President."
I don't know under what motivated him to say that.
"Today, the press conference will end with this."
Just one more question.
"A Seoul Special Investigation prosecutor was looking for the 1983 classified document and died while doing so, did you know that?"
The person who planned the Sweep Mission... is the current President...
You want to make me realise that my success was my illusion.
Right...?
I've been sitting at home and rotting these four years.
Only because of you
Sitting at home doesn't kill art.
- I'm finished!
I can't sing
Go away
"You're superstitious, KK"
"I never under-rated your voice, I still don't"
You can sing a great song again.
"And you'll outdo yourself... scoring your own music, instead of stealing."
I'm sure
How...?
How can a mind bent on thieving score original music?
"Two lines for you to remember, KK."
Spring follows autumn
And what use living if you have accepted defeat?
"Hey, you said what...?"
What's life lived in defeat?
"""Lived to the last breath, Life lives not in Death's fear"""
The Earth... the skies...
"""my heart... all resonate with the resolve..."""
"""to sing the song of love even when I'm heartbroken..."""
the song of love... for what is life lived in defeat?
Dense black nights... will be bathed in moonlight
"""Somewhere in the dark, you will find a ray"""
"""Your life is no journey through misery..."""
"""pick from the thorns on your path the path leading to your goal"""
For what is life lived in defeat?
"Mr Om, you've started a music company?"
"Yes, I'm offering you distribution"
It's all right!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
"Go on, Freddy."
Come on inside.
Come on.
So Gary Figgis copped a plea.
"Gave up the connection between Ray, the PDA and the mob."
There were a shitload of indictments.
"And the sheriff, Freddy Heflin—"
"You know, there's people on both sides of the river wish he never recovered."
They cursed the day he took down Ray Donlan.
"But what they don't know, he figured out:"
No one is above the law.
"Four cops dead, and one dead cop resurrected."
"In a bizarre twist, Murray ""Superboy"" Babitch sits alive and well in a holding cell—"
Sheriff Fred Heflin apprehended Babitch single-handedly.
"...he will be recovering the hearing in his good ear, so that's good news."
Files were seized this morning—
Officer Gary Figgis testified about mob influence and bribery.
"Three months since the shoot-out in Garrison, New Jersey... reputed mob boss Toy Torillo has been indicted on four counts of racketeering."
An unidentified corrections officer was arrested today... for the murder three years ago of Officer Glenn Tunney.
I understand Jim Allen is with the mayor.
Do you want to go back to him?
"[ Man ] back in the '70s, every cop wanted out of the city."
but the only cops allowed to live outside New York were transit cops.
because the Transit Authority was also run byJersey and Connecticut.
"So these guys I knew at the 3-7... they started pulling overtime at subway stations... and got the city to declare them ""auxiliary transit cops. """
They bought some land in Jersey.
Got some cheap loans from people they knew.
- What's wrong?
- One second.
Hey!
Run softer!
Learn how to run the right way!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
The American investors were threatening to withdraw on us.
"But we're good, since Representative Yoon brought those Chinese people here."
Our Representative Yoon...
has the right mentality.
"I was a little bit uncertain, honestly..."
Because I'm not sure how much Hong Gyu Man can cover up for us.
Weren't you constantly negotiating with Chief Jung?
This person?
He wouldn't tell me.
Whether we can break the legs of about ten tenants who refuse to leave.
Or if we can light the entire district on fire until there isn't anything left.
And whether or not Hong Gyu Man would be able to cover that up.
What do you think?
Would you be able to cover that up?
Or not?
"Once we build the Hallyu Core Mall we will profit one trillion won immediately, upon completion."
Between people who manipulate trillions of dollars in order to boost our economy and people who make 20 to 30 million won per year...
Who is more important?
Even the ones in power don't have this much ambition...
That's why our country is in this state.
"The drive to place our country's economy as a top priority, is severely lacking."
Hong Gyu Man.
Yes?
With the profits we gain from the Hallyu Core Mall
I plan to use those funds when my father retires.
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
Jean Valjean is nothing now!
Another story must begin!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
BEGGARS' CHORUS: (SINGING) At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle!
It's a war!
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about What is it for?
One day less to be living
At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying
And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill
One day nearer to dying!
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day!
(FACTORY WOMEN GIGGLING) (SHUSHING)
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread
There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed (GASPS)
And we're counting our blessings
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today
I'm very disappointed.
"If you came just to discuss this,"
Then please go back.
"Your Majesty,"
"I, Yeo Mi-Eul, have never once lived my life for myself."
"Before I became Priestess, I was a woman who kept Your Majesty in my heart."
"After becoming Priestess,"
"I only have BuYeo in my heart, I live for BuYeo."
I lived my whole life for BuYeo and Your Majesty.
How can you treat me like this?
"Like you, Yeo Mi-Eul,"
"I, too... have a person whom I deepy respect, Hae Mo-Su."
"Whenever I think of the cruelty you inflicted on him,"
I can't stand it.
This scar will be with me till the day that I die.
I heard Your Majesty is prepared to wage war against the Han Dynasty.
Indeed.
Do you think we stand a chance of winning?
"Because of your animosity towards the Divination Palace and I,"
You made a wrong decision.
Such reckless decisions will be frowned upon by the Gods.
"For the sake of BuYeo,"
Please act with wisdom and prudence.
"Then,"
"You suppose that sacrificing the lives of 10,000 soldiers to appease the ruthless Han Dynasty will garner Divine protection for us?"
Stop exploiting the Gods to blind and deafen me.
A cloud of war hangs over BuYeo now.
"If war erupts, should we move the fleet to Gyeh-Ru?"
"Don't worry,"
We'll know of it as soon as they mobilize the troops.
It's not too late if we move then.
I wonder how So Seo-No is doing.
"- Ned, what are you doing here?"
"- Filing, fielding calls, making coffee."
What happened to assistant Giancarlo?
"He had to, um, scoot."
What happened to Giancarlo was this:
After eating a slice of pie  from what he believed was a secret admirer in Accounting  Giancarlo experienced what could best be described as  extreme intestinal distress.
You pruned his pie?
"Sent him home, hid in Human Resources waited for them to call Happy Time Temp Agency, then canceled the order and showed up with a smile and a pleasant attitude."
I think that's the most romantic thing I ever heard.
He is stalking you.
You don't think I'm stalking you?
I'd be a hypocrite to judge you for dosing someone's pie.
- Why?
Are you stalking me?
- Depends.
"Now we're living our Parisian lifestyle, does that mean I can't be close?"
I feel safer now that you're here.
Then this isn't stalking.
"It's just good, old-fashioned chivalry."
Walk with me.
Cancel my appointments.
I'm leaving.
But I've got one more thing to do.
Have my car waiting for me downstairs.
With the Pie-Maker serving the perfect distraction  Chuck beelined for the stolen bee key.
She found the bee key exactly where Betty Bee put it.
Then she made an important discovery  of a different kind  before she herself was discovered.
Chuck.
I told you this was dangerous.
Alive again doesn't mean you can't be dead again.
There's a reason I don't let Digby play in traffic.
I suppose we can talk about this later.
"For the orc too late, brothers, we have come"
To witness that strange fight and but in vain.
"For the orc too late, brothers, we have come,"
But not for him who did the work profane;
"May so from heart to heart my fury spread,"
Which in the waves will doom the godless dead.
"I, islanders, your rout which threatens death,"

"The naked rock my boat presently nears,"
"Where she was placed, to feed the monster spread."
"I look, and known to me the dame appears,"
"And more appears, when nigher her I head:"
"Olympia she appears, and is indeed"
Olympia!
Angelica's not my meed.
"But I, naked, to the warrior say naught,"
Drop my head and to raise my eyes dare not.
"Speak, Olympia."
What evil destiny
You to this cruel island has conveyed
From where you in as much felicity
Were with Bireno left as could be said:
"Narrating all to you, I should exceed."
How my false spouse betrayed me as I lay
"Asleep, and how of pirates made the prize,"
They bore me from the desert isle away.
And now I deliver you from your chains.
Oberto comes;

Cash-hungry producers simply burn the forest to the ground.
The biggest problem with oil palm now
Is in order to clear the land properly
And prepare it for oil palm you've got to burn it.
Anderson:
"This is conservationist mike griffiths,"
Who's been fighting to save the rainforest for the last three decades.
Griffiths:
"This is a relatively small one, believe it or not."
The big ones are picked up on the satellite.
Anderson:
"On what kind of scale, nationally?"
It's industrial grade.
"So hundreds, maybe even thousands of fires,"
Just like this across the whole country daily.
Sure.
Yeah.
"From the oil palm plantation's point of view, it's a very good system."
"It's not very complicated, and it's cheap."
♪
"I mean, now you can't see 10-15 meters-- let's get out of here."
Anderson:
"It feels like dusk, but it isn't, is it?"
That's just the smoke.
Griffiths:
A lot of people throughout the whole of this province
Are now suffering from respiratory problems because of this pollution.
Anderson:
The health threat that the smoke poses
Is only a small part of the problem with these fires.
"As mike then went on to explain, it's the specific nature of the forest itself"
"That has even larger, global ramifications."
What case?
"Don't you understand that your police are trying to take away my business, my property - everything that I have!"
Your police are blackmailing me!
Who?
Who is blackmailing you?
Who?
What are you involving the police officers into your business for?
"Do you understand that you couldn't have been detained without any official documents, a warrant or something like that?"
It's nonsense!
Nonsense!
There was one doctor in my cell.
May be you can identify that prison by finding him?
What is that doctor's surname?
Petrovskiy...
Viktor Apolinaryevitch.
The tailor has come and is waiting.
Petrovskiy.
Viktor Apolinaryevitch.
What was he accused of?
I don't know exactly.
Something connected with illegal drugs.
He is a doctor and he quarrelled with his boss...
- His age?
- About sixty.
Check it through all the channels.
Tell the tailor to come in.
All right.
You may write a statement to initiate the criminal proceedings.
You may turn to the district police department or to the district prosecutor's office.
Well...
Viktor Apolinaryevitch Petrovskiy has never been detained or accused of criminal activities.
No man under such name has been to any prison in our region.
Beautifully tanned human skin.
"It has retained its flexibility, and of course, all its features."
What a disgrace for the bank.
But why did you do that?
His motive is money.
It all started when Madam de Vibray was driven to suicide.
She believed herself ruined.
"In fact, it was only a manipulation of her stock fomented by Mr Nanteuil."
And to say I didn't see anything.
It's clear that you didn't call enough your associate to account.
"After the suicide of the Baroness, Mr Nanteuil, aka Fantomas, transported her corpse to Jacques Dollon's loft."
There he put the painter to sleep to set him up as the murderer.
"Effectively, Jacques is suspected and imprisoned."
"Then, fearing that the young man manages to exonerate himself, he hangs him in his cell."
And he has this diabolical idea:
He uses jacques Dollon's hand to commit his crimes with impunity.
It's impossible.
Defend yourself.
Fantômas... in name of the law...
I arrest you!
Stay calm.
"""The misfortune of man,"" said the philosopher,"

And disconnect the power.

The whole piece has been magnetized.
"There are electromagnets everywhere in the ceiling, walls, under the floor."
The battle must continue!
Useless.
Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails.
I'm well aware of that.
These Xindi are innocent.
"If we let them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us."
"I don't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality... out the window when things start getting a little rough."
Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed also believe... that this would compromise our mission.
Your opinions have been noted.
Now get back to Enterprise and start the antimatter transfer.
"I'm sorry, Captain, I can't obey that order."
You may not be wearing a uniform... but you can still be charged with insubordination.
Perhaps we should contact Starfleet and discuss this with Admiral Forrest.
You're relieved as First Officer.
ARCHER:
"Major, escort T'Pol back to the ship and confine her to her quarters."
HAYES:
Sir?
ARCHER:
I gave you an order.
Ma'am.
[Serious instrumental music continues]
[Door beeps]
Come in.
The first shuttlepod is on its way.
How long will it take to transfer the antimatter?
"Using both shuttlepods, about four or five hours."
ARCHER:
I didn't realise how badly I needed a shower.
I've spent too much time in that hatchery.
"If you're looking for a new first officer, you should consider Malcolm."
You're going to want someone on the Bridge full-time...
I'm a little busy at the moment.
I'm happy with the command structure the way it is.
I have to finish up!
Who are you?
!
An angel of death here to send you to hell!
Double the reconnaissance and issue a full alert!
Prepare the weapons!
"The spirit of the soldiers will decide the battle, so do all that is possible to boost their morale!"
"Five days, Admiral."
You only have five days left to move your men back out to the Gogeumdo Headquarters.
Emissary...
"If you disobey, General Yu Jong will step in and force you out."
And the royal court will send the Royal Prosecutor and his guards to bring you in.
"You don't want to go through that shameful experience in front of your men again, do you?"
"The greatest shame for a warrior is showing his back to the enemy, Emissary."
"Look, Admiral..."
Congratulations.
The King of Chosun has granted your request.
I wouldn't call it a request.
This is the way it should be.
"General Konishi was very pleased, and said he would send additional one thousand heads."
When should we launch a messenger craft?
That's up to your leader to decide.
"Just let me know when, and I will have them allow passage."
Are you certain we don't have to worry about Yi Soon-shin?
What can he possibly do when he is no longer in command?
"If he takes any action without my authorization,"
I will strike him down without hesitation.
Thank you.
At last we can breathe a sigh of relief.
We must contact General Yu Jong.
You saw Admiral Yi's attitude.
We gotta go.
"- Hey,where's the costume?"
- It's itchy.
Did you try the long sleeves on underneath?

The cool thing about halloween is that it's a uniquely american holiday.
"I mean,despite it's obvious origins in the celtic festival of samhain and the christian all saints day, it really is a melting pot of various immigrants' traditions and beliefs."
"It became a little more commercialized in the 1950s with trick-or-treat, and today it rivals only christmas in terms of popularity."
All i asked was what he was doing this weekend.
I'm toying with the notion of either going to the edgar allan poe shadow puppet theater or the reenactment of the 19th century phantasmagoria.
- I don't want to know.
"- Oh,yeah,you do."
"Phantasmagorias are these amazing pre-cinema projected ghost shows invented in france, where the showman attempted to spook the audience using science magic."
And it just so happens that i have an extra ticket.

"One week ago, a page from a highly classified file surfaced online."
"That same day, SECNAV got a love letter demanding that he put the brakes on the Navy's green initiative which is to build all new subs and ships with lighter, alternative materials."
TONY:
"If the SECNAV refuses to play, the e-mail threatens to release more pages from the file."
It's straight-up blackmail.
"What is in this document, Director?"
The file was remotely lifted from a database at AUTEC.
That's the the Atlantic...
Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.
It's a facility where they test military technology.
"Unmanned submersible drones,"

"Easy, McBradbury."
The file details a simulated warfare test done at AUTEC.
"When you regain your senses, let me know."
"I'm going back to Thera, which I'm telling you for the last time, is not Atlantis, because Atlantis never existed."
The Ark will be returned to the Balkans immediately.
"Meanwhile, I'd appreciate it if you'd clear out your former office, and remove yourself from the premises."
Professor.
Come on.
Why wasn't the Torch in the Ark?
"Well, it probably was at one time."
"You said the Cult of Solon lived in some caves near Exeter, right?"
Of course.
That cut in the Ark was made by a tool forged near there.
You mean the cult opened the Ark and removed the Torch?
Call the police.
Hey!
"A man planted on the inside fires a tranquilizer dart, escapes in a dummy cab to a waiting speedboat."
I think we can safely say this was no ordinary smash and grab.
"No, this was planned like a military operation."
Isn't that an awful lot of trouble to go through to steal artifacts?
The Ark and the medallion would sell for millions on the black market.
"Inspector Rhodes, this just came in."
Thank you.
"Now, we ran your description of the thief through Interpol."
Is this the man?
"No, I-"
- I didn't get a good look at him.
I did.
That's the guy.
Yannis Zavros.
"A general in the Greek army, until he was court-martialed."
For what?
He's the leader of a militant group of fanatics who claim Macedonia as their birthright.
They see themselves as the heirs of Alexander the Great.
"- Daddy, please!"
[Chains clinking]
Do you know how rare it is for an arsonist to be a burn victim?
Less than 3.5%.
This guy's not an arsonist.
He's a serial killer who uses fire.
"And that choice of weapon tells us that he's aggressive, driven, and destructive, just like fire itself."
But why would someone so controlling choose the most unpredictable weapon?
This juxtaposition tells us there's more going on with him than we realize.
He's probably experienced some kind of loss these past few years that started him down this path.
We should look at accidents where couples were burned.
We're talking about hundreds of fires.
Focusing on ones where gasoline was the accelerant.
[Phone rings]
"Leaving his victims in the heart of Rivertown, in the center of these buildings themselves, may be subconscious on his part, but it says that this affected his very core."
"All right, hold on."
Somebody else has just been abducted.
How do we know this is our guy?
Because his daughter said a monster took her daddy away.
Kaman!
"Kaman, come on, man!"
What are you doing?
My little girl's back there.
You gotta let me go.
[Garcia] The victim's name is Christopher Edwards.
"He's 35, and he lives in the suburbs."
- [Garner] What part?
- [Garcia] Birmingham.
How far is that from the Rivertown district?
Not more than 40 minutes.
He might already be inside.
Let's lock it down.
It's about 45 minutes away.
So we're in a bit of a race to get there in time.
Big bear in there.
"As well as relocating bears,"
Professor Izumiyama also studies them.
"By fitting radio collars to track them, he hopes to discover more about their movements."
I'm not sure how much more time we've got.
"They have to work fast, before the drugs wear off."
Hirokun.
Hirokun.
"As Hirokun begins to stir, it's wise to take some precautions."
Just John and Izumiyama-san we'll leave here.
So we should retreat to the inside of the car?
Yeah.
Professor Izumiyama carries pepper spray just in case of attack.
John knows how nervous local people can get.
"People get so scared and so angry about these bears that unless he did something, they'd just end up dead."
"A few hours of unpleasantness, which it will have forgotten by tomorrow, is well worth it."
"Another bear on its way, but now its movements can be tracked."
Hunter.
"Yeah, that one."
"If, maybe in a weeks' time..."
"Over 25 years, Professor Izumiyama has caught a lot of bears."
"More than 1,000."
"More than 1,000 bears."
"1,000 bears and counting and there's no sign of stopping yet."
"As soon as one bear is released, it's straight on to another."
"Throughout the summer, he's on call 24/7."
"Despite being such a populated country,"
"Honshu is home to over 10,000 bears... ..and what Professor Izumiyama is discovering is remarkable."
These bears have huge territories.
They can roam nearly 50 square miles in search of food.
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Look to your dressage, gentlemen."
"Chaperone Mrs. Enright, once an army officer herself, casts a critical eye over the troops."
"Well, it was the first day on the parade square but I thought Mr. Foxsmith yawning on parade was something I'd have had him marched to the guard room for."
"And as for Mr. Gorell Barnes, five minutes behind everyone else, ten minutes, 15."
They need to smarten up very considerably.
March.
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
"Left, right."
And halt.
Halt.
"Apart from the pace and step, it was perfect."
"Oops, sorry."
Right... and halt.
Halt.
"Master of the house, Mr. Gorell Barnes, invites his guests to celebrate Napoleon's downfall."
"Joining them is historian Andrew Roberts, an expert on the wars."
I'd just like everyone to know this is a dinner in celebration of the fine victory at Waterloo.
And also I'd like to welcome Mr. Roberts to Kentchurch.
I hope you enjoy dinner and your stay.
"So, um... enjoy your dinner."
"Ma'am, this evening we have soupe la reine, escargot bourgogne..."
"Despite the conflict, it remained fashionable to pepper conversation with French words and serve French food."
So what do you make of the spread?
"After dinner, the table is transformed into the battlefield of Waterloo."
almost as much is psychology as is military strategy.
These action replays of the Duke of Wellington's finest hour were popular.
"Andrew Roberts describes the moment when, after ten hours, the tide of battle turned."
imperial guard marched straight through the center...
You're doing a magnificent job.
"Of course, I accept."
I'm flattered.
And I wantyou to knowthat I serve only one presidentata time.
Yes.
And you will give General Cushman full access.
"[Sighs] Itcould take a little time, but I will order a search foryour papers."
- Good.
- But it does raise a troubling issue.
- What?
- Castro.
Yes?
We have recent intelligence thata Soviet nuclear submarine... has docked at Cienfuegos.
"Well, we'll launch a formal protest."
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.
Mr. Kennedy gave the Russians a verbal promise... that he would not invade Cuba.
Did you authorize Dr. Kissinger to putthis in writing?
Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job...
unpleasantattimes... is to knowwhatothers don'twantme to know.
"Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't."
It is notmy practice to spy on the president.
Dr. Kissingermanages to convey his innermostsecrets withoutmy help.
"Dick, we've lived with Communism in Cuba forten years."
"But it has never been the policy ofthis governmentto acceptthat, and it is certainly not C.I.A. Policy."
C.I.A. Policy?
The C.I.A. Has no policy exceptwhat I dictate to you.
"I tried to, uh, adjust to the world as it is today, notas you or I wanted it to be ten years ago."
Is thatwhy you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
"This is a very dangerous direction, Mr. President."
Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors of judgment.
"But ifwe were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can... we could create a balance of power... thatwould secure the peace into the nextcentury."
"Well, what do you know?"
Not enough.
"It sounds like science fiction, but you make planes invisible."
Project Harvey.
- Which is?
- Stealth.
We can bring our planes and submarines right into Soviet territory... without any detection.
The K.G.B. Kidnapped this man...
Anton Baklanov... and took him back to the Soviet Union.
Was he the key to Stealth?
- We don't know that man.
- But he wasn't the key to it.
No one person has the key to anything.
Information is spread out through multiple departments and highly compartmented.
Classic definition of the left hand not knowing the right.
Soviets would have to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to put it all together.
And get through a hell of a lot of security.
The last meeting where all of the different groups actually met... each of us had two of our security guys watching our every move.
What meeting was that?
What meeting was that?
He is probably being tortured right now.
And once they realize he doesn't have everything they need... they will find out who does.
You said that they would need to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to get to Stealth?
"Well, that's exactly what they'll do."
They got to him.
Circumvented dozens of F.B. I. Agents looking for him... and sent him out of the country.
You think two D.O.D. Security guards can protect you... or anybody else?
Think again.
"Alexandria, Virginia, two months ago."
Who was there?
"Uh, reps from Lockheed and Northrop."
They're competing against each other for the D.O.D. Contract.
But then...
"Russia-- invincibility undone, the circle of my perfection crushed under the boots of Slavs, no less."
Stalinites!
The Führer Myth... shattered.
A quarter million of my young soldiers slaughtered in the snow.
My most humiliating experience.
I was naked before the German people... the world.
"And then, I had to continue with my role to take the stage again."
Only my will allowed me to remain in character.
"A childhood nightmare returned-- running home naked from school in the snow, hiding behind bushes, trying to avoid being seen, to avoid ridicule, exposure."
I pondered the many options.
Calling a world conference for peace.
"I could be ""The Great Peacemaker,"""
voluntarily withdrawing to our own borders.
We would keep only...
Austria.
"I considered retiring, going back to my painting."
"I longed to paint, to create, to build."
I should have been an architect.
"Has a great ruler ever simply disappeared from the public stage, changed his identity?"
"""Let someone else play Hitler,"" l thought,"
"""Give someone else the role!"""
But the stain of defeat would not fade.
And then... it came to me.
"Slowly at first, like a-- a blossom on tree in spring."
What I could do next.
( nervous breathing )
"An old image-- a primal hatred, crystallized."
The answer.
It obsessed me and lifted my spirits.
A new plan for these terrible times.
"It was the one thought, the one idea, that brought me peace enough to sleep."
When did you become an eco-freak?
"- Baby,i was born green."
- We're going to detroit.
It's halloween weekend.
Arson investigators have noticed a 3-year trend
- in the days leading up to halloween.
- Devil's night.
This unsub is killing only these 3 days out of the year.
- How's he doing it?
- He's burning his victims alive.
He's abducting seemingly random people and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
He struck again last night.
Yeah.
"Tony torrell,40."
"he lives in the suburbs, but he was found 20 miles away in the rivertown district."
He's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
- what does he do during the rest of the year?
- He's dormant.
"You know,arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25 who can't stay away from fire."
"Yeah,they're addicted to it and there's no rehab."
"And they target dwellings,not people."
So you're saying he burns his victims alive but he's not an arsonist?
Fire is simply his weapon.
And devil's night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
Then we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
"Well,his last victim was athletic."
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.
The offender must be just as strong or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
"Still,how does he transport his victims across the city and get them inside buildings without being noticed?"
Criminal.Minds S06E06
"niccolo machiavelli wrote,""if an injury has to be done to a man,"
"""it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared."
Lighter.
Good.
"Be warned, you may experience unusually vivid dreams as a side effect of the medication."
All right.
You get some rest.
We'll begin our first session tomorrow.
Drink.
Please describe your affliction.
"Ever since my parents' accident, their passing,"
I've had anxiety...
Mmm-hmm.
Insomnia.
My doctor thinks...
Dr. torrington.
"Yes, sir."
"He feels that my afflictions were not mere products of my grief,"
but manifestations of more latent maladies.
This is why he felt i would benefit from your care.
And which latent maladies did he identify?
"I have often been called willful, overly curious."
I'm told that my flights of fancy are not becoming of a lady.
"These character flaws, he believes, have evolved into my current difficulties."
And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?
My brother has always said that...
I don't care what your brother thinks.
What do you think?
I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.
I do.
But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.
And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?
"I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just..."
"There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel."
I wonder if you've ever killed anyone.
Have you?
"No, you never have."
"Besides, I'm going to tell you something."
"It isn't in your best interest to kill me,"
Amelia Folch.
You know me?
(LAUGHS) Yes.
What do you know about me?
Everything.
"Your father was called Enric, your mother, Carma, and you are an only child because your mother almost died birthing you."
That's enough for today.
I have business to attend.
"After what you've done, do you think I'm just going to let you go?"
I haven't done anything.
They betrayed me.
"I've saved lives, people who would have ended up in front of a firing squad if I didn't get them out of here and who can't escape now."
"When Napoleon's men wanted to kill El Empecinado, did you help them for the good of humanity?"
"I helped them with the hope that the war would end sooner, so that Spain would change for the better."
"(SIGH) When I found out they were going to kill him,"
"I wanted to warn him, but it was too late."
"The Ministry has you fooled, Amelia."
Preserving the past?
But it's History.
"Mmhm, and sometimes it's a shitty history."
Can you imagine the amount of mistakes that could be fixed?
Of course Spain defeated Napoleon.
But for what?
So that Fernando VII would annul a constitution that had cost so many lives?
while he was on vacation in Bayonne;
"so that he would return and kill so many heroes, like El Empecinado;"
"so that our best men, Goya, Jovellanos... would have to live in exile."
and invent new things.
The most reasonable humans are called scientists.
"Scientists congregate in research institutions, where they attend to organised reasonable activity."
A group of scientists are called a scientific team.
"Scientific teams commit discoveries, which bring benefit to the whole of mankind."
The highest form of reasonable activity on Earth is the scientific symposium.
They resolve the ill-effects of beneficial scientific work.
"Particular scientists are tagged with labels, so they don't get confused."
"The more scientific teams, the more life on Earth is better and more beautiful."
"If it continues like this, soon life on Earth will be absolutely perfect."
So that was our last greeting from Earth.
What could they be doing there at ours?
At home?
Nothing.
You know them.
-Doctor Yansky.
-Dear doctor.
-Our mission is complete.
-We are flying back.
You've provided priceless service to the idea of interspace cooperation.
-The whole galaxy is proud of you.
-Congratulations.
I...
One moment.
I also have to thank you.
"So thanks for everything, and see you later sometime."
"No, no ""see you later""."
I know that we caused you certain inconveniences.
But now it's the end of this.
We are going back home.
We are already fed up with you also.
Don't take it personally.
- But I think...
"- No, honey."
I think Mr. Newman's right on.
Let Hollis handle the day-to-day...
- and I'll be the man behind the curtain.
- Where do we go from here?
The FBI's gonna have to do an extensive background check.
- Director Friend will handle the investigation.
"- Yes, we made sure of that."
Just about every aspect of your life will be uncovered.
"Your bank accounts, your medical reports."
- What am I forgetting?
"- Correspondence to government agencies, speeches..."
"When Nelson Rockefeller was confirmed, they had over 300 agents working on him."
"They had a lot more life and cash to investigate, huh?"
"We'll do our own background check in case anything falls through the cracks, to be safe."
"At the same time, the House will..."
Come in.
The House will put together its bipartisan subcommittee... of the Judiciary to interview you and advise and consent to your nomination.
Shelly Runyon's running the show there.
"Cheyenne, Wyoming, you're on with Vice President Designate Laine Hanson."
"- Larry, how are you?"
- I'm fine.
Thanks for calling.
I just wanted to say to the senator that... all of Cheyenne is with her.
We think she's absolutely great for the country and this administration.
- Congratulations.
"- What's the question, sir?"
"I wanted to ask the senator, if she could pick one person from history... to serve as her model for how to behave in office, who would that be?"
"Good question, Senator."
"Hey, guys."
Nice to see you.
A seat belt that smells like Old Spice and bourbon.
- Easy now.
"[Michael Narrating]Assassination's one percent shooting, 99% preparation."
"Anticipating moves, devising approaches... recruiting sources... finding the perfect opportunity so the bullet's almost an afterthought."
Usually that's when a target's on the move... when there are too many variables to control them all.
-We should get out of here.
"-Michael, whatever happens, I just wanted to say thankyou."
You can thank me by keeping your head down...
"- and staying away from windows, okay?"
- Got it.
[ Michael Narrating] There are ways to lessen the risk.
An armed escort... taking an unpredictable route toyour destination... having backup in a trail car.
"But ultimately, as long as the assassin... knows where you're going... they have the upper hand."
The poi nt is the thi ng works.
I t's one of the few things in my life that's never let me down.
[ Michael Narrating] It's impossible to stop a good assassin... from finding an opening and taking a shot.
The bestyou can do is control where the best opening is.
And sometimes that's enough.
[ Michael ] Drop it.
You set me up.
- Bravo.
"- Put it down, Evelyn."
Hey.
I could still do this.
Did I tell you how much this job pays?
You could buy someplace decent to live-- even at Miami prices.
Put the rifle down.
How'd you know I'd be here?
I figured you had a source in the U.S. Attorney's office.
You knew Doug was thinking about testifying.
"Now, I count six different vantage points with a betterview ofthat entrance."
- How'd you know I'd be at this one?
"Burger may be holding that back, though, at least until the jury trial."
"In other words, they don't know that I know."
Paul... you finally deserve some supper.
Good.
But wait a minute.
"I haven't served up the piece-de-resistance yet, as we hungry men say."
Well?
About those bids.
"On the day the bidding officially closed,"
Somers had already turned out the first pilot models of the Norstaad line at his factory.
"Now, Miss Morrow,"
Why did you find it necessary to talk to Mr. Somers at the motel in the evening?
"Well, I'd been looking in every bar I could find, and I was still unable to locate Latham-"
- Mr. Reed.
"And inasmuch as Mr. Somers had threatened to put a private detective on his trail, I just had to beg for time."
"Well, did you discuss Axel Norstaad with Somers?"
"Yes, briefly."
"You were well aware, were you not, that Martin Somers had instructed his attorney to file an injunction against the defendant the next morning?"
Yes.
And you were afraid of what Mr. Norstaad would do when he found out about this?
"I wanted Mr. Somers to wait at least until I could find Latham until I found out what had happened to the $50,000 so I could go to Axel and explain everything"
- and tell him how much at fault I was and--
- All right.
And what did Mr. Somers say?
Did he agree to give you more time?
He said it all depended.
Depended on what?
"On whether or not the defendant stayed away from him, let him alone?"
I suppose so.
"Please, don't make any suppositions."
Answer me yes or no.
- Yes!
"You know, one in seven American cancer and die."
"You know, one in seven American men gets prostate cancer."
"You know, one in seven American men gets prostate cancer."
Prostatecancer.

Prostatecancer.
"I know, you tell me every time"
Prostatecancer.
"I know, you tell me every time we hang out."
"I know, you tell me every time we hang out."
Did you write a book we hang out.
Did you write a book about your own death?
Did you write a book about your own death?

about your own death?

"Would you read it to us, Bud?"

"Would you read it to us, Bud?"
I'dbedelighted
"Would you read it to us, Bud?"
I'dbedelighted to read it to you.
I'dbedelighted to read it to you.
So here's the problem.
to read it to you.
So here's the problem.
Patients and their doctors most
So here's the problem.
Patients and their doctors most often don't have conversations
"Patients and their doctors most often don't have conversations about when the burdens of often don't have conversations about when the burdens of treatment would be so high, about when the burdens of treatment would be so high, they wouldn't outweigh"
"treatment would be so high, they wouldn't outweigh the benefits of treatment."
they wouldn't outweigh the benefits of treatment.
"Hold that thought, Jerry."
Patrick here was about to tell us how I stole his idea.
"First of all, very uncool using my real name, and second, you did steal my idea."
Here we go.
"Okay, remember?"
"We were blasting a J in the Zippie's parking lot and a bird dropped a deuce right on my shoulder, and then we started talking about how that would make a cool video game."
"Yeah, but in your version the player was just an average dude who was trying to avoid getting pooped on."
"It was my idea to make the player the pooper, not the poopee."
"Plus, when I brought it up to you a couple days later, you said, quote,"
"""That's the dumbest idea ever,"" enquote."
"In my defense,"
I was sober when I said that.
"Okay, look, Null Legend, or Patrick, whatever your name is..."
It's Patrick.
Patrick.
"...the customer you're protecting, the guy in this picture, he kidnapped a girl."
"Dude, your sister was kidnapped?"
No that was just a clever ruse.
I'm actually with Five-O.
"And all I got to do is say the word, and the cavalry will storm this place, seize every computer in here, and arrest your entire crew."
How many customers are gonna want to do business with you then?
I can't believe you narc'd me out.
I can't believe you're still running Linux on a 32-bit Samurai stack.
"Get out of the dark ages, dude."
"Also, get us that name."
(softly):
Yeah.
(Steve grunts)
"Let's get HPD and CSU down here, tear this place apart."
"(siren chirps, indistinct radio chatter)"
(siren wailing in the distance)
DANNY:
Why did you accept that request?
Were you giving us permission to kill our junior colleague?
Think about where they come from.
That request was equivalent to an order given from a much higher level.
"Do you think you could have stopped it, if you were me?"
If you gave them a stricter order to stop the mission...
If you just made sure that Baek Shi Yoon followed your orders...
Then nothing would have happened.
Don't you understand who made the mistake?
I apologize...
I didn't think it through.
The only thing you can do is forget about it.
Because every victory comes with a loss.
I will forget everything.
From now on...
With everything that will happen because of the Hallyu Core Mall...
You will have to cover for them.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Go apologize to them first.
"To this point, I have been lacking in my duties."
"From now on, I will work harder."
Good luck with that.
"You're still keeping our secret, aren't you?"
Why aren't you answering me?
Do you really think Detective Im would come here to hide in broad daylight?
Well our boss said that Detective Im was won over by the owner of this bar.
Who says something like that in today's day and age?
"And if that's the case, why aren't you investigating our president?"
And as far as Park Seon Woo's testimony goes...
"You don't trust it, do you?"
- We'll get going then.
And that is inevitable for men of his stature.
"On this journey, my father became real to me... a man, not a myth."
"Now that I know him a little better,"
"I miss him more than ever, and I really wish things had been different."
But he chose the life that he wanted.
It's hard to let go.
"But after all these years,"
I think I found the right time and place to say good-bye.

"(Kahn) Louis I. Kahn, whose strong forms of brick and concrete influenced a architects and made him, in the opinion of most architecscholars,"

"When I first read that obituary,"
I have to admit I was looking for my own name.
"I was his child too, his only son."
I didn't know my father very well.
"He never married my mother, and he never lived with us."
But I can still remember every detail of the few times we spent a whole day together.
"On this afternoon, we had a picnic."
"He painted with watercolors, and my mother snapped these pictures."
He died when I was 11.
[woman speaking indistinctly over intercom]
The circumstances of his death have always fascinated me.
He was bankrupt and alone on his way back home from India.
Emergency treatment is being performed.
Okay.
"Even the Blue House has been briefed of this situation, so keep me updated down to the little details."
Got it.
"Blood pressure is 175/110, pulse is 100, and heart rate is 70."
"Blood pressure is high, pulse is fast and irregular, and he is drowsy."
This appears to be hypoglycemia.
It said in his chart that he has diabetes.
Do you think it's a problem with insulin?
Let's take care of that first.
Please get D50W (Dextrose 50% in water) started as IV.
Wait.
This is a prescription from the president's doctor.
Nitroglycerin?
A vasodilator?
Why?
"This patient is a diabetic, and he's having an adverse response to insulin, isn't he?"
I told you that the chart is not to be trusted.
"If you switch the diagnosis with the symptoms, it makes sense."
He's not having hypertension due to hypoglycemia.
He's having hypoglycemia due to problems with his heart.
Please give this to him.
His blood pressure is suddenly dropping too much.
Open the lines and give him IV fluids.
What's this?
Abdominal distension?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What's the situation?
Abdominal distension and drop in blood pressure?
Hemoperitoneum?
(Bleeding in the abdominal cavity)
He is bleeding into his abdominal cavity.

"'Cause you're not going to see him for, like, a whole six hours."

I'm NOT addicted.

"Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery, Kat."
"Tara, I was extremely disappointed that you were involved in last night's idiocy."
I had no option.
To be distracted when your recovery has put you so far behind.
What happened to finding your inner anger?
Miss Raine's right
"- I need to put my head down, work harder."
"Are you thick, woman?"
You exposed an abusive teacher and your dad is close to suing the academy.
"If that's not a get-out-of-jail-free card, I don't know what is."
"So... so we're not one of those vomit-inducing couples,"
I was thinking we should introduce some guidelines for behaviour.

"I want a slow, technical barre."
"-Without it, I could not have conquered Logopolis."
-This is not conquest.
It's devastation.
It's nothing more than a blanket of silence.
Which is killing the Logopolitans and turning them to dust.
-You expect me to believe that?
-Yes!
You are destroying everything.
It may already be too late.
"You exaggerate, Monitor."
Logopolis is not the universe.
But it is!
Logopolis is the keystone.
"If you destroy Logopolis, you unravel the whole causal nexus."
Causal nexus?
You insult my intelligence.
You're interfering with the law of cause and effect.
"Nyssa, Nyssa, let go."
That is a demonstration of the causal nexus.
You revolting man!
The electro-muscular constrictor gives me complete control over that hand.
Please replace the screen.
I wouldn't take orders from you if you were the last man in the universe.
"Very well, one of your young friends will eliminate the other."
You understand.
Logopolis is crucial to the whole of creation.
This could mean the end of the universe.
"I've never been persuaded by hyperbole, Doctor."
Then come into the streets and see what's happening.
No need for that.
I can demonstrate the continued functioning of Logopolis from here.
This device only creates temporary silence and can be switched off.
I'm cross referencing bombings and child victims.
"Seven years ago, in the heart of Cairo, egyptian government blamed Hezbollah, but conspiracy theories on the street claimed it was a joint U. S-Israli strike that went astray."
Your ghost detainee's name is Jamal Abaza.
How about his son's name?
Do you have that?
Amir Abaza. 8.
Killed in the blast.
All right.
Find out everything you can on that.
I'll get back to you soon.
We know his real identity.
It appears that there will be no peaceful resolution to our difficulties after all.
I haven't given up that hope.
It's time for your Salut-ul-Isha prayers.
May we speak again tomorrow?
You are asking me?
Yes.
"Tomorrow, then."
Jamal Abaza's been in the U.S. for a while.
He volunteered as the prison imam at the Dearfield correctional center
- three years ago.
- How could the CIA not know that?
They're focused overseas.
We're domestic.
Yeah.
"They probably sent a request for a domestic information search, and it's somewhere making its way through channels."
"If he was a prison imam, he must have recruited militant islamic society members."
M.I.S. Is an atypical prison organization.
They pick up an amalgam of ethnicities.

"Outside these walls, you need to understand..."

You didn't do right by arguing with the sages' wives
What did I do?
I just told them to wait.
So much pride and arrogance
-We will avenge this insult
"""lf our husbands were clever, will we face such days. """
"""You had all gone to fetch water, where are your pots now?"""
We broke them on their pride and anger-What happened?
Sage Gautam  Ahilya have become proud due to their pond.
Sage Gautam is not at all proud and it is also true that water has come only due to their meditative powers.
"""Then, are we telling lies."
"-What do you wish for now?"""
Revenge
- What sort of revenge?
-For our insult.
But how can we avenge Sage Gautam?
Accept our wish and arrange for a Yagna
- What Y agna?
A yagna by which their pride and powers will break into pieces.
And they are compelled to do severe penance.
"""No, that will not be proper"
"-Was their behaviour right then?"""
"""We can think of something else"
"-No, only revenge."""
"""Think again"
"- Not necessary, you all listen, if you don't help us..."""
"""...in avenging them, we will all leave this hermitage  go away"""
"""Y es"
"- We are compelled now, and have to please Yagnadev now."""
Hail Yagnadev
"""Sages, tell me why you have called by this Yagna."""
We want to avenge Sage Gautam for our insults.
But the Hans will not agree to it so easily.
"The most important thing is, we must be sure that the Hans will win this battle easily, like what Yang-Jeong claims they can do."
Sending troops into a losing battle will not do.
Did you check up on them?
Yes
The ministers haven't left their positions... and are currently in a heated discussion over whether to send reinforcements to Han Nation.
"Even if they come to a conclusion on their own,"
Doesn't the final say lie on the King Geum-Wa?
Dong-Sun
"Yes, Governor!"
Arrange a private session with Dae-So.
I'd like to speak to him privately
Yes.
"If His Majesty refuses to send out reinforcements,"
Diplomacy between BuYeo and the Han Dynasty will surely crumble.
"Dae-So, you spent much effort at Hyeon-To solving our previous problems."
I'm afraid your efforts might come to waste.
His Majesty will make a wise decision.
Please don't worry.
No.
His Majesty will not comply with the Han's request for reinforcements.
It's different this time around.
"If he declines, the people will be adversely afffected by our lack of salt."
"Then, for that we will have to go to war."
I'm sure His Majesty is aware of this as well.
I can't stand it any longer.
How long are we going to let the Han Dynasty oppress us?
We are but dogs of the Hans.
That Yang-Jeong jumps at every chance to make things difficult for Father.
"Brother, why don't I just dispose of him already?"
Do you really want BuYeo to be annihilated?
Why don't you try using your brains to think for a while?
I...
I think we do need to recognize a new era has begun for mankind.
- I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet.
"And the UFO phenomenon is real, although it's been covered up by governments for quite a long time."
The United States government knew a whole lot more about UFOs than it was telling the American public.
There's an intelligence involved that there was a highly evolved technology that to a degree we were carrying a dialogue with this intelligence.
"- 'Cause I read NATO military material that indicated that the UFOs were not only real, they represented something far beyond anything I had ever imagined before."
"-Could I get...$60 on pump four, please?"
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I understand over the years... some peculiar things have been happening around these parts.
"Cattle mutilations, strange lights in the sky, things of that sort."
"-No, I don't know anything about that."
-Really?
Okay.
Set to go?
"- Yes, sir."
-Son of a bitch.
Yes..
-May I ask why you chose me?
"I've known who you are for some time now, you seem like an honest man."
-I'm all about the truth.
"And if what you're about to tell me is the truth, am I to understand we're all in a very grave danger?"
-Yes.
"In five days, human existence as you know it, will forever change."
-Why don't we start with your name?
-Jaelen.
-Jaelen?
"So, Jaelen, who are you?"
You're speaking of the Phoenix Lights incident?
Are you trying to tell me you were aboard that craft?
-Yes.
"If we don't comply, the Han Dynasty will put pressure on our trade issues again,"
"If the Hans... dare to oppress BuYeo again,"
"Then,"
I'm prepared to go to war with them.
"This is a matter that still requires much thought,"
Don't come to a hasty conclusion.
Is there still no news of the decision?
Yes.
"Not knowing the outcome of the war,"
"It'll be a huge gamble to dedicate 10,000 troops just by faith alone."
"No matter how tempting Yang-Jeong's offer is,"
King Geum-Wa will have a hard time making his decision.
"From your point of view,"
What do you think his verdict will be?
Oh yes
"King Geum-Wa will weigh the gains in winning the war against the consequences of losing the war, and the people's vengeance that might follow."
The interesting thing is
"No matter what the King's decision may be,"
Our merchant fleet will stand to gain.
Who's there?
!
Have you checked it out?
Yes.
"Besides the ones under training, there're still about 20 of them."
Their weapons look impressive as well.
There're also 90 odd prisoners.
It looks like they'll be sold as slaves.
There're only two road leading to the hideout.
One of them passes between cliffs and will be hard to sneak in.
They usually wait in ambush here to attack and plunder passing merchants.
The prisoners are then taken here.
"Brother, Brother!"
Such devastation...
But...
True change arises from confusion and destruction.
"Don't you agree, Mr. Yonamine?"
Chief Kato...
A mysterious high energy reaction that instantaneously swallowed up thousands of lives...
It just thrills me to pieces...
One can only hope that this is a sign that'll point us to the path we must take for the future.
Negative readings on both residual radiation and radioactivity.
Troops will now begin examining the center of the explosion.
Chief!
Look at that!
"Chief, we have a report on Miya Shikitani from the medical team."
Has she awoken?
Huh?
Well...
"I'm asking you, if she's up or not."
I don't need to hear every single progress report!
Clearly this is a mechanism made from a technology not found on this earth.
The only survivor...
And the mysterious woman.
They're all keys to solving that incident.
The giant monster and the white giant that appeared in Shinjuku that day...
"In order to figure out who they are and why they came, our agency Agwarda was created for the future."
We will get to the bottom of this.
Without fail!
"What do you mean, they need to discuss a possible shutdown?"
A total waste of money...?
What does the Foundation know anyway?
We just need the right opportunity!
We have all the necessary conditions in place!
A gentle push and the wheels will start spinning...
Met the emperor.
Antimatter monsters.
Gasmasked zombies.
Real living dinosaurs!
Real living werewolf!
The Loch Ness monster!
Seriously?
Oh!
Listen to us.
It's like me and my mate Shareen.
"The only time we fell out was over a man, and -- we're arguing over the Doctor."
"It was great because you would imagine that would happen, of who's seen the most, who's done the most, who's been there the most, and i.e. who was more important to the Doctor."
"There's this moment where they realize they're united in how special they are, for having had those experiences and they start laughing quite madly."
"Once they're past that territorial stage, they do then become great friends and I thought ""all right, that's good."
"""That's how I wanted it to be!"
Good!
"Glad we got there."""
River Song is better at operating the TARDIS than the Doctor is.
I just landed her.
She's unpredictable.
Moisturize me.
"I think that ""Doctor Who's"" one of the very few programs that writes brilliantly, gives excellent parts for female characters."
"They're not just screaming women, they're not just like they used to be, it's not a cliché, it's not sexist anymore, at all."
"In fact, the parts for women are better than the parts for men, a lot of the time."
"River Song is beautiful, glamorous."
"I think she's unpredictable and you don't know what she's going to do next and the fact she's a murderer and the fact she's good, but bad."
You always -
- I like a character like that.
River Song is basically the female Indiana Jones.
She is so awesome and badass.
She's smart;
"She's human, but not quite."
[Chokes]
What Michelle didn't know was that boiling water had been poured into the thermos earlier in the night.
[Coughs and gasps]
"When the girl was disinhibited by the drug she was on, and she took the swig of the boiling water, her natural response to spit it out wasn't present, and she caused burns in the back of her throat and epiglottis."
"This epiglottis, which normally covers up the airway during swallowing, swelled up and blocked the airway."
She would've passed out within five to 15 seconds.
"Death would've ensued within minutes, as there was no oxygen getting to her brain."
Michelle thought she'd play a little joke on her religious friends.
Amen.
But just as they were all about to see God...
I am a rock star
Michelle went to meet him...
Let's pray.
Personally.
[Heavy metal music]
"In the criminal justice system the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups, the police who investigate crime, and the crown prosecutors who prosecute offenders."
These are their stories.
You know what Kelly's like.
One little quirk in the spatter pattern and she stays till she's solved the whole crime.
But she left the lab an hour ago.
Just here is fine.
I'll be two minutes.
Grab that.
Kelly?
Kelly Mahon.
Worked in Forensics.
She was supposed to be on a night out with Chloe and Joy who worked in the same department.
Obviously she never made it.
"Hi, Chloe, hi, Joy."
"All right, Pete."
We were just talking this morning at the lab.
"When I was a kid, the French Quarter was kind of off-limits to people like me."
"This was 1961, so this was the segregated South, you know?"
Mr. Jaffe integrated things long before anybody else thought about it.
This was one of the few places where black and white people would come together to listen to music.
It was the only place.
It was the place.
And my parents risked a lot by being open about it...
Their policies...
And outspoken about it.
Yeah.
It was very difficult to hear New Orleans jazz in New Orleans a few years ago.
So we rented an old art gallery and began Preservation Hall.
Both of your parents took the responsibility?
"Yeah, well, my mom was like the bouncer."
"She sat at the gate all night collecting money and like, deciding on who would get in and who wouldn't, because people would be rowdy."
And my dad was the guy who was going around town locating musicians and putting the bands together and kind of keeping the place physically in shape.
"People are sitting on wooden benches, sitting on the floor."
There's no drinks.
"Pretty hot in here, too, in the summer."
People come to hear the music.
People hear it.
That music was dying.
"You know, trad jazz like that was dying."
Ben's dad bought that place and started putting on those...
They were performing for tourists.
"People that came to New Orleans expecting to hear jazz and they couldn't find it anywhere, they could find it at Pres."
Hall.
Preservation Hall...
Now that's where you'll find all the greats.
"And when I was a teenager, the ones that's still alive?"
That's where they're playing now.
"And that's where all the people all over the world the minute they hit New Orleans, the first place they want to know..."
"Bill, Wendy!"
Are you seeing this in the studio?
Do something!
"Oh, my God.!"
Astonishing and tragic imagery.
A green monster truck... obviously an undercover law enforcement vehicle... made a valiant attempt to sideswipe the BMW... with disastrous results.
"Almost ready, Mr. Josephson."
That was a pretty dangerous and radical maneuver from the police... especially with a hostage at risk and that roadblock up ahead.
"- Wouldn't you say, Byron?"
- Radical?
Yes.
But I imagine these cops are getting awfully desperate.
"- Three, two."
You're on.
"- Randy, thank you very much."
"This is Paul Dandridge with Channel 3's live, on-the-scene, exclusive interview... with Jackson Hammond's attorney, AriJosephson."
"Mr. Josephson, if Mr. Hammond is innocent... why was he found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury?"
"During the bank robbery, the actual thief cut his hand... on the teller's paper spindle."
A sample of that dried blood was taken and tested... and compared with a sample of my client's blood.
"Jack's blood is type ""B"" positive."
"The red-nosed robber's blood is type ""A."""
But because the evidence was collected improperly from the crime scene... it was deemed inadmissible in court.
Thank you very much.
Let's go back to the studio.
Hey.!
"Hey, look at that."
You're a folk hero already.
I don't care.
"If you ask me, I think your lawyer's right..."
you should keep on fighting.
Almost sounds like you believe me.
You don't strike me as the kind of guy who gives up that easily.
Is nothing:
I no more my widowed bed
"Will keep, but from the couch in fury spring,"
And headlong forth from the pavilion fling.
I look around:
the moon is shining bright.
"Nor, save the shore, is any thing in sight."
"I, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,"
Thence see my cruel lord's departing sail.
"And I my raiment waving in my hand,"
Sign to the frigate to return to land.
"But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears"
"Faithless Bireno's sail across the deep,"
"Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers"
"Of sad myself, sorrowing on the steep."
And now?
What can be done?
"Alone, betrayed..."
"Who will console me, who afford me aid?"
"So crying I my raven hair offend,"
And lock by lock the scattered tresses rend.
"Anxious to save Angelica, who has already been saved by Rogero,"
Orlando arrives at Ebuda's island.
"To Ebuda's isle I pursue my quest,"

and fled in utmost confusion.
The running battle was there after maintained near Gravelines.
"So close were we to the enemy, we were within speak one another."
"Then the wind shifted, what remained of the Amada was swept by storms and gales to flounder in the North Sea. """
And the Flanders' force?
"Intelligence that the Flanders force will not embark without the protection of the Spanish fleet. """
Then they are vanquished?

"this is not just a Protestant victory, but England's victory!"
This is all our victory!
"We are safe, Excellency!"
"Victory, My Lords, Victory!"
"My lord, we must make the preparations."
For our celebration.
I will issue the proclamation for a day of holiday throughout the realm.
And a new coin must be struck in honor of our triumph.
"And let us make a victory procession to St. Paul's, to thank God..."
"So solemn on such a day, William?"
Shame on you!

And since I'm mentioning that...
Isn't that when you'll be in charge?
"Through Chief Jung, I will make sure we take extra precautions."
"There's a problem with your attitude, Hong Gyu Man."
Those friends over there join forces to push out companies like San Ah Group...
"Hong Gyu Man, are you really keeping us in mind constantly?"
"Or, do you want to skip becoming Prime Minister... and go up there, instead?"
- Definitely not...
- That's what I thought.
I have yet to hear from my father... about how arrogant you are.
You...
Do you have some moral lines that you're not able to cross?
I don't.
Then...
Why are you not helping Yoon Sang Min properly?
I will pay more attention to it.
Pay more attention?
Is this a matter of paying attention?
Don't you know what happens when you turn against the New York Study Group?
"The Prime Minister position, and everything else, will fly away."
"We'll be disposed of our luxury of being alive, just like that."
Don't you know how important this is?
Go Moon...
I have something I'm curious about.
You killed my junior colleague...
- Whose request was it?
- Don't try to find out.
Things will get harder for you.
"Three years ago, when the mission in Macau was recalled..."
Was it the request of New York Study Group?
This little...
Are you still hung up on that?
"Katherine, when you send a broadcast you're sending out these numbers to the agents in the field to deliver specific assignments they cannot trust to normal communication lines."
Do you know what that means?
Fifteen broadcasts.
Fifteen assignments.
Unauthorized.
"Assassinations, bombings."
Could be anything.
Murders?
Gonna fix it.
"Here, what does it say?"
Can't read that.
"Agents in the field carry, like, one-time notebooks, like pads."
Each page is a new cypher.
"When you broadcast something, the agent matches up the first set of numbers to the page in the notebook."
"Now he knows he's using this page, and this page only, to decode the message."
"When he's done, he destroys the page."
So we send another broadcast to cancel this one.
Every cypher's a one-time deal.
Totally random.
Completely impossible to crack the code unless you have the original cypher.
That changes with every shift.
So we need the cypher?
"-Yes, we need that cypher."
-(crashing)
(indistinct conversations)
"As much as it seems like we're here to hurt you, to kill you, I assure you, both of you, that's the worst-case scenario."
Must have left the computer running.
-lt doesn't scare me.
-Shut the fuck up!
Back off!
Please.
Let me rephrase that.
"Chief General Heuk-Chi, pledges obedience to Your Majesty."
"High Priestess,"
"His Majesty has rejected the Han's request for reinforcements, and has ordered the General to make war preparations."
"General Chun-Gu, make for SaChulDo immediately and initiate a check on the soldiers and provision."
The soldiers should be prepared to mobilize promptly at His Majesty's order.
"Yes, Chief General."
General Ji-Gu.
Order all officers in and outside of BuYeo to check on their weapons and provision.
"Yes, Chief General."
Are we all just going to sit around?
We should at least convince His Majesty to avoid going to war.
"Palace Emissary,"
It's already too late.
There's nothing we can do now.
"Instead of trying to avoid the war,"
Why don't we put our heads together and think of a way to win?
This is what a loyal minister should do.
No I don't agree
"If we cannot get His Majesty to change his mind, then we should seek the Governor of Hyeon-To and appeal to him for a truce."
Didn't you see how smug Yang-Jeong was?
"As long as we don't comply, there'll be no end to this."
The problem is salt.
"If we don't secure a supply of salt,"
I'm afraid the people and soldiers will perish.
We must find a solution.
"Your Majesty, the Priestess seeks an audience with you."
Invite her in.
What is it?
"Your Majesty,"
I have depleted my strength these ten days seeking salvation for BuYeo.
Why didn't you visit me even once?
"I told you I washed my hands clean of the Divination Palace,"
That was two years ago!

"the Doctor has to take on human form and not realize that he's the Doctor and, of course, he falls in love with this incredible woman called Joan Redfern."
"Joan, lovely Joan."
What I like about her -- she's just a very normal lady and someone who's quite sensitive.
"""Joan."" Joan?"
That's my name.
"Well, obviously."
Everything has to be done in the right way.
She doesn't want to be seen to be being unseemly.
"I thinks he's so sympathetic and she's so beautiful, like, there's so much humanity to that portrayal."
"Joan is a perfect woman for him, if he's not a Time Lord."
"Unfortunately, he is."
"Truth be told, when it's just you and me,"
"I'd much rather you called me ""Nurse Redfern."""
"""Matron"" sounds rather, well, matronly."
"Ah -- ah, ""Nurse Redfern"" it is, then."
"Though, we've known each other all of two months, you could even say ""Joan."""
Joan?
That's my name.
"Well, obviously."
"The cool thing about when the Doctor was with Joan is that he was just completely human and we finally get to see what the Doctor would be like, if he wasn't a charming, all-knowing, all-adventure-all- the-time kind of guy."
"And, it turns out, he's just a bumbling nerd."
"Well,"
"I should imagine that you'd be, um --"
"I mean, I never thought you'd be one for --"
"I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't."
If you do -- you may not --
I -- I probably won't.

"Once again, you got carried away, Alex, there was no need to risk yourself like that, we had them trapped."
"I tought they would flee, and wanted to catch them red handed."
"Well, and did you find out how they smuggled the drugs?"
"Yes, Inspector."
"Look Inspector, inside the banana, and there is a good amount of it, don't you think?"
Quite ingenious.
Now we have all the suspects.
They will spend a good amount of time in prison.
"Alex, for your own good, don't get involved in my affairs."
They almost got away because you where too reckless.
"Very well, Inspector."
"I will heed your advice, for now."

"If they have a Whispered, then why are they targeting Chidori?"
"They shouldn't need her anymore, right?"
Because it's not complete.
Apparently there are differences in the knowledge that each individual Whispered has.
"If there's someone who has extensive knowledge of the theory behind Lambda Driver technology, there's also someone who only has knowledge of submarine technology."
"That's why every time a new Whispered is found, it's necessary to determine which field that one is strong in."
That's what those tests that we ran on that girl in the Khanka Autonomous Region were for.
And the results showed that Kaname Chidori is a Whispered.

"Oh, come on, Bishop!"
We know they are breeding like rabbits for decades.
"Why do you put your hologram and find it yourself, Trajan?"
"Come on Bishop, if you do not want to cooperate  we can always extract your information from your neuro-implant."

But humanoid reproduction is a capital offense.
The scientific ambition of your wife was the death sentence.
This is why the human race takes precedence for its petty grievances.

"Mr. Reed, was Axel Norstaad aware of the fact that you and Miss Morrow were previously man and wife?"
No.
Was it your idea or hers to keep this from him?
Mine.
I'd been an alcoholic.
"I was afraid if he found out too much about my past, it would ruin my chances."
What chances?
Of getting the full contract on the hospital.
Would you tell us the background of that contract?
"Well, there wasn't a contract yet."
"You see, I--"
I met Mr. Norstaad and drew some preliminary sketches.
Then you referred him to Miss Morrow?
"I said that I knew a woman that was talented in business, that's all."
He went to her himself.
Talented in business.
"Did you tell him that she was successful, wealthy?"
"Not exactly, but--"
Not exactly?
Then did you tell him that her car had only been one quarter paid for?
That the extravagant apartment in which she entertained his committees had only been rented the day after they met?
That her fur coat was borrowed?
Stop that!
I object.
I object.
"Mr. Reed, you've admitted that you tried to conceal the facts of your past life."
Did Mr. Somers know those facts?
"Yes, he did."

"The husband who loves his wife so much that he'd rather kill himself than live without her is a little way off the truth, isn't it?"
It's true!
Peggy was the backbone of my life.
"Arthur, Arthur, you hated her."
"Your son knew it, everyone knew it."
"Probably often dreamed of killing her, didn't you?"
"But you never had the nerve, because everyone also knew that you were terrified of her."
"And as the coward at the white feather, you rather resented being something of a local joke until, of course, you began to believe that the world was about to change."

"Oh, my poor Faith!"
She talks of dreams and now it is I who feel as though I walk through shadowed realms.
- My Goodman.
"Come, let me guide you with my light."
- There is a peculiarity in such solitude.
"With these lonely steps,"
I may be walking through unseen multitudes!
What if the devil himself could be at my very elbow?
I shall yet stand firm against the devil.
"Come witch, come wizard, come devil himself!"
And hear comes young Goodman Brown.
You may as well fear him as he feared you!

One of the things I believe in is the importance of passing on traditions the way they were given to us.
We play all styles of music.
"There's calypso, Cuban."
We have the Mardi Gras Indian sound.
The music there exists because the culture itself is so rich to begin with.
It's not just the Deep South.
New Orleans is the northernmost point in the Caribbean.
New Orleans was the largest port for a century.
It's where coffee entered America.
"It was the entry point for Central America,"
"South America, and Africa."
"I mean, part of our history is, you know, something that we're not very proud of, you know..."
"Is that we are the port where hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Africans were brought into the United States and sold into slavery."
"This was a place where people from a lot of different places met, traded goods and ideas."
And some of those ideas was musical.
You listen to the music and you can pick out all the ingredients from all those different styles.
You can pick out Spanish melodies and you can pick out African rhythms.
"You know, the Bo Diddley riff is just an African riff."
How much rock 'n' roll have we built on that?
- Yeah.

"Assassination's one percent shooting, 99% preparation."
"Anticipating moves, devising approaches... recruiting sources... finding the perfect opportunity so the bullet's almost an afterthought."
Usually that's when a target's on the move... when there are too many variables to control them all.
- We should get out of here.
"- Michael, whatever happens, I just wanted to say thank you."
You can thank me by keeping your head down...
"- and staying away from windows, okay?"
- Got it.
There are ways to lessen the risk.
An armed escort... taking an unpredictable route to your destination... having backup in a trail car.
"But ultimately, as long as the assassin... knows where you're going... they have the upper hand."
The point is the thing works.
It's one of the few things in my life that's never let me down.
It's impossible to stop a good assassin... from finding an opening and taking a shot.
The best you can do is control where the best opening is.
And sometimes that's enough.
Drop it.
You set me up.

"I may relate it since then, that I healed, and I was grew young on this pleasant place."
Tót was the very moment understood that the major took the shade for a ditch.
What should he do now?

I even got a chance to interview the President of the United States.
Why do you think this issue is so constantly overlooked?
BILL CLINTON:
"I think it's because it takes a long time for the climate to change in a way that people feel it, and because, uh, it seems sort of abstract now."
DICAPRIO:
"At the time, it was this huge push to get the word out on global warming."
Now a couple degrees' difference in today's temperatures may not seem like an emergency.
"Back then everyone was focused on small, individual actions."
"We all have to, you know, bring environmentalism to the American consciousness."
And it boiled down to simple solutions like changing your light bulb.
"It seemed like a positive thing at the time, you know."
Changing your lightbulb.
Which means this isn't just about you protecting your client's interests.
It's about you protecting yourself.

A mock election was planned in my elementary school.
"And I was for John F. Kennedy because my parents were Catholic, and I thought, although they were Republicans, they had a certain sympathy for Kennedy."
But also because Kennedy's hair was so much better than Nixon's hair.
"And, therefore, I went to the cafeteria and as each kid would go through the cafeteria line with their tray,"
"I would tell them, ""You know, Nixon has proposed having school on Saturdays."""
"Well, then the mock election was held, and to the surprise of the local newspaper,"
Democrat John Kennedy swept this mock election.
"For the first time ever, I understood the value of disinformation."
"Of course, I've never practiced it since then."

"LlGO scientists, like astrosurfers... live for the day when they can hang ten... and ride theirvery own perfect wave of gravity."
We've seen what we think are the effects of gravity waves... the loss of energy from a system by way of gravity waves... but we never directly detected one.
That's one of the last frontiers.
"If the LlGO scientists' quest is successful... and they catch a wave, it could change science."
"So, I think that long term, it's first to understand gravity... and then, even more interestingly, to understand the universe."
The force of gravity has domain over our universe.

"As such, how do you plan to deal with this revolt?"
I have high hopes for a prompt response.
A prompt response?
It's only been two days since we first received notice.
We don't even know the rebel army's stronghold or their ringleader.
He's an irritating bastard.
Countermeasures have already been arranged.
We've done research on the ringleader of the revolt.
"The only daughter of the old king of Estabul, Lady Noa Ehn."
Colonel Miran Froaude will fill you in on the information he gathered.
"According to our information, the Estabul side has roughly fifty thousand soldiers."
- Fifty thousand!
- That goes beyond any revolt.
It's a war!
It is likely that territories adjacent to Estabul will be caught in the fighting.
"For the time being, we'd like to have them evacuated to this castle."
We shall be certain to protect all of your territories.
You say to leave our territory?
!
Are you lot saying you would trample our lands?
I will never permit it!
Do you have something you would prefer we did not see?
C-Certainly not...
"You are free to remain there if you prefer, of course."
Estabul's forces are only fifty thousand at most.
"Nothing to fear, surely."
"Your Majesty, I will be taking the army."
"If a soldier bears such hasty ambitions, his men will turn their swords on their own brothers."
But...
"Remember, Commander Yi."
A soldier's duty ends with stopping the swords that threaten his country.
Once upon a time there was warrior.
"When a war broke out in his country, he fought with all his might and destroyed the enemy."
"Without him, the country would've crumbled and the people would've fallen in despair."
There was a King.
"When a war broke out, he hastily fled his palace."
He deserted his people and scrambled to save himself.
Your Majesty...
Then the war ended.
"The warrior had the trust of the people and a strong and faithful army, but the King only had powerless ministers and a disorderly mob..."
Your Majesty...
What would you do?
What would you do if you were the King with the duty to preserve the royal line?
"Your Majesty, Yi Soon-shin is your faithful retainer."
Do not doubt his loyalty.
A faithful retainer...
"I, too, wish to believe that he is a faithful retainer."
"And if he is indeed, I am certain he will figure out a way to protect the country and protect the authority of the Royal House as well."
"""Reprieve"""
I spare you from death...
"Your Majesty, did you say you would spare me from death?"
"Uncle, it's Wan."
Come in.
I heard you were looking for me.
Send this to the headquarters in Gogeumdo.
"What is it, Uncle?"
They are my diaries.
A testimony of the atrocities of the seven year war.
I hope no one will ever have to make such records again.
"The victim's blood was found on his shirt, under his fingernails and on his shoes when we arrested him."
I must warn members of the jury that they are very disturbing.
"Detective, can you describe the nature of these wounds?"
The knife into the back of the head severed his spinal cord.
"This was followed by three stab wounds down his torso, one in his armpit."
"According to the coroner, the coagulation of the blood suggests that all of these were done after Benjamin had died."
As in a sort of ritual killing?
Objection.
"Detective Maraco, please confine your remarks to matters pertaining to your investigation."
You are not a medical expert.
"And, Mr Dalton, you should know better."
"My apologies, Your Honour."
"Detective, you've conducted a pretty thorough investigation here, haven't you?"
No stone unturned?
"I'd say, yeah, it was a thorough investigation, yes."
"What was the boy doing in that lane, Detective?"
Soliciting.
So he was a lawyer?
(Some giggling)
He was performing oral sex.
So he was a male prostitute?
"Who were his clients, Detective?"
"Uh, beautiful fashion models?"
Romanian princesses?
Men.
"Plump, wheezing, sweaty middle-aged men with 50 bucks to spare."
I wouldn't know.
"How many men (clears throat) had he transacted that evening, Detective?"
We don't know.
Several.
Several.
"So is that six, seven?"
- Quiet!
Never mention that again!
( softly ) Look.
"Did you like me better when I was blonde, with baby-fat?"
Or later when I was brunette and thin?
I liked you when you were blonde and thin.
Hitler: ...fulfillment of a mysterious longing.
My need to control will fill others' need to be controlled.
That was my euphoric discovery:
the union of my urges with the German people's desires!
"If you unite a powerful people, whose first duty is obedience,"
you can do anything.
( whispers ) God... I love to order.
"Every woman a potential source of solace, warmth, love."
"Every man, a rival."
Hitler:
"""l am the German spirit."
"Consider the incomparable magic of my works..."""
Did you write that?
"""...the incomparable magic of my works."""
It's Wagner.
"""Man is a beast of prey, developing through constant progress."
"The beast conquers, founds great realms by the subjugation of other subjugators, forms states and organizes civilizations, in order to enjoy his booty in peace."
"Attack and defense, suffering and struggle, domination and servitude."""
Are those Wagner's words?
We were both illusionists and showmen.
"I made my life so different, so vibrant, so extreme."
That was how... I accumulated power.
I wrapped iron and blood in a cloud of mystic communion with the German Volk.
"Whoever wants to understand Hitler, must first learn Wagner."
Write this!
Fire.
I reduced chemicals in fruits and vegetables.
The SS planted organic gardens.
I am not a brutal man by nature.
I am not a brutal man by nature.
I am not a brutal man by nature.
I'm not a brutal man by nature.
I am not a brutal man.
Hitler:
Only a charismatic leader could heal the wounds of the great war inflicted on us by the November criminals.
Hitler's charisma was as much created by the German masses as it was imposed upon them.
"In peacetime, stability and routine undermine charisma."
"In wartime, the great threat is defeat."
It was the failure of the will of the German people that fatally undermined my charisma!
"You take... an ordinary man,"
dress him in a uniform... and that man... will commit acts he never before... imagined.
"You can turn a runny-nosed, bedwetter... into a ruthless warrior."
"If I'd stopped with the conquest of France, I would have gone down in history as the greatest conqueror since Alexander The Great."
No!
"No, no."
"""Greatest military genius in history."""
Wait-- what do you think?
"Well, no..."
Ah... here it is.
"""Greatest empire since Caesar."""
That-- that's it.
"Let's make it... lf l had stopped with the conquest of France, I would have built the greatest sustained empire since Caesar Augustus."
What I hated most about the war was fighting the English.
"The fair Brits... our racial brothers, our natural allies--"
Saxons.
Anglos.
"The very word means angels, doesn't it?"
Eva:
"""and sacrifice your life, so that the sin of killing a cow can..."""
...be blamed against them and we can compel them to do penance.
"""Direct or indirect, it is not right for you to harm Sage Gautam..."""
...through me.
Why don't ask for any boon which will favour you?
"""When you have appeared, you are bound to give us the fruits."""
The fruits of our sacrifice should be according to our wishes.
"""You have to accept our request"
"-Y es, I have to give you benefits"""
I will go as a dying cow.-Now we will see their bad state
Sage Gautam  Ahilya will both be blemished.
And blemish is like death.
"""Swami, please come out, a weak cow has somehow come into..."""
...our hermitage.
We should help and serve it
What has happened to it?
This cow is not from our area
-Then from where?
"""Has come from some other area, as all the cows in our area..."""
...are now healthy.
But this cow is diseased and very weak.
"""This cow has slept."
"-No, it has sacrified its life"""
Very bad thing has happened?
-What will happen now?
"""Mother cow, what sin have I committed that you came and..."""
...sacrificed your life here.
-Cow has sacrified its life
"""Cow sacrificed its life, or you killed it"""
Who has killed it?
-Who else was here to kill it?
"""What are you telling, please think before telling anything."""
"He's from the same ruling party as President Choi Eung Chan, but those two are political opponents."
"Without councilor Lee Young Taek, it will not be easy to get the Private School Reform Bill to pass."
"His side is against it for now, so the votes of the lesser councilmen from his faction are essential."
That means President Choi Eung Chan will persuade Lee Young Taek somehow.
Okay.
I will find out more.
"You came, Mr. President."
"We've finished the security inspection within the restaurant, and we found nothing suspicious."
Assembly Member Lee Yong Taek is waiting inside.
The bodyguards can rest outside for a while.
"We can't do that, Mr. President."
With the previous Guest Hall terrror incident at the Blue House too.
We need to guard you nearby.
Just 30 minutes is enough.
30 minutes is enough.
Mr. President...
I will cut to the chase.
Please help me pass the Private School Reform Bill.
"If I help you Mr. President, what can you do for me?"
"I will arrange it, so that you will not be summoned by the prosecution office."
"After the incident with Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, the National Assemby is reviled."
"With complaints from the citizens so adamant, the National Assembly will not come forward for you."
But I understand you and Chairman Cheon Jae Man agreed on an alliance.
Public sentiment is public sentiment.
"However,"
I will help you.
Thank you.
For us ruling party members to have friction...
"would only benefit the opposition party, right?"
I will use my power to help you pass your Private School Reform Bill as well.
"Then, I will leave believing in the President."
I am under your care.
Especially after I agreed to dance with him in ballet slippers so I wouldn't be taller than he was.
Fred was a perfectionist.
"After exhausting hours of rehearsal when we all thought we had it just right, he would say:"
"""Come on, Annie, let's do it one more time. """
What I wouldn't give to do it just one more time again.
Fred and his sister Adele were already stars in the New York and London theater before he came to MGM in 1933.
Do you feel like going through that number with Mr. Astaire?
- All right.
- Freddie.
Show Miss Marlowe the routine on that opening number.
- Good evening.
- Miss Marlowe.
Do you know the routine?
- I've seen it often enough.
I'll try.
That's fine.
"Harry, give us the pickup on that gang number, will you, please?"
It was a little more than a guest appearance for Fred for he was soon to be under contract to RKO Pictures where they were about to team him with Ginger Rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow.
Fred didn't return to MGM until seven years later at which time he starred with Eleanor Powell in Broadway Melody of 1940.
"In 1945, Fred and a new partner, Lucille Bremer stepped out to ""Coffee Time"" in Yolanda and the Thief."
"Its director, Vincente Minnelli."
That's for me
"I'm drum crazy, yes I'm drum crazy, yes"
I'm plumb crazy for drums
Fred could make music out of almost anything.
And he often found new challenges that stretched his talents.
"In Easter Parade, he uses drums to make a melody."
"First, soft violins"
"Then, sweet saxophones"
"Then, blue clarinets croon"
When it's my turn I turn into a loon
When the drum takes the melody
You're concerned about what Aubrey will do if he finally comes face-to-face with his dad?
How can he live with himself if he turns in his own father?
"My father had abandoned me and my brother, he was a fugitive from justice."
I...
I certainly never anticipated that we would manage to have a positive relationship.
How did you make that happen?
"By opening myself to the fact that... his actions, while partially his fault, were necessitated by events."
He's a much better man than the one I had built him up to be.
So there's a chance that could happen for Aubrey?
"Statistically, there's always a chance, Ms. Warren."
There's been another sighting.
Where?
"Uh, it's a financial record."
"Tell me, is there any difference between a latte and a latte macchiato?"
"Wait, wait, wait, I don't understand how a financial record is a sighting."
We'll get to that.
"With a latte, you add your espresso shot to the steamed milk, the, uh, the macchiato, it's the reverse."
And you taste the difference?
Absolutely.
I don't buy it.
So... where was he seen?
"Well, we have good evidence, but not eyewitnesses, from a wire office in Atlanta."
"There was a transfer for $9,000 from an overseas account that's tied to an alias previously used by Philip Aubrey."
All right.
"Small office, high volume."
Clientele is primarily alien laborers.
And the amount transferred is just a hair under the FDIC notification threshold.
That's definitely him.
Now he's got cash.
He may go under.
(phone rings)
He's here for a reason.
Wherefore that box?
"Sir, there lies such secrets In this fardel and box"
Which none must know but the King.
"Age, thou hast lost thy labour."
"The King is not at the pale, he is gone aboard a new ship"
I'll bring you where he is.
He seems to be a great authority
"Close with him, give him gold."
"Then please you, sir, to undertake the business for us"
Here is that gold I have.
Walk before toward the sea-side.
If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me
She drops booties in my mouth.
"Sir, you have done enough and have performed a saint-like sorrow."
You were one of those would have him wed again
"There is none worthy, respecting her that's gone."
"Besides, has not the divine Apollo said"
That King Leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found?
My true Paulina
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
That shall be when your first queen's again in breath
Never till then.
"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, son of Polixenes"
"With his princess, she the fairest I have yet beheld"
Desires access to your high presence.
He mes not like to his father's greatness.
Bring them to our embracement.
"Still, 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us."
Were I but twenty-one your father's image is so hit in you
"His very air, that I should ll you brother."
Welcome hither as is the spring to the earth.
"Please you great sir, Polixenes greets you from himself by me"
Though he cannot work he should have the strong will.
He should have confidence though he has no common sense.
There is a guy like the perfect package for all these qualities.
He comes keeping his brain in deep frizz while coming for duty.
"Interesting, who is he sir?"
Suzuki
Mother is Honda and Father is Maruthi.
"Son coming in collaboration is Suzuki,"
Suzuki Subramanyam alias Peter alias Pakodi
Frustration:
Unable to bear Depression:
Unable to hide Innocence:
Unable to believe
All operations he took up till now are disasters.
He strongly believes in all the wrong ideas he gets.
He is crossed border to catch Afghanistan Terrorists and has put a barber shop.
"With the frustration that no customers for 6 months, he forcefully shaved beard of one."
With that they shaved his head and made him sit on a donkey.
He till then has not understood that none shaves their beard in Afghanistan.
I need such a person going blindly ahead sir.
Where is he?
- In the bar
Will he drink so early in the day?
"Not for drinking, but to trap a gangster by name Tiger Bhai."
He is been working there as a waiter and is waiting in the same bar for 2 years.
"Why did you bring leg pieces when I asked for egg whites, you jackass?"
"By mistake, I will replace sir."
"Why did you bring egg whites when I asked for leg pieces, you dead loss?"
"My mistake, I will replace sir."
Why not just reverse it?
- Two mistakes.
"As I am starving for a success in my career, I am bearing this."
Because landing fees here are very reasonable... so it's one cent.
These are for you to do as you wish to improve your airport.
I think that's the cheapest airport
I've ever landed at in my whole life.
"When you fly in the day it's very bumpy, because the sun heats the surface of the African earth and it just gets these currents of air straight up."
"At night, it's completely different."
The air is calm and still.
You can see the stars.
You can see fires on the ground.
You can see the moonlight reflecting off of lakes.
And it's very calm and peaceful and kind of reflective time.
You're suspended in space over this large black think that you can't see.
It's mysterious.
The chimpanzee orphanage in northern Burundi was founded by the Jane Goodall Institute in 1989.
Chimps confiscated from smugglers are brought here to be cared for by conservationists and volunteers.
Dean Anderson is the director of the refuge.
"At the moment, it is home to 17 chimpanzees, and one baby gorilla."
How old is she?
She's about three
She was confiscated at the airport.
She was taken from her forest home as all the other chimps here...
"In Zaire... eastern Zaire, because she's an eastern lowland gorilla, by poachers and then she was brought to ;"
she was in transport... now what they were going to do with her there
I don't know.
Probably a zoo or...
Is that where they were mostly going to zoos at one point?
Zoos probably.
A gorilla would probably go to a zoo.
'Cuz a private person would just...
No...
"Not be so interested, right, because they get too big and too violent?"
"Yes, well too big."
"Only I'd understand, you know, if things have changed."
And that bullet might have had my name on it.
"Oh, Johnnie."
I wouldn't blame you.
Brannigan is one in a million.
"And I'm not much to write home about, am I?"
I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.
"""Everyday."""
Every day for the rest of my life.
- Good work.
"Bloody good show, what you've shot so far."
"When the film's been treated for color, it's going to look marvelous."
"God, the American's teeth!"
Can they be real?
"If the studio shoot goes half as well, this picture's going to be a triumph."
"There is, however, one area of concern..."
"Memo, please."
...from our American distributors.
"I'd ask you to absorb what's said without derision, Buckley."
"""American picture-goers like to be knocked off their feet."
"Bangs, crashes, ambulances careening around corners."
The same goes for romance.
"What you call understatement translates as a lack of oomph."""
"The Americans feel that the ending as presently written is too subtly nuanced,"
- too... restrained.
- Restrained?
"I mean, it's practically a call to arms."
Their concern is more what one might crudely call the love triangle.
"I have to say, as far as the home front goes, we can't let it look as if she'd rather have had the American."
"Well, that'll be the teeth."
"Teeth or no teeth, what all parties need is a morally clean, romantically satisfying resolution."
"Well, perhaps if Mrs. Cole could carry on her good work with Hilliard on set,"
"Percy just called, too."
Must be important.
I'm sorry.
I got to find out.
Tammy...
PRIDE:
"Wouldn't have bothered you, but we think somebody's life may be at stake."
Hoping FBI resources can help.
"Of course, what do you need?"
"Well, you were right about the racing circuit."
We've IDed the heist crew and we think another robbery may be imminent.
"Yeah, Patton got blueprints and schematics, but the best we can figure out is that it's a road map to certain IP addresses."
"Specifically, the ones that relate to high-tech communication systems made by Arsenal Protection."
"Apparently, they install them in armored trucks to allow continuous monitoring from security HQ."
"You know, the problem is, we can't figure out which banks contracted with Arsenal for the system."
Hoped Bank Robbery Task Force database might have that information.
Let me see.
Checked all local banks-- no issues and they're all closed for the day now.
"Yeah, and all the armored trucks are in and accounted for."
"Look, we're..."
running out of options.
Did you check Federal Reserve trucks?
The Reserve?
"No way these guys are crazy enough to go after the feds, are they?"
Drive.
Patton still tracking the armored truck?
SONJA:
They haven't hacked into it yet.
The truck's still moving.
Half mile ahead.
When is backup arriving?
Crew could be monitoring police communications.
"Isabel, you love venice this time of year."
You know that would remind me too much of mother and father.
But an institute?
That seems so severe.
Rosewood is more akin to a resort spa than a typical hospital.
Ladies of good repute routinely make use of its services.
Dr. torrington is right.
I...
I should be somewhere I can reflect and work on myself.
Someplace safe.
The staff at the institute is finely trained in the latest advancements in medicine.
And my dear friend Dr. cairn is at the forefront of psychiatric treatment.
"If it's what you recommend, we trust you."
"I assure you, our dear Isabel is in safe hands."
"Attherosewoodinstitute, weemploythefinestdoctors onthissideoftheAtlantic."
We work at the forefront of the scientific world.
"Nowhere will you find better, more attentive care."
We cater to the best families in Baltimore.
"And your dear sister, Mr. Porter, shall find..."
Please.
Roderick.
"Your dear sister, Roderick, shall find exactly the caring, supportive environment which she needs."
"Yes, this will do nicely."
This is where I will sit as I write you letters.
Let me introduce you to one of our physicians.
Dr. Jacobs?
Dr. Jacobs is our newest addition to our staff.
He's a leading researcher into new advances in medical technologies.
Madame Werner is too kind.
I am but a humble practitioner of the healing arts.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Isabel.
So Many people are dead due to that and also by illegal drug testing.
An employee by name Shyam Prasad knowing about this matter..
has complained at the drug control board with an evidence.
Officer from Delhi for inquiry arrived.
All those details are in this pen drive.
I will take action on this as a drug control officer.
Jayaraj knowing this before hand..
.. due to the fact that the case would fall on him if he directly kills them both..
.. planned a mass attack and made everyone believe it was a Terrorist act.
A boy working in the hotel found the Pen drive and he gave that to Ravi.
Jayaraj's chapter will be finished once your brother regains consciousness.
Your mission is completed.
Thank you sir.
There is yet another bigger mission in pending now.
What is that sir?
Telling my daughter Ria that you are not a Police.
Be careful!
My nephew Deepak woke up from coma.
Get well soon Deepu.
Your dad is very much worried
"Sir, that Marthand fellow has said it all in the investigation."
We all will have to go into the jail once that Ravi fellow is conscious.
He focused on your son and made him sit in a corner.
Now he has focused on you.
He seems to do whatever he has planned sir.
A selfie for safety
It is not possible in Cherlapally jail.
Why are you silent sir?
What shall we do now?
Silence is unpredictable.
It is difficult to estimate the silence.
It is further difficult to estimate the loss from that.
-Greetings Sir
-Greetings
If I die suddenly It will be because of them
What are you saying?
Are they deliberately creating mischief....
I am slightly tense will be back in a minute...
I will be back in a minute
"Sir, white and white man, I am calling you"
Wait for a minute
I didn't see your faces inside
"Now I have seen clearly, you may go"
Just a moment
Just listen to what I have to say
If anything happen to our boss We will tear you apart
We are the ruling party
"Do you know what will happen, if you oppose us?"
"You ask for votes, We cast votes"
There are 5000 members in our union
"Along with family members it's more than 20,000 votes"
We could make an empty guy an MLA and make an MLA empty also
You can not spin your yarn here
We are already spinning a lot Leave the place
"This husk has gold Quick, they might come"
They have come....
What are you doing here?
Can't you see we are scooping the husk?
Was it you behind stealing the husk so far?
Whom do you call a thief?
Why should I steal from my own house?
Don't I have rights to scoop even the husk in this house?
What have you done for me?
We have given you a silver shop
I'm assuming that not all the guests have to actually stay in the basement.
"Nice to be here, pretending it's five people having a gentle chat with an audience."
Sharing a dressing room!
Evening.
APPLAUSE
Hello.
I'm Alan Davies and this is As Yet Untitled.
"This is the show where me and four funny people sit down and have a conversation and during the course of the conversation, we will come up with the title for the show."
"We have limited ambition, but so far, we've always achieved our goals."
Please will you welcome my guests.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Hello.
"OK, I'm going to introduce them all, one at a time."
Please will you welcome Grace Dent.
Grace Dent hasn't been to Yoga in 18 months.
Grace Dent.
David O'Doherty is here.
David O'Doherty is an almost professional athlete and has had a top 30 hit.
Johnny Vegas.
"Welcome, Johnny."
Johnny became an inadvertent subscriber to the Catholic newsletter.
Johnny Vegas.
And Sean Kelly.
Sean Kelly shouldn't go camping with co-workers and will never again live in a van.
That's right.
Only once.
I shall explain.
"Now, in what field were you almost a professional athlete?"
"Well, you could say in numerous fields, in that I wanted to be."
"It's looking increasingly unlikely that it's going to happen by the year...now, but the closest I ever got was, in the year 2000, I'd just started doing stand-up comedy and I was house-sitting for Ardal O'Hanlon, a very funny comedian,"
"and he played golf and he had been booked to play in the Pro-Am of the Irish Open, which is the day before the pro tournament starts."
"The players, to get used to the course, play with probably businessmen and then also some people like Ardal."
Whoa!
What is your grand vision for all of this?
MUSK:
The point of the Gigafactory is to get the cost of batteries down to the point where it's affordable.
DICAPRIO:
Right.
MUSK:
Batteries are critical to the sustainable energy future.
"The sun doesn't shine all the time, so, you've got to store it in a battery."
DICAPRIO:
How is this gonna help developing nations that have massive populations that need to have power?
MUSK:
"So, the advantage of solar and batteries is that you can avoid building electricity plants at all."
"So you could be in a remote village and have solar panels that charge a battery pack, that then supplies power to the, to the whole village, without ever having to run thousands of miles of high voltage cable over the place."
"It's like, what happened with landline phones versus cellular phones, in a lot of developed countries they just didn't do the landline phones, they just went straight to cellular."
"And we actually did the calculations today, like, what would it take to transition the whole world to, uh, sustainable energy."
What kind of throughput would you actually need?
"Um, and you'd need 100 gigafactories."
So.
DICAPRIO: 100 of these?
"MUSK: 100 of these, yes."
DICAPRIO:
That would make the United States.
MUSK:
"No, the whole world."
DICAPRIO:
The whole world?
MUSK:
The whole world.
All energy.
DICAPRIO:
That's it?
!
MUSK:
Yeah.
DICAPRIO:
"That sounds, that doesn't sound."
MUSK:
It's manageable.
DICAPRIO:
That sounds manageable.
MUSK:
Yeah.
"The Gigafactory, when it's complete, will have the largest footprint of any building in the world."
"Counting multiple levels, it could be as much as 15 million square feet."
"So, Tesla can't build 100 gigafactories."
The thing that's really gonna make a difference is if companies that are much bigger than Tesla do the same thing.
"If the big industrial companies in China, and U. S., and Europe, the big car companies, if they also do this, then collectively we can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy."
"And if government sets the rules to favor sustainable energy, we can get there really quickly."
But it's really fundamental.
Unless there's a price put on carbon.
DICAPRIO:
We're never gonna be able to make the transition that we need to in time.
Correct?
MUSK:
Yeah.
And the only way to do that is basically with a carbon tax.
DICAPRIO:
"Okay, now walk me through a carbon tax, which is what you're saying, is the silver bullet for climate change."
MANKIW:
Well the carbon tax would be basically a tax on any kind of activity that put carbon into the atmosphere.
"So when you tax something, you raise the price, people are gonna tend to consume less of it."
In fact that's sort of lesson number one of economics.
DICAPRIO:
"Look, I'm just going to say this once."
Vince was a normal guy.
Okay?
"A normal, boring, regular guy."
He watched football in his underwear.
He never took out the garbage unless I told him to.
"He forgot our anniversary year after year and tried to make up for it two days later with a, with a bouquet of white roses."
"But I didn't care, because he loved me."
"Mrs. Nelson, was there anybody on the wrestling team that your husband seemed especially close to?"
Anyone he saw outside of practice or talked about more than any of the others?
No.
Did he seem to have a problem with any of the boys on the team?
"Look, just because he worked with boys doesn't mean that..."
I don't know why I don't just unplug it.
I guess I keep hoping one of these times it'll be someone with something comforting to say!
I-I'm so sorry.
We're almost done here.
I know what you're thinking.
"""Oh, poor woman."
"How could she possibly deny the fact"" ""that her husband was a pedophile?"
"We have these pictures."" This e-mail."""
"Well, Vince wasn't a pedophile."
"He was a loving, innocent man who was murdered."
Why don't you put your energy into finding his killer?
The photos of the boy were downloaded from an international child porn site.
Which makes it unlikely that Nelson actually molested him.
"I checked the browser and search histories on his computer, there were no additional pornography downloads or searches, not one."
Maybe he covered his tracks?
Surfed anonymously?
No.
The hard drive's clean.
"The strange thing is when I checked the firewall log,"
- feel it.
This can't be happening to me.
"Better put the kettle on, Pam."
And bring in one of Margaret's home-made Swiss logs.
Joyce needs a sugar infusion.
"Have a sip of tea, Joyce."
- Is camilla here?
- That bitch?
"That's enough, Pam."
"I can imagine some of the things you're thinking, Joyce."
"To an outsider, all this must seem pretty strange."
"But before you judge us, there are some things you should know."
"Once upon a time, there was a woman who was kind and courteous to everyone."
But there was one person of whom she was especially fond.
Me.
"Between them, the two friends saw the good in everyone until one day, when something very, very bad happened."
It was a horrific experience.
"But bizarrely, the two friends discovered that what doesn't kill you sometimes makes you stronger."
So they made a pact that they would do their best to ensure the streets of Little Stempington would never again be the target of lowlife lawbreaking scum.
"And once they started, they realised they actually quite enjoyed it."
So they did it again and again.
But then it all went wrong.
Camilla got greedy and she wasn't the only one.
"She crossed over to the dark side, taking Hilary and Lillian with her."
"And ever since then, it's been our mission to stop her."
"Good can't live in the same town as evil, Joyce."
"- well, why don't you go to the police?"
- CamiIIa got there first.
Jeremy said he died in a car crash.
"When he suddenly developed a conscience,"
camilla arranged a little road accident.
- Once she's got you she's got Jeremy.
"- Hey there, good game."
- I'm gonna hat-trick you twice.
Good luck with that.
"Oh, yes, cross-checking, boarding, slashing, spearing."
That certainly brings back the memories.
"Questionable sportsmanship aside, these Chiefs have certainly been reinvigorated with new blood on the ice."
"And after the first formal foray of these junior Hansons,"
- you have to ask yourself...
- Is that nature or nurture?
...ADD or DNA?
"Good job, good job, good job."
He sent in the goon squad.
They have gone from Zenovators to headhunters in less than a week.
"Yeah, it's truly inspiring, Dad."
Sure do have a lot of spirit.
What they need is liability insurance.
"And in a scene that is strangely familiar, three Hansons are populating the penalty box, forcing their fellow Chiefs to face a difficult five on three penalty kill."
A true test of their orphan grit.
- Thank you.
- Nice save.
"In a strange first period move, the angry Night Hawks seem to be trying to make the Chiefs pay by pulling their goaltender to make it six on three."
That's something you don't see every day.
And he's their last uninjured player to boot.
"...goes down to block the shot, and Alex Gorrall tosses the puck."
He flips it in the air and splits the two defenders.
What an amazing move!
He's rocketing down the ice towards the empty net.
He's beat the desperate defence.
"He's spins around, he scores."
"Led by emerging phenom Alex Gorrall, it seems these boys may be worthy to call themselves Chiefs after all."
"Way to go, guys!"
No mercy!
"But today we can join with old friends, we can make new friends and we help celebrate a young man's first Communion."
And also to thank that boy's family for a magnificent contribution to the State.
I have here in my hand a check made out to the university and it is a magnificent endowment in the name of
Anthony Vito Corleone.
The check is signed by that young man's parents whom I think we should recognize.
"Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please."
Let the folks see you!
"Folks, I want you to join me in giving a real Nevada thank you to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!"
"We also have, as a special added attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir who have chosen a certain special song and a special arrangement to honor their host, Mr. Michael Corleone."
Boys.
The plaque.
"Okay, fellows, did you get that one?"
"Okay, that's good."
"Now, Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone."
My lawyer Tom Hagen.
Senator Geary.
He arranged everything through your man Turnbull.
"-Yes, yes."
-Sit down.
I thought that you and I would talk alone.
"I trust these men with my life, Senator."
To ask them to leave would be an insult.
"Well, it's perfectly all right with me but I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you."
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my position has ever talked to you before.
The Corleone family has done well in Nevada.
"You own, or control, two major hotels in Vegas and one in Reno."
The licenses were grandfathered in so there was no problem with the Gaming Commission.
Now my sources tell me that you plan to make a move against the Tropigala.
"They tell me that within a week, you're going to move Klingman out."
Quite an expansion.
"However, it will leave you with a little technical problem."
The license will still be in Klingman's name.
No.
"You were thinking of Leonardo da Vinci, weren't you?"
"No, you see."
The answer is this.
Actually he was Chinese.
"The first known helicopter was a popular toy called the bamboo dragonfly which could fly 25 feet up into the air and dates back to at least the fourth century AD, therefore more than 1,000 years before the idea occurred to Leonardo da Vinci in 1480."
(Alan) But who actually did make a helicopter first?
"Not a silly bamboo thing, a proper helicopter."
"You know, going... (makes whirring sounds) Running across."
Pilot.
"Helicopter just means a spiral, a screw-wing."
Helixopter.
A real one with an engine that takes off on tyres.
I think the nation that really lays claim to inventing the first modern helicopter in the sense that we would use it is in fact the French.
"Now, next question."
What do you get if you suck your pencil for a long time?
- Lead poisoning.
- (Stephen) She's done it!
- (alarm bells)
- Can you believe it?
Can you believe these people?
"No, there is no chance on God's or any other earth we know of of getting lead poisoning."
- (Alan) You mean Sir was lying?
"- No, there is no lead in a pencil."
It's called lead.
"It has no Pb in it, no element of lead whatsoever."
It's pure graphite.
"Since the invention of the pencil, they've been made of graphite, which is the pure crystalline form of carbon and will do you no harm."
- Why the lead thing?
It's not lead?
- (Stephen) It's not lead.
"It never has been, never will be."
"Madigan, and Tbe Invasion of tbe Body Snatcbers, of course which is one of the great B-movies of all time."
Don SiegeI was a montage director at Warner Brotbers in tbe '40s.
"Tbe montages, tbe passage of time, tbat sort of tbing."
"For montages, you bad to be very clear about tbe images and very precise because it bad to tell a Iot in 10 or 15 seconds."
"In fact, He did the montages in casablanca."
"THen by train, or auto, or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in french Morocco."
Don SiegeI was almost tbe last of a certain kind of breed of directors.
He did what one would call B-budget movies.
Baby Face nelson.
"Taut little movies done in a very lean, efficient style."
"I tbougbt: ""well, tbls'II be fun."""
He seems to know bis stuff and so we went abead and made tbe movie.
Tbis isn't tbe O.K. corral around bere.
Tbis is tbe city of New York.
We've got a system.
"Not mucb, but we're fond of it."
We don't like it wben some two-for-a-nickeI cowboy tbinks be can bend it out of sbape.
Coogan's bluff was a stepping stone into the modern world.
It was a little bit of a Western cbaracter but contemporary.
"Tben be goes to New York and in a sense it is, I tbink, almost a precursor of tbe Dirty Harry cbaracter."
Looking for Jimbo?
Don Siegel invited me to come by tHe set of Coogan's bluff.
And I Hung around late into the night watching them work.
He moved fast.
He was used to moving fast doing small budget pictures on tight schedules.
One thing struck me very noticeably.
"I'd been around enough sets to know that this was unusual which was that the star, Clint Eastwood, never left the set between setups."
He never went to His trailer or went to tbe pbone or wbatever.
He just bung around and watcbed.
Eastwood observed Siegel as intently as He Had observed Leone.
But He would learn even more from Siegel.
He became Eastwood's most important mentor.
The sun... is uncontrollable... unforgiving.
"With the sun, you can't... shape and sculpt reality."
I hate the sun.
"There is magic in enormity, my doctor-- overwhelming, like a dominant father."
"Yes, but... the art is in disguising the technique."
Brutality must be wrapped in velvet.
That is what distinguishes us from say... a thug like Stalin.
Hitler:
Wagner made the exorbitant demand that the stage become an hypnotic instrument under the power of the artist.
I impose the same demand on Germany.
History is an error to be rewritten be the visionary playwright.
"While Wagner brought the German myths to the operatic stage, I brought them to the world."
"I am the superman, the Teutonic knight on the quest for the Holy Grail."
"Compared to you,"
Wagner was a minimalist.
Let's enter one more into the record.
"This is from April, 1935."
A woman from Berlin.
"""My fervently adored Führer, you have a birthday, and we know only two ardent wishes:"
"that everything in our fatherland be, now and in the future, just as you want it to be, and may God provide that you be preserved for us forever."
"Your loyal, E.E."""
Just a minute.
"I thought you said our count was 5,700,000."
They're using the 6-million figure.
( Hitler mumbles ) Typical.
A clever exaggeration.
"Well, all right, Goering, let's use those figures."
Suits us.
History likes round numbers.
"Now, the war total was 55 million."
"Out of that, the camps and death squads were responsible for only"
11 or 12 million.
"Yeah, Addison wasn't the only person that Holm was spying on."
"Looks like he put spyware onto over 1,000 machines."
He was targeting other victims.
"Exactly, and it looks like he may have selected one."
"He's got a folder with this guy's name on it, Jason Putnam."
"Whoa, that's a lot of data."
Over a terabyte.
"E-mails, financials, recorded phone calls, he even has video and screen caps from a bunch of hijacked camera feeds."
Who is Jason Putnam?
"My name is Jason Putnam, and I have something to confess."
"Over the past year, while working as a private financial advisor,"
"I embezzled over $800,000."
Mostly from elderly clients whom I believed were less likely to detect the fraud.
JERRY:
Jason Putnam posted this video to his profile three days ago and it immediately went viral.
"Uh-huh, so this guy's robbing old folks for their live savings."
I imagine the Internet was not too kind.
It was brutal.
He was publically eviscerated.
"But since then, no one has seen or heard from him."
His family contacted HPD 'cause they were concerned about his mental state.
"He's currently classified as an ""Endangered Missing Adult."""
"Okay, but clearly Putnam didn't go missing on his own."
"I mean, Holm kidnapped him and forced this confession."
TOAST:
"Guys, check this out."
Found these on Holm's server.
They're camera feeds and they're live.
"All right, can we trace where they're coming from?"
"Yeah, sure, but there's 17 of them, and they're coming from all over the island."
"From what I can tell, it's mostly abandoned buildings and vacant homes."
"Well, obviously he was staking these places out."
Sometimes sexual abuse.
Lack of a strong authority figure in adolescence.
Low self-esteem resulting in few permanent relationships.
Defensive.
Rebellious.
Highly intelligent.
"Susceptible to being stuck in one position, environment or occupation for long periods of time."
Wow...
"Yeah, you're terrible at this."
How about your profile?
Indifferent and emotionally detached from reality.
lnability to communicate with any other human being on the face of this Earth.
Willing to sit silently in one place for hours at a time.
Make sure that you have a plan to kill every person that you ever meet.
No.
Close.
"No, I had a stable childhood but with an underlying desire to break free from control or authority."
Restless.
Sense of self-entitlement.
Striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people.
-Bordering between autism...
-Stop.
"You know, I, um, didn't always do this."
This is my first station assignment.
I was on the other end of the numbers.
Looking at nine million black-book tax dollars.
Recruited me straight out of college.
Said it was the best opportunity I'd ever have.
"Told me I'd do special things, important things."
"Well, you're worth more than what some bureaucrat wrote down on a piece of paper 20 years ago."
Hmm...
All they're really talking about is what's real.
What?
It's Halloween weekend.
Arson investigators have noticed a three-year trend in the days leading up to Halloween.
Devil's Night.
This unsub is killing only these three days out of the year.
How's he doing it?
He's burning his victims alive.
He's abducting seemingly random people and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
- He struck again last night.
- Yeah.
"Tony Torrell, 40."
"He lives in the suburbs, but he was found 20 miles away in the Rivertown district."
He's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
What does he do during the rest of the year?
He's dormant.
"You know, arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25 who can't stay away from fire."
"Yeah, they're addicted to it, and there's no rehab."
"And they target dwellings, not people."
"So you're saying he burns his victims alive, but he's not an arsonist?"
Fire is simply his weapon.
And Devil's Night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
And we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
"Well, his last victim was athletic."
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.
The offender must be just as strong or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
"Still, how does he transport his victims across the city and get them inside buildings without being noticed?"
"[Hotch] Niccolo Machiavelli wrote,"
"""If an injury has to be done to a man, it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared. """
"Now, I thought Devil's Night was Halloween Eve."
"You know, the moniker ""Devil's Night"" is somewhat deceiving."
"In Detroit, it's actually a three-day citywide cultural phenomenon, complete with masks, chaos, and costumes."
Say that three times fast.
"I thought maybe if I can double it, maybe triple it..."
Behind a pizza place.
"Well, small outfit like that, man,"
I couldn't believe I lost it all.
"I couldn't ask you for more, so they made me a deal."
"Bring some fresh meat to the table, and I can get you your money back."
Why?
"Michael, why?"
You were doing so good.
"I tried to make it right, Leon."
On my own two feet.
But watching that poor kid lose his last dime...
I couldn't take it.
I got out of there.
And he came after you.
"Yeah, he blamed me for, uh, bringing him into the game."
"the muck of machinery, but, no."
"Basically, the personality of the TARDIS got transferred into a kind of hot, scruffy,"
Helena-Bonham-Carter- type woman.
I'm alive.
"I was very happy when the TARDIS turned out to have such an elegant, demure voice and personality, you know, how the TARDIS, you know, sounded like a London taxi driver --"
"""I'm not going to metebelis, no, and I'm not going there at that time."""
He really realized how alive the TARDIS is.
"Because he always goes like ""she's alive,"""
"but when you see a person be alive, it's easier to understand, than, like, a telephone booth with infinite rooms."
You never read the instructions.
I always read the instructions!
There's a sign on my front door.
You have been walking past it for 700 years -- what does it say?
That's not instructions!
"The relationship between the Doctor and Idris, who was the TARDIS, is kind of interesting because it is a love story, but it goes past anything sort of physical, it's a love story that is like just"
they're bonded throughout time.
"It's simply that, as my craft came over this afternoon,"
I saw some explosions out to the east.
It seemed that fighting was still going on.
Isolated pockets of resistance.
They're being mopped up rapidly now.
You actually saw the destruction of a rebel unit.
Strange that I didn't see any sign of life.
They're very skilled at using cover.
So it would seem.
We employed a live target for that particular strike.
"A live target, General?"
Sleer's people picked up a rebel who'd been sent on an intelligence mission.
"He was adapted, given a tracer to swallow and sent back to rejoin his friends."
"When he reached their base, my missile commander just pressed the button."
"- That's very ingenious, General."
- And very effective.
"Well, Excellency, I'll leave you now."
We'll meet tomorrow at the swearing-in ceremony.
"Thank you, General."
I'm grateful to you.
We are now holding station 40 miles from the surface.
"I do hope this is satisfactory, Master."
"So, Tarrant, this is your big moment."
- If the teleport works...
"- It's working perfectly now, I checked it myself."
"Yes, but would you use it yourself, Vila?"
That's the real test.
"Oh, get in there and disappear."
"Remember, Tarrant, we are only interested in whether or not the Federation have some new weapon."
"Whatever else is happening down there, even if they are executing the entire population, you are not to get involved."
- All right?
"- You know me, Avon."
"Hey, fugitive's name is Walton Dawkins."
He's originally from the mainland but he did ten years at the Allen Correctional Facility in Cleveland for multiple home invasions.
"Apparently, our guy likes hitting families with big money."
Then he violated his parole by coming to Hawaii six years ago.
My guess it wasn't for the surf.
Dawkins killed a couple during his burglaries.
"But get this, according to the warden, he's been a model prisoner until now."
"So, what changed?"
"Yo, you all right, bro?"
"Hey, guards."
We need help in here.
"So right before the inmate collapsed, he was complaining of shortness of breath, pain in his arm."
Textbook sings of cardiac arrest.
"Little young to be dropping dead of a heart attack, don't you think?"
- Yeah.
- Not if he was poisoned.
Found this stuff in Dawkin's cell.
Nutmeg.
"Yeah, they got the prison bake sale coming up."
Hang on a second.
You can extract myristicin from nutmeg.
"It's an organic compound, it has psychoactive properties."
"It works like a drug, and in large doses, it's lethal and fast-acting."
"So Dawkins poisons an inmate as a distraction, shoots a few guards and walks out the door wearing one of their uniforms."
In broad daylight?
A lot of unnecessary exposure for someone trying to sneak out.
Price off freedom?
Maybe he didn't think he'd have time to dig a tunnel.
What else have we got?
One of the maintenance guys reported his car stolen.
- We got H.P.D. a description.
- Assume Dawkins knows that too.
aren't you married?
then why do you...with him?
does your husband realize...?
you're a good girl but I wanna hurt you
I'm not giving him away yet.
I'm not gonna give you Ogiwara
what's up?
wait
Yugi-san?
hey!
it's the first time we see eachother here
I was looking for this...
little red can you help me with homework?
me?
I don't know if I'll get it
they're good together daddy~ I want a mommy no i don't
uh...can I warn you?
huh?
I think you guys should separate my mom has always suported him when he was trying to become pianist when he couldn't make it and was doing part-time jobs when he started his work now and became more and more busy
it still was no use he can't get together with anyone
you should separate she stimulates her?
who?
her
if she enters this area then it gets complicated so don't stimulate her
"Imaoka-san, you don't like her?"
"it's a lie that girls are weak beings that get eaten by wolves when a woman passes 20, they set up traps to be eaten traps?"
when should we do it next time?
it'll be hard to do it till morning like last time so let's do it on weekends come here come here
I...actually that night don't remember anything of course...you were drunk drunk?
drunk and you sang and danced to dango 3 brothers at a karaoke place oh really?
I was singing dango good that's not good what about me?
make it clear what?
Are you getting the guns out of school?
That's the only question that's important here.
"We're going to open this up for your comments in just one moment, please--"
My daughter has been in tears for thirty-six hours.
We are not going to live with this kind of terror in our schools.
Friends.
One moment please.
We're going to get nowhere fast if each and every one of us speaks out of turn.
"Now, as I was saying to your point Madam, Ms. Krzy zanowski here..."
is going to provide special counseling...
for any student who has a problem coping with the incident.
That is good.
Put the kids in therapy so they can adjust to being shot.
We can hear what everybody has to say if we could just...
- say it one at a time.
"- Excuse me, M r."
"Principle, could l-- lt would help if you would say your name and the name of your child."
My name is Amber Vallone and I have a daughter Rayanne Graff who I leave...
"in your capable hands everyday, and what I'd like to know is..."
"while you're bringing in counselors, and being all upset..."
should I just send my daughter to school in a bullet prove vest...
every day or are you actually going to do something...
about the guns in our school.
It's not the lack of economic opportunity or the poor home life...
or the lack of values.
But the guns.
You know the things that shoot.
Are you going to get that gun out of our school?
"Yes, I would like to see it happen."
"Hey, you know, I really liked what you said in there."
- Oh God.
- l wish I could do that.
But now comes my innovation.
I didn't care much about quantities.
"I put the profession on the abscissa, and the type of offense on the ordinate, thus coming to the interesting social aspect of it all."
That's the first thing.
"Secondly, I used the following criteria:"
"Daytime, season of the year..."
And I got an interesting phenomenon.
"For example, the mafia tends to kill in the springtime early in the morning."
While the intellectuals usually kill in the wintertime late in the evening.
The housewives are victims of pocket-picking mostly in the summertime before 12am.
While the mafia members normally beat up their wives in late June.
I'm really impressed!
Help yourself.
How did you come to this?
"You mean, the system?"
- Yes.
"Look, if one uses his head..."
Cheers.
"Besides, if one has a love for such work, nothing is hard."
I'm currently working on something.
I'm working on classifying the human crimes in regards to the victim.
"You've heard about the victimology, right?"
It's a study of victims.
"You see, I have all that amply written in my books, but I'm worried about one thing."
"Namely, it is not unimportant who's the victim and what is his/her role in a crime."
What about data?
Where did you get it?
I find all that in the newspapers.
There's tons of data for those who know how to read carefully.
"I know, but they sometimes keep it quiet if it's an financial crime or a messy one."
"Then, all those traffic accidents."
Who would note down all this?
"I'm supposed to get an Ok from him this afternoon let's wait for that and then ask the client again we're close, we can't miss this client wait, where's Imaoka-san?"
oh a magazine interview 10 Japan CM Creators of the time
the person I respect?
yes
Mitsui Hachiroem
He's from Edo time period he was the first person in Japan to come up with a sales slogan
"Money, Low Prices, no waste it's so good and simple"
I always think the first person is great like Fugu (fish) the first person that ate that so good of him
I mean he must have died like why did it have to be cooked that way for getting rid of the poison oh am I talking too long?
should it be shorter?
"no, I want to hear more details don't you, thought so like yogurt, natto, things like that...."
I'll hook up with you (attack you)
"I don't mind after that... after that... remember, what was it?"
come on did you make it home?
"I was worried, since you were drunk aren't you tired, it was till morning"
right?
what?
serious business trip?
I have to..it's to Nagoya
I'll bring back a souvenir
I'm not good at that stuff but what do you want?
then I'll be going
what was that ha~ what was yours?
my private life is tough mine is hard too
mine is like an emergency too mine is probably worse
oh...
Tanaka-san?
why that name?
nothing you knew?
- I didn't see anything what did you see?
why didn't you say anything?
Ishida - you're scary
Leslie's mistake handed Amber the win.
"One more victory, and Amber would earn a spot in an upcoming pro-level race."
You stupid bitch.
"Being the vindictive type, she decided to sabotage her rival's chances."
Start your engines.
Should've been me out there.
[Grunts]
"Her plan worked, but then the broken chain flew off Amber's bike, and wrapped around Leslie's throat."
She didn't plan on that.
"As the stainless steel motorcycle chain ripped through her neck tissues, it acted like a serrated blade, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissues, as well as the carotid artery."
"This would have caused her to bleed out rapidly, at almost one liter per minute, causing death within a couple of minutes."
"Leslie would do anything to make it in the highly competitive world of motocross, even cheat."
"But in the end, she was a little too..."
Cut throat.
"Up next, finally we got a real story to work with."
"Hurry, hurry, hurricane."
I can't-  and...
- I just want to touch things.
A campfire tale that'll get you all choked up.
"It's hard to believe that anyone would want to steal a seeing-eye dog, but they have."
Joe was a local news reporter with big dreams of covering national stories.
"Back to you, Mike."
There was just one problem.
I can't hear anything in this.
I gotta hear the anchor.
What's wrong with you?
Joe didn't care about anything except looking good on camera.
[Phone rings]
- But then Joe got the call
- about a story...
"- Hurricane, huh?"
That would make national news.
No.
Then there's someone who can verify your whereabouts?
"Mr. Mason, I see no reason to involve an innocent person in these proceedings."
Why not?
Would it be embarrassing to that person?
Or would it be embarrassing to you?
I simply see no reason to reveal her name.
And neither do I.
"If it please the court, counsel is just employing his usual shotgun method here."
"I'll withdraw the question, Your Honor."
"That'll be all, Mr. Langley."
"I noticed a few minutes earlier that the defendant had left the party and changed her clothes, as though for traveling."
"Naturally, I was curious, watchful."
You say that you saw her later in the upstairs hall.
Where was this?
She came running out of her aunt's room.
The poor child was white as a sheet.
"Terrified, I thought."
"Naturally, I didn't let her see me."
Naturally.
"But, Mr. Corbett, did you notice anything else about her?"
"She clutched something under her jacket with one hand, and her other hand she held stiffly away from her."
There was some dark moisture on it.
I can't say positively it was blood.
"No, I can't, sir."
Just something dark.
And then she disappeared toward the back stairway.
"Mr. Pierce, am I correct in assuming that yours and the defendant's proposed flight to San Francisco-- or your proposed flight anywhere-- would have been in the nature of an elopement?"
"Well, yes, Merle wanted to try it."
"You anticipated opposition, then?"
I figured that Aunt Olivia would try to stop us if she could.
"Did she object to you on personal grounds, Mr. Pierce?"
Making sure we haven't blabbed to them.
"Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't."
"Well, what do you know?"
Not enough.
"It sounds like science fiction, but you make planes invisible."
Project Harvey.
Which is...?
Stealth.
We can bring our planes and submarines right into Soviet territory without any detection.
"The KGB kidnapped this man,"
"Anton Baklanov, and took him back to the Soviet Union."
Was he the key to Stealth?
We don't know that man.
But he wasn't the key to it.
No one person has the key to anything.
Information is spread out through multiple departments and highly compartmented.
Classic definition of the left hand not knowing the right.
Soviets would have to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to put it all together.
And get through a hell of a lot of security.
"The last meeting where all of the different groups actually met, each of us had two of our security guys watching our every move."
What meeting was that?
What meeting was that?
He is probably being tortured right now.
"And once they realize he doesn't have everything they need, they will find out who does."
You said that they would need to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to get to Stealth?
"Well, that's exactly what they'll do."
They got him... circumvented dozens of FBI agents looking for him and sent him out of the country.
You think two D.O.D. security guards can protect you or anybody else?
Think again.
"Alexandria, Virginia -- two months ago."
Who was there?
"Uh, reps from Lockheed and Northrop."
Carter.
"Forgive me, I..."
I've been foolish.
No.
It was my fault that we argued.
No.
- There's something I want to say to you.
"- Please, don't tire yourself."
My affection for you has never changed.
You must believe that.
I...
I thought you might like to see this.
It's part of a lamp that we found in the tomb.
"There were two cups, this is the inner, which when lit would cast its picture on the outer."
It shows Tutankhamun and his queen.
It's beautiful.
Even I can tell it's the real thing.
Tell Evelyn not to worry.
I'm prepared.
(Evelyn sobbing)
"For an Egyptian Pharaoh, death was not the end."
It was a beginning.
Tutankhamun now embarked on his most important journey into the underworld.
"There, he would be united with the gods and complete the cycle of resurrection and regeneration."
"But first, Tutankhamun's body must be preserved with salt."
All of his internal organs except the heart and kidneys were removed.
"His brain was withdrawn through his nose and discarded, while other organs were preserved in an alabaster chest."
"Finally, Tutankhamun's mummified body was wrapped in bandages and placed within a series of golden coffins for transportation to the Valley of the Kings."
"Tutankhamun's young widow, Ankhesamun, had produced no heir, so the former advisor, Ay, now came to the throne."
"To cement his power, he married Tutankhamun's widow, probably another incestuous marriage."
There is evidence that Ankhesamun was Ay's own granddaughter.
What saddens me the most is that he won't be at my wedding.
No.
Didn't you also find that the necklace had been stolen?
"And didn't you then kill your wife, using this weapon?"
That's not true!
Not true that the necklace had been stolen?
"Did you also take the necklace, Mr. Langley?"
"No, I didn't."
"No, I was in the garden, I tell you, all that time."
I never left!
"But a certain woman left that garden, didn't she?"
The nameless woman you'd been embracing--
"That woman left the garden, didn't she?"
Well--
"Well, yes."
"She did, as a matter of fact."
"Who was that woman, Mr. Langley?"
Gina Gilbert.
You filthy old man!
You didn't have to tell him!
[judge pounding]
Don't you know what I did for you?
"Stupid, filthy, rotten man!"
"I knew Howard made a hopeful play for every woman he ever met, but I never guessed he'd got around to Gina."
"It had gone further than that, Mr. Kirk."
"Gina wanted to marry Howard and help him manage Merle's estate, if only Olivia could have been disposed of."
A divorce wasn't the answer because Olivia had such a hold over Merle.
Then Danny came on the scene.
Danny was looking for someone who had entree to the wealthy set.
Gina went along with his plan to steal the necklace because first he knew that she was wanted by the police back east and second because it afforded her a perfect chance to murder Olivia.
"Gina put on an evening gown, slipped quietly through the party, killed the unconscious Olivia, and got back in time to meet the messenger who delivered the stolen diamonds."
"Oh, that's what you meant when you said the girl at the motel was not maybe disrobed."
Exactly.
"Helicopter, isn`t it nice?"
"No, this isn`t a good name"
Why not name it...

"No way, I can`t wait"

"Before us lies Germany, within us marches Germany, and after us comes Germany!"
Hitler:
"At the extreme, one becomes a symbol."
Every man who desires adulation will recognize in me the pure manifestation of that dark part of himself.
"I am the perfect reflection of every man with the lust to dominate, who has some bias or prejudice-- some unsatisfied craving."
"Some will condemn me morally, but they cannot escape the power of my image."
"Their self-righteousness will dissolve, as their hearts beat with the rhythm of my essence."
"Even those poor souls who hate me will privately envy me, because I've fulfilled my dreams, whilst others repress their true desires."
"Thus, have I guaranteed my immortality."
The essential Hitler has a hold over every human heart.
Does that sound clichéd?
"Anyway, let's end this on a poetic note."
Will to power.
Will to form.
Will to beauty.
"Look at the men, Goebbels."
American citizens with a reason for hating the government.
We're looking at home grown terrorists.
- What the hell do you want?
- The name jamal abaza.
Does it mean anything to you?
Abaza was an imam in Cairo.
"He preached Jihad to his followers, but he fell off the grid seven years ago."
"That's because when his son died, he took the Jihad name:"
Jind Allah.
He came to America to recruit sleeper cells.
You're telling us that that detainee in there is Jamal Abaza?
Amazing what you learn when you talk to people.
He was also a prison imam in Virginia three years ago.
Are you familiar with the militant islamic society?
They're home grown?
"We know the cell that abaza put together has access to anthrax, but we can't find any reports of any going missing in the States."
We have protocols that we have to follow.
You really going to allow a terrorist attack on U.S. soil because of protocols?
"I told you what I learned in there because you and I, FBI, CIA, right now we have the ability to break through all the protocol and share information."
Let me see what we have.
Coordinate with agent Jareau and Penelope Garcia at Quantico.
Please.
- Think it'll work?
- I don't know.
CIA's tough.
They play it pretty close to the vest.
"Well, if we don't all work together, more people are gonna die."
A lot more.
- How goes with the CIA?
"- I don't know what Gideon said to them, but they are feeding me information like crazy."
- They sure do generate intelligence.
- Yeah.
It's graphite.
That's why they're not very heavy when you pick 'em up.
- (Stephen) Exactly.
- You might say they're more HB than Pb.
- (Stephen) Yeah!
- (Julia) Oh!
It's time for the final scores.
Let me give them to you.
"Oh, dear."
I'm afraid in fourth place it's Peter with minus five.
- Minus five!
"- (Stephen) Oh, lordy Lord."
In third place it's Rich with three points.
"In second place, Julia with nine, but way out in front it's Alan with 23 quite interesting points."
(applause)
"Well, that about knocks it on the head for QI."
"It only remains for me to thank our four wise monkeys, Rich, Julia, Peter and Alan, and to close with this thoroughly positive and quite interesting thought from yet another great British Alan, the boxer Alan Minter, who reassures us:"
"""Sure, there have been injuries and deaths in boxing, but none of them serious."" Good night."

"Louis I. Kahn, whose strong forms of brick and concrete influenced a generation of architects and made him, in the opinion of most architectural scholars,"
"America's foremost living architect, died Sunday evening apparently of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station."
He was 73 years old.
"Besides his wife, Mr. Kahn leaves a daughter, Sue Ann."
"When I first read that obituary,"
I have to admit I was looking for my own name.
"I was his child too, his only son."
I didn't know my father very well.
"He never married my mother, and he never lived with us."
But I can still remember every detail of the few times we spent a whole day together.
"On this afternoon, we had a picnic."
"He painted with watercolors, and my mother snapped these pictures."
Ina squarehole cut through bedrock?
"CouldJackbe standing on a secret doorway, perhapsonethatleads directly to the Money Pit?"
Does it seem to be solidifying at all?
Are you hitting a bottom or is it just bottomless there?
"I'm standing on something solid, but I-I honestly can't tell until we dig up the rest."
"It's just mud in this top part, and could be anything."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- Keep going, Jack."
"As you look around the sides, does it appear that they're nice and solid anywhere?"
"Well, besides breaking off."
Besides knocking the rock out.
"But no, no large holes or anything that you can see?"
"Yeah, that's solid."
"Yeah, pretty much."
The middle part kind of seems to go further.
It's too muddy to be able to tell if this is the bottom.
"It seems to be narrowing, but at the same time,"
I almost feel like it's slate mixed with mud continuing on.
"I don't know if we want to come back with a different method, 'cause it-- this is, this is gonna be real slow from here on out."
The shape is strange;
"I mean, that's a given."
Everything's strange about it.
It's not natural.
"You know, even taking an excavator in here, it would be difficult because that's been chiseled down through."
"You try and dig right there, an excavator isn't gonna pull that up."
"It might break it up, get underneath of it."
It might.
- Well...
"-You can lose a tooth, too."
"Not only lose a tooth, but if it really is something, do we really want to go that route?"
I honestly think we should have that archaeologist guy
- look at it.
It's war.

What will they think of us?
History... those who study our lives?
"Will we be judged by what we say, by our deeds, by the monuments and images we leave behind... or... by something else?"
Something... we can't control?

They adored you.
"They were stupefied by the Führer cult... so hungry for me, as if I could fill their emptiness."
"By feeding them hope, you stimulated their craving."
Yes... the desire to be the desired object.

Hitler:
"When I was homeless during a cold Vienna winter, a Jewish art dealer gave me an overcoat."
I even had a Jewish friend at the men's shelter with whom I spent many pleasant afternoons.
"Maybe, there would have been an advantage in not exterminating the Jews."
"Well, for a long time, we considered a territorial solution."
"Let me begin by saying that I am glad to see you safe, Count Mazuurek."
"My apologies for causing you to worry, Count Barouhcruz."
"So, what are your plans?"
I have none as yet.
"I have lost my Kataphraktos, as well."
"If you wish to ally yourself with Count Troyard, I can act as intermediary."
I have heard what happened with Count Marylcian.
It must have been most galling.
"No, both sides fought fairly, and that was the result."
There is nothing to hold a grudge over.
"Count Barouhcruz, Troyard is dangerous."
"He not only killed Marylcian, there are even suspicions that he also killed Count Saazbaum-."
It doesn't matter who it is.
I merely...
But you-.
Hold your tongue.
How could you let yourself be misled by such unfounded rumors?
"You heard Princess Asseylum's proclamation, I take it?"
No one can stop Count Troyard's rise.
"Not when he holds all the cards, even Aldnoah activation privileges."
"As they say, ""Do not try to fight an Olympian sandstorm."""
"If you wish to make a comeback, I suggest you choose wisely."
Count Barouhcruz pledges his full and unconditional cooperation.
"Counts Sebring and Raffia have have yet to make their allegiances clear, but they appear to be amenable to acknowledging the new kingdom."

Do you see police behind my back?
"Nothing, dear major lord."
Because you look over there always.

"Look, Tót family"
It enough if the world's single part is behind the man's back always.
For what to increase this trouble with it if somebody looks over there constantly!

Did I say something strange?
Did I not express myself clearly?
"Ow, sure."
"Watch out, that where you are watching,my sweet good Lajos."
- Well where let me be watching?
"- No, no, no.There be watching, where want."
I told you.
"I do not have extra wishes, claims none."
Can I tell you something?
"If a little you would pull your helmet onto your eye then would be all the same, that where the dad is watching."
Congratulations.
Your daughter is clever.

Please consider my request void one.

"Six months ago at that airport, who was it who risked his own life in order to provide us with valuable information?"
"Four months ago, who was it who faced an absurdly powerful enemy machine without any preparation and defeated it?"
"Deep in the mountains of Helmajistan, who was it who recaptured a nuclear warhead that was being smuggled even while his comrades were being killed one by one?"
"Three months ago, who was it who gave his all to protect this ship?"
"Tell me, who was it?"
It was Sergeant Sagara.
Correct.
And yet you're still going to blame him?
You're going to just brand him a coward?
No.
"If you really want me to, I'll admit it."
I love him.
But those personal feelings are irrelevant right now.
I am positive he will return and do his job.
He will not abandon us.
"No matter how hopeless he may seem right now,"
I am sure he will pull himself together again and come back to us.
You can't change a person's basic nature.
"So he will come back, because he is strong and kind!"
Strong and kind?
"Captain, do you think that is enough to convince me?"
"It's not about that, is it?"
What you doubt is my judgment.
Commander Richard Mardukas.
Do you believe in me?
Or do you not?

"Aye, ma'am!"

Perhaps now it's a little pebble.
But a beautiful pebble that would skim really well across a flat surface.
I'll tell you the answer.
"You do get your points though, I think, for knowing that Alan means rock or pebble."
"You'll actually find most of them not in any Celtic country, but on the Russian border, in the northern Caucasus mountains, where the Alan tribe have lived since being driven there by the Huns in the 4th century."

General Konishi is impressive.
"In order to sail clear to Japan, we need the water to be calm."
I'm sure he took that into consideration as well.
Yes...
But So...
Yi Soon-shin is likely to have figured all of this out the moment he saw Yoshira's messenger craft getting away.
General...
There is nothing Yi Soon-shin does not know about naval warfare.
His knowledge is almost supernatural.
So he will place his men at the best location and wait for us to sail right into his trap.
Where do you think that location is?
"Noryang Channel, sir?"
But will Wakizaka come through Noryang?
He fell into similar traps twice in Hansando and Myongryang and suffered crushing defeat both times.
He probably learned his lesson by now.
"If he has any brains, he will avoid Noryang."
That's why we will have to make him come.
How?
We can't hit him in the head and make him stupid...
All we have to do is abandon Noryang.
Pardon?
Avoid Noryang and go around Mijo to the open sea?
"But sir, the open sea is very rough and dangerous."
Unless we're prepared for some losses...
"If we go through Noryang, we could lose the entire fleet."
That's the painful lesson I learned in Myongryang.
We will go around Mijo as close to the shore as possible and strike

"two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two..."
The end of the house party marks the climax of the guests' romantic hopes for the season.
"one, two, three, join hands and one..."
Miss Hopkins is playing a dangerous game.
"Having opted for Mr. Everett, she's switched her allegiance overnight to Mr. Carrington, to the dismay of her chaperone."
But Lady Devonport has a problem of her own.
And walk.
"Over the summer, she's conducted a dangerous liaison with Mr. Foxsmith."
"You are very, very, very handsome."
"Fashionable Regency society turned a blind eye to relationships between young men and older, married women so long as they were discreet."
"Ah, Lady Devonport."
"Marriage, however, was out of the question."
"Now that Lady Devonport and Mr. Foxsmith are about to leave the Regency, they must face the future."
Just who will go through the maze in couples has yet to be agreed.
Mr. Everett has asked the chaperones to settle the competing claims of head and heart and help resolve the final partnerships.
They will interview each of the men.
"Right, let's give them hell, girls."
Absolutely.
"First up, the most eligible man in the house,"
Is there a lady in the house who you like more than the others?
Yes.
Uh... one of the maids.
"Well, right, which maid is it, sir?"
"Forgive us, but we have collected the impression that you and the countess were on warmly affectionate terms."
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
"""Perhaps."""
You're sitting on the fence.
"What does ""perhaps"" mean?"
Whatever you'd like it to mean.
Where?
"Well, nobody knows where or when."
"However, an Egyptian pharaoh..."
-Shishak.
-Yes.
"...invaded the city of Jerusalem right about 980 BC, and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls."
Secret chamber?
"However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year."
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
Uh-huh.
"Obviously, we've come to the right men."
"Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then."
"No, no, not really."
Ravenwood is the real expert.
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.
Collected some of its relics.
"It was his obsession, really."
But he never found the city.
"Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood."
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
"Oh, rubbish."
Ravenwood's no Nazi.
"Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?"
"Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it."
What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?
"Well, the staff is just a stick.."
"I don't know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high.."
"and it's... it's, uh..."
"it's capped with an elaborate headpiece... in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center."
And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis..
"a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor- and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls."
"Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?"
The Government needed to look inside its subjects' heads.
"An oath was framed requiring all citizens to reject the United Societies, but there were questions, too."
"Could the subject say, ""God save the King""?"
No-one from the United Societies could say that of Charles II.
Not when God was listening.
And God was always listening.
"john Graham of Claverhouse, fast becoming the Government's enforcer of choice, was sent into the south west, armed with the oath."
The oath could be administered on the spot and failure to take it was punishable by instant death.
These months would be remembered as the Killing Times.
It wasn't the numbers that made the Killing Times notorious.
The numbers weren't great.
It was the summary nature of the executions.
No courts.
No appeals.
Just a bullet in the head.
A little over 90 deaths in a little less than a year.
"The killings began in December and provided an unpleasant baptism for the beginning of a new and inauspicious reign, the reign of James VII and II."
"In February 7685, Charles I!"
died of a stroke.
James's succession was unopposed.
The Stuart dynasty seemed unassailable.
Now there were two powerful Catholic monarchs for Europe's Protestants to contend with.
"In France, Louis XIV."
"In Britain, James VII and II."
"For William of Orange, the Calvinist Prince of the Dutch Republic, the prospect of a Catholic alliance between Louis XIV and James was too frightening for words."
"He had been fighting the French off and on for years, and he was a Stuart, or very nearly."
He was James's nephew and son-in-law.
"In short, he had a claim to James's crowns."
James set about providing William of Orange with ammunition.
"He decreed that Catholics could not only worship, but hold office."
He was his father's son.
Parliament was not consulted.
This is still my place.
Don't forget it!
Did you just come back here to make trouble?
"-You heard about mom, didn't you?"
-Yeah.
Heard about her.
"Hey, Joey, here's a quarter."
"Run along now, huh?"
"Come on, pick it up."
"-Pick it up, Joey!"
"-Lucas, you leave him alone."
"Honey, don't start a fight."
"Me and you, we got to know each other a little too well for that."
"Say, I didn't think you could improve, but you sure have."
"Oh, it ain't like I was your real pa, you know?"
-You dirty filthy animal!
"-Still a little wildcat, ain't you?"
As we worship together this Easter morning... and more of we pray to Him who died and rose again... that we might have life and have it more abundantly... let us remember especially... those who have gone from this country and this town... to live and die in far old places for a like purpose.
"May they know His mercy, His comfort and His peace."
"May we uphold them with our prayers... encourage them with our letters... honor them with our love, and may our lives... not less than theirs, be dedicated to that same Lord... who alone can give to life a perfect freedom and a final peace."
Let us pray.
"Our Father, who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy name"
Thy kingdom come Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our debts As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thy is the kingdom And the power
"And the glory, forever"
Amen.
-Thank you.
I think...
"I think that, um..."
"So that makes it you're the second-most important person in the house now, doesn't it?"
Does that mean I get wine slightly quicker or I can go horse riding whenever I want or...
I'm not sure.
Perhaps we could redecorate your bedroom in honor...
I like it the way it is.
Perhaps you could give me yours.
No chance.
So we'll just keep that under our hats until...
"Wait till you get it and then, uh..."
Yeah.
"Glover's fortune of £50,000 would be the equivalent"
"You can buy me a bottle of champagne, dear boy."
Yeah.
Well done.
"After the defeat of Napoleon, the arrival of the daily newspaper... always a big event in a country house... brought home the terrible carnage of the war."
"Look, here's the wounded."
"""Lieutenant General, the Earl of Uxbridge, severely wounded,"
"Major General Cookson, severely, left arm amputated."""
Fancy being at home and reading that.
"You know, being a member of the family or something and just getting that."
"Amazing losses, yes."
In the upper section of society there would be in the next generation
Also pathetically concerned about the horses.
"Oh, terrible."
Terrible carnage.
"And the regimental farrier would cut off the right foreleg of every horse, the hoof, which was marked with its army number, so they could tot up what your equine casualties were your regiment was entitled to..."
the remounts.
And some people kept their hooves and you have them for inkwells...
"Yes, inkwells, yes, yes."
You get them in antique shops.
James should have listened to it.
It was a prophecy.
"Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top"
"When the wind blows, the cradle will rock"
"When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall"
"Down will come baby, cradle and all."
The roots of his power as a Catholic king were far from deep.
They had grown upon stony Protestant ground.
William of Orange had begun preparing an invasion fleet two months before the child was born.
The fleet was ready by the first week of October.
"With sailors and others included, William's force totalled some 70,000."
"Clearly, he had no intention of doing this twice."
The army landed in Devon in the first week of November.
"And almost at once, James's support began mysteriously to wither away."
"Because in the end, Stuart or not, son of the headless king or not, he was a Catholic."
"On the night of 9th December, the Queen and the King's young heir fled to France."
James VII and II followed on the 23rd.
He hadn't abdicated.
But everybody decided to behave as though he had.
"They decided, too, that this wasn't an invasion."
This would be the Glorious Revolution.
They had invited William of Orange.
Do come and take a kingdom!
Dress - military.
RSVP.
"In May of 1689, William of Orange and his wife Mary accepted a joint monarchy of England, Scotland and Ireland."
A monarchy with strings attached.
"The Crown could no longer suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army in peacetime without Parliament's permission."
"Here, at last, was the new world, 50 years after the Covenanters had first asked for it."
50 years after Charles I had said no.
"In England, the Stuarts were kings no longer, with hardly a shot fired."
The Glorious Revolution would acquire another adjective.
"This house has seen many champions, Oenomaus, and yet you stand tallest among them."
"I have not the words, Dominus."
"Those who do, tend to weave them to undeserved advantage."
Where do we stand upon the rankings?
Eight men have yet to hold victory.
And one suffers grievous injury.
It pains to lose Dagan.
The Syrian had shown much promise.
More so than Ashur.
Yet Dagan is now blind to attack from the right.
A disadvantage in the arena.
"Well, let us shift from the unfortunate to the blessed."
Who holds the pinnacle?
Two men own equal victory.
Crixus and Gannicus.
They are to face each other in the final contest.
Gannicus is removed from contention.
I have sent word to Tullius agreeing to terms of sale.
Sale to Tullius?
"Well, he makes offer."
"I had thoughts towards refusal, but they have dimmed."
I would speak towards reigniting them.
"Strong words, Oenomaus."
Quintus has plied me with many upon the subject.
"He inflates Gannicus' worth, at great cost to this house."
"Apologies, but in this your son and I are in agreement."
None stand more worthy to hold the title of champion.
You allow personal relation to cloud judgement.
"True, Gannicus is trusted friend."
"Yet I speak from position of Doctore, one, but a moment ago, you sought to praise."
"If I pull acceptance to Tullius, we will be excluded from future games."
We would be forced to beg for matches in the lesser venues of Nola or Neapolis.
"Ultimately, they are reliant upon my investment, but they do tend to forget this from time to time."
They get emotional...
but then everyone gets emotional when they feel they may lose their position.
"But as Mr Trump says, it's not personal, it's business."
Now I am going to have a little word with Miss Carvell.
I have some ideas for her column.
See what an education you're getting here.
How to run things from the top.
Are you learning things?
Good.
"Yes, I did meet with Mr Diamonds, Michelangelo, although, quite frankly, it is none of your business."
"I'm absolutely fine, thank you."
Hmm.
"Now listen up, Michelangelo."
"See, I have observed that you have been speaking to the exact same people I've been speaking to."
Sometimes ahead of me.
"Maybe you have a fascination with this fashion universe and you is trying to make a reputation, reputation, reputation with this little camera."
"Or maybe, as beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold, you is stealing the truth out of their mouths, and by the time they get to me, they is all talked out!"
So... just what exactly have they been saying to you?
Anything you want to pass on brother to brother?
"Hello, Michelangelo."
How are you?
"I have good news, Michelangelo."
My photograph was in a magazine for celebrities.
My face.
"Actually, it was an action shot, falling."
So...
"And, also, Otto is phoning me."
He is telling me that a big producer is phoning him to offer me a very good role in a commercial.
"It's for the bad guy, actually."
The villain.
"The killer, actually."
"So, that was the measure of success in our family."
What sort of stuff was he doing to invoke that much rage from people?
He was...attacking the regime.
He was a satirist and he attacked the Khomeini regime?
"Khomeini's regime, yes."
And after that assassination attempt...
"I mean, it wrecked our peace of mind, because that's what terrorists do."
Killing you is the tip of the iceberg.
What did they try to do?
They tried to blow his car up.
Wow.
Yeah.
Was there an explosion?
"No, there wasn't, because Scotland Yard got wind of the plot and they said, ""OK, you have to go to Windsor."
"""We've got a safe house for you."""
"So, they took us away, and this was the era of Spitting Image, and my dad had an Ayatollah Khomeini Spitting Image mask, and as the police were gently telling us kids what was going on,"
"my dad came in with the Khomeini mask and a black robe, going, ""Argh!"
"I kill you!"""
It was really traumatic.
"So, um, they told..."
Do you think he really grasped the seriousness of the situation?
LAUGHTER
"No, I think my dad was like, ""Hey, he knows me personally."
"I'm so famous."""
"Because the trial of my father's would-be assassins was held in The Hague and I got transcripts of the trials, and my dad's death order was signed by the Ayatollah Khomeini himself, and on it was written, ""The writer Hadi Khorsandi is to be shot"
"""as he takes his children to school."
"""Neither of the children are to be harmed."""
"And I thought, ""That's so cute, right?"""
"Cos I'd written a letter to the Ayatollah and I said,"
"""We're getting death threats,"
"""but you need to know my dad makes up jokes about everybody - even me."""
"So, when you're ten years old or something like that?"
- And what?
Nothing.
Great.
"Make way, please."
This is the scene at my sister's wedding.
"There she is getting drunk, regretting she ever got married for the third time, mind you."
"My mother is so jealous, she's sprouting snakes from her hair."
"And I'm thinking, ""This is perfect."""
"We've got three feminine archetypes, the divine whore, Medusa and me."
Who am I?
What archetype?
Trevor.
- The Virgin Mary?
"- Thanks a lot, Trevor."
"No, the faithful handmaiden."
"Always the bridesmaid, never the bride."
"It does prove, however, what Jung said all along, that myths and archetypes are alive, and well and living in my apartment."
"As I stood at the altar beside my sister and her husband-to-be, it struck me that this ritual called a wedding ceremony is really just the last scene of a fairy tale."
They never tell you what happens after.
They never tell you that Cinderella drove the prince crazy with her obsessive need to clean the castle.
"But she missed her day job, right?"
"No, they don't tell us what happens after, because there is no after."
The be-all and the end-all of romantic love was...
Mike?
- Sex?
"- Sex on the brain, Mike."
Marriage.
"Marriage, that's right."
But it wasn't always like that.
"Around the 12th century, there was a notion known as ""courtly love,"""
where love had nothing to do with marriage and nothing to do with sex.
"In most cases, it was defined as a passionate relationship between a knight and a lady of the court, who was already married."
"Do you know what, Steve?"
This is all a bit too late.
"You should have told me the truth, given me the chance to work with you on this."
That's what partners do.
"For the tape, image 313 is a photograph of item reference NTW-7."
Said item is a rope found hanging from an overhead support.
Detective Inspector Cottan has given us a statement where you attempted to overpower him with the intent of causing death by hanging.
The exact same means as PC Rod Kennedy.
I didn't murder Rod and I absolutely didn't attempt to murder DI Cottan.
"In fact, DI Cottan set me up."
He set you up?
!
"Yeah, Cottan smashed himself in the face to make it look like I hit him but I didn't."
"As far as the rope goes, he must have planted it there beforehand."
- He'll say anything to save his own skin.
- Yeah.
"And why would an officer of mine do such a thing, eh?"
To frame me for Rod's murder.
Do you have anything to support these claims against DI Cottan?
"I mean, anything at all?"
"For the tape, the interviewee is offering no supporting evidence."
Moving on.
DS Arnott.
"For the tape, image 291, item reference MR-3 and image 292, item reference MR-4."
MR-3 and 4 are mobile phones.
A Section 18 search of your property recovered a pair of unregistered pay-as-you-go phones concealed in the garage.
"Document 16, analysis of activity on these phones reveals they made and received calls within the telecommunications cell that covers your home address."
"Three nights before the murder of Danny Waldron, a call was received by one of these phones."
Who called you?
No comment.
Document 16 again.
The night before Danny Waldron's murder.
Raina's not great at being on time.
"Well, actually, Raina's not gonna be joining us today."
"We've been doing some digging, Ms. Lundquist."
It turns out your work at the Animal Salvation Fund is completely pro Bono.
Your day job is contract law at Mather and Kline.
"According to this, your current assignment is to secure port locations along the Northwest Passage for a company called Newhall Transocean."
"Now, if you manage to succeed, you're in line to make partner."
GREGSON:
A partner at a white-shoe firm like Mather and Kline makes millions of dollars a year.
WATSON:
"But securing the ports hasn't been easy, has it?"
"The locals are poor, and they're attached to their traditions."
So you volunteered your legal services to an animal rights group here in New York and managed to convince them to pursue a ban on seal hunting.
GREGSON:
Ban like that would've wrecked the locals' traditional way of life.
They would've been forced to either relocate or seek new income.
You were hoping that they'd fold and agree to Newhall's port deal.
WATSON:
But Tendu Otolik's Sealfies turned public opinion against the ban.
"So, when you switched to Plan B and tried to buy the village outright, he stopped that, too."
He sent money home in exchange for a promise from the village elders to never agree to Newhall's port.
No way were you gonna make partner after that.
Not unless you could make Tendu go away.
"Which brings us to your fixer, Kurt Godwyn."
"No, no, you see..."
Save it.
We've already got a full confession from Mr. Godwyn.
You might want to call your firm.
You're gonna need a good lawyer.
Hey.
Hey.
I wanted you to know that boy Lucien won't be bothering you no more.
"Okay, Mimi."
Thanks for your cooperation.
Sit tight.
"Mimi, the clothes maestro wears when he conducts... they were dipped in coke too?"
He decides.
His decision.
Her mother said she was about to be made first violin.
"Yeah, made by the maestro."
"When I last looked, subscriptions were up this year."
"Absolutely, but there are other considerations."
Not because we've hired some new carpenter.
But because of me.
I choose the material.
I shape the performances.
They come because of me.
"Without me, this would be meaningless screeching."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you now to observe a minute of silence in memory of a beloved member of our family, violinist Laura Booth, who died tragically this past weekend."
"No one disputes your talent, Philip."
But the unions have presented us with three more grievances...
Stop wasting my time!
"Philip, wait, the minute of silence isn't..."
Philip Reinhardt's jacket had been dipped in cocaine.
"If Laura struggled with him on the roof, that's how the cocaine residue got on her hands."
"Anybody see the maestro with Laura, or see him going up to the roof?"
Everybody was too busy getting loaded.
"This place, the backstage should be onstage."
They'd sell more tickets.
Reinhardt was promoting her to first violin.
Hardly sounds like a prelude to murder.
"We think he might have changed his mind, and she might have decided to fight back."
We found a musician's union handbook in her bag.
"It seemed unusual that she'd carry it around, so we had latent check it out."
No!
She's only addicted to painkillers.
Remember her breast exploded?
You know?
I do think they're the most creative.
Who else would've paid me to scout that active volcano and...
- and keep the diary of it?
- And that burger salt layer...
- was genius!
- True.
"Gwyneth, you like them because you have been in every issue..."
- for the past three years.
- Excuse me!
I like them because they're innovators.
"- You'd better watch your back, Jack!"
- I'm not worried...
I've got someone on the inside.
- You crocodile!
"- You know me, girl!"
"As you all know, our Editor Chief's husband is suffering... from testicular cancer."
"Once again, Skirt Magazine will host this year's carnival and ball..."
"""Save our balls"" ball."
We'll have booze there and I need all of you to sign up.
The clipboard will now circulate.
We have some very serious issues to get down to.
"As you know, Vogue magazine ran... a canteen chic feature, and that means... we still have an info trader in the midst of our operation."
It was dreadful enough when they copied that year moth explosions... on terrific towing spreads but now this?
I abhor Nina Zamoi.
I abhor that whore.
I wish the most evil thing in the world would happen to her.
"I wish that... an anti-fur activist marched into the ""Four Seasons""... and dropped a bloody dead raccoon carcass... onto her freezing salad, Spiring the balzabic and blood... all over her Valentino contourship..."
- Easy.
After that your thermal protection will increase by 1% per hour of exposure.
"So, do we have four days, before we make ourselves palettes?"
"You will not need much, son."
"- One question, General."
"- What is it, Kix?"
What range is recommended for some after freezing.
Can I calm him down?
And bury him in the snow?
It has more deaths than you have wet dreams.
They are in perfectly capable hands.
"But that's a long time ago, General."
Before qVapor has fried his gray matter.
Commander Bishop  you have the floor.
Weapon systems  what we have?
Each stay in the team art piece in the man
"Sources of energy, sonar grenades, radon guns."
Enough firepower for everyone to melt ice cubes in the death zone...
"Know the magnetic field, That the meteor has caused."
Why did we ever put electronic weapons there anyway?
Intelligence has new information about the magnetic field in the death zone.
Their wrist weapons have been modified and operate within the death zone.
I'd like to order five carabinier rifles.
"3,000 cartridges of ammunition"
And 50 thermal grenades.
"For backup, sir."
"I like the sound, Commander."
said it used to be one of the hottest deserts on earth...
"But 500 miles of radio alive this tundra became ""Death Zone 714""."
I guess hell finally froze.
"Again, search for the needle in the haystack."
You just have to love it.
I do not understand that.
Name your price.
Your leather jacket.
"Oh, thank God-- a ""D."""
-What?
"-Oh, no, no,"
I'd rather bet a zillion billion dollars.
"Look, if she's not at my house after school,"
I'll be your slave for life.
"These are excellent terms, Brad."
You're toast.
"Oh, no."
"He got an ""F""."
Your understanding of the female reproductive cycle is simply not satisfactory.
I'm giving you a second chance by assigning an oral presentation.
Oral-- as in from the mouth?
That's exactly right.
"An oral presentation on the material with footnotes and visual aids, due by the end of the week."
What kind of visual aids?
"Well, Suzanne, trash day in the red light district took on new meaning today as one unlucky local resident made a grisly discovery."
He found sitting innocently among the trash cans at the curb the dead body of an unidentified white male.
"The body, when examined by paramedics, showed signs of what police are calling ritualistic mutilation."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
...or release the name of the victim.
But speculation on the street is that the killing was related to drug running and prostitution.
Millionaire importer and reputed mob boss Jerry the Pope denied allegations that moneys from local prostitution operations were being funneled through his corporation.
Hello.
"Betty, it's V."
I'm just watching the news.
What happened?
Um...
"Cash stole from Waltzer, so Waltzer cut his heart out."
It's for the country and the people.
"And also, there isn't any evidence."
"People who believe in democracy are ignorant, who does not know that."
"They rack their brain to prevent insincere people to come into power, like me and my party."
But why did you provoke me?
"Even though the objective is a good one,"
It's still not right if the chosen method is wrong!
"The moment I fall will mark the end, the death of democracy in the Republic of South Korea."
Sea fishing is the latest method for money making.
The dates were deleted from the registers and I couldn't find any record.
You are really ambitious!
Do you no longer want to be the chief prosecutor?
Don't you want to do it anymore?
Your personality is not suitable for being a prosecutor.
I've been your fathers' best friend for 40 years.
I'm ashamed that you're my father's friend.
What?
Do you really think your father is a saint?
You... who are you?
"Bodyguards, bodyguards!"
Dad.
I'm hoping to become a President's bodyguard like you were.
"In the future it surely will happen, right?"
"I will do well, right?"
I just know that father would say something like that.
"Mom, the rest I don't know, but I'll surely apply BB Cream and lip balm, so don't worry."
Good night.

So you did three tours in Afghanistan and you were wounded in the Kunar province.
"- Yes, ma'am."
- You received a Silver Star for pulling a Corporal Dawson from a burning Humvee?
There was an IED attack.
"Humvee flipped, we were taking fire, so I grabbed him."
- Why?
- I was a little concerned that he was getting a little too warm in there.
"It's funny to me, you still think glib is the way to go here."
Corporal Dawson is the nephew of the speaker of the house and when you were discharged a year ago he got you a job with the Capitol Police.
"Actually, on his protection detail."
If Special Agent Todd keeps making those sounds I'm gonna start looking at him.
"- Will you give us a second, please, Ryan?"
"John, why do you want to be in the Secret Service?"
I can't think of a more important job than protecting the president.
"Okay, this job requires a university degree."
You dropped out of GW after our first semester there.
- You don't finish things.
"- Check the file, Carol."
Two years in college night school.
A certificate of graduation should be in there.
Great.
"Yeah, John, you barely maintained a C average."
"I'm sorry, I didn't have our little study sessions like we used to back in the day, did I?"
Evaluations from your senior officers:
"""Cale frequently does not complete his field reports on time."""
Nothing to do with protecting someone.
"""Sergeant Cale demonstrates a lack of respect for authority."
"Sergeant Cale has raw potential but seems determined not to realise it."""
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.
I'm not the kid you used to know in college.
I've buttoned up every single thing that I have to to qualify for this job.
"Well, no, not actually."
It would've been the same with anybody.
"See, she just wasn't letting Merle meet any men."
Objection.
The witness is stating an opinion.
"Your Honor, I believe the proper groundwork can be laid to make the witness' last answer admissible."
"Very well, Mr. Burger."
Proceed.
"Mr. Pierce, how long have you known the defendant?"
- A few weeks.
- And how did you meet her?
"I can't recall the exact circumstances, but it was an accident."
Danny!
"- You mustn't interrupt, Merle."
- But he remembers how we met.
- He must.
- Tell me later.
"What do you mean by accident, Mr. Pierce?"
The watchdog went to sleep on the job-- Mrs. Langley's chauffeur.
"Whenever Merle did get out of that house, he was always sent along."
Really?
How did you manage to carry on your courtship?
"Well, it wasn't easy."
We met in tearooms.
[spectators chuckle]
"Mr. Pierce, the very fact that the defendant continued to see you under these circumstances was a form of rebellion against such strict supervision, wasn't it?"
"Why, then, since the defendant became legally of age on her recent birthday, did you find it necessary to plan an elopement?"
That didn't really mean anything.
"You see, Merle was sort of like a zombie as far as her aunt was concerned, and she had to get fighting mad before she'd stand up to her."
- Objection.
- Sustained.
The witness will refrain from giving opinions.
"In 1 828, Walter Scott pulled all the strands of myth and hearsay together and gave the Bruce an encouraging spider for comfort, but it was just a story."
Where he fled to precisely is not known.
Ardnamurchan is the current favourite.
"But wherever he went, Sir Walter was right about one thing, that Bruce had a decision to make, whether to give up or go on."
He had connections.
One of his sisters was the Queen of Norway.
He could have hidden there.
"But that would have left his wife, his other sisters, his daughter and all his bishops in captivity."
"It would have left his supporters, his friends and his brother dead and unprayed for, in purgatory, or worse."
What sort of choice was that?
He chose to fight on.
"He gathered a force of Irishmen and Hebrideans, and landed secretly at Turnberry in Ayrshire, towards the end of February in 1 307."
"By the beginning of March, two more of his brothers were dead at English hands."
The price of Robert's throne was rising.
"He took his forces, his anger, and his grief into the broken lands of south-west Scotland."
He wasn't hiding.
He was learning how to fight.
He had no more than a few hundred men.
Hardly any knights.
"He only had spearmen, foot soldiers, and no intention whatsoever of following Wallace to an early grave."
So he could only wait until the English were wherehe wanted them to be... and then surprise them.
"In April, Robert and a force of 300 men surprised an English force of 1 ,500 here beside Loch Trool in Galloway."
It was an unpleasant surprise.
There was no room for cavalry to manoeuvre and nothing for the English to do except trip each other up and die.
So they ran away.
So this was victory.
The Bruce enjoyed the taste.
But was it a fluke?
A one-off?
It might be.
"By May, Robert was in Ayrshire."
The land was full of the level playing fields that knights adored.
CAM:
McKinney served with Aldo and those men trust each other with their lives.
How could he just watch Aldo get taken and not try to help?
"I don't know, but Booth believes he's telling the truth."
Did McKinney see anything that we can use?
Nothing specific.
"No plate numbers, no physical characteristics."
"But he did say that it was clean, precise, perfectly executed."
Perhaps someone else with military training.
"Well, which means it's possible one of the other men in his unit is responsible."
You think?
"Well... they carry anger, they are taught to kill."
"There are many recountings, starting with ancient Greeks, of returning warriors murdering those they are closest to."
WARREN:
Dr. Brennan?
"What is it, Ms. Warren?"
There's something you really need to see.
I re-examined the impact fractures on the left eighth and ninth ribs.
How did your perception of the fractures change?
It didn't.
They're exactly the same.
"But, look at these rat bites on the anterior plane of the affected sternal ribs."
They are deeper and closer together than the other rat bites which you've catalogued.
That's what I thought.
BRENNAN:
They appear to be both peri and antemortem.
Did you run an immunohistochemical test?
I did.
It came back positive for fibrin clots and new bone deposition.
There is only one very likely interpretation.
What do you think that is?
That the victim was alive while the rats were eating his torso.
I know it's true.
That's the problem.
Can I have some more?
You are here today because science is on the cusp of a startling discovery-- a discovery about how and why we are attracted to one another.
It appears that human beings emit certain chemicals.
"Now, these chemicals-- pheromones, they're called-- work to attract us to one another."
"Pheromones don't smell, and yet we believe that they're detected through the nose, sensed, if you will."
"And these pheromones travel from one person to the next, sending secret messages of sorts, directly into our brains to grab our sexual attention-- a raw sexual attractant, pure animal magnetism."
"Uh, I need some invoices signed, but the doc isn't in yet."
"So, how you doing?"
Fine.
How's Dan Logan doing?
Fine.
I think.
"Can I say something, uh, you know, honestly, but also in confidence?"
Of course.
"I think the doc is a little worried about Mr. Logan, about the, uh-- the effect that he's-- well, he's having on you."
I'm sorry.
"- Uh, the effect?"
"- But, actually,"
"I'm a little bit more worried about the doc, to be honest."
I-I think he's a little...
undone by Mr. Logan's presence.
"So, Bill sent you to... pump me for information?"
He asked me to inquire.
But the only reason I'm even doing that is 'cause...
"I came a long way to get to that desk chair out there, and I have no interest in watching this whole operation blow."
Nothing is going to blow.
Betty.
Tell Bill that-- that we spoke and that I reassured you that everything is fine.
Mr. Logan and I are simply moving on to the next stage of the scent research.
"Which is true, Betty."
I´ve had a very difficult time since my wife passed away.
"If I told anyone I was using drugs to develop a case, they would have misinterpreted it."
I couldn´t afford that risk.
"Yeah, well, that´s what they´re gonna do now."
"Rae, let´s put down that Jack started using heroin in late January, after the first meeting with Salazar was established."
"I appreciate what you´re trying to do, but that´s not what happened."
Just trying to save us all some paperwork.
- l´m OK with that.
- l´m not.
I started using in December.
I´ve got nothing to hide.
This office demands results and that´s what I provide - results.
- Fine.
- Can I get back to work?
"Not quite yet, Jack."
(speaks Russian)
Dost thou love me?
I know thou wilt say 'Ay'... and I will take thy word.
Yet if thou swear'st thou may prove false.
"At lovers' perjuries, they say, Jove laughs."
O gentle Romeo...

"Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse... and say thee nay, so thou wilt woo..."
"Shakespeare doesn't write many prologues... but he does here in ""Romeo and Juliet""."
"The fearful passage of their ""death-marked-love""."
"Those syllables are very, very strongly accented in that line."
We know that the play is heading for the tomb... but then we all are.
"So there is a kind of quintessential, archetypal... intensity about the play that I think makes popular."
It's accessible.
It's night.
Lovers thoughts are filled with wild imaginings.
"The encounter of Romeo and Juliet at Juliet's balcony... is a transforming experience, a revelation... that most of us experience perhaps only once, or twice, in our lives."
Inspector Frost feels he's being treated properly.
I expect your investigation to be conducted by the book.
"And you can rest assured,"
I know that book very well indeed.
"In the middle of a current murder investigation,."
you spent four hours yesterday
looking for files on Harriet Barr and Michael King.
A case that was wound up ten years ago.
"Yes, well, when I've got something on my mind,"
I deal with it.
Harriet Barr's death was on my mind.
"So having found the files, you then went to see ex-Chief Superintendent Fairclough."
"Yes, because I found a statement that contradicted evidence from a main witnesses against Michael King."
Do you know why this piece of evidence didn't reach the courtroom?
No.
"Well, you say it wasn't in the file that went to the DPP, but in another file, where it had apparently sat, quite undisturbed, for nearly ten years."
Yes.
"But, when I entered your office"
Steven Mitchell's statement was on your desk.
"As I told you, I found it in an envelope that was hidden in the back of the file."
I spoke to Mitchell this morning.
"Yes, I'd have done the same thing myself."
At Chief Superintendent Fairclough's suggestion?
What?
Mr. Mitchell remembers all this very well.
He remembers coming forward to make his statement.
He also remembers being told he wouldn't be required to give evidence.
"When he queried this, he was told to forget he saw Michael King on the night of Harriet Barr's murder."
Unless he wanted to go down for a couple of years too.
And who told him that?
Inspector Pearson.
"Oh Come on, there's a bandwagon rolling here, isn't there."
Like what normal people talk about.
"- Not really my strong suit, Katherine."
- I'll start.
How do you know I dropped out of college?
"Oh, that was just a lucky guess."
Grabbed my file or something?
- You fit a profile.
- Of what?
"Civilian broadcasters have a certain, you know, personality trait."
Keep working.
"Well, I can't work in silence, so you might as well just entertain me."
Okay.
A troubled childhood with an emphasis on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.
Death of a parent.
Sometimes sexual abuse.
Lack of a strong authority figure in adolescence.
Low self-esteem resulting in few permanent relationships.
Defensive.
Rebellious.
Highly intelligent.
"Susceptible to being stuck in one position, environment or occupation for long periods of time."
"Yeah, you're terrible at this."
How about your profile?
Indifferent and emotionally detached from reality.
Inability to communicate with any other human being on the face of this Earth.
Willing to sit silently in one place for hours at a time.
Make sure that you have a plan to kill every person that you ever meet.
No.
Close.
"No, I had a stable childhood but with an underlying desire to break free from control or authority."
Restless.
Sense of self-entitlement.
A 12!
"Well, I would like the opportunity to get to know him better, but at the moment he's an 8½."
Hi.
The arrival of an attractive gentleman is a sharp reminder the main objective of a house party...
bagging a husband.
How are you?
That was some welcome you got.
Kind of romance issue is not being addressed.
We don't really have that much opportunity
"Firstly, I think we... kind of girls came in here and said,"
"""You know, if it doesn't happen naturally,"
"And the chaperones are saying, ""How on earth can we control,"
"""you know, kind of strong, independent, successful women?"
"They're not going do as we tell them to do."""
Then we'll have a jolly good time.
"We are going to have a very good time, actually."
We're having a good time;
we'll have an even better time now.
The chaperones should really be encouraged to do a lot more chaperoning and a lot more orchestrating meetings with their charges and... and the gentlemen.
Do you...
"Can I just ask, do you mean... do you mean orchestrating chaperoned time or orchestrating unchaperoned time?"
"Well, I think..."
I think what should happen is that we can go out with the chaperone...
"with the man... and the chaperone could, um... yeah, exactly, like, ""sprain the ankle."""
It's from the ladies.
"Oh, yes?"
"""The dandy will be entertaining the chaperones from 3:00 p.m.,"
"""therefore leaving the ladies unsupervised."
"""Fancy meeting up for a few cheeky lemonades?"
"""Please reply ASAP to Miss Hopkins"
"""should you choose to accept our invitation."
"Fondest regards, the girls."""
Lighter.
- Good.
"Be warned, you may experience unusually vivid dreams as a side effect of the medication."
- All right.
- You get some rest.
We'll begin our first session tomorrow.
Drink.
Please describe your... affliction.
"- Ever since my parents' accident, their passing I've had anxiety..."
- Mm-hmm.
...insomnia.
Uh... my doctor thinks...
- Dr. Torrington.
"- Yes, sir."
"He feels that my afflictions were not mere products of my grief, but manifestations of more latent maladies."
This is why he felt I would benefit from your care.
- And which latent maladies did he identify?
"- I have often been called wilful, overly curious."
I'm told that my flights of fancy are not becoming of a lady.
"These character flaws, he believes have evolved into my current difficulties."
- And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?
- My brother has always said that...
- I don't care what your brother thinks.
What do you think?
- I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.
I do.
But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.
And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?
"I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just..."
"- There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel."
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
Othello is a play of everyday life... but it is a play that goes further than that.
"It's a thriller, a play with certain circumstantial evidence in it... something being unpicked and uncovered."
But it has also got frightening depth about human motivation... and extraordinary language that no one can quite explain... it's resonant and it's persuasive... and some of it is very beautiful.
Tis destiny unshunable... like death.
Even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken.
If she be false... oh then heaven mocks itself.
I'll not believe it.
Hey!
This way!
Hey!
no!
are you ok?
!
What's wrong?
Look!
It's...
What's happening?
This is a message plate.
It is a warning from a super-advanced civilization that came before us whose scientific knowledge surpassed even the most advanced technology of today.

If you keep falling asleep during class after coming back from a long absence you're going to end up our junior.
He was getting a BJ in the car.
Had his dong out and his pants down.
A concierge saw the girl leave after the shooting.
She see anything else?
"Ask Homicide, it's their baby."
Can I see the telex?
Boulanger.
"I got several, which do you want?"
Robert.
"Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger, aka Bob."
Horn: armed robbery record.
"Wanted for theft, armed robbery, extortion and attempted murder."
"Weapons freak, ex-mercenary, trained in Syria, a real psycho."
"Boulanger broke from jail 2 years ago, killing a guard and an officer."
Seems Horn sprung Boulanger to have him on his team.
"I have no other names, but they operate from here, a squat beside a warehouse by the beltway."
"First, we find lookouts and set up surveillance teams."
Smao and Titi will be in the silo overlooking the squat.
You photograph everyone coming and going.
"You identify all vehicles, and any lowlifes in the area."
"Second, we cordon off the area, block escape routes, one team per street in a perimeter of half a mile within the area."
"Third, we advise the local police we'll be playing on their turf for a few days, and to lie low on the day we make the grab."
"No neighborhood investigations or questioning, we avoid concierges, storekeepers, local hangouts."
"Klein, OCU."
"You don't know me, I know you."
"No waves: we settle in, watch and wait."
Know what they'll hit?
No.
We can't lose them.
Let's go.
Wear bulletproof vests over your T-shirts.
"We have a common friend, a friend who just died."
"Eighty-nine, eighty-seven, eighty-six, eighty-four, eighty-three, eighty-two, eighty-one, eighty."
Name as many vegetable as you can.
"Bean sprouts, cabbage, eggplant, cucumbers, squash, potatoes..."
Cab...bage...
"Chives, peppers... chwinamul*."
(*Korean leaf vegetable)
"All right, remember these items and please repeat them."
What items are under here?
"Pen, glasses, watch, coin..."
Coin... this...
It's what people give each other when they first meet.
Your name and contact number.
Business card.
"You're right, it's a business card."
"You're tired, right?"
Yes... no.
[Cabbage]
"Snowman, bat, tadpole."
"If I have an engagement and then say, ""what engagement?"" that's Alzheimer's."
"But if I say, ""oh, right, I had an engagement,"" then that's just forgetfulness."
"There are many similarities between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, so it's difficult to differentiate with just a neuro-psychic test."
"MRI and PET scan will be the next step,"
And even then it may be difficult to differentiate between Alzheimer's or a mild cognitive impairment.
"In that case, we'll have to spend one or two years continually testing."
What is this?
I think Seo Yeon should be writing her own material.
Ghostwriting for someone who doesn't have the qualifications...
Seeing her rewriting for others was pitiful.
The only thing I can do... there's nothing I can do.
"Don't mention me, tell her you want to help, tell her to write her own book."
Say that you'll take care of her living expenses.
"So simply put, is it consolation money?"
"It seems to be narrowing, but at the same time,"
I almost feel like it's slate mixed with mud continuing on.
"I don't know if we want to come back with a different method, 'cause it... this is, this is gonna be real slow from here on out."
The shape is strange;
"I mean, that's a given."
Everything's strange about it.
It's not natural.
"You know, even taking an excavator in here, it would be difficult because that's been chiseled down through."
"You try and dig right there, an excavator isn't gonna pull that up."
"It might break it up, get underneath of it."
It might.
- Well...
"- You can lose a tooth, too."
"Not only lose a tooth, but if it really is something, do we really want to go that route?"
I honestly think we should have that archaeologist guy
- look at it.
"Yeah, I mean..."
- Come look at it?
"I don't know what that is, but an archeologist might."
"To me, that is absolutely man-made and, um, obviously old."
"Yeah, I agree."
I totally agree.
"We should, we should get an opinion."
"Because this so-called ""hatch"""
"could be an important discovery,"
Marty and Rick's decision to bring in an archaeologist to examine it is a prudent one.
We're not done here;
"We-we need to figure out what's going on, but, Jack, for right now, you're done... nice job."
Canada has certain requirements for archaeological excavations.
"This hatch could be significant, archaeologically, so we want to follow the rules, so we bring in an expert."
We're not sure what this thing is.
"So, that's one reason to make sure we're doing the proper thing."
Fire fascinates Hitler.
It consumes without accepting or rejecting.
Hitler:
Read the last sentence back to me.
"Typist: ""We made the sound so overwhelming, the attitude so certain, the level of force so high, the spectacle so grand, that no one could see anything at the center but the symbolism."""
Yes.
Good.
The symbolism at the center.
"Like the sun, nobody could look at me without the pain and punishment of blindness."
Number two!
"The receptivity of the masses is unlimited, yet their understanding is feeble."
They quickly forget.
Three!
The masses tell each other small lies.
It could never come into their heads to create colossal tales.
"Thus, bold myths work best."
Four.
Effective propaganda must be confined to stereotypes.
Always focus people's attention on a single foe.
To have multiple enemies confuses people.
My genius was the combining of two enemies--
Jews and Marxism-- into one.
Jewish Marxism... the synthesis that was the key to my success.
Weave this in:
Crude simplifications endlessly repeated will influence the supple.
Goebbel's realm.
"For the non-supple, the stubborn... terror is necessary--"
Himmler's responsibility.
"When I was a small boy in Linz, I frequently played alone."
I would walk to the top of the hill overlooking the city.
"In dark solitude, I imagined I had absolute command of those heights and all the lands below."
Only the trees on the hillside heard my cry.
"It was a big robbery, it was on the news and there was like, people talked about it for a few days."
"Have you been in a robbery, Rob?"
"I haven't, but my mom was in a robbery."
I was about ten years old and it was a sawn-off shotgun situation.
"It was like in a woman's handbag store in rural Massachusetts,"
"I don't know why they chose to rob this place, but anyway, the police came with, you know, pictures of criminals that they wanted to show my mom and I'm ten years old and I'm thinking,"
"""You know what?"
They say they're the cops but probably
"""they're the robbers who've come to finish the job and kill my mom""."
"So, I put..."
"At ten years old,"
I just stood sentinel throughout the whole time while they showed...
"And I had weapons all over my body, like, that a ten-year-old would find, like a pair of scissors, like a little hammer from my own little boy's tool kit and I was like, ""If those guys who say they're cops try anything,"
"""I will cut their hair."""
Is it true that you've been happy-slapped?
Yes.
I was in Tesco...
You've made me look bad now and I'm actually a really cool guy.
Do you have happy slapping in America?
Don't know what it is.
"Well, when people started getting camera phones, with little... you know, you could record video, kids would go up to strangers and knock 'em - I don't know why I'm looking at you"
because I feel you might have done it to someone.
I am not a happy slapper.
And they would...
LAUGHTER
..assault people and film it.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Why was that wrong(?
)
It took a while for the penny to drop for me on that one.
"Anyway, he'll tell you what happy slapping is."
I hate this idea!
This is a stupid --
Looks like Schmidt doesn't much like our plan.
He'll come around.
Let's get this over with.
"Well, just how tortured do you want to look?"
Think an angry Schmidt with a car battery.
Electroshock torture is a messy business.
"While most of the damage is internal, the electric arc that's created can burn anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 degrees."
"If you want to look like you've been tortured, but aren't willing to hook yourself up to a car battery, a curling iron can create similar burns without the risk of stopping your heart."
Just a minute!
Surveillance doesn't always have to be covert to be useful.
Sometimes the best way into a target's life is through the front door.
"Good afternoon, Mrs. Westen."
"I'm Olivia Riley, CIA."
I'm in charge of the Agency's investigation of your son.
May I have a moment of your time?
Of course.
"Please, come in."
There are advantages to being obvious when the goal is less about information-gathering and more about intimidation.
"You, uh, really should have called first."
I could have been out.
There's nothing more jarring than realizing that your every move is being watched.
"I, uh, noticed that, uh, you stopped by your son's old place yesterday to take some photos."
Our perimeter cameras spotted a silver Camry.
"That was you, wasn't it?"
It was.
I was taking pictures for the insurance company in case anybody needed anything.
Interesting.
So you think Michael's going to come back and file an insurance claim?
I assume you realize your son's in an enormous amount of trouble.
He shot and killed a CIA officer.
"You mean, like, run a boat charter in Fiji?"
Be mountain guides in the Alps.
Freedom fighters in the Sudan.
Ooh.
Ha ha!
No.
Cartoons instead of math homework.
Do I hear the thundering crash of a Laurasaurus on the rampage?
Laurasaurus was about to go on a rampage...
Yeah?
"But then she was distracted by the deep, musky scent of a T.Rex on the hunt."
"T.Rex forgot all about his prey... and gently, firmly... took hold of the Laurasaurus... in his powerful jaws..."
"Coming up, Teacher of the Year turns Killer of the Year..."
- My God!
- Gives him a failing grade.
"Haskell DeBray's coworkers are in shock, describing him as quiet but fiercely loyal."
"Serena, since when do you watch the news?"
"They're releasing Jesse's new video today, and I thought maybe they'd show some of it."
"Well, how about this?"
"While we're waiting for the video to drop, remember, before Christmas, those Mexican hotchocolate cookies we were supposed to make, only somebody was, um, too busy at work?"
"Today, we are going to bake enough cookies to make Santa Claus beg us to stop."
Hoho!
Captain Kendra Sarneau was quick to give credit to the coroner at the scene.
Up.
You've always hated me.
"The confession, sewn into DeBray's jacket, revealed that he had been targeting mothers who had, in his view, abandoned their children."
"Records now confirm that several of his victims had, in fact, given their children up for adoption."
This is when Ruby finds out the teacher she loves is a killing machine.
This is when a normal uncle would drop in on his niece.
"Well, there'd be drawing instead of math and tree climbing instead of sports and..."
"No, they'd never have that."
"No, go ahead, say it."
For the promise Greece holds.
'Tis our enemies who forged our freedom in the fires of war.
It was King Darius who came to take our land.
"Ten years ago, when youth still burned in our eyes... before this bitter war forced our children to become men."
"Ten years ago, this war began as all wars begin:"
With a grievance.
Marathon.
"The Persian king, Darius annoyed by the notion of Greek freedom has come to Greece to bring us to heel."
He makes landfall at the field of Marathon with an invading force which outnumbers the Greek defenders three-to-one.
"And so at dawn, the hopeless Athenians do the unthinkable."
They attack.
They attack the weary Persians as they disembark their ships on shaky legs after a month at sea.
They attack before they can establish their war camp and supply their soldiers.
And who is the architect of this mad strategy?
A little-known Athenian soldier.
His men call him
Themistokles.
He gives the Persians a taste of Athenian shock combat.
All thoughts of glory are gone.
Thousands dead.
Hundreds of them their own.
All for an idea:
"A free Greece an Athenian experiment called ""democracy."""
Could this idea be worth it?
Worth all this sacrifice?
Themistokles would let the good King Darius decide.
For through the chaos a moment appeared.
And Themistokles would seize it.
A moment that would ring across the centuries.
A moment that would raise him from simple soldier to the height of Athenian political power.
No!
A moment that would make Themistokles a legend.
I felt uncomfortable with all his piety.
"A boy at that age should be looking for mischief, not telling his rosary."
What you're saying was
"James didn't want to know about the church, yet you couldn't get Alec out of the place."
Surely you've got that the wrong way round?
"I was booked in for senility, but it hasn't come through yet, Inspector."
But I do need more prompting things are starting to get a little vague.
"So how did they get on together, James and Alec?"
There were problems.
I think the Barrs were having financial difficulties.
It all hit Alec very hard.
"And his behavior was difficult, very difficult."
What happened Father?
He became very jealous of his brother.
"It started with toys being broken, books torn up."
And I believe James's pet was killed.
"Then he set light some clothes, and gutted James' bedroom."
It was all very hard for the family.
How long did this go on for?
Well Alec spent some time at a special school.
"He came back a spotty adolescent, but still with too much piety and not enough faith, and healthily more interested in girls than what his brother was up to."
"Go on, was there still something wrong."
He made a point of taking James's girlfriends off him.
But he grew out of it eventually.
"He'd still sneak into confession if he felt he'd done something bad, thinking I wouldn't know who it was."
And always insisting that I conduct the proceedings in Latin.
"Thanks for coming, Charlie."
"Yes, well, that doesn't mean there's anything to say."
Are you off to see Ms. Bailey?
That's right.
"And I'm not going to say much to her either, practically nothing in fact."
"No, you've just got to keep your mouth shut that's all."
Nicely.
Sorry.
Couldn't you try to be nice?
"What, like that?"
Yeah.
This is science;

"I'm kind of perfect, you know?"
"And I just sat there; no one came up to touch my head, so after about a couple of minutes I thought,"
"""I'm not going sit here and wait for someone or go and ask somebody if they wanted to feel my head."""
"I'd rather just, um, come and breathe some night air and, uh, hopefully that'll..."
"that nonsense and, you know... we'll do something else for the evening."

"""that you have taken the time to send me correspondence"
"""from your Kentchurch house party."
"the detail and functioning of our bodies."""
"""My work with plastinates is as unique as the first steps taken by earlier anatomists."""
"""I look forward to meeting you."
"Professor Gunther von Hagens."""
"Ladies, I've taken the liberty of inviting a special guest who's an anatomist... called Professor von Hagens, to Kentchurch."
He's going to come here?
The one that strips the muscles and...
I presume that his demonstration will take place after dinner.
He's so controversial.
"I can't say ""have the hots for Miss Braund,"" can I?"
That he favored Miss Braund and she should now reciprocate by agreeing.
"Now that his ship has come in,"
Sir Jeremy could have his pick of the women round the table.
But he remains steadfast.
"And for the penniless Miss Braund, this is, indeed, good news."
"I find him more and more endearing just because he's being himself and he's just being so sweet, yeah, I think if you persevere you can get what you want."
"I think there is something to maybe marrying your best friend, someone you can completely rely on, who will be there for you no matter what, who's not going to disappear at the first sign of trouble,"
who is going to be genuinely concerned about you.
"So, um... and I think Captain Glover has all of those qualities."
Ask you all to raise your glasses and toast Sir Jeremy.
Sir Jeremy.
Thank you.
Alias Captain Glover.
"Indeed, mate."
It's the last week of the Regency house party.
"Two months ago, our modern-day guests arrived hoping to find love, Regency style."
This is their last chance to form an attachment.
"In Regency terms, the glamorous but hard-up Mr. Carrington needs a wealthy wife to secure his place in society."
"Sneaking into the lady's quarters, he's risking expulsion to make his move."
Thought I'd do a warm gesture for a very special girl.
I think this might be something that would really make her day.
"It's kind of cool, isn't it?"
Bit of a path.
"I've said, ""You are..."
"""a... truly... special..."
"person."""
The lady in Mr. Carrington's sights is industrial heiress Miss Hopkins.
Her money would have made her a prize catch for any Regency gentlemen.
"As far as my feelings towards Miss Hopkins goes,"
I don't think they've changed at all.
"I'm still very attracted to her,"
"After one week in Australia, the Endeavor sets sail for Britain, carrying an irreplaceable cargo."
animals and plants unknown to science.
"Ahead, a 20,000 mile journey."
11pm:
Five weeks into the voyage.
"[items topple over] 24 miles from the coast, the Endeavor hits a reef."
[voices - run aground]
[Going down!
]
Banks records the terror on board:
[voices yelling]
Fear of death now stared us in the face.
Probably the most of us must be drowned.
I prepared myself for the worst.
Off the coast of Australia mankind's greatest explorer fights to save his stricken ship.
If Cook can't refloat it the reef will tear the hull apart.
Few sailors can swim.
This was a alarming and terrible circumstance.
It threatened the immediate destruction of the ship.
Sam Sheridan:
"Its horrendous, there is a shock."
"There is chaos, the ship is grinding on the rocks."
Time is of the essence if they don't get the ship floating soon their going to die.
"To lighten the ship and refloat her, they throw overboard personnel possessions, canons, casks and ballast."
Even fresh drinking water.
Only the precious scientific samples are saved.
[voices]
"There is no rescue coming, you are completely alone, completely isolated."
For us it would be like if we were on Mars and our space ship is breaking apart.
Our chances of survival are terrible.
Its a terrifying event.
"23 hours later, a rising tide helps the ship lift free."
"Afternoon, sirs."
Are we well?
We are very well.
What do you think of Mr. Howard?
All right.
A bit freaked by our welcoming committee.
I thought it was quite funny.
"We were thinking that we would at one point organize... and this is where you come in, G.B.... organize, like, a dinner for the chaperones, like, somewhere really far away."
Like London?
That's about four days away.
Can we send them shopping for the day?
"Miss Samuel's initiative to encourage romance is going to plan, but unchaperoned, Regency decorum is soon abandoned."
"We should all, like, squash the arms of the men"
"I mean, something that you're not allowed to do."
"Oh, my God, we've actually touched hands."
I like that you've taken off your jackets.
Miss Samuel had this idea:
"""We're going to go up"
"""for an unchaperoned picnic with the boys."
"""Don't tell the chaperones."
"We're going to have gin and lemonade."""
"And I was, like, ""That's nice, but it's not really bad, is it?"""
I've got to do something much more extreme.
"We've got to kind of lead this to another level of badness, because if the worst thing you can do is go without your bonnet or something, you know, that's not really kind of going for it."
"During the Regency, black musicians performed throughout Europe's concert halls and opera houses."
Mr. Howard's quartet is performing a Beethoven sonata.
Dawn.
"Today, the gentlemen of the house will host the fancy, a sporting fraternity drawn to a remote corner of the Kentchurch estate by the promise of a prizefight."
"Good morning, Professor."
"Good morning, gentlemen, good morning."
Good to see you again.
Good to see you indeed.
"We've got things to do, you and me, eh?"
Eh?
We can go anywhere.
Everywhere.
You choose.
That sounds good.
"In kind of a real-life ""Doctor Who"" episode,"
"Georgia Moffett, who plays Jenny, is the daughter of Peter Davison, who's the fifth Doctor;"
"and she's the wife of David Tennant, who is the tenth Doctor."
"So it's this kind of amazing meeting of real life and the fiction of ""Doctor Who."""
"There's so much weird sort of ""Doctor Who"" looping going on with that that it's -- he married his own daughter..."
He married his own daughter.
But I'm fine with it.
It is all wrapped up in timey-wimey in real life.
"Yeah, I -- it's a conundrum."
Amy Pond was supersexy and feisty.
She states what she wants and goes for it.
I really wasn't suggesting anything quite so...
long-term.
I think what the show does a really great job of is not having the women just sort of be these passive accessories to the male lead of the show.
"They're always very strong women, in their own way."
Amy Pond was the first companion since Rose to just be like supersexy and hot and feisty and crazy.
"I love the fact that she's got this edge to her that's really, like, kickarse, like, she's really -- like, you just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her."
Amy's interesting because she's the first companion we meet as a child.
"He showed up when she was a kid, said, ""Oh, come with me,"""
"she said okay, and then he ditched her for 12 years"
And then ditched her again for 2 years.
"All that stuff that happened -- the hospital, the spaceships,"
"Prisoner Zero -- Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning, there's loads more."
"Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff."
That was two years ago!
Ohh...
But Savage still has to do this in three different time periods.
"That's the beauty of immortality, Jefferson: he can."
He can literally be in three places at once.
- Can't be.
- Can.
"Thanks to time travel, and it's because of time travel that I know you're here."
"You're out here tonight, because you have felt an immanent presence of... something."
- A... a meteorite?
- And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.
Change the course of the entire world.
"So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times,"
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.
- We kill him.
- How?
"We've always known that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items exposed, as you were, to the meteor's radiation."
"Now, the radiation works both ways."
"It gave Savage his immortality, but..."
It also makes him vulnerable.
And Savage is about to unleash the radiation from three meteorites in three different time periods.
- Triple the exposure.
- Yes.
Which should be sufficient to render Savage mortal.
And then all we got to do is kill Savage three times.
Indeed.
"Gideon can navigate the Waverider, and we can split into teams of two."
"One in 1958, one in 1975, and one in 2021."
Open it.
Did you know that this is one of the original meteorites which fell upon the Middle Kingdom?
"Drawn from the ground after a millennia, straight into Nazi hands."
"The object that has bound the two of us together for 4,000 years has the power to take us back to where it all began."
"But this time, I will be the pharaoh,"
"Well, that will probably put very serious constraints on your career as a detective."
I'm prepared to co-operate with your enquiry.
"However, co-operation brings conditions."
I'm not here to make deals.
I can create enough confusion to have you running round in circles till you've missed two promotions and I've gone to meet my maker.
Or to listen to threats.
"If there was any error of judgment under my authority,"
I take full responsibility.
The only officer I confided in fully is now dead.
My co-operation means you drop any possible charges against any detectives who may have worked for me.
Like Jack Frost.
Jack always played it straight.
I can't agree to that.
"Well, you'll have to find someone who can."
"Oh, by the way, Superintendent, next time I expect someone of my own rank to be present."
That's the correct procedure.
I don't think retirement precludes that.
I'm sure I'll hear from you.
"Okay Mr. Fairclough, you have your deal, we'll start taking your evidence at 0900 hours tomorrow."
You know where to find us at FHQ.
Welcome back Mr. Frost
Thank you.
Nice to see you back sir.
Thank you.
How are you Jack
(Everyone welcoming Jack back)
"You're a lucky man, Inspector."
"Oh, is that what they say now to suspects when they're found innocent?"
You're lucky.
I thought you'd have been relieved that my only crime was believing in Charlie Fairclough.
"But there again, what's one old copper who's taken the wrong road, not many brownie points in that is there?"
Not like uncovering a network of corruption.
"NARRATOR: 'He had been living in the city for nine years, 'and was only now coming to think of it as home."
"'Characteristically not in a hurry, 'but perpetually enraged by slow foot traffic before him,"
"'Philip was on this day meeting for lunch with Mona, his ex-girlfriend, 'whom he had dated throughout a portion of college."
"'As with any punctual individual, Philip loathed when people ran late, 'which Mona typically was."
"'By the time Mona made her way to Philip, 'he was in a state of rage and on the verge of storming out... 'a reaction he was known to often have 'towards the end of their two-year relationship."
"'During the arguments that led to their breakup,"
'Mona repeatedly emphasised Philip's short fuse and poor temper 'as key factors in no longer being capable of tolerating his company.'
- It's just crazy that you're late to me.
- Can we stop talking about it?
"25 minutes I'm waiting, almost 30."
It's an insult.
"Also, I have a really busy day, so now I have less than an hour."
Probably not even enough time to eat anything.
Maybe a grilled cheese for me.
I had that the other day.
It's disgusting.
"So I'll ask you how you are, right?"
Things are good?
Things are good with me.
Allie and I just finally found a new roommate.
"Oh, what's-her-ass moved?"
"- She got married, like, two years ago."
- Figures.
- Is that the new book?
- Er... yeah.
"I wasn't sure you'd noticed, or heard."
- OK.
- I'm just getting ready.
Things are gonna be pretty crazy for me after the release.
"In fact, this might be the last time I'm home for more than a week at a time for the next eight or possibly nine months."
"Actually, yeah, definitely."
"I was impressed that someone was trying to take these chimps that had already basically list so much, they were trying to in a way give them back to themselves and nature."
May be its not perfect.
Nut it was something.
"Soon Claytor must leave Africa, and make the rest of his way around the globe."
"But first, he wants to make one more stop."
"For some time, he has wanted to visit Zaire."
"But so far, he hasn't been granted clearance to land there."
"Okay, this is Mike Oscar in southern Zaire."
Over.
Mike Oscar... is there any way for me to confirm a clearance from Ndola?
Over
That's very difficult because of the fact that there's no telephone communication between the two places.
Over
"Okay, roger."
"If I arrive with my copy of my AFTN request, how easy is it to negotiate once on the ground?"
Over.
How much money do you have?
Over
I've got a fair amount.
How much do you think it would cost?
Over.
At least $250 each.
Over
"Roger, I understand."
The turbulent political situation in Zaire makes it extremely difficult to get permission to enter the country.
"Claytor decides to go in any way, without an official clearance."
He'll touch down at a small airstrip where he can refuel form his own supply.
"If he's lucky, no one will ask him for his papers."
"In Africa there's a rule an unwritten rule, and that is that it's easier to get pardoned than to get permission."
"Because of communications and how difficult it is to get clearance and things, its sometimes easier just tot do them and afterwards, of course, you get in trouble."
But the Africans are very forgiving.
"Good people, and very often they'll forgive you."
"And as with most such stories, no one else believed him."
"Except in this case for two nuns, who in 1923 met the man and believed so much in him and his dream that they invested money no one knew they had."
"Now, when the nuns told their parish priest about the man's dream and their investment in it, now, he counseled them to try and get their money back."
"Sheepishly, they admitted that it was too late, that the money was already spent."
"Well, the priest, he sighed, shook his head, and offered just one small bit of advice -- bless the site with rose petals, and invoke the help of Saint Rita, patron saint of impossible dreams."
"And while the workers waited for the oil that would eventually come, they played baseball."
He's outta here.
Played baseball so well that some were able to give up the dirt and the despair and went on to play major-league ball in the glory days of Ruth and Gehrig.
Come on!
"I've heard and told that story on many occasions, but that was long before"
Saint Rita decided to bless our little town just one more time.
-
- Yeah!
"First game in the big leagues, and Jimmy Morris has a no-hitter going."
"Agh, Jimmy, don't throw it so hard."
My hands are cold.
Agh!
What are you doing?
"Waiting till Spring, that's what I'm doing."
Jimmy...
Your father and I need to talk to you.
I hear Virginia's real nice -- at least that's what the Navy folks told your father.
"Isn't that right, Jim?"
We'll just be moving again.
It's my job to decide when we move.
It's yourjob to make the best of it.
"Jim, please."
Who knows?
Maybe it won't snow so much in Virginia.
"""Jimmy Morris,"
"""with another masterful pitching performance,"
"""well on his way to another World Series title."""
"They're not good, to be honest."
"And, of course, that kind of decision has an effect on others."
You and your sister.
"You were separated when your parents died, weren't you?"
You entered the chaos of the care system and Jess went to live with aunt and uncle.
Who raped her repeatedly and had neighbours hold the camcorders.
Incredible what goes on behind the net curtains in this nation of ours.
"Robert and Abby, they seem contented little kids."
"I'm sure they'd rather be together, being looked after by your sister."
Is he fast?
Cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he can take a couple of steps.
"I would, too."
"That's partly the reason you're here, isn't it?"
"You're a class act, aren't you?"
"No, I'm a necessity."
Destroy the lives of innocent people just to keep me your slave.
Stop being so melodramatic.
You may learn to love me first.
Well...what do you want?
I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
His name is Iain Risdale.
I think he betrayed Operation Merlin and was involved in his commanding officer's death.
The man smells of corruption.
"Things will work out just fine, John."
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Oh, yes!"
What I wasn't gonna tell ya!
"Si, oh, si!"
"TV: ""Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould."
Gould had stepped down from the daytoday running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being continually linked with the illegal arms trade.
Police confirmed Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin's attempt to target illegal gunrunning networks in Britain.
Derrick Phelps is taking a break.
It caught a lot of people's attention because it was the national championship game.
"But, in fact, that would've been a departure from what we had done all year long."
Kicked out to montross.
That was lynch.
They got the break.
Carolina can take the lead.
"Smith's calculated risk worked, and his well-rested team took a 2-point lead with 20 seconds to play."
Took a 2-point lead with 20 seconds to play.
The referee missed it.
Webber brings it into the front court.
There are no time outs remaining.
Too many time outs.
That's a technical foul.
"He called a timeout, and Michigan doesn't have any."
...north Carolina is the 1993 national champion.
"On the same superdome court where Smith won his first and only title 11 years earlier, where Smith won his first and only title 11 years earlier, once again, it was an opponent's mistake that defined the final play."
But luck really had little to do with it.
"Every situation that happened to us that year, he prepared us for."
There was not one thing that we didn't cover.
"Donald Williams called a timeout in practice, and he put us on the end line and made us run for Donald Williams calling a timeout."
...on defense that you might learn something from.
...on defense that you might learn something from.
Get him!
Get him!
"No one, not even the coaching staff --"
"Bill guthridge, Phil Ford --"
Would stand up on that bench and call a timeout without coach Smith giving them the go-ahead.
"So, for our season to end like it did with Michigan, you know, we can look back and say,"
"""I remember that day in November Donald called a timeout."""
It's an unusual friendship.
"I know people would not think that we became really good friends, but we did."
[Whimpers]
- [Screams] Help!
- Stay back!
- Stay back!
I'll break her neck.
- [Screams]
"He had been faking his catatonic state, ever since the shock treatment wore off."
If you follow me I will kill you!
"With the orderlies hot on his trail,"
Charles was desperate.
But the shock treatment did leave its mark on his heart.
[Gasps and chokes]
"Electro-shock therapy isn't just to the brain, it's to the whole body."
"It's like a mini electrocution, and it will disrupt the natural rhythm of your heartbeat, causing what's known as atrial fibrillation."
"Lack of coordination of the heartbeat, that he had suffered a heart attack and died."
Charles was a bad guy.
[Groans]
He thought he could beat his shock treatment.
"But his heart took a pounding, and then it just..."
Stopped...
Beating.
Leslie and Amber are arch-rivals on an entry-level motocross circuit.
"- Yay, Amber!"
- Yeah!
"Ladies, start your engines!"
They both share the same dream:
"Making it all the way to the big time, and the big money."
"A professional super- or motocross rider can make between $20,000 and $30,000,000, depending on their sponsorship."
Everything from your helmet to your underwear to your boots to the oil that you use.
"Everyone has a sponsor, and if you end up winning, then you make the big bucks, and you can also do commercial endorsements."
Leslie jumped out to an early lead.
"But after miscalculating a turn, she was smelling Amber's exhaust."
Now police initially presumed this to be the work of a rival mob.
"However, a letter dropped off, apparently, late last night at eyewitness news, indicates another possibility."
I quote from the letter.
"""The people of New York have been terrorized"""
"""by criminals for too long."""
"""Politicians have stood idly by"""
"""as thugs and killers have taken over"""
"""our streets, our parks, our lives."""
"""As of today, this will no longer be true."""
"""Gino pontivini will not be the last."""
"The letter is signed, ""the exterminator."""
In other news the nuclear regulatory commission came under fire once again... elections are just two months away.
We really don't need this bullshit.
Can you take care of it?
"Well, what do you want me to do?"
I think the country would be better off if this lunatic were brought to justice.
I see.
"Arrested, brought to trial."
That's not necessarily what I had in mind.
I didn't think so.
The trial might raise some embarrassing issues.
"The president's campaign promises, for example."
An administration that hasn't brought about law and order for the last four years shouldn't be given a second chance.
I asked you if you could take care of it.
I'll take care of it.
But it would be a lot easier if the New York police cooperate with us.
I'll give their commissioner a call.
[Collective chatter]
"Cocaine, joints in bags, nickel bags, man, speed... check it out, check it out."
Check it out.
"Hey, check it out..."
No headphones.
We should welcome him in style.
"I'll put the plastic sheeting down in the box room, eh?"
"Number Seven, come on."
"In today's main headline, it's been a month since 19 passengers and one train driver were killed in the Box Tunnel massacre."
"The victims'families are calling on the Home Secretary to replace Alastair Lynch, the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police, due to what they see as a lack of progress in the investigation."
- Jim Warren's here with the sport.
Jim?
- Thanks very much.
Our main story tonight is the much-anticipated clash between the vampire John Mitchell and an as-yet-unnamed werewolf.
"Of course, regular viewers will know that this has been on the fixture list since the prophecy was given to Mitchell by one of his victims, that he would be killed by a werewolf."
"But in a surprise move,"
Mitchell's camp recently cast doubt on the reliability of this prophecy.
"They've dismissed it as mind games, prompting this response from Team Werewolf."
"""Mitchell won't be saying that when he gets his head ripped off."
"""There's a wolf-shaped bullet with his name on it."
"Mitchell's gonna get got."""
"So, it just looks like this story refuses to stay dead."
"Turning to rugby, and following the sudden tragic death of scrum half Gethin Watson's girl..."
"- Well, that's sorted, then."
- Yeah!
"I'd file that under ""job done""."
Sure he'll settle right in there.
"I mean, they do have a massive telly."
"Oh, ginormous."
"The whole house, it was furnished to the highest standards."
Yeah.
It was so clean.
It was immaculate.
"I mean, Richard and Emma themselves were slightly, what, eccentric perhaps?"
"Well, I'd go for ""unreconstructed""."
- Would you?
- Yeah.
You mean the disappearance of Thomery?
"Yes, I know."
"I guess that when a guy like him disappears, the market takes a hit."
Can you explain it to me?
I will not give you a political economy course.
No.
I only want to know:
When a guy like that disappears who pays the damages?
A lot of people.
There are now a lot of bankrupt people on the market.
Then who benefits?
"In other words, who are the people who benefit from his disappearance?"
"Negative financial speculators who want the market to tumble, to buy some stocks for dirt cheap, then sell them anew."
But they are worthless!
On the contrary.
"Suppose a financier has anticipated, a few days ago, the disappearance or say, to simplify, the death of Thomery."
"So the financier sells to the buyers its actions at a firm and final price, but, listen well, available only in 15 days."
"That way, buyers are forced to buy at full price actions which are worthless."
"As it is played on many actions, you see the fabulous profits?"
"Effectively, it's a good trick."
Ah!
"I've been looking for you everywhere, my pal!"
They found Thomery's corpse in the Orsay's glass roof.
And Professor Hansen has found again fingerprints belonging to Jacques Dollon.
Miss Dollon awaits you in the parlor.
But it's really an exception after visiting hours.
"Can't you remove the handcuffs, please?"
"No, the rules prohibit it."
You have five minutes.
I'm behind the door.
How could you have me arrested?
You know I have done nothing.
(baby coos)
I was dispatched to check on an alarm incident.
Why are you holding my baby?
She was crying.
No one else was home.
"I don't understand, if the alarm went off, why didn't anybody call us?"
"(groans) Oh, my God!"
Please don't do this.
Please.
KAMEKONA:
"For thousands of years, man has taken to the sea, building vessels to conquer the mighty ocean."
"Now, after nearly a year of planning, months of robust pre-sale, finally time for my inaugural voyage of my latest and greatest enterprise:"
Kamekona inter-island booze cruise.
"Congratulations, big guy."
We knew you could do it.
"Well, not to be a killjoy, but as ship medic,"
I do have to advise that consuming alcohol could severely impair our ability to operate this vessel safely.
"Well, as the first mate-slash-DJ-slash bartender,"
I got one thing to say to that:
Overruled.
Boom.
"I'd like to throw out a special thank you to my bruddah from another mudda,"
"Steve McGarrett, for generously offering his services as nautical consultant for this test run."
"Pro Bono, I might add."
"Yeah, we, uh, we firmly established that I won't be getting paid, so why don't we christen this lady, and get her out on the water?"
I'll drink to that.
Although I do have to admit I am perplexed by the name that Kamekona has chosen for her.
"I didn't pick it, Doc."
This boat is from a HPD property forfeiture auction.
Re-painting wasn't in the budget.
Not after he blew it all on this.
Oh!
Guess what I found.
What?
What did you find?
Tell me.
"Foyle, voice-over:"
"You thought you could make it look as if Spencer was the actual target, and your wife had been hit accidentally, which is why you arranged for it to happen in the dark, by leaving all the lights on in all the rooms"
"as you turned down the beds, which overloaded the fuse box."
But then you had to be sure that you could actually hit your wife and not Spencer.
I take no pleasure in so many young lives...
"Foyle, voice-over:"
"Spencer said that during his speech, you were fiddling with your pipe, but, you see,"
Stanley told me that you hardly ever smoked.
It was...
"Potassium nitrate you used in the pipe, saltpeter, which is used, of course, in gunpowder, but it's also used to cure meat, which is why you had a supply of it in the hotel."
"And it acted as an oxidizing agent, and it..."
Added to the tobacco and made it glow.
You lit the pipe while Spencer was making his speech.
I take no pleasure in so many young lives being sacrificed on the altar of politics.
The British government has misled us long enough.
What's going on?
"I'm so sorry, everyone."
It's a fuse.
Do sit down.
Arthur?
"Foyle, voice-over:"
"And when the lights went out, you put it directly in front of Margaret so you could use the glow as the target."
Aah!
Aah!
"Foyle, voice-over:"
You got rid of the gun as quickly as you could.
It wasn't yours anyway.
"And after that, you were biding your time until..."
"Burn me a copy, put it in my office."
- Julianna's completely out of hand.
- She is.
"- Very talented, however."
- Very clever.
Did you make me a copy of the contents of that briefcase?
- Did you get a chance to look at it?
- Very interesting.
"We now have a list of all the Canadian companies involved with the Blackmire Group and the donation expected to funnel to the various lobbyists and politicians, or whoever it is they're pissing off."
- Names and amounts?
"- There you go, on top, there."
It's like a shopping list.
Julianna's expecting to get her passport today.
She's supposed to travel with Browne to the Blackmire summit in Mexico.
I don't think it's safe to let her go.
She might find the life of a billionaire's mistress hard to resist.
Been a few songs written about that.
- I think I've got to reel her back in.
- I agree.
Have Immigration pick her up on something...
- completely unrelated to us.
- As you wish.
Tell them to hold her until she misses her flight.
"When she calls us to help her out, we help her out."
How could we not?
"- Grateful, but too late to travel."
- Too late to travel.
You asked me to find out about the recent arrival of some Americans on the dope scene.
I spoke to the Vancouver Drug Squad and they said they've been noticing a steady influx of Americans arriving over the last five to six months and it seems to be growing.
"It started out as street trade, dime bags."
"But they've moved steadily into wholesaling and they probably already account for 5 to 10% of the Vancouver market, which is a... pretty quite entry into the scene."
"So, who are they?"
"You couldn't receive any messages, nor could you put out a distress call."
"I'm not sure when Dortmunn was killed, but Cally thinks that the death of the pilot Rafford was an accident."
What d'you mean?
An accident?
- A misfortune.
- It certainly was for him.
I think that it was not part of the plan.
"Whoever put the Sonovapour into the ventilation system intended to put the whole crew to sleep, while the controls were being sabotaged."
"Rafford was supposed to be sleeping, too."
"But the ventilator ducts on the flight deck were closed, consequently Rafford was unaffected by the gas."
The murderer was using an oxygen mask to stay awake.
Reaching the flight deck and finding Rafford conscious must have been a shock.
And that shock killed Rafford.
The ventilators shouldn't have been closed.
It's against flight operating procedure.
The next shock was when we arrived.
Now that really was misfortune.
Pure bad luck.
- Rafford should have known better.
"- Shut up, Pasco!"
Go on.
Even the most meticulous of plans could not have anticipated our arrival.
Meticulous?
"The murderer had to cover up, and quickly."
Dortmunn was killed.
I think the plan was to put his body into the life rocket and launch it into space.
"That way, it would appear obvious that Dortmunn was guilty."
So why didn't it happen?
I think it was too difficult.
Dragging the body across the spaceship to the launch area without being seen?
"That proved to be impossible, so the murderer settled for the next best thing."
He launched an empty life rocket.
The alternative was war on the never-never.
Charles began to look for someone to borrow from.
"The Scots raised an army of fervent Covenanters, led by expert soldiers who had returned home from foreign wars."
Charles raised the military equivalent of a tickling stick.
He lost.
Twice.
"By September of 1640, he was shamed and mired in debt."
He had to call the English Parliament.
And the English Parliament was full of Protestants who wanted the same things as the Scots - limits to his power.
"They didn't understand that he was God's anointed, trying to save their souls."
Charles declared war on Parliament in August 7642.
The English Civil War had begun.
Warriston had prayed for a chance to extend the power of King Jesus beyond Scotland 's borders.
"The English Civil War was a regrettable bloodbath, of course, but it was also an opportunity."
"For the first year, the Scots took no part."
Charles and his Royalist army secured victory after victory.
"And in the autumn of 1643,"
"England's Parliament sent agents north to Scotland, to ask for help."
The National Covenant had been for Scotland alone.
The Solemn League and Covenant of 7643 would go much further.
I wasn't expecting to see this in the form of a little hardback book.
WOMAN:
"Unlike the National Covenant,"
Solemn Leagues actually tend to be printed.
"They are normally a plain, printed book that is signed up to."
- We have these lovely engravings here.
- What do they tell us?
One of my favourite illustrations is this one here.
It shows how the Covenant is more radical than that of 1638.
There's no wishy-washy stuff from bishops here.
"It's the extirpation of Popery, prelacy, that is bishops."
"And here we have these bishops, prelates, deans, deacons, all being cast out of the Church, being insulted as they go."
"But I'll have the car transported to the evidence garage, I'll do a full forensic work-up."
"Unless, of course, you need me to stay here."
"Interview witnesses, canvass the area."
'Cause I am totally up to speed on the NCIS investigation manual.
And I need you to finish the examination.
"You still work for me, for now, remember?"
"You got it, boss."
PRIDE:
"We're not gonna leave you undermanned, Loretta."
"Sebastian can still work out of the lab for you, even after he becomes a special forensics agent."
Just wish somebody had told me in advance.
LASALLE:
"Ooh, sorry about that, King."
Won't happen again.
Talk about it later.
You got experience tracking cars.
What do you see?
"Well, not a lot that makes sense, especially with these skid marks."
"Racers know to control their slides around turns, but these indicate that Jared kept accelerating for some reason, and then lost it."
"Well, maybe his accelerator stuck."
"It's possible, but these skid marks are inconsistent with braking, which begs the question, why didn't he?"
"Well, hopefully Sebastian will be able to give us some answers."
"Meanwhile, let's find out everything we can about our marine."
Make sure he doesn't have any skeletons in his closet.
Count on you?
Absolutely.
"All right, Percy and I are gonna head over to the hospital, talk to Jared's father."
See if he can explain to us why he thinks his son was murdered.
RUSS:
I-I-I don't know why I said it was sabotage.
I wasn't thinking straight.
"I was just upset, that's all."
"I love Dean Smith, you know?"
"I respect him as much as anybody that I've been around in coaching, and I understand him."
A lot of the things that we've gone through --
The sustained excellence and the expectations --
"Are very, very similar."
It's like brothers in arms.
One thing coach k and coach Smith.
One thing coach k and coach Smith certainly had in common was winning.
"By the time he reached his 36th year at Carolina,"
Dean Smith had amassed enough victories to make history and pass adolph rupp --
"At the time, the winningest coach in the long history of college basketball."
But the glare of the spotlight wasn't for him.
"He thought it took away from the players, it took away from the program, it put him in a spotlight that he didn't want to be in."
It was never his goal to break rupp's record.
He probably didn't know what rupp's record was.
He probably didn't know what rupp's record was.
"He was not comfortable with it at all and he told me at one time he may quit the day before, and I said, ""you cannot do that."
We're going to hogtie you.
"You cannot do that."""
"There was almost a conspiracy of his former players, who got together and who said, ""look, whatever it takes, we're not going to let him retire before he breaks the record."""
"Dean Smith is the winningest coach in the history of college basketball, in the history of college basketball,"
877 career victories.
"They start chanting his name, ""Dean!"
Dean!
"Dean!"""
And he sprints like a track star to get off that court.
He genuinely did not think he had done anything.
And I'm telling you -- He meant it.
"Coach, we want to give you a present from past, present, and us --"
"A present from past, present, and us --"
A Jersey with 877 wins.
"Well, aren't you nice."
- I probably shouldn't get drunk.
I'll just start crying.
I feel obliged to say thank you for all the kind words.
Now I'm not the type that likes to hear my own voice   in such a well filled room.
But I am turning 48 after all.
"And there was so much I didn't manage to say when I turned 40   and much has happened since, so I think it's reasonable   that I be allowed to steal ten minutes of your precious time."
Because it is.
Time is precious.
The years have taught me that.
Helene...
I could stand here and brag about you for hours.
But don't worry.
I know you don't want me to.
"But I will say, that even though you can't always feel it -"
- I am extremely happy that you're with me.
"You are night and day, the heaven and the seas for me."
The time I'm with you and our wonderful children   confirms exactly what I would have said.
"Every acquaintance, every friend, every person   who has a place in your heart..."
It is the time with them   that really means something.
Nothing else matters.
"Apart from the firm, of course."
We've expanded a lot recently.
"We will continue to far into the future, I hope."
"Already today, cranes stand in London, New York and Singapore."
It shouldn't be long before we can sleep in our own buildings   when we visit Houston and Manila...
I'll anticipate things a little and invite you all to the opening   of our new headquarters in Singapore on January 5th next year.
"I'm sure my ten minutes are up, but I am very grateful to you   for wanting to spend the day with me."
And I would like to propose a toast to the future.
Cheers!
Jorgen?
I talked to the boys' teacher about separating them after the holidays   and moving Morten into a different class.
It sounded quite reasonable.
Mr. Mason.
"Doctor, was the deceased intoxicated at the time of her death?"
"I wouldn't think so, Mr. Mason."
"Our tests did show a small percentage of alcohol in her system, but not much."
"Your tests showed something else, didn't they?"
"Yes, chloral hydrate."
"That's commonly known as knock-out drops, isn't it?"
That's right.
"Thank you, Doctor."
That'll be all.
"Mr. Langley, as I understand it, you are the legal guardian of the defendant and the trustee of her estate."
"That's right, sir."
Merle's parents died rather tragically when Merle was only 12 years old.
"Isn't it true that in actual practice, your late wife was the real acting guardian of the defendant?"
"Well, yes."
She needed a woman to look after her.
"And isn't it a fact that the decedent really managed your niece's trust fund, too?"
Someone had to look after things.
"And then, Merle is simply not equipped to handle large sums of money and may not be for some time yet."
"Large sums of money, Mr. Langley?"
How large?
"I believe the principal is in the neighborhood of 250,000."
"That's in addition to real estate, like the house you live in, and personal property like the still-missing diamond necklace."
- Is that so?
"- That's correct, sir."
"Mr. Langley, why was your wife wearing the defendant's necklace?"
It's extremely valuable.
"As I've said before, Merle doesn't understand of the value of things."
She could have lost them.
"Yes, of course."
"As a matter of fact, the necklace seems to be lost anyway, doesn't it?"
"Although, of course, there are a thousand places where anyone who knew the estate might have hidden it."
"Freedom from the English crown at last, for ever."
The next English invasion was in 1 332.
So much for bottles and for promises.

NARRATOR:
"They call it Britain's last great wilderness, a place as beautiful as it is barren."
The islands and mountains of Scotland seem to exist on the edge of the imagination.
But it wasn't always like this.
"For centuries, Gaelic Scotland was at the heart of the Scottish kingdom."
Then it changed.
"It became something different, something separate."
Something other.
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS)
(ALL SPEAK GAELIC)
"In many ways, Scotland is a nation of two cultures, one Highland and one Lowland, and one part just doesn't seem to understand the other."
Most of us don't speak Gaelic.
"We speak English and, whether we admit it or not, we have to view our own country through the prism of the English language."
"And when we go to the Highlands and Islands, we find ourselves in amongst a language and an entire culture that we don't understand, that we just don't get."
"It's an uneasy, uncomfortable double vision."
It's Scotland's guilty secret.
And it all began with a feud between two families.
"In 15th-century Scotland, family was everything."
This is the story of two of those families and how their fates were locked together.
The rise of one meant the fall of the other.
Their struggle was epic their names legendary.
They were the Stewarts and the MacDonalds.
There's a story of a medieval Spanish traveller who came to Edinburgh to see the sights.
"When he got home, someone asked him what was the most wonderful thing he'd seen."
"The traveller thought for a moment and then answered,"
"""A grand man called MacDonald with a great train of men after him,"
"""called neither Duke nor Marquis."""
"His name was Alexander, Lord of the Isles,"
I just want to say   that next week I turn 32.
And so... ?
I can't go on like this.
- I'll be graduating.
- It's about time.
Then I'll get a job.
"Actually, I wanted to tell you,   that next week   I'm getting married."
What can I say?
Buy me a nice gift.
Benito's getting married?
To whom?
I don't know.
"Beloved,   you come to the house of the Lord   so that your love can be sanctified by God,   by the Minister of the Church and the Community."
"Christ blesses this love and commands you to be faithful to each other,   bearing together the responsibilities of marriage,   you are enriched with the Sacrament,   having been consecrated through baptism."
I now ask your intentions before the members of the Church.
"Italia and Benito,   have you come here to join in marriage without coercion,   but freely and conscously aware of the step you are about to take?"
Are you willing to love and honor your...
Why do I have to attend this absurd ceremony?
"Because he's your student, ..."
- ... and she's the former nurse of your boss.
- He's a jerk and she's useless!
The last time I saw Ciotti he suggested I take   a trivial position with the public health service.
"If it is your solemn intention to enter the sacred bond of marriage,   join hands and express such to God and the Church..."
- Yes?
- You have some shitty friends.
"They didn't want to be witnesses, and they haven't even deigned to come to your wedding."
... to each other for life in Sacred Marriage?
Ah... yes!
"- Have you come here, or not?"
- What?
"To join in marriage without coercion,   but freely and conscously aware of the step you are about to take?"
Are you willing to love and honor each other for the rest of your lives in Holy Matrimony?
I heard Mr. President put a lot of effort into making his campaign a clean campaign.
"Though I have some guesses on how he came up with the election money, but I don't know anything."
"He said he would take responsibilities for it later on, so he managed that money himself."
"Though he's such a thorough person, he probably kept a record about it."
A record?
"Yes, since he's someone who writes a diary and keeps a record of office spending as well."
There must be a ledger book somewhere.
Maybe in his private residence somewhere.
"Da Hye, after she heard about Prosecutor Kim Young Joo, she's been laying in bed without eating or drinking."
She's not even going to the clubs that she likes so much...
Miss Da Hye's not going to clubs?
"Last year, even though she failed to get into college, she still went to clubs all the time.."
That's why I'm worried like this.
What should I do about our Da Hye?
Just leave her be.
"After going through a pain that like, Miss Da Hye will come to be mature too."
"I'm telling you, I'm confused whether I'm her bodyguard or her personal secretary."
Should I try to get her to get on a blind date?
"A blind date's a blind date, but take care of yourself first."

A tall and good-looking guy said he was a reporter and asked about the election campaign money?
"Right, you answered well."
"Yeah, stay well."
"After I leave office, let's go hike up the mountain together."
My youngest daughter bought me a jacket for mountain-climing too.

Of course.
There needs to be doctors who appear on TV.
I'll get going first.
The entire area of medicube is under FPCON (Force Protection Condition) BRAVO.
FPCON (Force Protection Condition)
What's going on?
Is there a war going on somewhere?
"If so, I'm going to treat the enemy forces, too, since I took the Hippocratic Oath."
The entire medical team is commanded to gather.
Is the area of interest Medi Cube's field hospital?
A VIP patient is being transferred to Medi Cube.
How much time do we have?
"It's President Mubarat of the Arab league, who was returning from his unofficial visit to North Urk to establish agreement on a Middle Eastern peace treaty."
"As a royalty of Abu Dhabi who is third in line for succession, he has been involved in solving disputes and reaching peaceful agreements between political groups and border control."
He is known to be a key player in these matters.
"He's a strong candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the Middle Eastern peace treaty, but to his opposition, he's their number one target for assassination."
Get the car ready.
I'm headed to the Blue House.
These are the medical records sent by the VIP patient's doctor.
Okay.
What is this?
"If everything is censored, what exactly do they want us to read in order to diagnose?"
"In VIP patients' charts, there are more lies than truth anyway."
"You mean, they record false information on their patients' charts?"
What kind of crazy doctors would do that?
Doctors like me.
"Similar to how poor patients need doctors like Schweitzer,"
"VIPs need special doctors, too."
"To VIPs, their medical history can be their weakness."
That's why a president's health status is a national secret.
- What's the situation?
- Nothing special.

"No, I can't recall anything."
"Now, Mr. Maigret, what time was it when you told Axel Norstaad that you had just seen Miss Edie Morrow outside a motel called the Windmill Inn?"
"Axel stormed up to my house about 9:00, I'd say."
Maybe a few minutes later.
"And when he left your house, did he go in the direction of the motel?"
"Yes, sir."
"He-- well, he left my place running."
Running?
"Tell me this, how far is your place from the Windmill Inn?"
"It's about three blocks, that's all."
"Well, Axel came roaring into my barroom at the motel."
"When he got his breath back, he says he's looking for this Edie Morrow."
Says he's going to find her if he has to tear the place apart.
"Well, I finally got it across to him that she'd walked out some time before with a man named Somers."
What did the defendant say then?
He demanded to know where they'd gone.
All I could tell him was that Somers was staying at the motel.
So Axel rushed off again.
"Now, we've heard the testimony of the autopsy surgeon to the effect that Martin Somers met his death sometime between 9 and 9:30."
What time was it that the defendant rushed out of your barroom?
"Mm, 9:10, 9:15 maybe."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
No questions.
"Miss Pedersen, you were employed by the defendant as his confidential secretary?"
"No, sir."
"I was the entire office force-- stenographer, bookkeeper, everything."
From the time when I was still a young woman.
"Now, referring you to the morning after the homicidal death of Mr. Somers."
"On that morning, when you arrived at the Norstaad office, the defendant already there, and you saw him lighting something in the stove, is that correct?"
The stove?
The old-fashioned pot-bellied stove in which wood scraps were burned to keep the office warm in the winter.
"What will I do, thinkest thou?"
"Why, go to bed, and sleep."
I will incontinently drown myself.
"If thou dost, I shall never love thee after."
Why thou silly man.
It is silliness to live when to live is torment;
What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so fond;
- but is not in my virtue to amend it.
- Virtue!
A fig!
"Come, be a man."
Drown thyself!
Drown cats and blind puppies.
I have professed me thy friend;
I could never better stead three than now.
Put money in thy purse;
follow thou the wars;
"I say, put money in thy purse."
It cannot be that Desdemona... should long continue her love to the Moor... put money in thy purse.
When she is stated with his body... she will find the error of her choice:
therefore make money.
"If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning."
Make all the money thou canst:
if a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian... and a supersubtle Venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell... thou shalt enjoy her;
therefore make money.
Go to.
It is very difficult to work out what if anything motivates lago... in his campaign which is virtually against Othello.
"Various motives seem to be suggested in the course of the play... that he isjealous of Cassio's promotion to the lieutenancy, for example... that he suspects that Othello has been unfaithful with Emilia, lago's wife... that he himself, lago himself desires Desdemona."
But the multiplicity of motives makes it difficult to believe any of them.
"My own feeling is lago is evil, because he is evil."
I hate the Moor:
"By all means, send your bulletin."
We do need to speak to Tendu.
But not as a suspect.
"I mean, judging by this murder weapon..."
I think he was framed.
"According to the lab, blood type on the weapon is a match for Owen ""O.G."" Tuchman, and this guy"
Tendu's prints are all over it.
But you two still think he was framed?
"Well, circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing."
"It might seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different."
"Well, I don't know how you shift this."
"The blood matches the victim, and the hook matches the wounds."
The hook.
Precisely.
Tendu is an Inuit male from a traditional Inuit village.
"Hence, he's likely killed hundreds of seals."
"Only, seal hunters do not kill with the hook side of the hakapik."
That's used for hauling seal carcasses onto the boats.
"To kill, the hunters use the hammer."
"So if he had he swung this club, Tendu would likely have killed"
O.G. with a single blow from the hammer directly to the temple.
Okay.
So what went down?
From your shifted point of view.
"Well, imagine for one moment that Tendu was the killer's intended target."
"Only, he couldn't find him."
O.G. had taken pains to keep Tendu's whereabouts a secret.
"O.G. himself, however, he'd been out and about in the city, he'd been taking meetings, he'd been negotiating for his clients."
He would've been relatively easy to find and follow back to the hotel.
BELL:
We think that's why O.G.
was tortured before he was killed.
I've to drop these troublemakers often catch chopper to the main land.
You get your bottom to school.
"And Cody, give it time."
You'll find your place.
"Heatwave, Chase, Blades, Boulder."
"After careful consideration, I have chosen your new mission."
- Nice!
"- We are happy to join the battle, sir!"
"- So, when do we roll out?"
- You do not.
"As, perhaps, the last rescue bots in existence you are uniquely suited to help the people of this planet, as well as learn from them."
"You mean, we would interact with humans?"
You will be ambassadors to the people of this planet.
"The first autobots to live with a human family, study their customs, obey their rules, and work together to keep this planet safe."
"During this mission you four must appear to the humans... as machines, robots in disguise."
What?
"While the people of Earth are comfortable with advanced technology, the idea that alien beings are living among them will undoubtedly cause panic."
"So, we can help the humans as long as we hide our true selves."
"You are right to question what is best for your team, Heatwave."
That is why I am asking you to lead this mission.
"To maintain your cover, you will each adapt a vehicle mode based on Earth's technology."
Wow!
Look at those lines.
This thing's a powerhouse.
"Boulder, do you wish to scan first?"
"Ha, primitive."
But apparently they use this one for what I did back home.
Is this one first authorities use for ruling enforcement?
"It seems, your choice has been made for you, Blades."
"Wait, this thing flies."
He doesn't like heights.
"This is Chief Charlie Burns, he knows our secret, and will help you keep yours."
Just considering my options alright?
"Been a little tired of waiting for you, guys."
You're not going to.
Hope you guys got plenty of Cosmo to mix for the fairy.
What you say?
Don't mess up the party clothes.
- Come on.
"- I don't even like Cosmo, bitch!"
"Come on, go, that's great!"
"I almost sweat him, man."
Kappa Taus're like the gay fraternity on campus.
"Fit right in, good riddance."

Excuse me?
I want you to pack up your crap and get the hell out.

Calvin Owens has more potential than you'll ever have.
"And truthfully, Trend, I just don't have the time and the patience to teach you tolerance."
"I don't know who elected you, emperor of Omega Chi but you don't have the authority to kick me out, I'm not going anywhere."
Actually you're about 3 months late on your dues which if your checked the house rules is due cause for exposure.
I'll rally the brothers.
- I'll call nationals if I have to.
- Go ahead and call nationals.
"'Cause if I told them half the crap you've been making my ears blead with, you're gonna be bounced anyway."
I'm doing you a favor.
Take the easy road out.
You have until tomorrow.
I actually think these restrictions from the dean are god-sent 'cause they force us to be so much creative.
This is way better than some loud rowdy fraternity party.
I agree.
This was an inspired idea you did an absolutely lovely job pulling it together so quickly
Could be.
So he could have serviced a whole league team.
"Detective, presumably you've had semen tests performed, yes?"
"Yes, we did."
"Ah, most of it was ingested."
In his stomach?
Yes.
So my client's sperm was in there?
"Ah, no, it doesn't appear so."
"So, I'm sorry, but a veritable bevy of unknown men abuse this boy and then disappear back to the bosom of their loving families, and yet the only man the police investigate is my client, who's the only man we know for sure didn't have sex with Ben Rigby."
The boy was seen alive just before Mr Lorton went into the lane.
"What if my client had stumbled onto the boy already dying, killed not by him, but by any one of these anonymous gentle folk that he'd recently serviced?"
We have a witness who says he saw Mr Lorton murder the boy.
"Or could he have, at that distance, seen my client in fact remove the knife?"
"And if so, would he not be awash in Ben Rigby's blood?"
"Could that not explain the blood on my client, Detective?"
Possibly.
Is 'possibly' another word for 'yes'?
Yes.
Possibly.
"No further questions, Your Honour."
"That was it, eh?"
"I seen him go into the lane, pull out the knife, stab the poor little bastard."
Pica was off his nut.
"Thank you, Mr Shrimpton."
"Is this the first time you've given evidence in a criminal trial, Mr Shrimpton?"
No.
Murder cases?
"No, drug cases."
Cases?
I see.
"Isn't it true that on three occasions, you've been granted immunity from prosecution if you testified against the accused in these drug cases?"
Even some of the faster-moving animals are caught.

A sign that winter is nearly over.
The songs of male Weddell seals challenging their rivals to battle.
The male seal's calls can be heard over 15 miles away.
He aims to control the best breathing holes for they will determine his mating rights in spring.
His calls create powerful shockwaves in the water.
They are threats.
"This hole has already been claimed, and the owner will not surrender it willingly."
No change this time.
The challenger will need to find a hole with a weaker owner.
"The battles continue until the females arrive, and that time is now close."
The sun returns to Antarctica.
The longest night on earth has ended and winter begins to give way to spring.

"After four months feeding at sea, they are returning sleek and fat."
"Penguins, it seems, can fly after all."
But a winter at sea has left them a little out of practice.
There is no time to waste.
"Far away, the males are waiting."
"While the females were gone, the sea ice grew, and it's now twice the distance from its edge back to their colony."
"70 miles away, the males are in desperate need of help."
"Despite doing all they can to conserve their energy, many are close to dying from starvation."
SQUAWK!
SQUAWK!
SQUAWKING
Reunited after three months apart.
The reward for her return?
A first glimpse of her chick.
"The reunion made, it's time for the handover."
The father finds it hard to let go.
Some gentle persuasion is needed.
we reveal who Donald Trump is running against for President.
"- Plus, we'll show you the winning lottery numbers."
Could 67 be one of them?
- Now our top story:
two prisoners have escaped from the Coral Palms sheriff's station in a daring daylight jailbreak.
"Themen,identified asGregoryStickney andLarrySherbert werearrestedafter aroutinetrafficstop revealed a cache of automatic weapons."
"- Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell."
"- Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with-- really, I am, kiss whoever you want-- except they were both men."
- Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.
- I do a lot of meth.
- The sheriff's office is coordinating their search with local and state police.
"- If you're watching, Greg and Larry, and I know you are, my men and I will not rest until we find you."
"That's right, we're coming for you."
"- Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?"
"- The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead."
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
"- Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
"- Okay, I'll get some water."
"- Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?"
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
"- Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme:"
Code Rad.
- Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
"What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
- We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
"- I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a..."
"""hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
Good call.
"All right, let's get out of here."
"Follow instructions, follow instructions."
Understood.
With joy I would split that bastard's head with a single blow!
"There is no need to listen to our conversation in that manner, Mr. Dinamo."
we have nothing to hide.
"Very well, in that case, I only wish for you to answer some questions related to..."
We know about what.
"Here is all you need to know about the matter,"
"I hope that our data will help you resolve the case, and punish the perpetrator."
"This is quite queer, those same words I have heard from the lips of,"
Ms. Bristol.
I can see that you have quite the perfect organization.
"Oh no, no, Mr. Dinamo, we are men of action, businessmen, executives of important corporations,"
and we are not acustomed to wasting our time!
"What's the matter, Alex?"
Are you still dedicated to investigating?
Or to have fun taking plunges fully dressed?
"That is correct, Inspector, can't you see I am trying out the swimsuit I will model at the conference?"
"Good morning, Alex"
Good morning.
"Come in,"
I was expecting you.
Thanks.
I regret I can only offer you...this.
But I believe it may interest you.
"Ah, as I can see, you lot waste no time."
"we are men of action, businessmen, executives of important...,"
"Of important corporations, I know."
I know the script well.
"To tell the truth, your organization is too perfect for a plain conference."
But not that smart.
We shall meet again soon.
There it is.
"Not as good as the model, for sure."
"You're much more beautiful, Aliki."
No 27.
'I love you!
'
That's strange.
It's the only one without a price.
There must be someone here to ask about the price.
"It's not for sale, sir!"
"Perhaps the model was sold once, but this one, no."
This is absolutely mine.
"- So, that was the painter?"
"- Yes, that was him."
"Let's go, Dimitris!"
"Now, you shouldn't imagine that after this incident any novel-like tragic incident occurred."
Life has even more tragic finales.
Time crushes everything.
The years went by fast.
"It is, alas, inevitable."
Aliki submitted to the conventional life most rich married couples share.
where wealth is gradually taken for granted finally becoming an indifferent thing.
She also became a good mother giving birth to a son looking exactly like his father.
So people considered her marriage as happy like with all logical marriages not based on passionate love.
Passionate love remained in her heart...
No calendar ever managed to erase it.
She never again met Pavlos who developed into an acclaimed and famous artist...
Pavlos became what he always wanted to be.
"A true artist, a 'bohemian.'"
Free from any engagement that would force him  to make compromises in his life and art.
Aliki always followed his steps from afar reading with pride and secret joy about him in the papers which mentioned his name again and again.
Would Pavlos have remained a true artist  had he taken over a family burden on his shoulders?
But Islamic tribunals do not follow formal courtroom procedures.
Those who are asked to testify may speak as they wish.
"Thank you for your guidance, imam."
"Fatimah, did you discuss this marriage with your father?"
I told him I would not go through with it.
Did you ever express your rejection to Mr. Al-Jimri directly?
No.
I never saw him after my father announced the betrothal.
So the marriage was not consummated?
"No, it was not."
"Hearing this, Mustafa, tell us why do you wish to see this marriage declared valid?"
"Fatimah is still young, imam."
She is wilful.
Our marriage was not arranged lightly.
It unites two houses that share many interests.
"If it pleases the panel, shouldn't we consider whether Fatimah's interests were being served?"
I do not have to answer to her.
I have done no wrong.
Fatimah accepted her marriage.
Accepted it where?
Accepted it how?
"She took ownership of my mahr, the dowry."
The dowry was placed in her name by a contract her father set up.
- There was no action on her part.
- Not until she sold it.
"According to the kitab, the dowry was a villa in Spain."
Did you sell the property?
- Yes.
- And you kept the proceeds?
You must be aware that accepting the mahr is tantamount to consent to the marriage.
"But we have Shahada, supporting testimony, that will shed some light on this matter, from the best friend of the princess, my daughter."
Aneesa.
"I'm not so obtuse I cannot grasp the implications, Sir Francis."
"and if the claimant is ignorant of any conspiracy on their behalf on that count, my sister could have sent me to the scaffold."
"As your heir, the Queen of Scots would do the same given the opportunity."
And the blood she would shed would not be yours alone.
Her ambition for making them Catholic once more would engulf your people in a civil war more catastrophic that anything your sister ever inflicted on us.
"The physician awaits, Your Majesty."
Amend it.
The claimant must have knowledge of any conspiracy on their behalf.
"Proven knowledge, Sir Francis."
My signature contingent on that.
"As you know, Your Grace,"
The purpose of my examination is to ascertain whether there is any physical impediment to your bearing a child.
I'm afraid it requires that I...
"Do what you must, sir."
Get it over with!
I find nothing which prevents Her Majesty from bearing a child.
"A sublimation code, see?"
Every letter of the alphabet is replaced by another.
These..uh.. coded symbols.
They indicate the key words.
Some letters appear with more frequency.
"The letter E, for example..."
"But the content, sir!"
Does Babington lay out the details of their conspiracy?
If it sufficient?
"""Proven knowledge"" is what Her Majesty demanded."
For that we need the Queen of Scots response.
"All shall come to ye who waits, Master Phelippes."
"Excuse me, sir."
Come come!
Come!
"The Earl of Leicester, they are close, are they not?"
"Oh, no, run, I mean."
What are we supposed to do here?
"Oh, no!"
"Everett, you have to pick that up."
"Come on, Everett."
Keep up.
"Oh, he's missed the footman."
Nice action with the steering.
Oh!
Brilliant.
"No, they're going through it anyway."
Excellent race.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner."
"Mr. Everett and I wouldn't kind of go anywhere, and one of the reasons why I am so sure about that is because I've had the chance to meet Mr. Carrington."
"Being a 21st-century girl, I'm also frightened of being hurt"
So all I can do is be myself and try and spend time with him.
"Um, maybe, kind of using the purpose of the game, try to get my chaperone to engineer some time so we can genuinely spend time to getting to know each other, because at the end of the day"
we haven't spent that much time together.
On your marks... get ready...
Hypnotherapist Tom Fortes-Mayer arrives at the Regency House.
"Mesmerists, as they were then called, were doctors of the heart and mind."
Many were fashionable quacks;
others were motivated by genuine scientific inquiry.
Now you may soon find your mind begins to wander.
My words as a melody may move through your system.
"Leaving romance aside,"
"Mr. Carrington returns to his first love, music."
He's reliving an historic hypnotic experiment.
"And I want you imagine that whilst you play, actually you can see the energy, that magnetism, that movement moving from your soul through that instrument."
Mozart wrote the opera Così fan tutte while being hypnotized by the famous Anton Mesmer.
Mr. Fortes-Mayer will have equal success with him.
"and create some power, some change you could make"
"I was married to her seven or eight years ago, but she got a divorce."
[Mason] I see.
"Your Honor, I would like to request an adjournment until tomorrow morning."
"Why, Mr. Mason?"
"Well, it is approaching the hour of adjournment, and my examination of this witness may be rather lengthy."
I see.
Mr. Burger?
"Well, Your Honor,"
"If counselor really wants time to prepare for this hearing a little more fully,"
I think the prosecution might exercise tolerance.
"I think that's uncalled for, Mr. Burger."
Court stands adjourned till 10:00 tomorrow morning.
That certainly was a nasty crack Burger made when you asked for an adjournment.
Nasty but accurate.
"If Burger had a client as confused and frightened as Merle Telford, he'd be stalling every other minute."
She certainly hasn't been much help.
"After all the hours you've spent talking to her, for her to suddenly think of this Gina Gilbert."
"Apparently, Gina became acquainted with Merle while taking pictures of her house for a magazine."
Then she introduced her to Danny and subtly arranged for them to meet a number of times.
Sounds like a well worked out campaign.
"Yes, but not a campaign for Danny to marry Merle."
His wife had never filed for a divorce.
"Well, whatever it was between Danny and the Gilbert woman, it wasn't romance."
"I don't know who yet, but she's seeing somebody."
So perhaps Danny was a business arrangement.
It'll be hard to prove.
"And if Gina was anywhere near the party that night,"
"I didn't see her, and I can't find anybody who did."
"At a big party, that doesn't rule it out, Paul."
That's true.
"Look, if Mrs. Langley was unconscious during the theft, there'd be no reason for Danny to kill her-- that is, if Danny was the thief."
No.
"Today, only a few humans still live in deep contact with nature..."
On some of the last pristine places on on earth.
They continue a traditional way of life...
That has been practised almost unchanged... for thousands of years.
A way of life that has stood the test of time...
And allows them to live in harmony with the natural surroundings.
These may be some of the last remaining people to live in traditional lifestyle...
Based on a wisdom passed down through countless generations.
Many people have never heard their voices.
"Now, it may be time to listen."
My voice been told by my parents and my grandparents... which was the same message they received from their grandparents for many generations...
That was to treat Earth as a mother.
When we respect the Earth mother then she provides for us.
And all the things that we see on our way...
Four legged animals...
The ones in the ocean...
Even the hills and boulders...
They are relatives.
By them learning that we are all related...
We also learn responsibility to keep our planet alive.
As I young boy...
"When I stood next to great tree, a big fullgrowing tree..."
I felt really small.
"I fell that I still had a place, here at this great tree..."
Bigger than me...
Being on Earth longer...
And I feel one with it.
The way that my ancestors were able to maintain a unity...
Within natural enviroment...
Was to see all things sacred.
"Meaning, there was spirit in everything."
We always respected our elders.
The night that Lucas Cross left town... I performed what I recorded as an appendectomy on Selena Cross.
It was not an appendectomy.
I falsified my records.
I assisted her in a miscarriage.
A miscarriage of Lucas Cross' baby.
I said that it was Lucas Cross' baby that Selena Cross carried.
I object to admitting any such statement as evidence!
On what grounds do you base your objection?
It's the unsupported conclusion of the witness.
-Except that it is true.
-Can you testify of knowledge?
-I can!
-Objection overruled.
Continue.
I have here a complete admission of guilt... signed by Lucas Cross.
Will the attorneys please approach the bench?
"I offer Lucas Cross' confession in evidence, your Honor."
"I object, your Honor."
The confession of a person who's neither a witness nor a party... is totally inadmissible.
The prosecution may have a sound point.
But I'll reserve my ruling until I've heard that witness testimony.
"And, if I find it inadmissible, I'll order it stricken."
"Dr. Swain's whole testimony stricken from the record, your Honor."
I'll rule on that when I've heard it.
"You will complete your statement, Dr. Swain."
I'm sure the prosecutor will see that the State investigate my records.
And perhaps I could lose the privilege of practicing Medicine.
And it's time that someone spoke up and paid whatever price is asked... for the privilege of speaking.
Selena killed Lucas out of fear.
Fear of being forced to submit to him again.
And then she hid her crime... for fear of how we'd react to her being assaulted by her stepfather.
She couldn't trust us with the truth.
"Judge, are you going to let me put on a case here or not?"
Mr. McBride--
"Mr. McBride, call your next witness or rest."
"Based on your professional knowledge and experience, what do you think happened to Ryan Larson?"
"Based on the size of the explosion taken from the video by the fishermen, it was caused by a large amount of the napalm-based fuel and something else, too:"
munitions.
What do you mean?
Do you mean bombs?
"We don't like to use the term ""bombs,"""
"but yes, bombs."
Did Ryan Larson ever work on cluster bombs?
- Officially?
- Mm-hmm.
Nobody worked on cluster bombs at Borns Tech.
"Officially, we didn't make them."
"They're banned, indiscriminate devices that killed way too many civilian women and kids."
"So earlier, Gina Larson testified that this was found buried in her backyard."
Can you tell us what this is?
"Well, that right there is a model of a banned weapon using illegal fuel and cluster bombs which Borns Tech developed."
Okay.
And with this model we found these guys.
Can you tell us what these are?
Those are blueprints for what appears to be a cluster bomb system.
Thank you.
Nothing further.
- Thank you.
"- Mr. Berring, you were fired from Borns Tech because of mental health issues relating to fantasy and occasionally hearing voices."
"Okay, but that-- that's-- it's--"
"Yes, amongst other things."
Including anger.
"Anger's a big one for you, isn't it?"
You sought revenge against an ex-girlfriend for breaking up with you by posting a video of the two of you having sex on the internet without her consent.
You're really talking to the man who took her.
"Well, how do we know he'll be watching?"
My team's coordinating with local media to get the word out.
He'll be watching.
"And if I do this, then he'll let Josie go?"
"There's a chance, yes."
"Word just in from a local hospital that Ellie Zumwalt, recovering from injuries suffered in the latest attack on local families, is going to speak to the public within an hour."
"We don't know what this unexpected statement will be, but concern is rising for the hours passed with no word on her abducted daughter."
"Come on, Penelope, think."
Patrick Sorenson didn't just vanish into thin air.
There's gotta be some way that he...
"Oh, yes, there might be some Thomas Alva Edison in me yet."
"What do you got, Garcia?"
"What I have got is Betty Cordray of Wichita, Kansas, which I know makes no sense, but actually, Betty Cordray is not Betty Cordray, she's Betty Sorenson of long-lost fame."
The mother who abandoned Patrick.
None other.
Is she still in the area?
No.
"She died 6 weeks ago of kidney failure, and then when the paperwork started, you know, the paperwork that happens when you die, her real identity was revealed and Patrick was called as her next of kin."
That must have been the trigger.
That's when he dropped off the map in New York.
"Yeah, and if he was holding out hope for answers from that mother one day, that hope was suddenly gone."
"Garcia, did Betty Sorenson own any property in the Wichita area?"
"Nope, she lived in a studio apartment."
"Then after she died, was she buried or cremated?"
Uh...
Neither.
"She was held in the morgue, Patrick was called to identify her body, but he never showed up."
I guess she's still there?
"All right, I'll check it out."
We're recording.
This is a message for my child.
"The illustrious King of Scots was buried here, at Dunfermline Abbey, near his wife."
"The dead King, and the first king of something that had never existed before."
"The very word ""Scots"" meant something different."
"There was a Scottish people now, loyal to a Scottish throne."
"No more confusion, no more divided loyalties."
The bishops and the Bruce had done theirjob.
It was a revolution.
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
"His five-year-old son David succeeded Robert the Bruce on 7th June, 1 329."
"The following year, James Douglas took the Bruce's heart on crusade against the Moors in northern Spain, and died there."
"The heart, having fulfilled its promise, was found on the battlefield, returned to Scotland and buried in Melrose Abbey."
"After his death, the legend of the Bruce did what legends do."
It ate things up.
It ate the human being.
"All that was left was Robert the Bruce, the soldier King who fought for Scottish liberty and won."
"It left a suit of armour, and this face, resolute and empty."
The legend hid his consuming guilt.
"It rarely mentioned the bishops who'd chosen him, and who had guided his every step."
It barely muttered the names of his lost family.
It shrunk the Scottish casualties and multiplied the English armies he'd defeated.
It blurred the medievalness of what he did.
"It made it about liberty for all, instead of a revolution that established a free and independent Scottish crown."
"On November 24th 1 331 ,"
David and Joan were enthroned as King and Queen of Scotland.
There was no Stone of Destiny.
Edward III had promised to return it and hadn't.
"But at last, there was an ampulla of sacred oil from the Pope."
The bottle of independence from the English crown.
Final proof of the Bruce's triumph.
Final proof that the Scottish crown was free and quit of English authority.
"Final proof that the reign of Good King Robert had been worth everything, all the deaths and horror."
!
To understand their strength and movement.
"No, hey Brother!"
(BuYeo Palace)
What is it that you want?
The Han Dynasty is preparing to wage war against the barbarians of South-West Yi.
"The Emperor is offering a chance for BuYeo to show her loyalty by pledging 10,000 soldiers to the cause"
in return for the Emperor's benevolence.
This is also a good chance to mend the failing diplomacy between our two countries
"Knowing His Majesty, he'd never send reinforcements"
I agree with you.
"If the previous King were still around, he would have declined immediately."
"But this time, it seems he did not give an answer at all."
Might he have something up his sleeves?
What other motives would he have?
It must be because of the recent trade issues.
His Majesty is aware that in refusing... the people of BuYeo might be put in a difficult position.
It is this that His Majesty is worried about.
Chief General!
Yes.
"Won't sending out 10,000 soldiers as reinforcements lead to any problems for us?"
"We cannot mobilize the soldiers in BuYeo, as well as those at the border."
"But if we send out SachulDo troops,"
BuYeo's defense will not be compromised.
His Majesty is aware of this as well.
"Prime Minister,"
"If we send out reinforcements,"
What do you think we can gain out of it?
"For one, we can easily settle the trade issues."
We can also request to learn the art of forging steel from the Hans.
"After we send out reinforcements, we can also request that they be responsible for arming the reinforcements and expenditures."
Great idea!
And while it's difficult to hear
It will happen.
"And while it's difficult to hear this truth, it is essential that"
"And while it's difficult to hear this truth, it is essential that you accept it, this truth, it is essential that you accept it, because every second that goes you accept it, because every second that goes by in which you don't is a"
because every second that goes by in which you don't is a second of your precious by in which you don't is a second of your precious and finite life second of your precious and finite life that you risk wasting.
and finite life that you risk wasting.
So I'm going to say it once that you risk wasting.
"So I'm going to say it once more, and this time, try as hard"
"So I'm going to say it once more, and this time, try as hard as you can to believe me."
"more, and this time, try as hard as you can to believe me."
"You, yes, you, will die, and there is nothing you can do to stop it."
How's that?
you can do to stop it.
How's that?
Whatthe(bleep)?
How's that?
Whatthe(bleep)?
Toomuch?
Whatthe(bleep)?

"Yeah,that'salot  for a first date."

"Also,what'swith the hourglass?"
"Also,what'swith the hourglass?"
Do you just carry that thing the hourglass?
Do you just carry that thing around for dramatic effect?
"Catholics became a majority on the Privy Council,"
Catholics were appointed to the control of royal burghs.
Little was lacking from James's victory.
Only the United Societies remained.
He set a price on Renwick's head by proclamation.
"£100, dead or alive."
It was clear to Renwick what his God required of him.
"He would preach in the fields outside Edinburgh, he would even enter the city itself."
He would make it easy for the King's men to find him.
The authorities entered the house he was staying in.
"Renwick shot one of them, escaped, but couldn't or wouldn't run."
"He walked this far, to Castle Wynd, where he was captured."
He was too important a prize for simple execution.
"For two weeks, the authorities attempted to extract from him a confession that he had never done God's work."
This proved impossible.
His execution was finally fixed for February 17th 1688.
"On the scaffold, Renwick spoke for King Jesus at considerable length."
He recited Psalm 103.
"""The Lord has established His throne in Heaven, and His kingdom rules over all."""
"He read from Revelations, Chapter 19."
"""Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God,"
"""that ye may eat the flesh of kings."""
"And he concluded, ""Lord, I die in the faith that you will not leave Scotland,"
"""but that you will make the blood of your witnesses the seed of your Church,"
"""and return again and be glorious in our land."
"""And now, Lord, I am ready."""
Renwick's death made James feel safe.
He could ignore the Covenant.
"He was anointed by God, an absolute monarch, unchallenged."
And then he did what his brother had failed to do - he secured the future of the Stuart dynasty.
"On the 10th of June of that year, the King's wife gave birth to a healthy male heir, James Francis Edward."
A rhyme began to do the rounds.
My wish was to be close to Her Highness.
My wish was to be worthy of her.
And to be of some service to her...
But I...
"If power is the only thing that I can win now, then that is..."
"Is that you, Harklight?"
Enter.
M-Milord Slaine...
Miss Eddelrittuo?
We are quite satisfied with your ship's current actions.
"For the time being, we want you to continue providing unit support as a commando squad."
I have no objections to that.
But about that proclamation by Princess Asseylum...
That nonsense about founding a new dynasty in Earthspace?
It's nothing but big talk meant to stir up the Mars Knights.
Something along those lines.
That might be the case.
But perhaps we should consider the possibility that the enemy's attacks might be about to move to the next level.
"We're sitting on our thumbs, doing nothing?"
Is that what you are implying?
"No, sir."
I meant nothing of the sort.
"As far as new operations go, we are currently coordinating with our primary units."
"Once that has been finalized, you will be contacted."
"You might be unhappy with your status as a commando unit, but there is no telling how much faith we can put in a ship that runs on the enemy's power."
"Not to put too fine a point on it, but that's just how it is."
I'm amazed that you sat through that without any outbursts.
Did you want me to?
"Remember, I'm only here as your escort."
"Anyway, I'm not that naive."
They just don't understand.
They probably just don't know what they've got.
"A delay that long would be disastrous, but there is an alternative."
Liberator can make the journey in four days.
What I've suggested is that Avon and Cally stay here and help you with your repairs.
"I take the neutrotope to Destiny, and then come back to collect them."
No.
We can't do that.
We can't just hand over the neutrotope to some passing stranger.
I agree.
"We've been trusted with this mission, we can't simply forget our responsibility."
There are plenty of ready markets for the neutrotope.
"If it was stolen and sold, a man could be wealthy beyond imagining."
"That thing is a temptation even for those of us with our homes, families, and lives at stake."
"You have nothing at stake, nothing to lose."
It is frequently easier to be honest when you have nothing to lose.
The responsibility for the neutrotope belongs to all of you.
"There is a risk that if you entrust it to me,"
I may fly off never to be seen again.
"You have to weigh that chance against the effects a year's delay would have, on the possibility of your planet's recovery."
"We've made the offer, the choice is up to you."
Remember that Avon and I will be staying.
We will regard ourselves as hostages against Blake's return.
"Well thank you Cally, what a clever idea."
Blake will return.
You can bet your life on it.
"In fact, you've just bet both our lives on it."
"Personally, I have no hesitation about accepting the offer."
Delivery of the neutrotope is vital.
"And anyway, after what's happened here, it may well be safer with Blake."
"However, we'll vote on it."
Those in favour?
"That's about four to three, in favour."
We accept gratefully.
That's all he said.
"""Eleven."""
"Ms. Zumwalt, do your or anybody in the family own an hourglass?"
Police found this in your living room.
I've never seen that before in my life.
"What you got, baby girl?"
"What I've got is fail, fail, and more fail."
"Remember Thomas Alva Edison, Penelope."
"""I have not failed."
"I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."""
"Ok, let me rephrase what I just said."
I'm currently waist-deep in what is not working.
"Despite the distinctive craftsmanship,"
"I cannot figure out who made these hourglasses, and I haven't been able to find a single person who recently relocated from upstate New York to Wichita."
Something must connect our unsub to the Seneca River.
"All the sand in the world right here and this guy brings dirt from 1,500 miles away."
"Garcia, you confirmed that the hourglasses were handcrafted?"
"Oh, for sure."
"We're talking topnotch museum quality, but not by any artisan known in the high-end glass-blowing community, and yes, there is such a thing as the high-end glass-blowing community."
"All right, look for boys ages 8 to 12 who were sexually victimized and/or abducted in upstate New York in the mid-1990s, all right?"
Ok.
Hit you back if and when.
They're analyzing the sand from both hourglasses now to see if it matches what was put in the victims' eyes.
So far no prints or DNA.
The unsub's careful.
And precise.
I calculated the width of hourglass necks with the average grain of sand having a .2-millimeter
diameter and a volume of .0042
cubic millimeters.
"Given the weight of the sand, that's a gravity flow duration of 3,600 seconds."
"You know, obviously give or take a few."
"Skill level off the charts, yet his work is unknown."
Why do you always say it like I'm not focusing?
Just do what you did before.
"Ah, before we had a Nazi trying to kill us."
This is just a vase.
Come on.
"I never thought I'd utter these words, but I think we need a Nazi."
- Not funny.
"- Look, the reason I keep telling you to focus is because transmutation is a literal function of mind over matter."
"Dude, this sucks."
Why do I always got to
- be in the driver's seat?
"- Oh, don't despair, Jefferson."
"This is only our second attempt at transmutation, and, you know, they always say, ""The third time's a charm."""
What?
Third time.
Three rituals.
I-I think I know what Savage is planning to do.
I figured out how Savage plans to erase time.
I believe he intends to detonate each of these meteors in a different time period.
How can you destroy the world three times in three different times?
"You can't, it would create a temporal paradox."
"Which would result in a timequake that would return the Earth to the point of the first chronothermic reaction,"
- Ancient Egypt.
"- Okay, it's official."
This is the craziest bad guy plan in the history of bad guy plans.
I don't think that sanity is a yardstick by which Vandal Savage can be measured.
"Okay, so which time periods are we talking here?"
You said Savage was in possession of one of these meteorites in 1958.
"That was a year of a rare alignment, with the Earth and Thanagar."
Evidently he got hold of a second meteorite in 1944.
Which would be useless to him in a year where Earth and Thanagar weren't in alignment.
"Now, if my math is correct, and trust me, it is, the next two years that Earth and Thanagar are in sync are 1975 and 2021."
"The King was taken to a castle, to die, some thought."
"And then, magically, as spring came, the King recovered."
He returned to the slaughter.
"He came here, to Barra Hill, near Aberdeen."
"The Earl of Buchan had dug himself in at the summit, amidst the remnants of an Iron Age hill fort."
"It was, he thought, an impregnable location."
He was wrong.
By now the Bruce's reputation rode ahead of him.
The Earl of Buchan lost his cavalry to simple terror.
Then he lost the battle too.
"John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, last of the Comyn nobility, fled to England."
He was dead within the year.
There were still supporters of the Comyns to exterminate.
King Robert rode north.
He came to Duffus Castle and the Bruce laid waste.
"Then he sent his brother, Edward, eastward into Buchan, the heartland of Comyn power."
The Bruce did not forgive it.
"On his orders, such damage was done that the land was infertile for a generation."
But it was not the land he damaged.
He didn't just burn the crops.
That would have made the land fertile in the coming year.
"He ordered the slaughter of the livestock, and not only the animals, but those who tended them and who grew the crops - men, women and children."
Parts of Buchan were left barren for a generation because there was no-one left alive.
ROBERT THE BRUCE:
Ihave split the blood of innocent men...
NEIL OLIVER:
"ByMarch of 1309, the Bruce had crushed resistance almost everywhere in Scotland."
"In the July of the previous year, the Pope had lifted his ban of excommunication."
"So he was officially back in the fold, one of the saved, at least for the time being."
Now it was time to get on with the business of kingship.
"Here at St Andrews, in a cathedral nearing completion after 1 50 years, he called his first parliament."
"It was a funny sort of parliament, by modern standards."
"My wife has a touch of the baby blues, and you want to lock her up?"
No one's locking anyone up.
I just want her to get the help that she needs.
"- Oh, by giving her drugs."
- Maybe.
Ignoring it is not gonna make it go away.
It needs to be treated the same as any other disease.
"This could happen again, only next time, it could be worse."
"Judy, please."
"You could die, Judy."
Your baby could die!

Did you ever think it possible that God in His infinite mystery could produce two mortal beings so perfectly matched in taste and temperament... who could think and feel and see and act as one?
"Everyday now since we met, I look out there and know there is a natural order to the universe."
And what chance was there?
"Among the random, drifting moats of all creation that our paths could ever hope to cross until... that hellish Hogmanay at Richard McCauley's."
WOMAN:
Where I swear I was truly contemplating the efficacy of self-impalement as a means of escape.
Forgive me.
-Jack Coulson.
-Roberta Samms.
"God, I'm sorry."
I must be the only man in Christendom who cannot see the pleasure in barking and whooping like a rooster while capering about the room among a colony of simpletons.
"Also, the choice inanities that seem to charm a lady on these occasions are beyond my wit, I'm afraid."
So you see before you a hopeless social misfit.
You have just articulated every sense of frustration and alienation in my soul.
I'm honoured to make your acquaintance.
- Police?
Open it.
I saw you all coming in.
What's going on?
I'm investigating your neighbor's disappearance.
You hear or see anything suspicious last night?
- Which neighbor?
- Kayla LeSeur.
"Oh, man."
We heard her arguing last night out on the balcony.
"Yeah, around midnight."
I saw her through the window with a guy.
- You recognize him?
- Yeah.
Marcy had me come take a look.
I've seen him around a few times.
"I think my wife will agree with me, I genuinely care, don`t care for um much um hyperbole when it comes to these things but er it`s been rather marvellous hasn`t it?"
The celebrations were premature.
The new system may have been functioning in most of London but it wasn`t yet in the East end.
Less than three months after the grand opening of Crossness the cholera returned.
Once again health officials had to resort to desperate measures.
The possessions of victims were fumigated with sulphur in a vain attempt to stop the disease spreading.
But once again William Farr had the grim task of registering the deaths.
And there was a puzzle.
With the sewers almost complete the worst of the smell had gone.
So why had the cholera come back?
This reservoir provides drinking water to the East end.
l`m assured by the East London water company that the river that feeds it has been filtered to cleanse it thoroughly.
Yet earlier today I saw something very strange.
That strange thing could be the vital clue that eventually led Farr to unmask the true course of cholera.
The Russell family`s water supply in Poplar had suddenly stopped.
After five days without water Mr Russell unscrewed the tap and found an eel fourteen inches in length.
How come you are here?
"I didn't know you were so proficient in making deals, Mr. President."
"If one more person can go to college with this legislation, I won't have any regrets."
Didn't you once say your position was to serve?
When did that seat become the seat of deal-making?
"When you participate in politics, there are times when you need to justify for the cause."
"When you ordered the lives of 21 men to be oxidized, it was for the great cause, too, I suppose."
"A lot of people want the Private School Reform Bill because tuition is expensive; however,"
"The National Assembly that makes laws... those seats are filled by college presidents and professors and department heads, along with their in-laws and their relatives."
Do you think they can be easily persuaded?
I have no other way.
No way...
Let me ask you one question.
Is it okay for an orphan to steal sohe has food to eat?
You cannot coerce sacrifice for the great cause.
"You cannot cover up corruption, for the great cause."
The classified document that's sealed until 2030...
I have it.
The decision you said you wouldn't regret...
I'll make you regret it.
This is my... great cause.
"President, are you okay?"
Yeah...
I was just about to get up.
"Agent Kim Na Na, what's going on?"
It's nothing.
"It had already been 30 minutes and the President still hadn't come out, so..."
"Right, let's leave."
Bear Na Na.
You say you're a journalist?
"I was the one in charge of the money during the presidential election, I've been living away from government life in order to avoid trouble for Mr. President."
How did you find me?
Disciplined spontaneity.
We stove for the most extreme intensification of possibilities.
We elevated passion above reason.
"We rescued the German people from their drab, predictable lives."
"We gave them a sense of heroic belonging, a vision of victorious triumph over evil."
"A man will do anything, as long as you take him step by step."
Break a shop window.
Rough up a labor leader.
Turn a neighborhood into a ghetto.
Shoot a man.
Eliminate.
Erase.
If you asked a civilized people to take this last step first... it would be impossible.
No!
Give me that.
Let's start again.
"Only as each order was obeyed with absolute fidelity, did I recognize the possibilities."
"My mind leapt ahead to the most extreme, fantastic scenarios."
"But my advice is, go slow."
Take small steps.
"A desire fulfilled must be followed by a somewhat larger request, a slightly greater brutality."
Let the momentum build.
"To my astonishment, I found I could experience the sensation of absolute power."
The whole system functioned to obey my commands.
"Each member of the armed forces swore obedience, unconditionally, to me."
The nation celebrated my birthday.
Every German schoolboy pledged:
"""l swear to devote all my energies, my strength to the savior of our country, Adolf Hitler."
I am ready and willing to lay down my life for him so help me God.
"One Volk, one Reich, one Führer."""
A mere flicker of my imagination could be transformed into a giant deed.
"Sketch a museum, it is built."
Defense contractors hire ex-military.
We may be able to connect him to Borns Tech that way.
"Yeah, but Stoltz was never mentioned in any of the Borns Tech files."
Oh.
We haven't gone through all of them yet.
"Besides, that's not going to be there."
[cough] They'd never admit that he's theirs.
What is this?
"That's part of a Borns Tech cluster bomb that just wiped out all those people you saw in the other images, all those women, children, civilians."
"Okay, we move to suppress this."
"Yeah, no shit."
I'm sure you do.
"Our witness, who happens to be their ex-employee, will testify that this is the finished product of the model that we found buried in Ryan's backyard."
"Now, they're saying that they don't make cluster bombs, and this proves that they're lying."
Ms. Senate?
"Obviously, these images are irrelevant."
There are no markings that identify it as a Borns Tech product.
There's no reason to think that our client had anything to do with making or selling that.
Our witness will testify that this was built to Borns Tech blueprints and of the Borns Tech model.
"Okay, this is trial by surprise bullshit, Your Honor."
We don't know what that is
- or where it came from--
- Your Honor.
...even if it's real.
"You sure it didn't look familiar to you, Leonard?"
"Its probative value is substantially outweighed by their prejudicial impact on the jury, and we've had no time to review them."
The images are disallowed.
"- Oh, come on."
- Why?
Are you kidding me?
It lacks foundation and is unduly prejudicial.
The images are disallowed.
How about lead poisoning?
Lead poisoning symptoms don't appear this suddenly though.
"By chance, was he sucking on something?"
Yes.
He was sucking on his fingers while asking me to give him something.
I don't know what he was asking me to give.
Dirty.
Dirty.
Eat this.
Me.
Me.
Me.
"We'll have to start with detoxification, so give him some IV drip with some nutrients and vitamin C, as well as EDTA"
Are you saying it is lead poisoning?
It's anemia caused by malnutrition.
"But because lead was ingested, the red blood cells (RBCs) absorbed the lead since it was receiving any nutrients."
"Since the lead intake increased too quickly, it became an acute poisoning."
Captain is awesome.
I'll bring the medicine.
Let me know when he wakes up.
I can translate some stuff for you.
I will be grateful if you help out.
"But from now on, let the medical team take care of medical--"
"If you're grateful, all you need to do is be grateful."
- What do you mean?
"- You said that life has dignity, and there is no higher value nor ideology than that."
I'm saying that you seem too different from the Dr. Kang I once knew.
Anemia from malnutrition and symptoms of iron poisoning are illnesses that rarely occur nowadays in Korea.
"In this country, they are as common as the cold."
"Even if these illnesses are rare in occurrence, it would have been nicer if a doctor who knew about them came."
"Of course, that is true."
"However, not all doctors in this world are like Schweitzer."
"S."""
Strife was internecine during the next fortnight.
"But I suffered the more, ...for my father had greater reserves to draw on."
"One day, by chance, a weapon came to hand."
I met an old acquaintance of school days named Jorkins.
I never had much liking for Jorkins but I greeted him with enthusiasm and asked him to dinner.
My father was quick to retaliate.
He made a little fantasy for himself that Jorkins should be an American.
"So nice of you to come all this way, Mr Jorkins."
"Oh, it isn't far."
Really only a matter of minutes.
Ah.
Science annihilates distance.
You are over here on business?
"Well, I'm in business if that""s what you mean."
"I had a cousin who was in business, you wouldn't know him it was before your time."
I was telling Charles about him only the other night.
He has been much in my mind.
He came a cropper.
You find his misfortune the subject for mirth?
Or perhaps you were unfamiliar with the word I used.
You no doubt would say folded up.
"Well, I don't know that..."
I mean...
I suppose with your standards you find our life here very parochial.
My father was master of the situation.
"Throughout the evening he played... a delicate, one-sided parlour game with him... explaining any peculiarly English terms... in the conversation, translating pounds into dollars... so that my guest was left with the vague sense that... there was a misconception somewhere as to his identity which he never got the chance of explaining."
I mean...
if...
Only once I thought my father had gone too far.
"Of course, I'm afraid living in London you must sadly miss your national game."
My national game?
Yeah.
I can see your shape.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Good.
"We met up with Anthony three months after his implant was turned on, to see how he's adapting."
Can you see these people walking past?
Yup.
That's good.
Anthony:
"I still have to use my cane to navigate, but it does work."
I can see you.
And I feel more involved in what's going on around me.
"That was a truck, a big truck, a bus or something."
Yeah.
"Rather than being totally blind, I have, like, visual cues that I didn't have, that I lost years ago."
I see it as a start.
"There's a lot more advances, but until that day comes, you know, this is as good as it gets so I'm, I'm grateful."

Marijuana legalization is gaining huge momentum across the country.
But it isn't just pot smokers who are celebrating.
Big business is also investing heavily in this hot new market.
"And if the current trend in legislation continues, it seems that they're going to realize a huge return on their investment."

"Okay, guys, if this is your first marijuana tour, which I'm assuming it is, thank you for coming to Colorado Cannabis Tours."
We're gonna go ahead and get you started with some joints.
Morris:
This is what the end of marijuana prohibition looks like.
"Now that marijuana is legal in Colorado, companies like Colorado Cannabis Tours are cashing in on the excitement."
"$99 for the ticket, $20 for an artisanal pipe, two dollars for the cupcake, Thank you."
"However much money for the weed they bought at the last location, how much money they're gonna spend at the next location."
This is the team building portion of the exercise.
"Yes, eyes like those of a saint."
Anyone would probably say they were beautiful.
Do you understand?
"In other words, there was consistency, no contradiction."
"When we met again in Khanka, your eyes were still as beautiful as I remembered."
The eyes of someone who has no human weakness.
I thought it would've been pretty nice if I could've killed you the way you were then.
But that...
What's with that face?
Venom spotted!
It's in the Jordan area.
Equip the ARX-7 with a rapid-deployment booster.
"Supply it with a Boxer shot cannon, and put it on standby in the elevator."
"Captain, the use of the Arbalest is supposed to be prohibited."
We can use it as a decoy.
I want to reduce the danger they are in as much as I can.
"And besides, Sagara still hasn't..."
"I am sorry to say this, Captain, but the only conclusion I can come to is that Sagara has abandoned his mission."
Relying on that AS and that man is an obvious mistake.
You cannot say that for certain.
This is not some school club activity!
I am well aware of that!
Are you going to lecture me now of all times?
"Ma'am, this time I simply refuse to stand by and watch!"
"You are allowing your personal feelings to interfere, and are even trying to twist an order from the highest level!"
What will become of the organization and its regulations?
"Not only that, you are giving preferential treatment to an officer who has abandoned his duty."
This is outrageous!
Very well.
"Then tell me, who was it who forced a ridiculous amount of heavy responsibility upon that officer?"
"Well, uh..."
It was us!
"But when she had finished her lines, about the 3rd job, she went over to a corner and started to laugh."
She covered her face with her yashmak first.
She knew all about that 3rd job herself.
"When we finished filming, the discussion started in earnest."
"We tend to think that feminism is restricted to progressive, advanced societies."
That it only has a place in highly developed countries.
"But if you scratch the surface, you see that relations between the sexes follow the same patterns the world over."
Women are capable of talking about themselves.
Sometimes they are allowed and sometimes not.
"But here, it was a real discussion."
Don't men have a 3rd job?
Is it only women?
Why?
"If a man doesn't do his 3rd job, he is dishonoured."
The 3rd job is as heavy as a mountain on his shoulders.
"It's difficult, it's not as easy as you think."
Am I wrong?
The dialogue was supposed to happen on film.
"But when we'd finished, they started the subject back up in their own language, which is more animated, warmer and more real than ours."
The photo
"It's normal, they have their intimacy"
and they want to preserve it.
They hate having their photo taken.
"We ask them to act in a film, but taking their photo is very different."
"That can happen anywhere in the world, in Africa, people would pose in front of our cameras."
But others forbade us to photograph them.
"It depends on the person and their personality, it's nothing to do with Cinema, really."
"I've seen it on film shoots, a person's disposition, their personality, counts a great deal."
No photos!
- Was I wrong to give it back?
- I'll put it away.
I said no photos.
"It's a lovely offer, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline."
It's just I don't really like mixing business with pleasure.
"You know, it just wouldn't be professional."
And we're nothing if not professionals.
Exactly.
"Well, I..."
Good evening.
[Man] Can I borrow your knife?
- [Man #2] There you go.
- Thanks.
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."""
I told you our suite was haunted.
It is not haunted.
They're trying to sell newspapers.
"Mr. Deline, my wife has had to endure tremendous pain and suffering, and the way I see it, you and the Montecito Corporation... had a legal obligation to disclose the presence of that ghost before we purchased the residence."
It was clearly a pre-existing condition.
"But, you know, I'm thinking you're gonna have hell finding a judge to hear this particular case."
"Well, I'm hoping that legal action won't be necessary."
"""A ghost ruined my condo""?"
I would actually pay to hear that testimony.
"Well, as I said, I'm hoping that legal action won't be necessary."
"You know, I'm getting this, uh... this feeling that, uh, there's a dollar figure in your already ghost-ravaged brain... that would make this all go away, am I correct?"
Yeah.
"Well, I think it would be reasonable to refund the purchase price plus a hundred thousand dollars."
Plus...
Plus a hundred thousand dollars?
Yes.
For our pain and suffering and inconvenience.
I am going to fix this little problem in your suite as soon as I possibly can.
"And in the meantime, I will put you both up at this beautiful hotel free of charge."
"Now, I'd take that before I change my mind."
Good.
- And it's all crap!
- Steve.
Really?
Do tell.
Lindsay Denton knows our procedures inside out.
She exploited doubts and grey areas to tie our investigation in knots.
"Oh, you did that all by yourself."
"First, DC Fleming's failed undercover operation and then yours."
- I didn't do too badly.
You ended up in prison.
- And we didn't fail.
We got you convicted.
But you know sexual misconduct by undercover officers is a hot topic so you invented this story about us going to bed together so the jury sees you as a wronged woman.
They obviously felt that I must have shagged you into conspiring
- to murder a protected witness.
- Stephen!
"Thank you, DS Arnott."
I couldn't agree more that the question of your sexual integrity quite rightly made the jury sceptical...
.. but I've got a recording that will be of interest to you all.
"All right, then."
This just isn't the time or the place.
Now is exactly the time and exactly the place.
"Not in court, in a room full of rubberneckers and reporters, my pathetic private life laid out for everyone to laugh at, to pity."
I couldn't bear that.
"But to show you all what kind of officer got me locked up for 585 miserable days,"
THAT I can live with.
I've had my whole life put on trial and now it's your turn.
You've been charged and tried but the one person that refuses to examine what you're accused of is you.
I'm innocent.
The question is -- are you?
"This phone was next to the bed the entire time, although I can believe that you were too preoccupied to notice."

We need to know who he is and how Vince Nelson knew him.
"I'll reach out to the Bureau of Missing and Exploited Children, see if we can come up with any leads."
Pedophile coach.
Maybe he got what was coming to him.
"The day he died, Nelson e-mailed the photos to seven kids on his wrestling team."
"One of them could've been embarrassed, humiliated..."
Or just flat-out enraged.
"I'll track them down, see what they got to say."
Found the kind of chainsaw we're looking for.
It's new on the market.
"Serrated shears on the bottom, chainsaw on the top."
Tool-mark pattern's a match to the body parts we found.
Call the manufacturer.
"Get a list of credit card purchasers, cross reference them against... the last names on the e-mails."
"Did it, done."
Nothing.
Okay.
What about the sawdust?
The sawdust.
Still working on it.
The problem is the DNA from the tree contains endogenous chemicals which inhibit analysis.
That means it's gonna be really difficult to narrow it down to a specific species.
"Well, that tree could point us in the direction of our killer."
Go with conventional methods instead.
"- Extract organic compounds, run 'em through the GCMS."
- All right.
"Hey, I think I just connected the alligator blood that we found on Nelson's roof."
"According to the principal at Hillridge High, they had a science fair three days ago."
And the winning project was about the immunological properties of alligator blood.
"The creator of this project, Todd Fleming, is also on the wrestling team."
I worked with Coach Nelson every day for three years.
"We went to meets together, had a few beers after work, then I find out he's into something like this."

Really challenged and taunt at ferry.
"We were all scratched up, beat up, all of us looked like we had been in a street fight."
North Carolina celebrates.
77-74.
"Carolina, first time since '82, has won the acc tournament."
"That was the best part, you know?"
"We got to hoist him up there, and of course he didn't want us to put him up."
"It's like ""yeah, coach, we're getting you up here."""
"For Smith and Carolina, the satisfaction of beating Duke in '89 didn't last long."
"The blue devils went on to win consecutive ncaa championships in 1991 and 1992, and for the first time in the history of the heated rivalry, the balance of power shifted."
Everybody was talking about Christian laettner and Bobby Hurley and Grant hill and Bobby Hurley and Grant hill and Duke hanging two banners was just enough motivation for us.
"We'd come into our locker room, and in everyone's locker, taped into the mirror, was the image of the Louisiana superdome, and it had"

"I never had the guts to ask him about it, but it had coach Smith written all over it."
"Carolina responded to Smith's ploy, winning 34 games and eventually reaching the ncaa championship final the ncaa championship final against the fab five of Michigan."
There's that passing lob.
"Trailing late in the second half of the game, his team once led by 10 points."
Smith stuck to his coaching principles and trusted his players.
"Coach Smith gets four ""tired"" signals."
"All of a sudden, he starts sending in people."
He's got four substitutes in there and Billy packer's ripping him on television.
Dean Smith went to the bench again.

Postpone the launch?
There will be no launching until His Eminence's recovery.
Asians Conquest has always been His Eminence the Taiko's cherished dream.
It is his will that he will direct this war himself.
Then how much longer must be stay here?
Your orders are to return to Nagoya for now.
Return to Nagoya?
Think about the morale of the soldiers!
They will feel like we are retreating before we fight!
This may be turn out to be blessing.
A blessing?
"So now we see the true you, General Dodo."
It comes time to go to war and you're getting scared!
That is untrue!
Of course it is!
"Master, I'd like to conduct a naval training when we return to Nagoya."
Training?
Battle formation training to be precise.
There is more to fighting a naval war than simply just being there.
"We'we been through this before, Dodo!"
We must eliminate even the most remote possibility.
All of the naval leaders of Chosun are more experienced in land battles!
"And so are you, General Wakizaka."
"You're the best naval leader in Japan, and yet you're better at land battles."
There is a possibility.
They could be concentrating on different military exercises because they are already practiced in maneuvering their fleet.
Yes.
There are many variables on a battlefield.
It is wise to consider all possibilities.
"Also, to win a war, you must forestall the enemy."
"And to forestall the enemy, you must win the first battle."
"If we are met with unanticipated resistance from Chosun Navy and experience complications in landing, what would happen to the morale of the soldiers who have traveled across the ocean to a foreign land?"
"Warriston felt the future tighten around his neck, and fled to Europe."
The brief and ugly experiment was over.
The headless king had horrified everyone.
"No-one wanted anything to do with dictators, no-one wanted anything to do with the almost-democracy of the Covenant."
The way ahead was backwards.
The Parliaments of both England and Scotland began undoing things.
They remade the old world.
They remade the Union of the Crowns.
You could hardly see the join.
It was as though nothing had happened.
As though this Charles was that Charles.
His father's ghost was promoted.
He became King Charles the Martyr.
Cromwell's body was exhumed and its head cut off.
There was no Cromwell.
There had been no Civil War.
There was no Covenant.
There would be no Covenanters.
The English Parliament declared the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 unlawful.
"Surviving copies were collected and burnt by the public hangman, executed as though they were people."
Charles was destroying the evidence of the new world that had killed his father.
Everyone knew there would be changes for the Presbyterian Church.
Perhaps it would be enough for Charles that the Protesters no longer ran it.
It wouldn't.
Charles appointed bishops and archbishops.
"He ordered Scotland's ministers to swear an Oath of Allegiance to him, and also required that every minister seek the nomination of a local member of the gentry."
"262 out of roughly 1,000 ministers failed to make the cut, couldn't or wouldn't take the oath, couldn't or wouldn't find a noble patron."
"So 262 ministers, mostly in the south west, were made redundant."
Alexander Peden was one of them.
"Until 1662, Peden was a minister in the parish of New Luce, in the deep south west."
Charles's Oath of Allegiance stuck in his craw.
"He couldn't say it, let alone swear it."
"farewell, my lord."
"Farewell, my sweet Desdemona:"
I'll come to thee straight.
"Emilia, come."
Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be...
I am obedient.
Excellent wretch!
"Perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee!"
"And when I love thee not, Chaos is come again."
Desdemona may appear to be the innocent victim.
But it could be argued that she does contribute to her own downfall.
Again we ask Russell Jackson.
Desdemona contributes to her own downfall to a certain extent... partly because she is innocent in the sense of not knowing certain things.
She insists on reinstating Cassio.
"She nags Othello about it, to use a slightly sexist verb."
She won't let it go... and at the same time Desdemona can't comprehend... how all the gestures of subordination she constantly... and dutifully makes to Othello can be misread.
"The scene for example where Othello slaps Desdemona in public... is one of the most shocking in the play... because he hasjust shown his obedience to the Venetian state... he takes the scroll of paper, 'I kiss the instrument of their pleasures'."
"I don't think that's a bawdy joke, but still... he takes a piece of paper, this commission... and then he treats Desdemona like dirt... and he treats her in a way that is shocking to everyone on stage... who hasjust arrived from Venice... as it were bringing Venice on to the stage with them."
"- Save you, worthy general!"
"- With all my heart, sir."
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
"And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?"
"I am very glad to see you, sir."
Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you.
How does Lieutenant Cassio?
Lives sir.
"Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord an unkind breach:"
- but you shall make all well.
- Are you sure of that?
"And when you want to give something presence, you have to consult nature."
And there is where design comes in.
"If you think of brick, for instance, you say to brick, ""What do you want, brick?"""
"And brick says to you, ""I'd like an arch."""
"And if you say to brick, ""Look, arches are expensive,"
"""and I can use a concrete lintel over you."
"""What do you think of that, brick?"""
"Brick says, ""I'd like an arch."""
"And it's important, you see, that you honor the material which you use."
"You don't bandy it around as though you said,"
"""Well, we have a lot of material around."
We can do it one way;
"we can do it another."""
It's not true.
You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of just shortchanging it.
I remember hearing him talk at Penn.
"And I came home, and I said to my father and mother,"
"""I just met this man."
"""He doesn't have much work, and he's"
"""sort of ugly... funny voice,"
"""and he's a teacher at school."
"""I know you've never heard of him,"
"""but just mark this day"
"""that someday you will hear of him,"
"""because he's really an amazing man."""
Tell me the story of Philadelphia.
"What was it that stopped Lou from building more there, from being more successful there?"
Because he spoke his truth.
"And he was not controllable, and he wouldn't have been controllable by the powers that be that really wanted control"
of the image of Philadelphia.
They wanted to have Philadelphia bask in their image or be connected to it or get credit for it in some way.
But really fundamentally why?
Thank you so much.
PRES.
OBAMA:
Alright.
Good?

"I have realized that as a science community we have not done the best job, frankly, of communicating this threat to the public."
"But when you go up there and see it with your own eye, how thin the world's atmosphere is, tiny little onion skin around the earth."
"That's all the oxygen that we breathe, that's the CO2, everything we burn goes into it."
It's an astonishingly fragile film.
"You know, I knew intellectually how the earth's system works, 'cause that's what I've been doing for 20 years."
"To see how the atmosphere and the ocean, all the elements in the system work together."
So I understood it intellectually.
DICAPRIO:

But it's like being an ant trying to understand what an elephant looks like by crawling all over the elephant.
"But when you're up there in orbit, and you can see 1200 miles in any direction, I mean, let me tell you."
It's kind of a revelation.
"Seeing all the cities at night, millions of people all working away, doing something."
"Come around the day side of the world, seeing the natural systems."
"The hurricanes, huge, great big wheels, you know, over the oceans."
Saw the Amazon River go between my feet.
"For like five minutes, you know, I have a whole green carpet either side."
"Just beautiful, all the way out to the sea."
"And you know there was the sun coming up over the Amazon, the whole forest waking up, and doing what it does every day, you know."
Breathing in and breathing out.
"So I, I, you know, at the end of all that I became immensely fond, more fond of the planet."
You know?
Which I never thought about when I actually just live on the surface.
"I'm also kind of fond of the people on there, too."
It's like being taken away from your family and coming back.
It even smells of man - the essence of burnt clutch.
Splash it on all over before going out for a curry and a fight.
The Mitsubishi is much more technical.
It's got an Active Centre Differential which moves the power to the front or the back wheels depending on which has more grip.
"I just have to tell it whether I'm on Tarmac, gravel or snow."
Then it's got a Super Active Yaw Control which moves the power from side to side.
"Sometimes then, in a big corner, when you're really hammering, this car is one-wheel drive."
So I can sum them up like this.
The Mitsubishi is like an F16 fighter -
light and highly manoeuvrable.
The Subaru is more like an F15.
A fighter bomber.
"As far as power is concerned, both of them get close to 150mph and both do 0-60 in under five seconds."
You can't split them on looks either.
Inside both have wilfully flimsy interiors that are lifted only by the big seats and the buttons for spraying cold water on the intercoolers.
On the outside the Subaru tries to lighten up with its jewellery but both cars really are shamelessly aggressive.
Look at the scoop on this bonnet.
And the Evo's got so many steroids it's growing out of its own body.
These cars should be called the Mitsubishi Did You Spill My Pint?
"and the Subaru You, Outside Now!"
Trying to decide which is best is hard.
"They're both spoon-bendingly, hallucinogenically, law-breakingly mad and absurd."
On a wide open road like this the nimbler Mitsubishi wins.
"But when things get narrow and bumpy, the Evo turns into a jet."
On a difficult road like this the Impreza feels more planted.
"So, which would I buy?"
"Ooh, I can't give you an answer now."
I'm having far too much fun.
So what did you discover after your overly long trip to Scotland?
Nothing.
It's impossible to choose.
There's no tangible reason why you'd take one car over the other.
"- Yes, you bet."
I also heard he was only there for a few minutes.
"Look, mister, after my truck broke down,"
I worked a solid half hour banging my knuckles in the dark and there was no car going and coming;
just the one car leaving-- that's all.
After that I climbed into the cab and took a snooze.
It is your contention then that Mr. Sandover's brief visit occurred after you went to sleep.
"But, Mr. Potkin, how do you know the length of time you had been working on your truck if you didn't have a watch?"
"I just know, that's all."
"After all, you crawl under a truck three or four times, the jack breaks--"
What time did you arrive?
"Well, I was headed for the 1:00 AM market, so I figure I stopped--"
"You don't actually know then whether you arrived at 11:30, at 12:00 or even 12:30."
"Well, of course I know."
The way I figure it--
"If you saw a house that close, why didn't you phone for a tow truck?"
"What, spend $10 to save $5?"
Now look here--
"Now you don't actually know if you arrived at 11:30, at 12:00 or at 12:30."
Now is that not correct?
"[sighs] Okay, mister."
That much I'll give you.
"Beth Sandover requested her release from the company, oh, about a year ago for personal problems."
It all seemed quite proper at the time.
At the time?
Did something occur later which threw a different light on it?
It did.
"Lita-- the deceased, that is-- had made a number of remarks regarding certain discrepancies she'd found on taking over her job."
"Well, women and business, you know?"
I paid little attention.
"Until just the day before her death,"
"Lita handed me an itemized list of certain kickbacks, little deals involving promotions--"
"I won't quote you on that, Mrs. Dexter."
"Oh, please do."
And please be sure to include that I really resent my PR people having set up this interview.
And that you have precisely three minutes of my valuable time.
"- Well, then I'd better get to the point."
- Yes.
King Galen.
What about him?
My research tells me that you were once romantically involved with him.
Is this interview for a financial magazine or for one of those trash magazines that's sold at the supermarket?
"Well, there is a correlation here."
The pipeline.
"Now, you own one quarter of the oil leases but you skipped the announcement party to go off and rescue a deposed monarch, at the risk of your own life."
"Now, I and my readers would like to know why."
And I believe that that is none of your or your readers' business.
"You see, but it is."
"See, it is because-"
"I mean, here is Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter, a bona fide tycoon, willing to put a king, and one without a country, before her own empire."
You'll just have to draw your own conclusions about that-
Is there some allegiance between you and the king?
Has he promised you something the community should know about?
- This interview has just terminated-
- Has he offered to make you queen?
Your three minutes are up.
Fine.
Because you've just told me what I came to find out.
What you think you know is merely assumption.
And I'd like you to stick this up your little tape recorder.
"I am a happily married woman, a very happily married woman, and I intend to remain so."
You're sure about that?
"Oh, yes, I'm very sure about that."
And now would you please get the hell out of my office?
It's cancelled.
"I'm fired, if you can believe that."
"The whole damn time, he had another guy and was talking to another magazine, and just goes with that."
"It's sociopathic, is what it is."
Fucking snake.
Feel like a real fat loser right now.
You should use the time doing something equally as productive.
"Well, I was actually planning to stay home and suffer quietly as I can no longer afford to do much else."
Come to my country house.
Stay with me.
Rub two sticks together.
Make a fire.
"I know most people expect surprising and generous offers to be politely refused, but I might have to call your bluff and emphatically accept."
How does Memorial Day sound?
That's next week.
Yeah.
Sooner the better.
"I have a girl, Melanie, up there."
She looks after the place.
I'll mention it to her.
Thank you.
Skol.
"NARRATOR: 'Philip had begun to feel that the city was rejecting him, 'and Ike's sudden offer of solitude and respite was immediately appealing."
"'So much so that Philip even requested that the invitation be open-ended, 'and that he be allowed to stay until he felt emotionally capable of returning to the city."
"'To Philip's surprise, Ike considered this a terrific idea, 'and even said so.'"
IKE:
"Actually, that's a terrific idea."
I admire you for being so bold as to come right out and ask.
"I know that sounds like I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not."
"NARRATOR: 'Ike had begun to lose his passion for being alone all the time, 'and was eager to have an impressionable young mind on which to impart his wisdom."

And Allison is no longer your Faith.
Do you remember the performance we had you do as part of your therapy?
- I think so.
I remember something about a a demon.
- Mm-hmm.
You did very well.
It was evident that you're taking control of your own identity.
Now I need to see if you can do another role.
- Another role?
- Soon you will be able to be whomever you want to be without limits.
I'm going to keep you in the dark for now.
But I'll let you know when you're ready.
"In the meantime, you'll have to trust me."
- Of course.
How's the device coming?
The physics are impressive.
It's just a question of...
getting the device itself constructed.
- Doctors.
"Dr. Lemelle, if you would excuse me, I'd like a word alone with Dr. Cairn."
I trust this event will be worth the resources devoted to it.
The inner circle came to see me today.
Our benefactors are concerned you're shirking your duties.
"The flow of girls to the society members is the institute's lifeblood, yet you're spending all your time on one girl, and you've lost control of her."
- They can face me themselves if they don't like my methods.
"- You forget yourself, Doctor."
Rosewood and the society that supports it have existed long before you arrived.
- That's true.
But you'd just be an old maid prostituting deranged women for wealthy miscreants without me.
So why don't you go back in and deal with your drapes and leave me to my art?
- Very well Doctor.
"- Very well done, Dr. Lemelle."
"Privacy, please."
Good morning sir.
Go..go!
Ahhhhh....

"Kill him, I said!"
Marriage to Anjou is the only option.
How else do we halt Spain's supremacy in the region?
They've already annexed Portugal is England to be next?
"If you know of a better protection than an alliance with France, My Lord, name it."
A treaty.
Treaties can be reneged upon.
The match ensures our security and the succession in one stroke.
"And if nothing else, puts paid to the vile rumors that I am barren born."
"It has taken us years of negotiation to get this far with the duke, My Lord."
"Do not undermine that now, for God's sake."
Marriage will make the Papal Menace vanish in a puff of smoke.
"War with Spain will be averted and the Catholics here, appeased."
The war will come to us if people get wind of such a union.
They'd rather take on Spain with their bare hands than subsume to France.
"Enough, My Lords."
Pick up the pace!
Our dinner is escaping.
"If I could have a moment, Your Majesty."
"The draft of my Act of Association for your approval, Your Majesty."
Parliament is waiting for your response to ratify it.
"""Any claimant or his associates conspiring to seize the throne shall forfeit all right of succession. """
And their lives.
We all witnessed your distress over the signing of the of the Duke of Norfolk's death warrant.
This act absolves you of all such onerous responsibility.
"You will simply be adhering to the law, discharging your responsibility to the state and allowing us..."
"- The girl, sir."
The feral girl.
Finding her became his life's work.
"George, these were written years ago."
Mr. de Jaager would have still been in school.
"Indeed he was, sir."
I took the liberty of going through his material.
"His diaries were very intriguing, very well-written for a young lad."
And what did you learn?
"Well, sir, it seems young Hugo preferred his own company to that of other boys."
He spent long hours wandering the woods near his family farm.
"I suppose you could say he was a loner type, sir."
"In any case, one day while exploring one of his usual haunts, he came upon a strange and wondrous sight ... a pair of feral creatures, sir, a girl and a boy."
"He describes them in great detail, sir, their wild appearance, their animal-like movements, often on all fours, sir."
- I can probably illustrate...
"- Perhaps another time, George."
- Thank you.
Go on.
- Right.
"Sir, when Hugo tried to convince his mother, or anybody else who would listen, about the children, they dismissed his tales as wild imaginings."
"But he never stopped looking for the children, sir."
"This is all very interesting, George, but what has it to do with our case?"
Hugo stopped trying to convince people about the children.
They became part of his own private world.
"Until one day, the partially decomposed body of a young boy was found in the woods by some hunters."
"Apparently, he'd been attacked by wolves."
Near the boy's body was the torn and bloody clothes of a young girl.
"But the girl was never found, dead or alive."
He became haunted by the mystery of what happened to this young girl.
It took hold of him as you can see.
He's been searching for her ever since.
And he came to Toronto believing that he had found her.
Don't park here!
Move aside!
Can't you see you're in the way?
Karas!
You're responsible for our delay!
Go on!
Get dressed!
End of Episode 3.
HEROIC TIMES
"Like a herdsman's fire blazing on autumn nights across the vast sea of the Puszta,"
Miklós Toldi's face flares before me over nine or ten generations of antique time.
"(János Arany, 1817-1882)"
"My life began in the middle of that summer, which, now I know, was the last summer of my childhood."
My brother and I got orphaned early.
"My father, the king's knight, died in battle, so we were raised by our widowed mother."
"My brother, as the rightful heir of the title and the estate, enjoyed the limelight of the royal court, while he threw me, his blood brother, amongst his servants."
I was not afraid of work.
"I also valued our servants, since I ate the same bread, that we ploughed together, with our sweat, in the rough soil."
"It's just that I imagined, that I could be destined to some more glorious purpose."
I was inspired by my father's example.
"In my feverish, restless adolescent dreams"
I too rode my horse in front of heroic armies.
"I won many laurels in battle, with my father's invincible sword."
"Oh, that sword!"
"That sword,"
He kept it sharp until his death.
"In the middle of that summer, a shiny army crossed our land, and their captain, who rightly took me for a stray servant, asked me about directions."
The haughtily thrown reward coins caused the cup of my bitterness to flow over the brim.
"I decided to finally rebel against the destiny that was enforced on me, to get my inheritance and leave the parental house."
"Oh, damned anger!"
Heavy burden of my life.
"When the King's head fell, the old world ceased to be."
It went mad.
The people were horrified by what Cromwell's faction had done.
$0 the English Parliament abolished monarchy.
"If there was no king, there was no crime."
They had beheaded a nobody.
No-one had asked the Scots if th ey wanted their king beheaded.
"Their Covenant needed a king, like King David in the Bible."
Their Covenant needed his signature.
A dead king could sign nothing.
"So within a week of the King's execution, they declared his son Charles king instead."
The 20-year-old Charles returned from France to take the throne.
It was imperative that he sign the Covenant.
"His ship arrived in the mouth of the Spey, in the north east, in June."
"It anchored, and before he had had a chance to set foot on land, commissioners went on board, presented him with a copy of the Covenant, and required his signature."
He signed.
Because he had to.
"But in Cromwell's world, there could be no kings."
"As long as there were kings, he was a regicide, a king-killer, which meant that Cromwell had a bone or two to pick with the Scots."
"In July of 7650, Cromwell came north."
"At first, his campaign went badly."
"He was forced back to Dunbar, his back to the sea."
One last push would secure his total defeat.
The Protesters mustered their army in Leith.
It was more than double the size of Cromwell's force.
"The godliest of the godly, Warriston amongst them, chose this moment to insist that the army be purged of its ungodly elements."
"The ungodly elements, tended, by and large, to be the professional soldiers upon whom the army's success had depended."
"""God can do much with a few,"" said Warriston."
He was right.
But God chose to do it for the other side.
"One morning in September, Cromwell broke out of Dunbar at dawn, killed 4,000, took 10,000 prisoner, and put the rest of the Covenanting army to flight."
It became one of Cromwell's most famous victories.
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Are you interested?
Always.
"So the seconds I get the lead,"
Three desperados stormed in and hold up the spot.
"First I'm thinkin', I was gonna lay low, and I'll be free and let this shit be."
"Then, one of them sees me and gets the bright idea that they should rob me too."
"So I proceeded to inform the perp and his pals, about multiple ways in which they might violated their mothers."
"So while they're trying to figure out where I got the balls, the cops showed up."
Was it because of the police has a silent alarm?
No.
Was it because the cops just got lucky?
"Hell, no!"
This place is a stone's throw from the 115th precinct.
"So the minute I remembered that little detail,"
"I'm thinking one or two things, these desperados are either stupid or crazy as whole hell."
"Whatever the case, the cops apprehended the whole crew, and then one of the fuzzy wuzzy asked me if I'm ok."
"So I said ""Officer, how do you know I wasn't in on it?"
"What makes you think a girl can't be in on it?"""
Next thing I hear is...
"Bang, bang, bang!"
The guy behind the register flipped and starts shooting at the perps.
It seems the other company at the counter took the robbery personally.
"Long story short, just about everybody ended up taking a shot or two, except for yours truly."
That's how I got this one chilled on me.
It was blasted off of the porker and just went it there.
Scout's honor.
"Anyway, right about then, I thought it may be prudent to exit the premises to the rear."
"Some days, you just can't get a bullet to save your life."
And here of all places.
"I mean, shit, this is America right?"
But... how did you get so dirty?
Through ceremony we are thankful...
And say prayer for being part of this Earth.
"I respect other creatures, other animals..."
Because we are living together.
"I come from a society, where each one of us, is responsible for the ceremony..."
To heal the mother Earth.
It heals our family.
It heals our nations.
It heals our tribe.
"People, they already know how they should keep the planet clean."
This is the way we used to live.
"We are the ones, that are being dangerous species."
That's what the raven say.
That's what the eagle say.
When you are living in the forest with the insects and the animals...
We build a culture around the presence of those things.
You always feel something is there...
Warming you up or even frightening you or making you happy.
The forest does speak to us.
"The basic value of the traditional way of life... is astonished to the belonging, of having a place."
For me and family includes my community because they are so close to us...
And we share our life with them every day.
People can learn a lot from traditional way of life...
"If there is one thing, I think is to learn to live humbly on the land..."
To live humbly in this world.
When this is the last generation to have traditional fortune beliefs...
It may will be...
That is the sad thing about traditional knowledge...
"If you don't take it know, it will be gone forever."
We also want our children to have a good future...
We also want to have this land intact for our grandchildren.
"We are nothing without animals, We are nothing without the forest."
Have you any idea how many men the Confederates could bring out of Atlanta against me?
"15,000 at least."
That many?
"Suppose we have a look, Andrews, and see how matters stand."
"Here's Lee, who has his hands full in Virginia."
"And here's Beauregard, who's bringing up everything he's got to fight Grant at Shiloh."
"And here's their east-west railroad, all the way from Alexandria to Memphis, with Chattanooga right in the strategic center."
Here we are.
"So, if I moved down here to Huntsville, captured the locomotives and flat cars, and rode into Chattanooga, all I'd have to fear would be these forces out of Atlanta."
"That's true, sir, but we're right back where we started from."
They can move their soldiers up the railroad from Atlanta and drive you out of Chattanooga in two days.
There are 11 railroad bridges over the Chicamagua.
A man like you could lead a raiding party and burn those bridges for me.
Why not?
"I had a deal with General Buell that when I brought this information,"
I wouldn't go South anymore.
"Soon as I complete this report, I aim to enlist in the 21st Ohio."
You'd leave the Secret Service to become a foot soldier?
"Yes, sir."
"Maybe I won't be any great shakes in the infantry, but at least it wouldn't be hiding under a cloak."
"After just so long, a man has to come out in the open."
"Mr. Andrews, I wouldn't detail any man on a duty of this kind against his will."
But consider what it might mean to the Union.
Cut the Confederacy in two.
"We could shorten the war by half, maybe end it."
[Pittenger] I'd heard from Mr. Andrews sooner than I expected.
"That night a score of adventurous men, most from the 21st and 33rd Ohio Infantry, followed me to a meeting place on a hillside."
[coyote howls]
"- Good evening, gentlemen."
- [all] Good evening.
"All here, Mr. Andrews."
Which are Brown and Knight?
"It has the same handmade feel, too."
There are squeaks and rattles.
But there is one big difference.
"The normal Vauxhall VX, the 220, has a 2.2 litre engine which is fine in a ham sandwichy way but in this, they've added pickle."
"The engine is smaller, just two litres, but it has a turbo charger."
That means 200bhp.
"So, this may be a bit heavier than an Elise, thanks to its airbag and its anti-lock brakes and its soundproofing and turbo."
But it is hugely fast!
I like the feel of acceleration.
"There's a cosiness as your internal organs are marshalled by the G-forces into a little puddle in your spine, but in this, it's like you're being electrocuted."
0-60 takes four seconds.
It keeps on kicking you in the back of the head with its million-volt shoes all the way to 150.
Wicked!
It's so quick that on the press launch in Spain four of them were crashed by journalists.
There was a rustle in the hedgerow.
Remember when Marks and Spencer's launched that range of underwear that was seethrough and boudoirish?
This car is as big a departure for Vauxhall as those knickers were for MS.
Really.
And you know what?
We haven't even got to the best bit yet - its handling!
"I drove an Elise round this track in the last series, and I know I've got fingers of butter and fists of ham, but it really was understeery and this just isn't."
"Miles of oversteer, you can get it up to the limit and just hold it there."
Love it!
Brilliant.
One thing'll get me off this racetrack - if it runs out of fuel.
That's the first time I've thought that while behind the wheel of a Vauxhall.
"Lotus has responded to this car with a 190 Elise that we saw earlier in the programme, but that cost £33,000 - £8,000 more than this."
This has an airbag and is more comfortable.
I do believe this is the sports car of the moment.
"I'll give anyone a fiver if they can find the word ""Vauxhall"" written anywhere on it."
One more test.
The Stig.
He chose to view it as a conspiracy.
The king brooded on how to deal with the two magnates.
He didn't brood for very long.
"In 1452, James requested the presence of the Earl of Douglas at Stirling Castle."
William smelt a rat.
He only showed up when he got a letter guaranteeing his safety.
It was the dinner party from hell.
James was jumpy and volatile.
William was edgy too.
The fact that both men had been drinking since lunchtime made the situation even more unpredictable.
Only one thing was guaranteed and that was a confrontation.
"At some point, late in the proceedings, James demanded that William give up his alliance with john, Lord of the Isles."
William refused.
Bad move.
James exploded.
He pulled a knife and launched himself at William.
Then his courtiers pitched in.
"Legend has it that when the frenzy was over, they dumped him out of that window."
"When the body was recovered by William's men, it was found to have 26 separate stab wounds."
His head had been split open with an axe.
"It was a shocking act, as much for its violation of notions of honour as its brutality."
William's followers paraded a copy of the king's safe-conduct pass around Stirling before ransacking the town.
But James was more than a match for the Black Douglas.
"Faced by the King's heavy artillery, the Douglas castles surrendered without a shot."
William's family fled into exile in England.
This was another great leap in the Stewart fortunes.
"By seizing the lands of the Black Douglases,"
James made himself very rich.
"Big guns, wealthy relations and a single brutal act of murder would bankroll the future of Scotland's Royal dynasty."
"For James, it was a dream outcome."
"But for john, it was a nightmare scenario."
What had happened to the Black Douglas could happen to him.
"The founders of the company, the anonymous heroes of the future."
The future is for the dark forces individuals organized.
Solution champagne!
"Non .. can no longer say anything, especially you can not kill any thoughts or bite!"
"If the teeth are used to climb trees, as the big toe of the foot?"
"There is another world without cruelty, more deformed and more Laido?"
That when I have my hunger and thirst obligations to think about the meat and blood who want my neighbor?
What butcher us legitimate children?
"Attention to the vase, cousin."
Why?
We're badly in practice.
"Clothes, furniture, prisons ..."
I am like you.
"I found a solution, the theater."
"You will see, is not that jumble where he rolls my mother."
It really breaks through here.
It kills better and faster.
"It does not make happy, but makes good, better than everything."
I would like to remain here.
Did I go to system.
I have the hip murder me.
The body of Simon I will not say no.
This I know to do.
"We all lost, lost in our flesh."
"- Also you are lost in your flesh, Aglaé, you understand?"
- Everything is cold.
"You can not destroy that with media, middle-class scenery."
"Costumes bourgeois, with a bourgeois game."
The bourgeois revolution in the service of on behalf of all humanity which is Perita ...
"Their souls have merged into one universal soul, that's me."
"In my mind, the human conscience was confused with the animal instinct."
I remember everything and rivivo each exists in myself.
Our orbit has changed:
- The Omega quadrant is no longer visible:
- Then the ship has moved:
"I'm not sure what happened, but it was off our port bow before we left to survey Vor-Deeth:"
It's not there now:
"I don't know what happened, but..."
But what would account for the new star reading?
I don't think we're on board the real Searcher:
"Buck, that's just a little hard to believe:"
Is it?
Then how do you account for the fact that the interior has changed?
And the fact that all the people on board this ship are acting so totally out of character?
What if we're on board a fake?
A very clever but nonetheless imperfect fake:
"But we piloted the shuttle here ourselves, and Wilma flew here in her own ship:"
Anything clever enough to fabricate a copy of the Searcher: : :
Is certainly clever enough to throw our instruments out of adjustment: : :
And make us believe we're landing on the real Searcher:
"If the ship is a fake, what about the people on it?"
They're fakes as well:
"Robots, androids:"
"I don't know what they are, but they're fakes:"
We can't worry about that right now:
The first thing we have to do is get out of this room:
"Yes, but how do we get past the guard?"
"If you gentlemen will go along with it, I think I have an idea:"
[Wilma Screams] Let me go:!
"Let go, you..."
Help me!
They're trying to take over the ship!
Release her!
Stand back!
"And then when he found a client that is sympathetic, it's a client for life, huh?"
And I don't think I could claim that.
"On the other hand, I probably... lost fewer clients than he did."
"Oh, way fewer."
I think you've built way more.
You've had way more success rate
- in terms of your buildings...
- Building doesn't mean success.
- No?
"- Building... three or four masterpieces are more important than 50, 60 buildings."
"Quality, not quantity."
Architecture has to have the element of time.
"How can you judge a work today, let's say a work by anyone of these modern architects that you know about that's exciting and wonderful."
"And then what'll happen to it 20, 50 years later?"
That's the measure.
That's why that Salk Center will always be as perfect as it was conceived.
The teakwood may fade away.
It probably did... or has.
But the spirituality of that project will remain.
"Now, that building will stand the test of time."
No question about it.
There is something spiritual about this space.
"For the first time since he died,"
I felt I was getting closer to my father.
"The scientists told me the building is not only beautiful, but it works."
"Unlike the Richards medical towers, where the labs are small, these labs are totally open, spanning the full length of the building, and each scientist has a study with an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean."
Lou was 65 when Salk was finished.
He said it was the first building he was really happy with.
"I looked up one of the men who worked with him on the project, a guy named Jack MacAllister."
Jack moved out here during construction and never left.
I was in charge of this project when I was 25.
You had an incredible responsibility.
"However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis, and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls..."
Secret chamber....
"However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year, wiped clean by the wrath of God."
"Obviously we've come to the right men, you seem to know all about this Tanis."
"No, no, not really."
Ravenwood is the real expert.
"Abner did the first serious work on Tanis, collected some of its relics."
It was his obsession really.
But he never found the city.
"Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood."
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
Oh rubbish!
Ravenwood's no Nazi.
What do the Nazis want him for then?
"Obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it..."
What exactly is a head piece to the staff of Ra?
The Staff is just a stick...about this big.
"Nobody really knows for sure how high it is... it's capped by an elaborate headpiece, in the shape of a sun with a crystal in the center."
"And what you did was you take this Staff to a special room in Tanis, a map room, a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor."
"And if you put the Staff in a certain place at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here,"
and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.
"Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?"
That's exactly what the Nazis are looking for!
What does this Ark look like?
There is a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God!
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrew's thought."
Now what's that supposed to be coming out of there?
"Lightning, fire..."
Power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.
There are large wetlands but it's dark...
I didn't help stop the investigation.
Send his blood to the lab and have them test for matching DNA.
- And the car'?
- They don't think she was in the car.
The dogs didn't even react.
We'll return to Copenhagen.
The notebook is likely to lead him in that direction.
I couldn't have done it differently.
- I've told you everything.
- Who did you cover for?
I can't say anything before it's cleared.
It wouldn't make a difference.
Let me explain.
Why are you...?
We're not just talking about a single error.
"From your relationship with Rosa Lebech and a jilted ex-husband, who leaks confidential material, to the handling of the Zeuthen case."
You've ignored all warnings and haven't called the Justice Minister to account.
The Ministry of Justice is not to blame.
"You're taking the Zeuthen case personally, and undermining the party's credibility."
"You must understand the situation, you've put us in."
"We owe it to the electorate, and not least to the Zeuthens."
It's not up to the party to remove the Prime Minister.
No Prime Minister has survived for long without his party's backing.
"What kind of party are we, if we have nothing better to do than this?"
"Yes, our credibility, our future and our standing with Zeeland are at stake, the basis of our financial rescue plan, but you know where I stand."
"In spite of what the Treasurer's been telling you about me, this is useless."
You chose me because you had faith.
I need that faith fight now.
That won't bring Emilie back to life.
So you're not open to reason and would rather have the party fight a destructive internal war'?
Then I'll call the business committee...
All this effort will help to keep bears away from people so that both stay safe.
"The next day, the team are back on the plains, still trying to catch the macaques staging a crop-raid."
We haven't seen anything.
Anything interesting?
No.
"But with Takayo's expert help, they are learning to predict the macaques' movements."
"You might spot a macaque or two who are, kind of, looking a bit shifty and you kind of get the sense that something's going to happen."
"And then, at last, they are in the right place at the right time for a raid."
Is that an apple in his hand?
Caught red-handed.
"In a place with such close proximity between people and animals, the relationship is always going to be challenging."
But Professor Izumiyama has seen a big change in attitudes since he first started working with bears.
"Next time, we head to Japan's far south."
This is a land ruled by the power of the sea.
"Here, you have to make the most of every opportunity."
"And the further south you travel, the stranger life becomes."
Here'sa challenge.
I want you to believe what I'm about to tell you.
I want you to believe what I'm about to tell you.
"Not just hear it, not just what I'm about to tell you."
"Not just hear it, not just understand it, but believe it."
"Not just hear it, not just understand it, but believe it."
"It's a fact that you already understand it, but believe it."
"It's a fact that you already know to be true,"
"It's a fact that you already know to be true, but have never been able know to be true, but have never been able to fully accept."
but have never been able to fully accept.
And it's this:
to fully accept.
And it's this:
You are going to die.
And it's this:
""" now,i thought devil's night was halloween eve."
"The moniker ""devil's night"" is somewhat deceiving."
"In detroit,it's actually a 3-day citywide cultural phenomenon, complete with masks,chaos,and costumes."
- Say that 3 times fast.
- Sounds like mardi gras.
"Yeah,a violent one."
Vandals and amateur arsonists literally set hundreds of fires.
Who burns their own city?
It started as pranks in the 1930s but escalated in the 1970s with disenfranchised youth.
"Well,given today's economy,it must be a free-for-all."
"They've got record-breaking unemployment and foreclosures, leaving a lot of displaced,desperate people."
And every single one of these victims suffered unimaginable pain.
"I'm sure that's what gets him off,watching them burn."
It gives him power and control.
The top of the whodunit list is first responders.

"We're stretched as it is, but we've set up a joint task force with the detroit p.d. to catch this guy."
It's pretty extensive.
"No, he was very angry."
Was he?
Yeah.
"I'd gone to see him live and obviously, he's this big rap pioneer, he practically invented early hip-hop with a few other people, so I was really excited."
"I was in the front row but I get very self-conscious at gigs, cos I never really know what to, sort of, do."
That'll do.
Yeah.
"""Hey, I blooming love hip-hop!"""
"But I was front row, centre, I couldn't wait and he came on, and the crowd went absolutely mental and people were going mad and I was,"
"""This is going to be really brilliant."""
"And he took the mic, he went, ""I'm a firm believer you got to know"
"""where you came from, know where you're going."
I'm going to play some
"""Parliament, some P-Funk,"
"""some George Clinton, some Bootsy Collins."""
"Everyone's like, ""Yay!"""
"and I was like, ""That sounds absolutely great!"""
"And then he started playing all these tunes, it was great and everyone was dancing and I was there with my Guinness or real ale or whatever it was, having a really great time and then he kept looking"
"into the crowd and looking angry and eventually he picked up the mic and it was sort of, it was electric, cos people are like, ""We're not"
"""expecting him to rap, he's going to freestyle."
"""He's freestyling for the people of Wales, this is amazing,"
"""no-one expected this."""
"So, everyone was really up for it."
"He took the mic and went, ""There's this white guy down the front, man,"
"""and this motherfucker ain't dancing for nobody, what is wrong with you?"
"""Your ass is stuck to the floor, your boots are made of lead!"
"""There must be glue on that dance floor!"
"Dance, motherfucker!"""
And I remember thinking...
"I remember thinking, ""He's giving this guy short shrift, isn't he?"
"""What an idiot."""
"And he was like, ""I'm talking to you, motherfucker,"
I have nothing to do with it.
We'll have to look into it more deeply.
Im Tae Ho!
You're dismissed.
Pack your bags and go home.
Shouldn't we take care of it quickly?
"Even if you do this, I don't think you will be able to dodge the bullet."
Someone made a proposal.
And what is the result after trusting you?
"- I must hear it, coming from you."
- That's enough!
Chief Jung!
Who is it that you're protecting?
"Tell me what you want,what you like, It's okay I'mma little curious too"
"Tell me if it's wrong, If it's right, I don't care I can keep a secret, can you?"
"Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite"
"Don't tell your mother, kiss one another Die for each other, we're cool for the summer (Ha)"
"Oooh, Oooh"
Take me down into your paradise Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
"Just something that we wanna try Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer"
"Tell me if I won, if I did, what's my prize?"
"I just wanna play with you, too"
"Even if they judge, fuck it all, do the time I just wanna have some fun with you"
"Got my mind on your body, and your body on my mind Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite"
"Don't tell your mother, kiss one another Die for each other, we're cool for the summer (Ha)"
"Oooh, Oooh"
Take me down into your paradise Don't be scared cause I'm your body type

"And seriously would a set of decks and basic crossfade,"
"I mean would it bankrupt us, you know?"
Get the patient a few tunes.
Keep talking.
"Well, it's the 21st century, you know?"
"And as a woman I would- I would appreciate being able to browse, say a lingerie catalog, while I'm waiting for my appointment."
"So, yes, on the first day"
I would liberally scatter the waiting room with lingerie catalogs.
"Right, I can see immediate problems."
"Two words are just screaming themselves at me, Guitar Hero."
For the patients?
"No, for us."
How are you supposed to heal when you are all tense.
"You know, I have long had a vision of what a general practice could be like in the 21st century."
And I've never seen it realise.
Not even in Scandinavia.
"Doctor, could I please have a word with you in my advisory capacity?"
"I've realised who it is she reminds me of, *** of The Apprentice"
"Yes, the one who got replaced by the fit one of West Ham."
And you are Lord Sir Alan Sugar.
"You listen to her advice, you're grateful for it, but at the end of the day you trust your gut."
"And so you've got hot, cold, and my favourite, espresso."
This is all great and you know the sort of thing that we'll probably be looking to buy outright in a matter of months but have you got anything more within the price range of a family supported entirely by the wage of a doctor's receptionist?
"Not quite sure what they using this room for at the moment, but as you can see it's big enough to accommodate a mattress end a webcam."
So I'm sure it can cope with a dining-room table.
"Oh, Mr Nibbles knows he's home."
Hasn't he got a good strong voice?
You're going to live here with mommy and daddy for ever and ever!
"Don't worry, dear."
He'll come back when he's hungry.
"Ah, hello!"
"Hello, Lovelies!"
"Now tell me, Victoria, it's been a busy, busy few weeks for you, has it not?"
"With time running out for Miss Hopkins, her chaperone, Lady Devonport, presses her to choose between her two suitors."
"And I've thought long and hard about it, and I've come to a decision."
Go on then.
And that is Mr. Everett.
I knew you were going to say that.
Why?
Because you are so contrary.
"Right, well, it's your life, and I like the man."
He's grand.
"Because they are both great gentlemen, and there's nobody truer, more sincere, genuine, caring, sensitive than Mr. Everett in the house."
"Well, I think that's entirely true."
"And I know I'm very lucky to, you know, have him want me, really."
He's been consistent in his feelings for you from the very beginning.
"And gorgeous though Mr. Carrington is, but if you change your mind again..."
I'll let you know.
I can't be doing all this travel agent stuff.
"He'll be a very happy boy, Mr. Everett will."
"And anyway, he knows the way round the maze."
"Away from the romantic merry-go-round, the estate's hermit has more basic concerns."
"Everything's wet, and there's a conspiracy afoot to completely starve me."
And I must have lost about two stone.
Really hungry all the time.
"And they're like, ""He's a hermit,"""
"like he doesn't need food, he can just eat grass or something."
I'm not a deer;
I do need food.
But the hermit has found love.
"Miss Francesca, the lowest- ranking lady in the house, is fast losing her tenuous grip on gentility."
"It is very romantic, you know, being a sort of filthy vagabond hermit, being visited by this exotic creature in petticoats about dinner parties, target practice, angry chaperones."
"Yeah, it's like being in a wonderful story."
It has had its romantic moments.
They've filled it with gypsum.
We're going to need angle irons and differential pulleys to lift it.
Tutankhamun had died but his tomb was unfinished.
Now a new site had to be found in a hurry.
"His body was probably placed in the tomb his chief advisor, Ay, had already built for himself."
It was not designed for a king but it could be made ready in time.
"Tutankhamun's coffin was placed inside a stone sarcophagus at the centre of the burial chamber, to be surrounded by four gold-covered shrines, one within the next, each covered in sacred writings to protect the king on his journey."
The small tomb was crammed with everything Tutankhamun would need in the afterlife.
"There were beds, chairs, couches, musical instruments, magical charms, chariots, jewellery, swords, daggers, shields, torches, cosmetics and boats to carry him on his long journey."
Tutankhamun was not buried with the care one might expect for a king.
The golden coffin was too big and part of it had to be sawn off to make way for the lid of the sarcophagus.
"Tutankhamun's final resting place was in a tomb built for a commoner, and assembled in a rush."
Good.
LACAU:
"Good afternoon, Monsieur Carter."
Monsieur Lacau.
Have you come for the opening of the sarcophagus?
I have.
- My only regret is that Lord Carnarvon isn't here.
- Indeed.
Though I would have had to remind him that all the usual rules still apply.
- I hope you understand that?
- Yes.
- Of course.
"Arthur, are you happy?"
- Yes.
"- Pecky, you happy?"
"- I'm ready, Howard."
"All right, gentlemen, we lift on three."
"Very, very gently."
"One, two, three and lift."
"Come on, men, we can move this."
It's the location that makes the film credible.
These roads were trails that I had driven down 2 years before filming.
"And naturally, with the help of my memory, my notebook and my little camera,"
I tried to relive my first meeting with the region and the inhabitants.
How to live in the village?
The village and the stranger
"It's important to remember the first time, the first meeting."
It's very difficult to remember how you saw an old friend for the first time when you've known them for years.
"It's the same here, he's a stranger, he doesn't know the layout of the place."
A guide shows him the way to his destination.
"But, of course, he will always be watching, observing the things and the people around him."
That's the difference between him and the child.
"The child knows the area, he doesn't know it at all."
"So he looks at all the doors and windows, the people and the streets."
Because it's all new.
It's normal for the two women on the roof to wonder who the stranger is.
"Here, the child introduces him to his mother."
"That was important, the proof that the character is not being used to represent the word ""stranger"""
in an unknown town.
"In each detail of the structure of the film, he must be seen to be a stranger."
We have to see their two different cultures and two totally different goals.
I think your mother is wrong.
"Small things can be good, you're small, but you're good."
I'll grow.
The house won't.
You feel his foreignness again there.
The shadows of the people on the walls are watching him while they work.
They wonder what he's doing there.
They're always surprised to come across the stranger.
"Because of the shape of his glasses, or his clothes, or because he just hangs around..."
The village and women
That's the real face of the peasant women
The mother survived.
Do you know if she's able to talk?
"No, she just went into surgery."
JJ's at the hospital with here.
But it's definitely our guy.
Glue and sand in both parents' eyes and the father's throat was slit.
I saw an alarm panel by the front door.
"It wasn't activated, but it did keep the computerized log of all home activity."
Shows the back door was opened and closed at 3:35 am.
And then again at 4:47 am.
"An hour, just like the other attack, but this time he left a witness."
"Well, he may have gotten sloppy and assumed she was dead."
"I mean, she was found unconscious in a pool of blood."
Family have any other children?
"Just Josie, the missing daughter."
- How old is she?
- 13.
Differential sex offenders usually cross age and gender lines only when their preference isn't available.
"And Ronnie Brewer wasn't sexually assaulted, so we may not be dealing with a pedophile."
"No, I don't think we are."
This is something else entirely.
We're looking for a family annihilator.
We believe he's a white male in his early to mid-30s.
"He is intelligent, well organized, and meticulous."
"Family annihilators are often quick and ruthless, but this unsub prolongs the suffering of his victims."
He appears to kill in stages.
"First the father, then the mother, and finally the child."
The mother seems to be the primary target of the unsub's rage.
She is forced to endure a sense of helplessness for upwards of an hour while her child is in danger.
So we're dealing with a sadist?
"Yes, but not sadism as we typically think of it."
"Despite the savagery of the attacks, the killer does not derive gratification from inflicting pain."
"Alex, please, no need to risk yourself further."
We can catch the lot of them.
"We will do that, Inspector, but I do not want to loose the opportunity to nick the entire organization."
"Unfortunatedly, my only withnesess, are in there."
Relay the order to alert patrol units.
"The weapon's shipments will be sent from different points, and we shall use different codes for each shipment."
"In the envelopes in front of you, you will find a microfilm with codes,"
"With the instructions and funds needed, to head to the countries you have been assigned."
"Our contacts will be the same, and the plans you are already aware of."
We shall begin as soon as possible.
"You all understand the methods to carry out our plans, based on the ideologies and peculiarities of the chosen countries."
"and now, I need only remind you, that the key to our success, is in your hands."
"Gentlemen, our meeting is concluded."
To remain another day here is dangerous.
"Be brave , and good luck"
"S.O.S. in general meeting, go ahead."
Agent four reporting distress call.
"Unit one has crashed, units one, two, and three have perished."
Alex Dinamo escaped and is headed your way.
Police is mobilizing to cordon off the building.
Stop them!
Impossible to carry out plan one and leave Quito by plane.
"We leave to Guayaquil by land, and carry out plan two,understood?"

"They shot from that roof top, but escaped."
It will not be for long.
"Pick up our comrade's body, the rest of you, follow me!"
Lets go!
Hurry!
"One of your men must stay here, no one must leave the hotel!"
"You heard him, disconnect both elevators!"
Hurry!

June 4th.
There are baby chimpanzees everywhere.
They are affectionate and smart.
Each one has a distinct personality.
One has mastered the art of threading a shoelace.
"If they were returned to the forest, they would be killed by wild chimps."
They can never go home.
My mind drifts back to a day
I spent in Equatorial Guinea and that little chimp I found.
We just had something to eat at a restaurant and I came out.
And sitting here tied to this chair is this little baby chimpanzee.
I don't know how old it is.
He seems very cold.
He was hugging himself when I found him.
"And it's, I'm shocked by it."
I don't know what to think.
He's just sitting here.
Oh my god.
I've got to go.
Most of the chimps in the orphanage were captured by poachers to be sold as pets.
"Though they are extremely appealing as babies, growing chimpanzees are too smart and too destructive to make good pets."
"Once the chimps become powerful adults, they must be confined in cages, a lonely place for these social primates, who quickly become bored and desperate for attention."
"Soon,"
Dean hopes the orphanage may be able to give some chimps a little more freedom.
This is a temporary situation.
We're hoping to get money together to out them into the sanctuary that we're talking about.
"And there they'll be, they'll all be together."
"They won't have cages, they won't have ropes."
They'll be on an open space where they can have a semi-natural social life.
Which is so important for chimpanzees.
Wildlife in Africa seems to be in direct conflict with people here because they need space and the animals need space and the animals end up losing...
I wasn't in the garden with Howard or anyone else.
"Young lady, I will not tolerate such outbursts."
But it's not true.
"Any more interruptions, and I'll have the bailiff remove you from the courtroom."
It was really pretty dark.
Maybe I'm wrong.
But I doubt it.
Then how can you be certain the man was Howard Langley?
"Well, I saw him go outside."
"Your Honor, at this time, I would like to recall Howard Langley to the stand."
Your Honor.
Counselor's strategy is transparently obvious.
These desperate attempts to cover his own client's guilt by directing suspicion on others--
Mr. Mason?
"If it please the court, the suspicion is already in existence and should be clearly established or eliminated."
"Surely our prosecutor, with his great tolerance, can't object to that."
"The suspicion exists, Your Honor, in Mr. Mason's mind and nowhere else."
Neither the police nor the District Attorney's office could find any grounds for it.
"Then by your own argument,"
Mr. Mason can only weaken his own defense by recalling the witness.
Howard Langley will return to the witness stand.
"Mr. Langley, at this time, I ask you for the name of the woman you say was in the garden with you."
"Mr. Mason, you have no right to expose an innocent person to this kind of notoriety."
Very well.
"If this court will agree to hear your testimony in private, will you then answer?"
No.
"No, I can't see that I must."
"You realize that in refusing to answer, you might be held in contempt of court."
I can only do what my conscience dictates.
"Mr. Langley, didn't you go to your wife's bedroom that night?"
No.
And didn't you find her unconscious from a drug she'd been given?
Until the girls were kidnapped.
"And look at it this way, because we played right into their hands."
"Because they want attention, right?"
And they weren't getting any attention from the western media when they were just slaughtering boys.
- Yeah.
- Right?
They want attention.
And what do they do?
"They kidnap girls and sell them into marriage or slavery, right?"
"And everybody... the u.N.,"
"Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, the u.K. Government, the Canadian federal minister of defense, they're all promising aid and help and equipment and personnel to help find these girls and bring them back, because this is such an outrage,"
"and, ""oh, my goodness, something needs to be done."""
"Well, maybe if, like, last year, maybe if we did something then, all of these girls would be safe 1n their dorms right now, right?"
But we didn't.
And the reason why they kidnapped those girls is because we didn't do anything.
"We didn't pay attention, and they want attention."
And they know that attacking girls or women is gonna get them attention.
What are we gonna do?
"Start a campaign, ""bring back our boys""?"
"Oh, wait, they're dead."
"Never mind, right?"
The men...
"The people in boko haram, they're chivalrous."
"If those girls were boys, they wouldn't be getting education, they'd be dead."
They wouldn't be sold into slavery with the hope of escape.
They'd be dead.
Boko haram has been fighting for islamic rule in Nigeria since 2002.
Its members have killed hundreds of people.
"At least 69 dead, although some reports put the number at about 150 and scores more injured."
One of the most important things the men's movement is doing is being able to say men need compassion and men deserve compassion.
"And to have that happen,"
I'm not expecting it in my lifetime.
And the other reason is to see if he can explain it.
That was not a pleasant job and you did a nice job.
"I don't mind getting dirty, Marty."
That is why I like having young people around.
While the team waits for the archaeologist
- to arrive...
- Here they are right now.
"Rick Lagina and Jack Begley meet with representatives from Irving Equipment, Limited."
- How's it going?
- Lorne Flowers.
"Lorne, nice to meet you."
"Having already removed all of the old casings from this year's two major target sites, the Laginas and their partners are now ready to begin the next phase of their operation:"
The clearing and preparation of the Money Pit area for what promises to be a massive excavation.
"Okay, so, guys, this is the Money Pit."
This is where the activity is gonna start.
So why don't we get down and you guys can do what you need to do.
- You want to go first?
- We going down here?
There's large equipment coming in.
Different types of equipment need to be staged in different areas.
There's a lot of things to consider.
"Because the Money Pit is susceptible to flooding, the Laginas and their partners have decided to drill two approximately 40-inch-wide steel-reinforced holes deep into the most promising sites."
"It is an ambitious and risky strategy, and one which will cost the team in excess of $2 million."
That angle of incline getting down into the Money Pit I think has to be addressed.
And do we have a large enough area here for you to construct a crane?
"Like I say, you level that off a little bit. -"
Level that off there.
How far back do you think?
There's an old trail that comes in up over the hill right there.
If we come up that hill there...
Right.
That'd be just wonderful for us.
Okay.
Can I offer you some water?
I offer you some first.
They only kept it there to show me what I could not have.
I'd like you to explain something to me.
How can you ignore the fact that Muhammad preached passivity while he was in Mecca?
"""Do no violence""."
His later message from medina was perfectly clear.
"""When violence come upon you, you must fight back with violence."
"He's quoting from the Hadith, not from the Qu'ran."
It's called the verse of the sword.
They argue that it cancels out earlier teachings.
Verse of the sword.
Just someone's spin on the words of the prophet.
It's not even part of the Qu'ran.
But it does say in the Qu'ran fight and slay the infidels wherever you find them and seize them in every stratagem of war.
Unless they repent.
Establish regular prayers and practice regular charity.
"Is it your intention, Mr. Gideon, to become a man of faith and revert to islam?"
I am a man of faith.
"I have repented,"
"I pray regularly, and I practice charity."
"I have never committed violence against you, so how is it that my faith would allow you to live and worship as you please, and yours would take my life and snuff it out?"
You are simply misguided people of the book.
- But if you revert to islam...
- A billion muslims.
one billion muslims manage to practice their faith in peace... for Allah is surely merciful.
You... inquired about my childhood earlier.
I will tell you... that it was a happy one
until... one day... a bomb fell out of the sky and leveled the bazaar that I was in with my family.
I was only 8.
Must have been horrifying for such a young boy.
An honest man he is... and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds.
- My husband!
"- What needs this iterance, woman?"
"O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!"
My husband say that she was false?
I say thy husband;
dost understand the word?
"My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago."
"If he say so, may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day!"
He lies to th'heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven...
- than thou wast worthy her.
"- Peace, you were best."
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm as I have to be hurt.
O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed...
I care not for thy sword.
"I'll make thee known, though I lost twenty lives."
Help!
The Moor hath killed my mistress!
Murder!
Murder!
So there we are.
Othello.
I think it's one of the greatest... but to conclude we asked our academics... if they could sum up the reasons why they considered it to be so.
The greatness of Othello lies partly in its representation... of opposing forces in human nature... the forces of good and evil.
To put it like that sounds very abstract... and these forces are embodied very strongly in human beings in the play... but underneath the surface of the play... there is this war between good and evil.
This is something which is important to people at every level of their lives.
We are all conscious of evil in human beings... the possibility of evil within ourselves... the possibility of virtue as well... the fact that evil can overcome virtue... but nevertheless virtue can declare itself in fighting against evil.
"They e-mailed back and forth for, like, a month, and then it just suddenly ended."
How come?
Did she say?
"No, I asked."
She clearly didn't want to talk about it.
But I think the guy really creeped her out.
KONO:
Hmm.
Do you recall if she ever mentioned this guy's name?
Jeremy.
JERRY:
Meet Jeremy F.
His online dating profile showed up on Addison's browser history.
I also found a trove of deleted e-mails between the two of them going back over a month.
"Just scanning through them,"
"I'd say their correspondence could best be described as, well, ""intimate."""
"Yeah, one problem."
This photo doesn't look anything like the composite sketch we got on our perp.
There's a pretty good reason for that.
"Knowing that many people often misrepresent themselves on the Internet,"
"I did a reverse image search, and the photos were stolen from this guy."
"He is a collegiate rugby player from Melbourne, Australia."
"His favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption, and his social media profile is set to public, which means that anyone in the world can download these images."
"Okay, so Jeremy F took this guy's photos to catfish our victim."
JERRY:
Exactly.
"And once Addison realized this, she sent him a strongly worded e-mail, threatened to call the cops if he ever tried to contact her again, and that's where the correspondence ended."
And I'll just bet this creeper couldn't take no for an answer.
So he started stalking this poor woman until he could find the perfect opportunity to grab her.
"Okay, Jerry, we're gonna need to trace these e-mails."
"I hear you, but our kidnapper is no amateur."
He was smart enough to send the e-mails through a secure socket tunneling protocol.
- Why not?
"If I paid attention to every detail, I'd never get my real work done."
So paying tax isn't part of your real work?
"No, not mine."
"No, it isn't."
My real work is seeing that the building is safely and correctly built.
"And when my dad asked me, the look on his face was so scary, I just..."
I lied right to his face.
"""No, Dad, I didn't take the car."""
And that was it.
"So I'm confused because I see this permit, and it's dated February 23rd."
Then that's when it came in.
I was never very good at math.
That's nine days.
Didn't you tell me that level of permit takes seven weeks normally?
lssuing of permits is the city's responsibility.
"I'm given to understand that in extremely rare circumstances, and almost never in the city of Chicago, people have been known to pay bribes in order to have these permits speeded up."
"If you're accusing me, I'd like to see your evidence."
"The room's small for a high horse, Mr. Sammler."
This is a grand jury.
We're chasing down facts.
Any accusations will come later.
"But if you had any information regarding the bribing of any official say, a county judge who was asked to rule on a temporary injunction,"
- we'd better know about it.
- Excuse me?
"Were you aware that Judge Piwowarczyk, who ruled on the temporary restraining order sought by the firm of Harris, Reigert, and Sammler, was captured on videotape accepting a bribe from a man by the name of JD Gummersall?"
I was not.
You've never met Mr. Gummersall nor had any conversation with anyone or knowledge of anyone with the intent to influence a decision in county court?
And think very carefully before you answer.
"I remind you, perjury is a felony, Mr. Sammler."
No.
No to all of it.
The Democratic National Committee is located in the Watergate office building.
"I welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook."
"Well, I'm not a crook."
I've earned everything I've got.
I was the youngest person to go to the Watergate grand jury.
"During the Senate Watergate Committee hearings, this enormous chart was put up, in which everyone who received money from this secret fund was put on the wall."
"And it said, ""Gordon Liddy, McCord, Segretti."""
"And then way down at the bottom, it said ""Stone."""
I paid $100 to Mr. Roger Stone on one occasion.
My parents called me on the phone.
They were mortified.
I thought it was pretty cool.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
"But as president, I must put the interests of America first."
"Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow."
I was a Watergate figure at 19 years old.
"I mean, at the time, I was scared shitless."
It was very hard to find work.
"We used to have these buttons that said ""hire a Watergate vet."""
So this is the Batcave.
"This is ""the Factory,"" as we call it."
This is where I tape my Saturday radio shows.
It is also the repository of probably the world's largest collection of Nixon memorabilia.
The 1962 campaign for governor.
"Uh, a rally that I actually attended."
A head shot poster of the day.
This is protesting Nixon's historic trip to China.
Here you have the first and second generation Nixon bongs.
This is among my most prized possessions.
Roger Stone does occasional political chores for Nixon.
"One such chore, to organize dinners of journalists at Nixon's New Jersey home."
"I was the assigned liaison between the Reagan campaign and former President Nixon, transmitting memos back and forth."
General Shin Lip and Minister Yoon Du-su are accusing the high commander Yi of treason.
That means they're out to make Minister Yu a criminal as well!
How could this be happening?
You must stop defending a criminal of treason.
"That, too, is treasonous."
Criminal of treason?
He is His Majesty's most faithful warrior!
Faithful?
Ha!
How could a faithful servant force his way into the palace in arms and threaten his King?
"Your Majesty, please do not hesitate."
You must execute him and display the austerity of the law!
"No, Your Majesty!"
You mustn't doubt Yi Soon-shin's loyalty!
Building that hideous Turtle Ship and causing the death of innocent men alone is a crime punishable by death!
No one grieves for the loss more than Yi Soon-shin himself!
"To a warrior, his men are like his own flesh and blood!"
"Your Majesty, isn't it true that you had great expectations for the"
Turtle Ship as well?
You agreed that fighting the enemy at sea with an assault vessel was a superior strategy.
I do not wish to take anymore risks.
Experience is the greatest asset on the battlefield.
Make no attempt to break my will!
It is not the generals in this room who protects the southern coast nor is it His Majesty and the lords of the royal court.
It is Yi Soon-shin.
"Sun Mu said, in his book Art of War that he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign!"
This tells us that the judgment of the warrior who protects the front is most important and accurate of all.
Interference?
Do you consider this His Majesty's useless interference?
How dare you utter such blaspheme!
He is quoting a passage in the Art of War!
What's more important then the Art of War is the royal command!
These officers would come forward to us provided that we not use their name for fear of retribution within the department.
We talked to high-ranking District Attorney's officials and high-ranking LAPD officials and they concluded that they never got to the bottom of Perez's allegations.
They never got to the bottom of the scandal that was occurring at Rampart and elsewhere in the Department.
And they feel that officers who committed crimes and serious misconduct remain on the job today.
My job became an intoxicant that I lusted after.
The lines between right and wrong became fuzzy and indistinct.
"Whoever chases monsters should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster himself."
Truth is hard.
But Hostility stays outside.
Who would like to start?
"Well, you're the one with all the answers, Doc, why don't you tell us?"
"- Hostility stays outside, Dan."
"- Things have just gotten out of hand,"
"- so, we thought we could use some..."
"- No, you thought."
- ... objectivity.
"- Define ""gotten out of hand""."
Nathan?
Pass.
We reached the breaking point two weeks ago when my son...
"- You hear that? ""My son""."
"- Deb is speaking now, Dan."
When our son collapsed on the basketball court after taking drugs to boost his performance.
"The kid made a mistake, he knows that."
His father has been bullying him about the sport since he was old enough to hold a ball.
"Is that true, Nathan?"
"His mother is so quick to put the blame on me, but up until recently, job always came first."
"Yes, but I changed my behavior Dan, you haven't."
"You cant seem to loose this unhealthy obsession you have with basketball,"
- and how Nathan plays it.
- She blames me for her shortcomings as a mother.
Su-chang was made a commander!
What?
!
This is an outrage!
A commander's position is not a gift for you to hand out as you please!
Warships are the most important weapon on which we will fight our battles.
And I cannot be neglectful to a man that builds those weapons.
"We don't intend to be neglectful, sir."
"From the admiral to a seaman recruit, everyone is important here."
But not all of them can put on a blue uniform and command this navy.
"Are you aware of what you are doing, sir?"
There is order and discipline in the navy.
And there are stern laws that ruled this land for the last 200 years since the founding of this country.
And you're trying to violate those laws!
Do you want to mimic the King so much?
He likes to shock us with outrageous promotions as well.
Rules and official procedures are there for a reason.
"If you ignore them, order will crumble."
I will ignore them.
I will ignore all of them!
Sir!
Do you think we can win?
The Japanese have hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousand of warships.
They possess military power unimaginable in our minds.
How do you intend to fight them and win?
Or do you intend to stand around with your arms crossed and watch as they turn this land into ashes?
We're facing a war.
We can't even dream about winning if we get stuck on rules and procedures!
Our only hope is our men.
"Ultimately, war is fought by men not by weapons."
What I want are talented men.
Men that will devote everything they have for victory.
We admired them for coming so far in life.
My grandfather was a wonderful teacher and a great storyteller.
"It seemed as if, as he spoke he also healed."
And I wanted to learn it.
My grandfather told me as a nice speak...
It would touch the hearts of many people.
"I know now, what he meant."
And there is a healing in a story.
There is power in a word.
That's how we built the power of communities...
"That's how we told our children to be great leaders,"
To be great medicine people...
Through the stories.
"The most basic ""baggles"" that is important to our traditional way of life is to have enough food to eat, to have water to drink..."
And to have firewood for keep ourselfes warm.
The land provides us with all our basic needs...
So we are completely dependant on nature.
Without these things we can not survive.
"These things can be learned from other cultures, but we also learn from their mistakes."
If the people to continue to treat the Earth wit no respect...
Our traditional way of life will come to a end.
"When we killed an animal, the remains will be shared between the people..."
"His skin will be used for clothes, for a blankets."
"If it's a big animal, then meat will be sun dryed to be eaten later..."
And all the meat will be eaten up.
And sharing is a very important thing in our culture
"If you don't share with other people, they will not share with you."
And sharing is just a natural way of life.
The most important thing that I would teach the children is...
That we must not forget about our land and our culture.
Ancient teachings have been passed down through generations of our people.
These teachings that all life forms are interconnected.
"Thus, re-appeared the picture of his abandoned bride."
"That the former betrothed is now a happily married woman, what difference does it make!"
This can not prevent an ambitious plan:
the unification of the two countries.
"It seems that destroying a happy marriage is a lofty noble idea too, if the king wills it."
"Anyway, for me it was a chance."
Hope gleamed in me:
I get to fight back my knighthood!
Surely the king will forgive my sin!
And maybe that girl too.
Bloodthirsty days.
"The sizzling meat, the pungent smoke of burning towns."
"growls, screams, the stench of corpses rotting in the murderous fire of the sun, foxes, ghouls sneaking around in the night, this is war."
That's the price of fulfilling a dream.
"Finally, a quick and accurate strike, as a surgeon cuts off gangrened limbs, the prince's death."
There is no obstacle anymore to the marriage.
The country can recover.
"I have achieved everything as well, since the king, in exchange of saving his life, and for my dedicated fervor, graciously forgave me."
"Like the broken branch, tumbling in the stream, that sometimes drifts on the surface of the water, and other times is pulled into the deep, so we struggle in the unpredictable turbulence of our destiny."
"The tired swimmer hoping to land safely in the marsh grass greens, his legs are caught in black swamp."
"At the bottom, a cruel death awaits him."
The girl is dead.
And I died too with her.
The world is dead.
"Purpose and reason, everything perished."
The cherished dream of empire was gone.
The Heavenly Judge sent his exterminating angel over our triumphant troops.
The angel's name:
Horror and Damnation.
The angel's name:
Hatred and Revenge.
The angel's name:

DICAPRIO:
"The truth is, the more I've learned about this issue and everything that contributes to the problem, the more I realize how much I don't know."
How much I don't know about this issue.
"The first time I ever heard the term global warming, which was what it was called back then,"
I was in my early twenties.
I had the opportunity to sit down one on one with then
"Vice President, Al Gore in the White House."
"And he drew a picture of our planet on a chalkboard, and then he drew the atmosphere around it, and he said, this is the most important issue of our time."
I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.
"He said all our modes of transportation, boats, trains, planes, cars, the way we produce our food, the way we build our cities, almost everything we do releases carbon dioxide, CO2, and that leads to climate change."
♪ [MUSIC] ♪
"The polar ice caps will melt, the seas will start to rise, there will be more dangerous weather patterns, floods, droughts, wildfires."
It sounded like some nightmarish science fiction film.

"So it's the 4th of July, and we're here in the middle of the Arctic."
DR. SALA:
"Right now we are standing on the ocean, we are basically walking on water."
"This is the northern tip of Baffin Island, one of the hundreds of islands in the High Canadian Arctic."
"We are way above the Arctic Circle, and if you put your hand in the water, you would not be able to stand it for more than 5 minutes,"
India has consistently said that its biggest priority is development and bringing people out of poverty.
NARAIN:
We care about climate change.
But the fact is we are a country where energy access is as much a challenge as climate change.
We need to make sure that every Indian has access to energy.
DICAPRIO:
"From what I understood there are 300 million people without power, without light here in India."
NARAIN:
"Yes, yes."
DICAPRIO:
That's equivalent to the entire population here of the United States.
[DIALOGUE IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
NARAIN:
"Today in villages, Indian villages you will find people take cow dung and they make what is known, called cow dung cakes or uples in Hindi, and they burn those."
And that's their only source of cooking energy.
So they will make food now over this.
[DIALOGUE IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
NARAIN:
"Coal is cheap whether you and I like it or not, coal is cheap."
You have to think about this from this point of view.
"If you created the problem in the past, we will create it in the future."
"We have 700 million households who cook using biomass today, 700 million households."
"If those households move to coal you have that much more use of fossil fuels, then the entire world is fried."
"If anyone gives you this very cute stuff and tells you,"
"Oh the world's poor should move to solar, and,"
Why do they have to make the mistakes that we have made?

"You know, I mean, if it was that easy I would have really liked the U. S. to move towards solar, but you haven't."

We have to practice what we preach.
We will make America strong again.

"My name is Roger Stone, and I'm an agent provocateur."
Stone's Rules are things that I have learned in life that I seek to pass on to others who may want to be in the same business that I'm in.
"Or, actually, any business, 'cause they are fully applicable."
"So, for example, a Stone's Rule:"
"""It is better to be infamous than never be famous at all."""
Stone's Rule.
"One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."
"Everything I do, everything I've done, has been legal."
But politics ain't beanbag and losers don't legislate.
The truth will be suppressed no longer.
Lock her up!
Lock her up!
"Well, Roger has a really rough reputation."
"They talk about ""dirty trickster"" and lots of other things, but I've known him for a long time, and he's actually a quality guy."
He's a nice guy.
Just a few descriptions of you here:
"""a state-of-the-art sleazeball,"" ""a little rat,"""
"""an actor who likes to assume poses."""
I believe in winning.
"I believe in doing whatever is necessary to win, short of breaking the law."
"In the world of political consulting, there are a number of rogues."
But there's...
There's really nobody quite like Roger Stone.
Roger is the sinister Forrest Gump of American politics.
"He's not just this simpleminded guy, but this Machiavellian, almost crazy guy who shows up at every key moment in recent American history."
Roger has a great understanding of the media.
He understands politics and he understands politicians.
"And he always likes to take on somebody that at least has a good chance of winning, and sometimes it doesn't work out."
"'Now, it's my turn."
Mark and I are heading off to find out 'exactly what happened to those species that he'd seen 'dangling on the edge of extinction two decades ago.
'It promises to be exhausting...
'Exhilarating...' Unbelievable.
'Exasperating...
'But I wouldn't miss it for the world.'
"You seem to have brought me to some kind of paradise, Mark."
Isn't it wonderful?
"There's clear water, there's beautiful white sand."
What are we after?
I thought you wouldn't complain.
"Our main objective is to get to Komodo and look for the Komodo dragon, which is one of the most impressive animals on the planet."
"The biggest lizard in the world, very dangerous and endangered, so that's what we're aiming for."
"But rather than go straight there, which I thought would be too easy,"
I thought we'd go and explore a bit of the Malay Archipelago and look at some of the other reptiles and the other wildlife along the way.
We're actually heading for Snake Island.
"""Snake Island""?"
Right.
"Welcome to Snake Island, Mr Bond."
"Yeah, that's a worrying title, and what sort of snakes do we find there?"
"This is home to an animal called the yellow-lipped sea krait, which is a kind of sea snake."
It spends half its life in the water and half its life on shore.
It actually comes out onto the shore to rest and to lay eggs.
Are they venomous?
I thought you'd ask that!
It's actually the second most venomous snake in the world.
"10 times more venomous than a rattle snake, more venomous than a king cobra."
I've got open-toe sandals on.
"I forgot to mention that, yeah, you should have worn..."
Great(!
") No, I'm kidding, they're fine."
The sea kraits are just one of the many creatures that thrive in the marginal world that exists between sea and land which is so widespread throughout the islands that make up Malaysia and Indonesia.
"Now, do let me anticipate your next question."
You want to know how I've managed all ofthis.
That's correct.
"We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly, perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy and back to matter again."
Like the Enterprise's transporter system.
"Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process."
"You see, we not only transport matter from place to place, but we can alter its shape... at will."
This drawing room... did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet?
Quite.
I see.
How did you manage--
Your inquiries are becoming tiresome.
I want you to be happy.
Free yourself of care.
Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship.
We're getting out of here.
You're being quite rude.
You can't go.
"Apparently, you need another demonstration of my authority."
"Yes, quite."

"Now, that's a sample of the atmosphere of this planet outside my kindly influence."

Captain 's Log-
- Stardate 2125. 7.
Science Officer Spock reporting for Captain Kirk.
We have completed 14th orbit of this planet without establishing contact with our missing officers or the parties sent to find them.
Subspace communications remain blocked.
"However, by diverting impulse power to our sensors, we have made them operable, and we have detected one small area on the surface which seems relatively stable."
"Aye, it's there, Mr. Spock."
"Peaceful as Earth, but how do you explain it?"
"I lied to the police, Your Honor, and then I didn't know how to stop the lie."
But I did not kill Somers.
I swear it.
"Mr. Burger, in view of Mr. Hadley's admission,"
I'll leave the matter of perjury charges against him up to your office.
"Is it your desire to recall Mr. Hadley at this time, Counselor?"
"There is one point I believe this witness might be able to clarify, Your Honor."
"All right, proceed."
"Now, Miss Pedersen, let's explore Mr. Hadley's suggestion that there was collusion in the handling of the bids."
"Now, you testified, did you not, that the bids were kept locked in your desk, that only Axel and Edith Morrow knew what the figures were?"
Yes.
"Yes, I think so."
Then let me ask you this.
"Why had your brother Carl expanded his lumberyard, building new sheds and so on, when his principal client was about to sell out to a purchaser yet unknown?"
"Well, uh, Carl is sometimes a fool."
"Miss Pedersen, isn't it possible that your brother Carl knew who the highest bidder was going to be?"
Knew and expected Mr. Somers to reward him with lumber contracts far exceeding anything he'd ever dreamed of?
I don't understand.
We all know what kind of a man Somers was.
Isn't it possible that he promised those lumber contracts in return for private information about the other bidders?
No.
"No, no, no."
"Carl, he would never get mixed up in anything like that."
Isn't it even possible that your brother Carl advanced money to Somers?
He didn't pay him one penny.
Then did you?
To help your brother?
You were the person in whose desk the bids were kept.
"You, the person who knew everything that was going on."
All right.
"I told Carl that I would fix it with Mr. Somers about the bids, yes."
Because Axel was so stupid to sell our shop was no reason for everyone to suffer.

"My first day in India,"
I was chased by an insane monkey and contracted dysentery.
"I can't imagine how my father made this trip so many times, a 73-year-old man traveling alone."
He spent most of his time here with an architect named Doshi.
He's the one who invited Lou to come to Ahmedabad and build the Indian Institute of Management.
"On the day before he died, Lou toured the building and had his last dinner with Doshi and his family."
"It was March 16th, 1974."
"For us, Lou's visit was always a very exciting moment... great anxiety as well as anticipation of learning something more and appreciation."
There are very few people you will find anywhere who will talk about matter in spiritual terms.
Nothingness mattered to him.
Silence mattered to him.
The enigma of light mattered to him.
So those... those are not normal parlance.
"Those are not normal discourses, but these were the ones which we liked, and he talked about it."
"And when somebody understands this, he cannot be an ordinary person."
He has to be a highly cultivated soul whom we call guru.
We call him a yogi.
"And that is why I think, for us, he was from here."
"I have a feeling that he was really reaching, you know, his higher level... just to reach recognition and understanding."
"In India, we always say that nobody dies."

What'll we tell the Johnny Rebs about who we are and where we're from?
"Tell them you're Kentuckians, escaping Yankee rule to join a Southern regiment."
"If they press you, tell them you hail from Fleming County, Kentucky."
"I'm from Flemingsburg, and no man from that county ever joined the Southern army."

"There's this wonderful scene where all these dignitaries from around the Universe are coming together, they're converging to see the death of planet Earth."
"And then, they wheel out a tarp of skin named Lady Cassandra, the last human to ever be alive."
The Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Delta17.
"Oh, now, don't stare."
"I know, I know, it's shocking, isn't it?"
"I've had my chin completely taken away, and look at the difference."
Look how thin I am.
Thin and dainty.
I don't look a day over 2000.
"Moisturize me, moisturize me."
"Truly,"
I am the last human.
My father was a Texan.
My mother was from --
"She has been stretched so far that she is literally like a pinned piece of leather, drying out."
You know what?
"They sometimes bring up the concept ""if you were the last woman on Earth."""
"Even if she was the last human on Earth,"
I don't know what I would be able to do with her.
No tears.
I'm sorry.
And she arrives with all these medical staff who have to spray her and keep her moist.
"If someone's not there to spray water on her, she dries up and cracks and explodes into, like, dust particles, which is disgusting."
Moisturize me.
"She's really, really proud of being the last human and sort of raises all these issues about what it actually means, to be human."
"There is something, a good science fiction quirk of like, you know, the last human in the Universe and she's just not human anymore, right?"
"And she's rendered inhuman physically, but also because she's a villain, she's a horrible thing."
"Lady Cassandra tries to basically destroy the platform and all the inhabitants in it and, because of her bad move, the Doctor just lets her dry out -- no Dove moisturizer for her -- and then she starts drying out so much"
that she just explodes.
"Pretty gruesomely, too."
"People have died, Cassandra."
You murdered them.
They were only ever used with prostitutes.
"Thankfully, no men in this house"
"Oh, don't you believe it, Miss Hopkins."
Regency men were encouraged to be sexually active.
"Their prospective wives, however, were not."
"The more I learn about men, the more I just think,"
"""You know what?"
"I can't be bothered with you."""
"Like, why does anyone ever get married?"
"Goodness knows why they did in the Regency times, because you know, they'd be forced to have loads of children, so..."
"Well, not that they had much contraceptive choice anyway, but you know, the men would be desperately trying to produce"
"No, thank you, I'll steer well clear of that."
The constraints placed on the women are felt all the more keenly because of their lack of physical activity... something that was never a problem for Regency men.
Master of the house Mr. Gorell Barnes has challenged his footmen to a game of Regency football.
"Oh, we're going to slaughter them."
Very simple... we'll just tell them to get out of the way.
"If they have the ball, we'll tell them to stop."
We'll just take the ball and kick them in the goal.
It wasn't all plain sailing for the men.
The pressure was on to play hard and rough.
Excuse me!

"We understand, but if only we could have a little more time."
"We're so close with several leads - the white cotton gloves, a wig found at a similar murder site in Iowa."
You're making your best effort.
We do not want the public to feel it's more dangerous to go to church than to a crack house.
'There's a woman behind St Lukes in a dumpster.'
The first two tips telling us where to find the bodies of Goodrich and Lundy came directly into this office.
"Now, this tip on Callisto, was phoned into a police station in Union Square."
Maybe the killer wants publicity.
What do you mean?
We've kept a lot of information secret cos the calls have come direct to us.
"If he calls a regular station house, there's a lot more chance of a leak."
"So, Nut Boy is still disguising his voice but now wants to be famous?"
"Goodrich, Lundy and Callisto attended a planned parenthood convention in Los Angeles last year."

These cars were born in the rough and tumble he-man world of rallying.
"With their turbo-charged engines and their four-wheel drive systems, they grip and they go and they stop so ferociously that you're just left breathless."
"In the real world with bumps and hedges,"
"Iow-nosed, wide-bottomed Ferraris and Porsches couldn't hope to keep up with either of them."
They are astonishing.
And yet they're both relatively inexpensive Japanese saloon cars.
"They've both got four doors, they've both got big boots, they're both as reliable as a Swiss bus driver's Austrian pacemaker."
What more could you possibly want?
Let's deal with the Subaru first.
The old model - the one with the silly headlamps - was a softy.
The new one has a more attractive face but don't be fooled.
The steering is quicker and the suspension is tougher.
"They've made it harder, edgier,"
"less of a car, more of a bar room brawler."
It's a different story with the Mitsubishi Evo VIII.
The old Evo VII was like a Mafia hit man - without the compassion.
At first glance it seems they've made the Evo VIII more hard-core.
It's lighter and its gearbox has six speeds rather than five.
"In actual fact though, they've made it softer and quieter."
They've even given it a fuel tank.
The old one had a zippo in the back.
"You'd go four inches, then run out of petrol."
So the Subaru's been beefed up and the Mitsubishi's been watered down.
It seems then that these two cars have met in the middle.
And that means I have to go out there into the bigness of Scotland and find out which one's best.
"Sometimes you know, this job is very, VERY good."
Nothing prepares you for the shock when you first take this thing round the corner.
Take a test drive.
You will not believe how much grip there is.
You just won't.
This Subaru is a hugely manly experience.
"The noise it makes, it's got a macho gearbox, macho steering."
It's from observing the panic in his victims.
The sadism is psychological.
Something may have happened in the unsub's childhood where he felt unprotected.
Perhaps his own mother turned a blind eye to a real or perceived danger.
"And this could explain the ritual of placing sand and glue in the parents' eyes, symbolically blinding them as punishment."
"Ellie Zumwalt survived her injuries, and this may discourage this unsub and make him more cautious."
Or have the opposite effect.
"It could infuriate him and spur him to attack again soon, with increased violence."
Residents in remote or rural areas and families with an only child should exercise extreme caution in the coming days.
Thank you.
Still no sign of Josie Zumwalt.
And we scoured every inch of road in a 10-mile radius.
"Well, either she's still alive or the unsub did a much better job of body concealment this time."
"If he did kill her, why deviate from his previous disposal method?"
My gut says he's still holding her.
But why her and not the Brewer boy?
I'm not sure.
But things didn't go as planned in the second attack.
Ellie Zumwalt survived.
Ok.
"Maybe it's like we profiled-- he has to kill sequentially, in the order of the Brewer family murders."
"So, until the mother dies, he can't kill the child."
I'll have the hospital beef up security.
Yeah.
Guys.
Take a look at this.
Look at the mantel.
The hourglass.
"Yeah, it isn't in the Christmas photo which was only taken a couple months earlier."
Could be a recent purchase or they might have moved it there from some other place in the house.
Except we know the unsub spends an hour at each crime scene.
What if he brought it with him as a kind of timer?
"I coddled you all night, and you still dropped the goddamn ball."
"So, this time, we're gonna prepare by me telling you to stop acting like a little boy, start acting like a man, and get the goddamn job done!"

When he`d finished with the sewers Bazalgette turned his attention to London itself.
"His bridges span the river at Putney, Battersea and Hammersmith."
He replaced narrow streets with broad boulevards.
He laid out parks right across the metropolis.

Were you saying that that was when you first saw me?
That's right that's when I first saw you.
"I came in with my mother, and I saw Harriet."
"And I saw a toe-head, blond hair, very nicely decked out youth of 11... 10, 11."
And I figured that had to be you.
OK.
Did you get that?
Good.
"As I've always said, you must look for opportunity in every situation."
"A lot of people would think if they are let go from an employment position, for example that their future is not looking so very bright."
"But, then, every ending is also a beginning."
"That's, guess what, another chapter heading for the book I'm going to write."
Which I will be having a lot of time for from now on.
Also...
leisure opportunities.
"As a matter of fact, I always wanted to dance."
Have you spoken to Dwight a lot?
You have?
"Well, he's very bright, isn't he?"
Very well educated.
They... seem to like that.
"Yes, it's true."
"I have been promoted, Michelangelo."
How did you guess?
"You see, I made a counterproposal to Mr Diamonds after Bradley's proposal didn't go over so well at the press conference."
"I could see that Mr Diamonds was not impressed by ""M is for mortality""."
Ladies don't want to be thinking about death and dying when they're buying a fragrance.
"Anyway, so I thought, under the circumstances, why not change tack and target the youth market with the perfume?"
"Actually, it was talking to you that gave me the idea."
You know that?
"Yeah, young people, they have identity issues and insecurities about body odour."
"Am I right, Michelangelo, hmm?"
"So I thought of ""M is for me""."
"It works for the 12- to 16-year-old out-of-control hormonal situation, that teenage demographic, and, then, as for the under-12s with their... so used to violence with their video games, that brand association of murder and perfume... whoa, man!"
That could really take off.
"Now, well, Mr Diamonds, he didn't exactly get it at first, but then he got kind of excited and he called it damage limitation, Michelangelo."
And I think there's an amazing niche right there... in damage limitation.

"You go to a club, you have a couple drinks, you meet a 9.9 whose 1/10 deduction is 'cause he's too hot, so you ride that train."

"I can't step in now and crush his dreams, but just do me a favor."
"The next time you two are getting so excited about this genius plan,"
"I want you to take a step back, take off the mom goggles, and take another look, 'cause I think you're gonna be really surprised at what you see."
"Roger Frank screwed you, and we're gonna screw Roger Frank."
Here's the plan.
"We need the key to Roger's office, but the only time he lets it out of his sight is at his weekly massage."
"The receptionist is a hard-ass, but I've arranged a distraction."
While I occupy the laundry attendant... you steal a uniform... slip into the room where Roger is zoned out post-massage... take the key...
without being noticed.
"Get to the window, where I'll be waiting."
I'll make a quick copy... then bring back the original... which you'll return to Roger... on your way out the door.
"After a quick stop at my highly illegal fireworks contact, we'll have everything we need to take that bastard down."

"He's the only individual, as far as I know, who's trying to tackle this problem."
The film crew are keen to film him catching a bear.
"As soon as the next trap is sprung, he'll give them a call."
"Meanwhile, the team are trying to film the other problem animal - the macaques that raid the farmlands."
"Filming macaques crop-raiding is a huge challenge because they see any human presence as a major threat, so they'll run as soon as they sense that they have been noticed."
"So I guess the important thing is to kind of get a sense of which direction they're going, if they're coming down..."
They are being helped by scientist Takayo Soma.
"She grew up round here, so she knows the situation very well."
"Finding macaques is easy, but the team want to film their crop-raiding behaviour."
That's not so straightforward.
The farmers are keen to move the macaques on and they use firecrackers and dogs to scare them away.
"The macaques cause £5 million worth of damage every year, so it's understandable."
"It's such a big issue, there's even a monkey policeman on patrol."
I think he's following us now.
I think he knows we're onto something.
"The crew just need a bit of time to film, so Takayo goes to negotiate."
She has a trick up her sleeve.
You bribed him with an Oreo?
You gave him some biscuits?
He gave you a biscuit?
I had biscuit.

Two bites.

That's a brilliant bit of work.

"As you see, her postscript is in response to the Babington's letter."
I took the precaution yesterday to order a search in his quarters in Derbyshire.
Texts on encrypted codes were secreted there.
Also drafts of letters to her agents in Spain.
There is no question of her culpability.
"Mr. Babington and his associates should be rounded up, brought to trial."
And the Queen of Scot!
"If my cousin confesses her guilt,"
"And vows to put an end to her wretched plotting, she will yet be pardoned."
"The new Association Statute dictates, as claimant and chief conspirator, she, too, must be brought to trial."
"Your Majesty, that is law now."
"How pressing you were on that legislation,"
Sir Francis.
I see now that I underestimated you in that regard.
I will not make the same mistake again.
"My Lords, you shall attend to the proceedings on my behalf."
Remember the eyes of the world herald the actions of us princes...
and judge us accordingly.
"""Cousin, you have in various ways and means, attempted to take my life, and bring my kingdom to destruction by bloodshed."
"These treason's have been proved against Babington, and your fellow conspirators, have been punished for their actions."
"Ii is my command that you answer the peers of my kingdom, as if I myself, were present."
"Act honestly, cousin, and you might yet attain my favor. """
"30 noblemen commissioned as judges, arranged thus."
Come on.
"Put it there,"
"To indicate the presence of the queen, in her absence."
And the Queen of Scot's?
"If... if we place her adjacent, that makes her an equal."
"She goes there, where we can read her face."
"No, could you...?"
Get this damn dog out of here!
We need chairs here and here.
"Everything is part of one whole and living organism,"
And each part is vital to the survival of the whole.
I believe the Earth is one living being.
The end of anyone life form will lead to hardship of another.
"And if there are too many hardships, the whole will suffer beyond healing."
I was taught that the most important thing is to have a peaceful heart.
When we account that with who we are...
We treat other life forms with compassion and kindness.
Nature will always contain mysteries...
We do not need to solve them all...
We just need to be open and let it feel us.
"The energy of nature moves through the cycle of birth, death and rebirth..."
And it continues on and on...
Moving from one form of life to another.
Long before humans were able to communicate through modern medias...
Cultures separated by vast oceans were sharing the same values.
"They speak in many languages,"
"Yet, their messages continue to ... one another across the globe."
I'm a man of people of the tides.
Much of who I amcomes from the sea.
Much of our spirituality comes from the sea.
Somehow we are called back to the that place where all began...
"When there are things alive in the sea, then the sea becomes beautiful."
When there are animals and creatures on Earth...
Then the mother Earth becomes beautiful.
"When life is good, then we have time for the artist..."
The we have time to see the art.
It reminds us of the heritage of our tribe.
I live in a place where I can see all of nature...
And this is how I learn...
All the lessons to living for out there.
"When I go into bear country, I do ceremony for the bears..."
Not to psychoanalyze somebody that I have no business psychoanaIyzing.
But I feel like tbere is something fresh in tbe way be sees things.
"It seems odd, doesn't it?"
THat this Western guy is in love with tbe blues and tbe feeling of pain in those songs.
And jazz that feeds His soul as well.
He Has continually challenged Himself and by doing that be bas made it difficult to get tired of bim.
So the big surprise for everybody turns out to be that....
Guess what?
He was serious all along.
In 1993 Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.
It's just....
It's just been very nice because I've been directing films for 23 years out of the 39 I've been in tHe business and this comes out of the small films I've made¸:
"Tbe Honkytonk Mans, and the Bronco Billys, and Beguiled in 1969 and a Iot of films where I thougbt I took chances."
"Eastwood discovered His artistry as His audiences did gradually, over time."
"He invented a new kind of movie Hero and then, as He matured sharply criticized His creation."
"He Has never limited Himself to one genre or one kind of filmmaking moving freely between mass-market entertainments and small, personal projects."
Eastwood is an elusive artist an intensely private man who reveals Himself only through His work.
"Today, He remains a complex, contradictory and essential figure in American culture."
I did fall in love with Him the minute He was born.
And I don't think I ever fell out.
He was the biggest baby born in St. Francis hospital in San Francisco.
They took him all around to show tbe other ladies what they might have done.
So it was kind of fun. lt started out fun.
I was raised during tbe not-so-great depression.
We didn't know tbe difference as kids.
We just knew what you knew.
We couldn't afford tbe movies.
Those days were very poor.
We didn't do anything very extra.
They got His father a job in a gas station down in Los Angeles.
He was Happy to Have it.
We all trekked down there.
The Bruce chose Loudoun Hill instead.
"The Bruce had a few more men to work with now, about 600, and he put them to work gilding the lily, digging trenches to further reduce the opportunities for a wide assault, narrowing them down to a point."
"On 1 0th May the English approached, 3,000 strong."
They charged.
Then they found out about the valley and the trenches.
They lost their elbow room.
A lot of them lost their horses as well.
"When the Bruce and his men attacked, it was with such terrible violence that those English troops at the rear, those not yet engaged, decided not to engage at all."
They broke and ran.
It was no fluke.
Robert I was a winner.
God was on his side.
"God had also had enough of Longshanks, the Lawgiver, the slaughterer of Scots."
"Angered by the failure of his much larger forces to crush the Bruce,"
Edward dragged himself out of his sickbed and ordered his armies to muster at Carlisle.
"But he was iller than he thought, and older too."
This is as far as he got - the sands and marsh of the Solway Firth.
He died within sight of Scotland.
But the covetous King did not go gently.
"He asked his son to send his heart to the Holy Land on crusade, but his bones would go with the army to Scotland to finish the business."
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
"Longshanks' bones weren't up to the task, but they weren't the problem."
Edward II was.
"He had his father's temper, but nothing else."
Not his intelligence or his learning or his tactical gifts.
His first act as king was to disobey his father's orders concerning the disposition of his various body parts.
He simply dropped dad off at Waltham Abbey to await proper burial.
"Then, in his own good time, he joined the English army in Scotland."
"On arrival, he learned they'd been badly provisioned, so he marched them south for a good square meal."
"He would leave the Scots in peace, by and large, for the next three years."
And now the Bruce had a job to do - Edward's job.
A man must put others down to feel good about himself.
Hmm.

"Bravo, Lieutenant."

"Following our discussion, sir."
Supposing Lucerne was right before when he got the idea that Ward Fowler was our man.
Supposing Ward Fowler had planted that thread on the gun himself.
I don't quite follow you.
"Well, sir, supposing you..."
"I mean, supposing Lieutenant Lucerne was right, and Claire Daley was blackmailing you like in the TV show."
"Lieutenant, I thought we agreed that I had what you called an iron-clad alibi?"
"Ain'tight, sir, that's what we actually say."
"Yes, sir, but you know as well as I do that you could have rigged that alibi."
"It was very brave of you, sir, to show me the videotape machine."
You certainly like to take a chance.
"And I always wondered, of course, how two drinks could have given Mark such a hangover."
I figured it was phenobarbital.
And then he would be out.
"And you'd be able to tape the game, and go over to Tony's, and kill Claire, and get home, and then wake up Mark."
And he would be disoriented and groggy and guilty about drinking.
"And when you saw the ballgame on TV, and it looked just about the same as it did when he passed out, he'd be glad to assume he'd only been out for a minute or two instead of the hour and a half that had actually passed."
"And you changed his watch, didn't you?"
And then you changed it back to the right time after he was asleep.
"That was a mistake, sir."
You shouldn't have set it to the correct time because Mark always keeps his watch five minutes fast.
I wondered about that.
A thousand dollar watch just doesn't lose five minutes overnight.
Is that it?
"No, sir."
There's also the height of the criminal.

"And some, I assume, are good people."
"Whereas the rest of us looked at Trump and saw someone who was impossibly vulgar and impolite,"
"Roger looked at him and said, ""You know, this is someone who voters might like."""
"I mean, Roger actually gets democracy in a way,"
I think most people who cover politics don't.
"You know, democracy is the process of appealing to the majority."
"My name's Donald Trump, and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York."
"I own buildings all over the place, model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant."
But it wasn't always so easy.
"About 13 years ago, I was billions of dollars in debt."
"But I fought back and I won, big league."
Now my company is bigger than it ever was and I'm having more fun than I ever had.
"Hello, everybody."
"Fifteen seasons of The Apprentice not only makes him a smooth television performer, but think of the way he looked."
"High-backed chair, perfectly lit, great makeup, great hair, decisive, making decisions, running the show."
He looks presidential.
"Do you think voters, non-sophisticates, make a difference between entertainment and politics?"
Politics is show business for ugly people.
Roger always wanted me to run for president.
"And over the years, every time a presidential race came up, he always wanted me to run."
And I just didn't have interest at that time.
And nor was the country in trouble like it is today.
The American Dream is dead.

Ellia was just a child.
Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?
"So you know about that, then?"
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
But when I found a young female lying unconscious some distance from the crash...
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
"To this day, the people of the village don't know, and you must promise not to tell them."
She's not responsible for what's been happening.
Then who is?
"I believe another wraith survived the crash, an adult."
That's who you should be looking for.
"If she does not feed, how does she live?"
"At first,"
"I fed her as you would any child, and that seemed to suffice, but then something began to change."
The food no longer gave her any sustenance.
There was a hunger growing in her that would not be satisfied.
"I heard the stories of the other creature, what it did to survive, and I was afraid that was what Ellia would become."
And so I... started to experiment.
I have extensive knowledge of the chemical properties of various medicinal plants that grow in this forest.
Are you interested in science?
"I'm not sure that's what I would call this, but yes."
"Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day, and I wasn't sure that I could do anything for her, but eventually..."
I came up with this.
A drug that allows the wraith to survive without feeding?
That's what he said.
Is such a thing even possible?
"We don't know enough about wraith physiology to say for certain, although, I must admit it's intriguing that this dr."
Zaddik claims the wraith survived on normal food for a time.
Why?
"Well, if he's telling the truth, it might be the answer to a very puzzling question."
- What is it?
"- I need to know if you're happy with the way your case is being handled, because if Mike Ross isn't doing everything he can to help you..."
Stop right there.
Mr. Ross has dedicated himself to finding justice for my son.
"And not only that, when I was offered a settlement, he convinced me to turn it down and find out the real truth, so you tell whoever's in charge that I don't want anyone else working on this case other than Mike and Oliver."

"And we're all really, really excited, and we don't have to wear our hats, and we don't have to wear our aprons anymore because they're our marks of service."
This is very exciting.
"The summer fair was the highlight of the year, and for the men and women of the house party, this is a rare occasion to spend the day together."
"With everybody off to the fair, the house is an open invitation to burglars, risky with so many desperate ex-servicemen roaming the land."
"These deterrents may not look that effective close up, but from afar they did give some impression there were people in the house."
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the fair."
"lots of fun games, drinking, lots of fine food."
So I just hope you all enjoy yourselves.
Charge your glasses and have fun.
Go!
"Go on, girls!"
She's storming ahead.
She wants that dress.
Every fair had a smock race.
"my staff indicates, with assurance, that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara before the New Year."
I want to put you all at ease.
We will tolerate no guerrillas in the casinos or the swimming pools.
"He said that they're making an arrest, and in a few minutes he'll let us through."
Johnny...
It's nothing.
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.
Viva Fidel!
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.
Make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it.
I'm very pleased you're all able to come from such distances to be with me today.
"When a man comes to this point in his life, he wants to turn over the things he's been blessed with."
"Turn them over to friends, as a reward for the friends he's had and to make sure that everything goes well after he's gone."
-Not for years.
"-Hear, hear!"
We'll see.
"The doctors would disagree, but what do they know?"
These are wonderful things that we've achieved in Havana and there's no limit to where we can go from here.
"This kind of government knows how to help business, to encourage it."
The hotels here are bigger and swankier than any of the joints in Vegas.
"We can thank our friends in the Cuban government which has put up half the cash with the Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis and has relaxed restrictions on imports."
What I'm saying is that we have now what we have always needed...
Real partnership with a government.
Smaller piece.
You all know Michael Corleone and we all remember his father.
"At the time of my retirement, or death,"
I turn over all my interests in the Havana operation to his control.
"But, all of you will share."
"The Nacionale will go to the Lakeville Road Boys, the Capri to the Corleone family, the Sevilla Biltmore also, but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino brothers,"
"Dino and Eddie, for a piece and to handle the casino operations."
You chose your love life over your actual life in that bunker.
I saw it on your face when you made up your mind to go for the girl.
"Petra, I have the keys to the boat."
"Let's go, Let's go!"
"That did not fail to impress you know what, that's not exactly what happened."
We're listening.
Ok so I ran a little thought experiment inside our thought experiment.
"I didn't think anyone would mind if I fiddle with things, just a bit and your thought experiment has hit what premise?"
Whats the point of living if you can't have sex?
Really!
?
"Yeah, I was just a sterile kid in a bunker everybody else was starting to pair up to save the human race sex for procreation only, so I would've been the odd man out"
or I could be one man with...
six women all to myself.
So I found another uninhabited island outside the detonation zone...
"Hold it, I was on that boat too, what happened to me?"
Drowned.
And me?
Barracuda attack?
What about me?
"Ah Andy, the day that we arrive at the new island, you had a run in with the palm tree."
You turned to bone by the end of the week because of your hideous disease.
So it was just myself and the ladies.
"Me being a carpenter, I built a shelter we set up shop."
"Had a girl for each night of the week and on the seventh night, I rested."
"Um, excuse me you're sterile why would we have sex with you at all?"
"Ah, because that's the flip side to my thought experiment what do you do if you're six girls?"
And you need to start repopulating the human race?
You've only got one man to work with?
And he's infertile?
"You try, try and try again."
"Any specialist can tell you that in someone my age infertility is more often than not, sub-fertility."
The biggest loser in the reshuffle is real-life Countess Griaznov.
her title has secured her the grandest room in the house.
"Well, I think maybe we should keep our own chamber pot."
"I'll carry that then, shall I?"
"I mean, I'm not happy, because my room is beautiful, and it's one of the big joys of being here is waking up in it every morning."
Just... it is gorgeous.
"Um, but, yeah..."
"The new guest is a potential rival for the heart of Mr. Gorell Barnes, a gentleman whom the countess rightly regards as her natural partner."
I get on very well with Mr. Gorell Barnes.
"Feel like we're head girl and head boy in a strange sort of way, and Mrs. Rogers is headmistress."
"And to cap it all, Miss Samuel's lovebirds have no respect for the countess's rank."
"And my new room is just above the new, evil, screechy birds."
I wasn't feeling particularly well disposed to her
My philosophy on the birds is it's cruel to keep them caged;
we should just eat them instead...
on toast.
"Of all the chaperones,"
Mrs. Enright has the most cause to feel threatened by the new girl.
"Her charge, Miss Conick, is at the bottom of the pile."
Now her prospects of marriage seem remoter than ever.
She was a bit upset when she heard that there's another girl arriving.
"I said, ""Why are you upset?"""
"""Well,"" she said, ""I don't quite know why."""
"""Why is that?"" ""I don't know, dear."
"I'm honestly just upset for you."""
"And I went, ""I'm not upset."""
"Intelligent, beautiful, and wealthy... right up my street."
The master comes to inspect the room the chaperones have arranged for Miss Samuel.
He is not impressed.
"I think it's pretty horrible, and I think it would be unfair if she was put in here, so my suggestion is to change... which I'm going to obviously run by with Mrs. Rogers, but it's to change Mrs. Rogers' boudoir into her bedroom,"
"and then I think, the countess will go back to her room,"
"Miss Hopkins will have her room again, and Miss Francesca will be back here."
I want this man Stubbs apprehended and dealt with.
"Hostility to your projected marriage is not limited to a handful of miscreants,"
Your Grace.
The view is widespread among your subjects.
"And you, gentlemen... where do you focus your opinion now on this matter?"
"This decision is too weighted to take alone, My Lords."
I must have your council on how I am to proceed.
Advise me!
"I can not wait for that day, Your Majesty!"
I will live for it!
"Let the jewels on my dress be like a thousand eyes, so that my subjects know, however distant,"
I am always watching out for them.
"And let there be no shadows on my face or my neck, for they accentuate age."
"Immortal is the look we're after, sir, and virginal."
"Divinity, if you can so render it."
My hair should be loose.
"Oh, and make much of my hands!"
"Emphasize your slenderness,"
Because I have been told that they are my best feature.
"Henceforth, when my people think of their queen, this is the image they must see."
"Her reply, the Queen of Scots writes mainly of her rescue."
"On the subject of assassination, she is... more circumspect."
"Your proven knowledge might be hard to prove, sir."
"I heard tell when Her Majesty was to be sent to the Tower by his sister, she wrote begging her for mercy."
"In order...that no incriminating postscripts could be later be added, she drew lines like thus."
Pity her cousin lacked such forethought.
Take this down.
"""I would be be glad to know..."""
Is this to be in...in her coded letter?
"Both the coded letter and the transcription, Master Phelippes."
"""I would be glad to know the names of the 6 gentlemen who are going to accomplish the dispatch of the impostor queen."
"With such knowledge, I may advise them on how best to achieve their mission."
Henry VIII 's illegitimate daughter also now claimed to be Queen of England.
She had been born just eight months after her parents' wedding.
"And in the eyes of many, she was not only illegitimate as a daughter, but would be illegitimate as a queen."
"So, Mary's French family stoked her ambition, as she became the vehicle for theirs."
They encouraged her to dream - that now the crown of England really could be hers too.
"If she got it, one single, united empire would stretch from Scotland in the north to France in the south."
"This would be a Catholic empire, vast and powerful, that would dominate the west of Europe."
Wasn't that what God had in mind for Mary?
"But her rival, Elizabeth, was English, Protestant and a Tudor."
So she got the crown and Mary's dream of a vast Catholic empire slipped away.
"And soon, even the certainty of her own French crown was under threat."
The Protestant Reformation was coming.
"This religious revolution was spreading across Europe, promising to sweep away Catholic monarchs like Francois and Mary."
"just a few months into their reign, a group of rebels stormed the chateau at Amboise and tried to capture the king."
So who were the rebels?
"They were Protestants, but they were lords."
- We know their name now.
"- Oh, right."
"And they wanted to plot against the royal family and the king, Francois II,"
- who was young and weak.
- Right.
"The revolt failed, and a very public and very bloody example was made of the rebels."
"How much of this would Mary, Queen of Scots have seen with her own eyes?"
"We know she saw the bodies at the balconies of the chateau, because she was in the chateau."
It was the first time she was confronted with such a thing.
- Such violence!
- Yes.
First time she saw this.
The bodies were hung from here to show the people?
- To make an example.
- This is what you get.
"Just a few months later,"
This is a list of the things that we're working toward.
Now if you would shut the fuck up for the 50th billionth time...
"These are things we agree on, actually."
"These are things that we're agreeing on, and these are things you've all got skewed fucking views on."
"You think that feminists are trying to take away your fucking rights, but as a matter of fact, what we're trying to do"
"1s we're actually trying to work on the same things that you're working on, except the fact that you're so..."
You're just too busy hating women...
You're a fucking hate group.
You can't see we're trying to work on those same situations.
"Are you conflating feminism, which is an ideology, with women, which is a demographic of society?"
"Okay, mister derailing for dummies."
"So, really, your hatred is for feminists."
- You're still a hate group.
"- An ideology, yes."
"I hate also hate a lot of other ""isms""."
"- So you admit, though."
"- Racism, sexism."
"Oh, bullshit, bullshit."
"Bullshit, you hate sexism, but you're an mra."
"Okay, no."
Point taken.
We...
"like, we win."
You obviously haven't read our literature.
Sorry.
Okay!
You don't actually work on anything.
You're creating any change in the fucking world.
"Your website, your fucking website, the hate website against feminists..."
You're not actually creating any change.
Feminists do not want you to have to make alimony payments.
"Alimony is set up to combat the fact that women have been historically expected to prioritize domestic duties over professional goals, thus minimizing their earning potential if their traditional marriages end."
A suicide mission.
"You know, I was in a similar situation once."
"My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week, but when we finally located the only oasis for 100 Miles, it was surrounded by angry sandbenders."
I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.
"So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog-monkeys... enough of your ridiculous lies."
Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?
Hold on.
Maybe Bumi's right.
"We don't have a catapult and hog-monkeys, but we have a flying bison, and there's a plane on Varrick's ship."
Maybe we can attack from above.
What are you thinking?
"Mako, Bolin, and I can use the plane to create a distraction and scatter some of the defenses."
"You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening."
T's get moving.
"What are we still doing here, father?"
"The invasion was completely successful, and the Southern tribe is under our control."
The spirit portals are open.
You've restored balance.
Now we would like to go home.
You don't understand.
Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.
What else is there?
The water tribe is united.
"After today, there will be no more water tribe, no more nations of any kind."
"The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent and new, and I will lead this glorious revolution."
Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal.
From whom?
We've already beaten everyone.
The Avatar will be here soon.
She has no choice.
Are you ready?
"I'm an earthbender strapped to the wing of a plane hundreds of feet in the air, so no."
We cannot wait to free these gorgeous horses.
Horses?
Of course.
"We're here to discuss the NYPD Mounted Unit, right?"
Ending equine slavery.
"While this meeting does have to do with your position as CEO of the Animal Salvation Fund, Ms. Karnow, horse emancipation is not on the docket, I'm afraid."
"Rather, we would like to discuss your campaign to end seal hunting."
LUNDQUIST:
A selfie?
"Sealfie, actually."
You and your group have branded seal hunting barbaric.
"But the so-called barbarians, in this modern day and age, well, they also have access to cell phones and social media, just like you do."
LUNDQUIST:
You told me you wanted to talk to Raina about a crime.
I think you should cut to the chase.
"As your client well knows, the Sealfie movement was started by the Inuits to counter outside pressure to end seal hunting."
Sealfies show that the Inuit's very survival and culture depends on the practice.
"The young man in this photograph, for example,"
"Tendu, he's wearing seal skin, he's, uh, eating seal jerky."
BELL:
He's also a rising star in the world of eSports.
That made him one of the movement's more visible proponents.
"His Sealfies went viral, causing you a lot of embarrassment."
You even lost a few of your celebrity supporters.
And how did you respond?
By threatening him in the comments section of his posts.
"""If you continue to support this senseless slaughter, you and your people deserve--"" in all caps-- ""extinction."""
"Two nights ago, this man was murdered with a seal-killing club that belongs to Tendu."
The person who did this was trying to frame him.
HOLMES:
"Not quite as drastic as killing him, but an effective way to silence his voice."
"Okay, this is crazy."
'There's a lot of interest in Bobby's execution 'all over the state.'
Reports are coming in of a hold-up at the Supreme Court.
'I can give you the good news 'that things are pending before the Supreme Court...'
"If the Supreme Court decides they want to weigh in and consider one of these appeals, there could be a last-minute stay, a delay in Garza's execution today."
"It's kind of crazy that the Supreme Court hasn't ruled yet, though."
You could say that it means they're actually looking at it.
"But for all we know, they're just, you know, dragging out time and then it will just be harder for him and his family."
Did somebody walk across the street?
We'll know what's going to happen when we see the people walk from this building into that building.
They go up the stairs there.
"All right, bye."
It's gone through.
TEXT ALERT
Jeff just says there's nothing.
"Apparently, there was a big stir going on at the Governor's office, and it didn't amount to anything."
So... it's done.
WOMEN SOB
That's my mom!
"Oh, my God."
It's from Ray.
"""As I post this, Robert Garza is being executed."""
"I'm here outside the Walls Unit in downtown Huntsville, where at 8.41pm tonight, Robert Garza was pronounced dead after having received a lethal injection."
"Approximately ten minutes goes by in stunned silence inside that room while I and the other members of the media are just feet away from the members of Garza's family, who are racked with emotion and anguish as they watch him slip away."
"Again, at 8.41pm tonight,"
Robert Garza was pronounced dead by lethal injection.
"In Huntsville, Kirk Chaisson, Channel 5 News at 10."
All right?
"You would think that with time, it would get easier to deal with it, or at least you'd learn to deal with it, but it actually gets worse."
I think it does get worse.
"Joy, relief, a little bit of apprehension about what comes next."
"Be proud of your hard work, your sacrifices."
Be proud of the decision you made to go to law school.
He denounced the anachronisms of the City and its constitutional privileges.
"In Fleet Street, I had to restrain his attempts at violence... towards the Lord Mayor."
"But later, when we stood on the portico of the Royal Exchange... he became quiet and reflected."
"For Londoners, London is obscured."
"Too thinly spread, too private for anyone to know."
"Its social life invisible, its government abolished."
Its institutions at the discretion of either monarchy or state.
"Or the city, where at the historic centre... there is nothing but a civic void... which fills and empties daily with armies of clerks and dealers... mostly citizens of other towns."
"The true identity of London, he said, is in its absence."
"As a city, it no longer exists."
"In this alone, it is truly modern."
London was the first metropolis to disappear.
We walked home across Southwark Bridge in silence.
"When we got back, I stood at the window."
In the nine months or so since I had returned to London... a number of changes had taken place in the street where Robinson lived.
The street itself had been designated a red route.
A device to speed the flow of commuters from the suburbs to the centre.
"During August, there'd been a spate of shop-breaking... by a group of teenage boys... so that all the shops across the road had fitted roller shutters... and at night the pavement was now lined with aluminium."
"The next morning, I woke at 5:30."

You ever fart and sneeze at the same time?
You ever barf up something you know you didn't eat?
I got sick one time and barfed a whole shrimp.
"I mean, I know I chewed it."
I got a better one.
"Once, I barfed so hard that I pulled a string bean out of my nose."
That was gross.
"Oh, that's so slimy."
Ew.
I did not believe it in an objective sense.
I want to talk about his deleterious effects to the deficiency of the activity.
Do you not understand it?
"Attention to me, Tót family."
In a dark room the smallest noise multiplies the sound.
"The idleness affects onto the organization so, than the darkness onto the hearing organs."
"Intensifies the inner rustles, causes dazzles on the fields of sight, it brings about a murmur in a brain."
"I with my soldiers, if there is nothing their occupation,"
I have it cut off always and sew back their trouser buttons.
From this the spiritual balance is re-establish.
"I hope for it now already you understand it, what I wanted how it before."
If it is for major lord his trouser buttons came off we sew it back with Ágika immediately.
You misunderstood my words totally.
I ask your indulgence.
Am I allowed to speak?
"I take it very well the major lord and trust me that the mom and i, we never sit by idly."
What do you do?
"At this time evening falls, if there is not other our thing, we fold up boxes."
What boxes?
I show it immediately.
For the bandage factory of Eger because of the war multiplied his production the factory the automaton of one single box maker was not able to supply it.
The families of the neighbourhood secured a little easy housework so.
The factory gave the cardboards
It was necessary to cut it up according to the cutting shape... and to chop and to fold up.
"This they was made with margincutting, what Tót botch up from some board pieces and from a kitchen knife."
"Similarly to the devices that the photographers and binders use, only sure in somewhat naiver version."
Like this.
Like this.
And ready.
Great!
Well this is great!
Why did you not speak till now?
You have fallen in love!
"I will make an ornamental belt for you, will you come?"
Will you give me some place to stick on?
"I will make an ornamental belt for you, will you come?"
Will you give me some place to stick on?
Why do I need an ornamental belt?
Don't you have two hands to put around my waist?
Darling with beautiful nose and eyes The best bet for kisses
Shall I measure your chest and give a pearl necklace?
"One in great heights, and beau with lucky moles..."
"While you measure the chest, touch a little"
"Oh silver pot, golden chain turn to this 'chiyaan' side"
"If given a chance, will come  strike This is Coimbatore mischief"
"I will make an ornamental belt for you, will you come?"
Will you give me some place to stick on?
Why do I need an ornamental belt?
Don't you have two hands to put around my waist?
"Melting pure gold, placing a star stone"
I will get you an ornament for your forehead
Will you be after me?
Ornament for forehead is not necessary
Blue stone too is not necessary
Will you sport the 'kumkum' dot on my forehead?
"Shall I bore your sharp nose for pearl nose screws, will you come?"
Your pearl nose screw won't work out
Will you come to rub nose to nose?
I will give you the golden ear stud
Will you come with your bod?
Whisper the auspicious date in the ear that wears the stud
"I will make an ornamental belt for you, will you come?"
Will you give me some place to stick on?
Why do I need an ornamental belt?
"If you won a game, he said, ""I had great players."
"I couldn't have done it without my players."""
"By the early 1980s,"
"Smith's teams were again loaded with talent, especially 1982 with James worthy, the centerpiece of a legendary team-in-the-making."
"Sam Perkins was a sophomore, Matt Doherty, a sophomore,"
"Sam Perkins was a sophomore, Matt Doherty, a sophomore,"
"Jimmy black was our senior leader point guard, and then, we added this young freshman from Wilmington, north Carolina, about 165 pounds, this kid named, uh..."
"I-I forget, sometimes."
I think his name was Michael Jordan.
"First time I saw Michael, I was like, first time I saw Michael, I was like,"
"""this guy is so confident..."
"That it's scary."""
I was the best guy on the team at the time.
"He sought me out and started to like, in a friendly way, like, bully me."
"That playful arrogance might've worked on his teammates, but Jordan soon learned that impressing his coach would not be as easy."
"Uh, you never really get comfortable uh, you never really get comfortable where you felt like --"
"Coach made sure that you didn't feel like, you know, you belonged."
He always wanted that hunger to always be out there.
He made sure you understood where you were.
"Even though you're a highly recruited guy, you're the lowest on the totem pole."
"That means you carry balls, you go get water, you carry film projectors -- It doesn't matter."
"So, I was the film-projector carrier."
"So, you're in a suit, you're on the road -- whatever."
You're carrying that projector.
You're carrying that projector.
"Before the 1982 season, it was clear to everyone that Michael Jordan was headed for the starting lineup --"
Even sports illustrated.
"""Please let us put Michael on the cover with the other four guys."""
"""Not gonna do it."
"Not gonna have a freshman on the cover and, after all, you're not gonna name my starting lineup."""
I think it bugged Michael a little bit.
"I mean, I understood it."
"He took it, as the English later said, ""like a man of war"""
which is exactly what he was.
"By the end of the first week of April,"
Edward had appointed an agent in Scotland.
"Edward ordered him to raise dragon, the banner which signified no quarter, no prisoners, no mercy, no rules at all."
And the English rode north.
Wishart and Lamberton were swiftly captured.
The English regained Cupar Castle and moved towards Perth.
Robert I rode to meet them with all the forces at his disposal.
King Robert camped in the woods above Methven on the 1 8th June.
"He had failed to draw the English out from Perth to a pitched battle in the accepted, sporting style of medieval chivalry."
So he would try again tomorrow.
But the dragon banner was flying.
"For the English, chivalry was by the by."
They approached under cover of darkness.
"It was a rout, a slaughter."
Robert and a few hundred survivors dragged themselves west.
"His wife, Elizabeth, was still with them, his daughter and his sisters too, so he se nt the women north, hoping they might find refuge in Norway."
But they were captured and handed over to Edward.
"Robert and his remnant suffered a further defeat at Tyndrum, a defeat that must have seemed final."
"So the King of Scotland was forced to flee still further west, to Dunaverty, at the very tip of the Mull of Kintyre."
There was no land left to run to.
He put to sea and disappeared.
He must have sailed with the bitter knowledge that his crown was proving costly.
Bruce's wife and daughter were confined in convents.
He would not see his wife again for eight years.
"Back on the mainland,"
Edward indulged himself in an orgy of executions.
"One of the victims was Robert's brother, Neil, hung, drawn, quartered, as Wallace had been."
The news of his brother's excruciating death will have bitten deep.
Perhaps this misfortune meant that God didn't want him to be king.
"For six months, Robert the Bruce remained in hiding."
"I must say, it's been rather a good deal for me."
"Oh, did I tell you I was thinking of having a little cinema film made?"
No.
"No, I'm sorry, I can't allow that."
"- Allow what, Howard?"
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I was just leaving.
"Good night, sir."
"Good night, Evelyn."
- I mentioned the idea of a film.
- I told you he wouldn't like it.
What Howard would or would not like is beginning to irritate me.
"First of all, the King congratulated me on our magnificent discovery and then the Queen, whom I sensed was somewhat less excited said,"
"""But can it be quite right?"
"""Breaking into a tomb and digging up a royal personage?"""
(Crowd chuckling)
"I say, Mace,"
I hope you're not falling victim to the curse of Tutankhamun?
"No, no, excuse me,"
I think I've been breathing in too much mummy dust over the years.
"Yes, well, I dare say we're all a little nervous about what we shall find when we knock through the wall behind me."
"So, first, I'd like to ask our chief excavator, and my field director, Mr Howard Carter, to say a few words."
Howard.
"Morning, everyone."
This is a great moment in my life.
"Already this tomb is the single biggest find in the history of archaeology in Egypt, and even if we find nothing more, it will enrich beyond measure our knowledge of what was once a forgotten but mighty culture."
No one knows what lies behind this wall.
"It may be another antechamber, it may be empty."
"Or, if we're lucky, it may be a burial chamber with an intact royal tomb."
"If it is, I trust that we will respect the pharaoh who has lain in peace here for over 3,000 years and that he will forgive our intrusion made in the name of science, the only possible justification,"
"and not, as some have suggested, in the name of profit."
Only Stirling and Berwick castles remained in English hands.
Edward II began raising an army to reconquer Scotland.
"Edward mustered his forces at Berwick on 1 0th June - 1 5,000 footsoldiers, between 2,500 and 3,000 horse."
Edward's nobles were mostly absent and they hadn't sent as many knights as he would have liked either.
"So not exactly a vote of confidence then, but no matter."
Edward had more than enough confidence in himself to make up the shortfall.
They rode north.
"The Scottish forces mustered in the Tor Wood, south of Stirling."
The numbers bore no comparison.
"500 light horse, about 6,000 foot."
But size isn't everything.
"By now, the Bruce's army was used to war."
The men were used to each other.
"His brother Edward, James the Black Douglas,"
"Thomas Randolph, the Earl of Moray, were experienced, battle-hardened men."
"And the footsoldiers of the Scottish army had learnt to fight in schiltroms - packed together in close order, with spears and shields permanently presented."
"Like tanks, but made of human bodies."
"By Saturday 22nd June, the Bruce had chosen where to fight."
He'd had a lot of practice by now.
"He chose wisely - the edges of New Park, near the Bannock Burn."
"The trees limited cavalry action, and to the southeast, the ground was broken by streams and burns and rills."
"On either side of the road leading to the New Park, the Bruce modified the terrain."
"Just as he had done at Loudoun Hill, he made the ground treacherous for his foes, this time by ordering the digging of innumerable pits, disguised with grass and branches."
These would snap the legs of the English horse.
"The English army itself made camp to the north, and night fell."
"The next morning was a Sunday, so the Scots began it with a mass."
"The Bishop of Dunkeld presided, and when the mass was finished, he will have got his weapons ready."
"This would be the reckoning, the payment."
"For the Bruce had lost brothers and friends, family and priests."
"His wife and daughter, dear to him, had been imprisoned."
And those who gave allegiance to him had lost still more.
"And now, the English King was here, no more than a hundred yards away."
"Don't worry, Lutie, i'ii keep on writing to you."
i know you've turned to me only because Doc Reid is gone and that you want nothing from me but news of your children.
"in this letter, i am sending you a likeness of Sarah Beth and Brock."
i obtained it by devious methods from the local photographer.
"You asked about Brewton, Lutie."
i know very little about him.
He seldom comes to town except to do some buying for the ranch now and then.
it would break your heart to ride through this country.
it's all drying up and blowing away.
"Brewton was right about one thing, this land was not ready for plow."
it needed help from us.
"During those first years, when the rains came we should've been at work planning against the time when nature would fall us."
"We should've built dams, brought our own rain and irrigation ditches and culverts and diverted streams."
"Someday, we will do these things and the land will come back."
The hope of seeing that keeps me here.
And something else holds me too.
"Brock is growing up, Lutie, and the way it's happening worries me."
"When Sarah Beth was home, she used to look out for him."
But now that she's away at school Brewton makes no move to curb Brock in anything.
it's almost as though he were trying to make up to him for someone else.
"You, Lutie."
"Whatever it is, it's bad for Brock and i don't like it."
"And i'm forced to stand by, helpless to do anything and watch the wildness in the boy grow stronger."
Everyone likes him.
Maybe that's the trouble.
He's right at home every place.
"Whether he's joshing the girls at Ciancy's Dance Haii or playing ""The Blue Danube"" on Myra Netherwood's new grand piano he's a prime favorite."
And he's a walking contradiction too.
"One day he'ii be dealing whist and euchre from the best horsehair furniture the next, he'ii be prancing up and down the street in his new buggy with a homesteader girl beside him."
BRlCE:
You may see him buying out a showcase of jawbreakers at the Kingman Mercantiie Company for a bunch of runny-nosed kids gentle as a woman.
Or keeping a tomato can rolling at 50 feet with a six-shooter.
The sun rises on Japan.
"More than 6,000 islands on the edge of the Pacific."
Life here is at the mercy of Earth's most powerful elemental forces.
From the wilds of the frozen north...
..to the subtropical warmth of the south... ..animals along this chain of islands have had to adapt in unique and sometimes bizarre ways.
"Throughout this land, people have developed an extraordinary relationship with the natural world..."
..trying to capture its fleeting beauty... ..and tame its spirit.
"But these islands remain wild, mysterious and magical."
This... is Japan.
"Japan's great chain of islands stretches for 2,000 miles."
Right in the middle is its biggest island... ..Honshu.
Here is one of the largest urban areas on Earth.
But this is a wild place too.
"From the volcanic mountains to the edge of the sea, people and nature are drawn together in the most extraordinary ways."
Tokyo.
Home to over 35 million people.
"It's so densely packed, it's hard to imagine there's any room left for nature."
"But as the sun rises on a spring morning, something magical is about to happen."
"In the heart of the city, thousands of cherry trees are bursting into blossom."
"For just a few fleeting days, everyone celebrates."
No other event in Honshu is more welcomed.
"This natural event is so important, it makes front-page news."
"Every spring, across Japan, people follow the sakura zensen - the cherry forecast - eager to see the blossom at its very best."
The magic is all too brief.
The petals start to fall almost as soon as they appear.
"Even in this most urban place, people still yearn for a connection with nature."
But Honshu's cities are crowded for a reason.
"Three-quarters of this island is mountainous, where fewer people can live."
"Over 20 of these peaks are more than 3,000 metres high, pushed up by violent upheavals in the Earth's crust."
This is no place for humans.
The Hida Mountains are instead home to Honshu's wildest creatures.
How much opposition did you have to fight through to place Yi Soon-shin in command of the Left Cholla Naval Station?
"You can forsake a good man in a instant, but it will not be easy to find another good man."
"Your Majesty, offer your warm hands to them first."
And they will return your virtue by serving you with their lives.
There is not one naval commander in the three lower provinces that support you.
No one else has resisted my order to abolish the navy.
Why do you insist on walking the lonely path that no one else will go near?
It is to fight a victorious fight.
To fight a victorious fight...
You wouldn't be uttering empty words to the King.
Honor your word!
"If you suffer one single defeat, I will indeed abolish the navy!"
"What's more, I will take your life and the lives of your men as well!"
I will not commit the impiety of making Your Majesty take our lives.
"As long as I'm alive, I will fight the enemy and win, and if I must die."
I will die on the battlefield as an enemy of the enemy.
High Commander of Left Cholla Naval Station Yi Soon-shin?
"Yes, Your Highness."
Please serve my father well.
"I, Yi Soon-shin, will protect this country Chosun with my life."
You're looking at me with eyes of pity.
Your Majesty...
I've ceded to the stubborn subjects Yu Sung-ryong and Yi Soon-shin again.
Is that what you think?
"No, Your Majesty."
How could I when you've killed two birds with one stone?
Killed two birds?
"One, you've renewed the loyalty of High Commander Yi Soon-shin and Left"
"Minister Yu Sung-ryong, and two, you've stopped Yoon Du-su's influence from growing out of proportion since military leaders Shin Lip, Yi Il and Won Kyun are"
Westerners.
"In February of 1592 when the talks of abolishing the navy was casing a stir in Chosun, the Japanese fleet laid anchored in a harbor delaying the launching which was to take place on March 1st."
It was because Hideyoshi had suddenly taken ill.
So O.G. was acting as an agent in a brand-new sport with no real regulation or oversight.
How much are these deals worth?
Tons.
Millions.
"I mean, they say it can get pretty crazy when two teams compete over a hot new player."
Do you think that's why O.G. was attacked?
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.
"Excuse me, would you?"
"Hey, where are you?"
HOLMES (over phone):
Where are you?
The precinct.
The captain wanted to talk about...
"The violent assault of one O.G. Pwnzr during a live video stream, perhaps?"
You heard about it.
An associate sent me video of the attack just moments after.
He was concerned that O.G. might require medical assistance.
So I began investigating right away.
And?
I noticed an odd pattern of lights in the corner of the video.
I realized it was two different billboards flashing outside O.G.'s window.
"I spent the last few hours stalking midtown, searching for a location which faced two such billboards at the right angles."
My search was a success.
You found the crime scene?
That's the good news.
The bad news is medical assistance won't be required.
"So, as we know from the live stream, the assailant, likely a male with significant upper-body strength, pistol-whipped O.G., then smashed the camera, ending the stream."
"He then secures O.G. to the chair, using computer cables, and continued to beat him."
"So either someone really, really didn't like the guy, or they wanted information from him."
These bruises would have taken at least 30 minutes to develop.
"Implying that, for reasons unknown, the killer paused his attack for half an hour before delivering a final, fatal series of blows."
The motion for dismissal is denied.
"Moreover, this case has been settled by the confession of the accused; thus, it is not to be discussed again."
I cannot accept this!
I'm certain I will find evidence if I dig deeper!
Stop the investigation!
It is His Majesty's order!
The scholars of the academy will not give up even if we stop.
I'm sure His Majesty's statement has been delivered to the academy.
It's time to wrap it up.
Don't press forward with this for you own sake.
"If you defy the royal command, you could be charged with treason."
The scholars' concern for the state affairs is truly commendable.
"But if their voices are used to vilify high ministers of court without evidence to support their claim, they are to be kept distant."
The first duty of a student who has entered the academy of higher learning is to focus on their learning.
Act with discretion and practice restraint.
How did this happen?
The prisoners are on the verge of death.
How can you stop the investigation?
I don't know what to say.
"I knew they were powerful, but..."
This must be how they managed to carry on their scheme for decades.
What is to become of the prisoners now?
Are we going to let them die in confinement?
I don't know what to say...
Talk about hard luck...
"He suffered enough injustice being born a dirt poor peasant, but just when he can put food his mouth, he is doomed to die!"
"Chun-su, you fool..."
"If you were going to go like this, why did you have to befriend me?"
Look who's here!
If it isn't the backstabbing traitor who sold his friend out!
I have to ask you for a favor.
You can forget it.
With scents?
The preliminary results are very interesting.
Would you like to see them?
"So, Logan didn't get the, uh, results he wanted, and now he wants to test fake results."
No.
"No, I wanted to study the power of suggestion, something that you and I have talked about in our own work."
"Virginia, it-- is there any, uh..."
particular reason you're insisting he stay here?
"I'm making lemonade out of lemons, Bill."
"I didn't want Dan Logan to join us as our principle investor, if you'll recall."
I wanted Hugh Hefner.
"But you ignored my request, not for the first time, and as a result,"
"I have found something in his work that adds value to our work, an avenue that invites study."
"If you want to investigate the psychosomatic effects of treatment, in five seconds, I could design a study that is far more tailored to our work than some-- some phony sniff test with Logan."
"Even if he does go, you can't force me to work on your surrogacy program."
-  My surrogacy program?
- Isn't it your program if you're going forward with it regardless of my objections?
"Bill, I haven't put my foot down about something that you are interested in, and so I would expect the same consideration from you."
"In fact, I insist upon it."
The institute that bears both our names has enough room to accommodate us both.
"Dr. Masters, sorry to interrupt, but, um, Jack Coleridge is here."
"Go ahead, Bill."
I think we're done here.
"Mr. Coleridge, allow me to introduce Nora Everett."
"Miss Everett, Jack Coleridge."
"Nora, I-I don't know what I was expecting, but..."
I wasn't expecting anyone so pretty.
You are too kind.
"So, where are we going?"
"Well, I guess I don't know what you would like, so..."
I haven't really picked yet.
"Well, how about you give me two choices you like, and then together we can decide what sounds best?"
Selena had no one to go to but me.
"She only came to me because she had to, for medical reasons."
She swore me to secrecy.
"Now, I'm violating that secrecy for a bigger purpose."
We're all prisoners of each other's gossip.
"Killed by each other's whispers, and it's time it stopped."
Our best young leave as soon as they learn the price of a bus ticket.
They contribute the best of their characters to other communities... because they're stifled in Peyton Place.
-We're not interested in Dr...
"-Matthew Swain has come forward... at considerable risk to himself, and I intend to hear him through... without any more interruptions."
I will rule on your objection when he's finished.
"You continue, Dr. Swain."
"We're a small town, but we're a prosperous one... and yet we allow tar-paper shacks to stand!"
"We have half a dozen churches, which most of you attend... and then don't practice the word they preach... once you walk down the steps."
"We have a fine school, but you take it for granted."
We have a town's paper with a most intelligent editorial page... which you use for wrapping garbage.
It's time you people woke up.
"Perhaps today you will, because there's something much bigger... than the tragedy of Selena Cross on trial here:"
our indifference... our failure as a community to watch over one another... to know who needs help and to give it!
"Selena's been living in a prison of her own, one we helped to build."
"I have nothing more to say, your Honor."
The objection of the prosecution is not sustained.
The jury may consider this statement as evidence.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"
"-We have, your Honor."
-The foreman will read the verdict.
We find the defendant not guilty.
Court is adjourned.
"Come on, Joey."
You come home with me.
"Selena, would you like to go now?"
"Good going, Doc!"
A letter for Mrs. Rogers.
"To make matters worse, news has arrived of some serious competition:"
"good news for the gentlemen, bad news for the ladies, and disastrous for the chaperones."
"""Dearest Mrs. Rogers, I hope you will forgive my boldness,"
"""but the presence of Miss Tanya Samuel"
"""is sure to be a welcome addition to your proceedings."
"""Her beauty, confidence and honesty"
"""make her invigorating company."
"She remains, however, unattached."""
I'm making no plans to be agreeable to this young lady.
"With your charge's interest paramount,"
I know I'm not going to like her.
I shall make sure I don't like her.
"My name's Tanya Samuel, and I am a modern-day girl who lives a modern-day life."
"I've got this theory that if you can't wear denim to a job, then it's not worth doing it."
"""Rules of behavior for ladies:"
"""You must conform to the wishes of your hostess."""
"That depends, doesn't it?"
That really depends.
"In the modern world,"
Miss Samuel runs a successful fashion business.
"She has a strong sense of her own worth, especially when it comes to men."
"I'm the type of woman that believes that a man, if they want to take you out, they should take you out."
"If I go out on a date with anybody and... on that first date I'm expected to pay half the bill, then I would never see that person ever again."
"""Her beauty, confidence and honesty make her invigorating company."""
She's been the toast of the capital...
What does she want to come here for then?
Miss Samuel's luggage is sent on ahead.
"A wealthy heiress and a beauty as well, she enters the house at the top of the pecking order, a prize catch for any of the gentlemen."
"The master of the house, Mr. Gorell Barnes, wants his new guest to be warmly received."
I think that we should all try and welcome her
"After all, with her fortune and looks, she could make him the perfect wife."
The stench was vile and it was still spreading.
"You think this uhh, neutrotope will provide the answer?"
My experiments show that radiation from our sun was deficient in certain specific wavelengths.
The neutrotope will provide the necessary frequencies to kill the fungus.
And you'll mount this on a satellite to be activated by your sun?
- That's right.
- Hmm.
We've calculated the orbital pattern required to maintain a balance and save our planet.
Impressive.
"Yes, this has cost us."
"Well, let's say it's bankrupted our economy and mortgaged our future."
Why so much?
The yield from the ore containing the element is minute.
This neutrotope and the few others that exist are the most valuable objects in our galaxy.
I can see why you were concerned that Dortmunn might have taken it.
"Yes, it's enough to tempt anyone."
There are men who would betray their companions for a lot less.
"What a very cynical thought, Doctor."
"But realistic, I'm afraid."
Cally and I have finished checking the damage.
I can give you a fairly accurate assessment of the situation now.
We can fit things together and we can make repairs.
And?
"There is, however, a problem."
"When we've finished, you should have a ship that will navigate and get you back to Destiny."
"The problem is that without this, you will have to travel at sub light speeds."
I estimate that the journey will take you approximately five months to complete.
- But that'll be too late!
We'll miss the planting season!
- Five months?
It'll set us back a full year!
When I heard the news I was as concerned as you.
Now there are many aspects of human physiology that are quite useful.
"Bipedal motion, opposable thumbs, large brain capacity."
But the human digestive system serves no purpose in the adult Wraith.
So why have one at all?
Because they eat normal food when they're young.
Exactly.
Then at some point they lose the ability to sustain themselves with that food.
So it's a teenage thing.
"Pimples, rebellion, life sucking."
Something like that.
The question is what causes it?
"If it's due to some chemical deficiency like a diabetics inability to process sugar, then it's possible it may be addressed with some kind of drug."
Zaddik could be telling the truth.
I'd like to go to the planet and check into it.
Is that really necessary?
I'm sure we could get a sample.
Bring it back here for you to analyse.
It's not just the drug I'm interested in.
This young Wraith could be very important for our research.
What research?
We're working on a retrovirus that would alter Wraith DNA.
Essentially stripping out the Eratus Bug elements of their genetic code and leaving only the human aspects behind.
- A drug that turns Wraith into humans?
- Effectively yes!
But so far we haven't had much success.
"Apparently, because we lack the living tissue and blood samples we need, to test it."
You think this girl would be willing to provide them?
"Look, I realise we can't bring her back to Atlantis, but..."
"I could take the retrovirus and equipment necessary for the analysis, with me to the planet."
A few days with a cooperative test subject could be worth months of theoretical research.
Elizabeth.
I don't have to tell you how important this could be for us.
- Kentucky wasn't murdered.
"The swarm chased her to her car, all the way from the colony."
That swarm followed her from you.
"You tried to kill Betty, except that wasn't Betty."
This is the queen bee cage you spat when you were covered in bees.
"We found it outside Betty's office, under a swarm."
"And if we tested it for spittle, I'm sure we'd find plenty of yours."
"Well, I have no idea what you're talking about."
The facts were these:
Woolsey Nicholls was madly in love with Kentucky Fitz.
"The operative word was ""madly."""
Betty Bee was a withered hag by the mere fact that she wasn 't Kentucky.
Shortly after Kentucky gratefully accepted Woolsey's offer  to become the new face of Betty's Bees  he discovered her gratitude was insincere  and her intention was sabotage.
Infected bees were found in Kentucky's possession.
She was smuggling mite-infested bees into his new colony.
"Betrayed and brokenhearted, but not sloppy  Woolsey dealt with Kentucky using a means  that would also imply accidental death."
Woolsey Nicholls confessed to the murder of Kentucky Fitz  and attempted murder of Betty Bee.
He never knew the colony collapse was a hoax  or that Betty had stolen back her bees.
Since Kentucky Fitz was like a sister to Betty Bee  Betty Bee was like a sister to Dusty Fitz  and made him her new partner.
Realizing that his colony had not collapsed  but had merely expanded into his-and-her suites  the Pie-Maker labored to make Chuck's suite feel like home.
- Are those my books?
- Yeah.
"And my furniture, and..."
My special pillow.
How...?
Welcome home.
And so the Pie-Maker had come to understand  home did not mean four walls and a door you never walk out of.
Home was a feeling of where you belong.
"For Emerson Cod, home was Lil' Gum Shoe."
The tale of a girl whose father couldn 't find her  so she had to find him.
"Mr. Cod insists it's a work of fiction  but if published, it could serve as a how-to manual for an audience of one."
"For Olive Snook, home was the place she hoped to find herself  and perhaps find new friends with not so many secrets."
Orreries were mechanical models used to demonstrate the rotating orbits of the planets.
The next planet we get is...
Can we have Venus over here...
"Venus, the goddess of love?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, look far with science, look more clearly with science."
A round of applause to all of our volunteers who were planets.
There we are.
"It was a very nice note saying she was definitely one of the reasons for coming back, because she's just a great laugh... but that I just didn't feel comfortable pursuing anything."
There's kind of not really that much chemistry between Mr. Carrington and I.
I think maybe it was just the kind of excitement and I know that he's certainly not giving me any indication that it's reciprocated on his side.
"You know, we've got this really bizarre situation where Everett likes me and I don't like him, and I like Mr. Carrington and he doesn't like me."
"I've always said, you know, I know, when I meet somebody, I know."
"But actually, I've been wrong, and it's... and it's kind of quite hard to admit that to yourself, that that kind of gut instinct isn't always right, and sometimes I've really missed."
"And maybe in my past life, you know, in my past I've missed opportunities that maybe I should have taken advantage of."
"It's not all about that chemistry, that spark, because that doesn't last forever."
"For Miss Hopkins' chaperone, Lady Devonport,"
She's preparing for her secret rendezvous with Mr. Foxsmith.
I've spent the last ten years of my life trying very hard not to get attached to people.
"And it has made me think, I actually can open up and be passionate and I think it's not going to kill me; it is all right, and I'm really grateful for that."
"And if anybody sees you, you can say you're going midnight riding."
I would say I do love him.
I think he's a really lovely person and I really do mind about him.
Lady Devonport.
Foxy.
So soon.
Glass of wine.
Thank you.
Would you join me?
Here's to scientific research.
Absolutely.
"Next time, take your battle stations."
"Oops, sorry."
"If you can't climb it you just get behind it and you have a clot of earth like a lump over there or a piece of wood, and throwing that at them often turns them and distracts them."
In their sort of terms of reference nothing has ever thrown anything at them so they get a bit disconnected when you actually throw something at them.
Wow...!
There is
Notice how they skim the top of the water because that's where it's cleanest and clearest.
The sediment sinks down and you have about half half an inch to an inch of clean water on top.
"So they suck just on the top, much like you see them doing now... you have to look carefully, the ears are cocked."
Claytor approaches a bull shoot some video of him but the large make has no interest in posing for the camera.
What did you just do there?
It's a bluff charge.
It's to get you to go.
Just call his bluff.
Stay put.
May 22nd.
I have just been charged by a wild elephant.
"Lloyd laughs lightly, like he's seen it a thousand times."
Neither one of us says much.
There's really not much to say after an elephant charge.
After a while a large group emerges from the bush.
Its an extraordinary thing to be so close to these magnificent creatures.
It's so easy to feel small in the face of such splendid power.
"Thanks to bush pilot grapevine,"
Claytor has secured a job in an international park in Zimbabwe.
The two pilots part company in the Botswana sky
"Claytor's headed for Hwange National Park in Western Zimbabwe,"
but first he'll make a slight detour to one of Africa's most spectacular natural wonders:
Victoria Falls.
I'm now flying low over the Zambezi River approaching Victoria Falls and as you look ahead at the trees you just see this mist this towering mist rising
our of the trees that are above the water.
And the Africans call it
"""Mosi-oa-Tunya."""
Which means the smoke that thunders.
"Well, my favourite part about it was that I made a video for it, a really horrible sort of slow-mo throwing stones into the sea video on camcorder with my friend John."
"And John at the time was making a movie called Once that won the Oscar for best song - a really amazing movie, and there was a mix-up on IMDB of..."
"Cos he'd only directed two videos - one was the one for the song that won the Oscar, and the other was the worst song of all time."
"And for a while, the YouTube comments under my song were just very respectful kind of,"
"""Really surprised that the Oscar went to this."""
I want to know why you haven't been to yoga for 18 months.
Oh!
How long have you done yoga for?
"Well, I took it up a few years ago."
"You're quite bendy, then, you're quite flexible?"
Give over.
No.
"Well, I'd like to say it's because I can't improve on this, but the reason why..."
Farts - was it too many farts?
That's exactly it.
No!
"I took it up because I wanted to be elegant, and then I realised you're with all these women and they are all really elegant and then somebody always goes..."
"""Phhhhrrrt!"" And you're not allowed to laugh."
Why - is that a rule?
It's a rule.
Who writes these rules?
That's a horrible rule!
"I see a woman fart, I'm gonna laugh."
I would use a lighter.
Of course you would.
"Right, and I never actually let rip in one of these classes, but after 10 or 11 woman had done it, I thought, well, it's got to be me next and I would actually probably just have to move countries."
"But there came a point 18 months ago where you thought,"
I'm not going to be able to go - my farts are getting more and more hard to contain.
Are they farts?
You've got to be strategic about what you eat before you go.
You can't just have a really big nut and bean salad at 12 o'clock and go out and do a few downwards dogs.
You can't bloody do that.
This is only temporary.
T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist.
She's questioned your orders lots of times... but you've never locked her up before.
"You have to admit, it's a little out of the ordinary."
These aren't ordinary circumstances.
T'Pol refused a direct order in front of the crew.
I can't have senior officers behaving like that.
Especially on a mission this important.
"Maybe you ought to confine me to quarters, too, sir."
Because I'm still not sure we're doing the right thing here.
If the roles were reversed...
I can't imagine these Xindi would do the same for us.
My great-grandfather was in North Africa during the Eugenics Wars.
His battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone... when they came under attack.
There was a school full of children directly between them and the enemy.
"If his men had returned fire, they might have hit it."
So he called the commander on the other side... and got him to agree to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school.
"There are rules, Trip, even in war."
We have to help these children.
This is what you wanted to show me?
A battle simulation?
Scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tactical capabilities... much more than we'd learn from a standard analysis.
"I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play more games."
"This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant."
The simulation found that they're vulnerable here.
They've got minimal shielding around their impulse manifolds.
A pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the engines.
Those manifolds are pretty narrow... but our targeting scanners should be able to get a lock.
-Nice work.
"-Thank you, sir."
I apologise.
I overreacted.
So somebody with connections to the Lordship of the Isles went all the way to Rome and brought back this as a souvenir with its image of St Peter carrying the keys of heaven.
"Alexander, Lord of the Isles, held the keys to more earthly kingdoms."
His Atlantic realm faced in two different directions at once.
To the south was Ireland where family and cultural ties were deep.
To the east was Scotland.
"But the Lordship wasn't on the fringes of the Scottish kingdom, it was at its very centre."
The Gaelic world of the Lordship was at the heart of how Scotland imagined itself.
"It was the Gaels who had first unified the kingdom, giving it its Gaelic name, Alba."
Now Gaelic Scotland was enjoying a second golden age.
"If Finlaggan was the heart of the Lordship, then Iona was its soul."
St Columba's island was one of the most important spiritual sites in Scotland.
It was here that the bodies of the Lords of the Isles were brought for burial.
Alexander showered the Abbey and its community with money and gifts.
"Of course, he had good reason."
"Like the best of medieval godfathers, he had a string of mistresses and a pile of cautionary letters from the Pope to prove it."
All this church-building was a kind of spiritual insurance policy.
"But if Alexander MacDonald feared for his soul, that was pretty much all he feared."
"He was Ri Innse Gall, a king in his own land, in a land where there was no king."
Scotland was a kingdom with an empty throne.
Its Royal line had faltered.
Its young king was in the hands of its ancient enemy.
"James Stewart, King of Scots, had been captured by the English when he was only 12 years old."
His family had fought alongside Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Independence.
"When Bruce's bloodline died out, it was the Stewarts who succeeded to the Scottish throne."
"But the sole heir to the new Stewart dynasty was now a hostage - a bargaining chip, leverage."
"It was the same old game, for the same old stakes."
"If the Scottish magnates wanted their king back, they would have to submit to English overlordship."
"""Forget the Bruce."
"""Give up your independence."""
But the Scots weren't going to play by the English rules.
"""No, thanks,"" they said."
"""We're managing fine without a king."""
I'II put it in the record.
"In the hopes of clearing my family name to give my children their share of the American way of Iife without a blemish on their name and background,"
I have appeared before this committee and given it all my cooperation.
I consider it a great personal dishonor to have to deny that I am a criminal.
I wish to have the following noted for the record...
That I served my country faithfully in world War Two and was awarded the Navy Cross for actions in defense of my country.
That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime.
That no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or any other name has ever been made public.
"I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, although it's my right to do so."
"I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have besmirched it."
I'm sure we're impressed.
particularly with your love for our country.
We'II be in recess until 10:00 a.m. Monday when we will produce a witness who'II corroborate the charges against you.
At which time you may very well be subject to indictment for perjury.
I remind you that you're still under subpoena.
Adjourned!
"Ten-to-one shot, you said."
"A ten-to-one shot he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!"
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.
"-Well, just get a good night's sleep."
-Yeah.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
"I've got you a new suit, new shirt, new tie."
I'll shave you myself in the morning.
You'll look respectable for 50 million of your fellow Americans.
Tomorrow...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Come on!
I saw this 19 times.
"You've got a great home here, for the rest of your life."
"Nobody gets near you, you're not going anywhere."
"""We, Anne, you and I, are going to show them the way."
"""All my love, Lou."""
Do you think this building was very important for Lou?
"Well, he says so himself, you know, that the world discovered him when he built the Richards building, but he had discovered himself when he built that little concrete-block bathhouse in Trenton."
"So that... that says it, I think, right there how significant he felt it was."
Do you think about him a lot now?
"Well, he's kind of there, you know?"
Don't need to think about him.
- Part of you?
"- Well, he's there."
"He's there in you, he's in Alex, you know..."
He's in his buildings.
And...
"And I think the ideas that you work on together connect you always somehow, you know?"
Lou split up with Anne when Alex was about three and then got involved with my mother a few years later in 1959.
"In spite of everything,"
"Anne has always felt that we're all connected and that we are, in some strange way, a family."
I wonder if Lou thought of it that way.
Or was each relationship an entirely new beginning?
"The question is often asked, ""Why isn't Lou Kahn"
"""working directly in the work which the government is doing in the actual rebuilding of Philadelphia at this moment?"""
"I see it still as being the most useful plan, yes, and the most expressive."
It's the most expressive and the most useful.
"Uh, yes."
Expressive.
"I repeatedly made the effort to involve Lou directly in our work in Philadelphia, but it's turned out that the special quality of his genius could not be brought together with the reality of the problem."
I'd always heard that Ed Bacon was Lou's nemesis in Philadelphia.
"Bacon was in charge of rebuilding the entire downtown area in the '50s and '60s, and he hired Lou to come up with plans for how the job should be done."
But something had gone very wrong.
"We started work, and I wanted to communicate to the stupid public in the most acerbic fashion I possibly could the essence of the idea."
"And Lou would say,"
"""Wouldn't it be nice to put a curving stairway here?"
The issue of sugar crops up again.
"During the Regency, the campaign to abolish slavery gave rise to a new form of political pressure."
The public was urged to boycott plantation products until slaves were free.
There's an address to the people about... suggestion of boycotting sugar and tobacco.
"""The family that uses five pounds of sugar per week"
"""will be abstaining from the consumption 21 months"
"""to prevent the slavery or murder of one fellow creature."""
Perhaps we'll do it for 24 hours... sugar.
24 hours?
Make it a...
"Okay, well, I'm willing to make that token."
"I think we'd all very well do without four puddings a day, except Mrs. Rogers, who likes them."
We'll all abstain from sugar for 24 hours.
I was going to say that.
"I think that if we are supposed to be a fashionable house, well, I don't think it's actually going to kill anybody to... to..."
to make a gesture.
"It doesn't bother me, because I like neither sugar nor tobacco."
People have to decide for themselves.
That's what I'd like done in this house.
I would like people to abstain from sugar and tobacco.
"I think it should be to people's discretion and most people will do it, given a choice."
I'm going to say that there will be no sugar.
Was there anyone who didn't want to do it?
It wasn't an issue of they didn't want to do it.
It was more they thought they should have a personal choice.
"So Miss Hammond, I think, had a problem with the fact that somebody made a decision for her."
"But then, you're in a household, so you would be kicked out if you didn't do it."
"As much as it is a really good debate, there was something far more important."
"Let me read on, okay."
"""News has reached the capital"
"""that Mr. Austin Howard"
"""is said to be back in England after a stint in Europe."""
"NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, is transformative in the sense that we really pioneered negative campaign advertising in massive doses to win elections."
"Up to that time, it really hadn't been done."
"I came to Washington for the Wall Street Journal in, um, the very end of 1983."
"And Roger was already kind of a legend by then, kind of a dark legend, because of the negative ads that he and NCPAC had run."
So people thought of him as kind of a wizard behind the scenes.
"I remember meeting him on the street and thinking,"
"""Wow, that's Roger Stone."""
Birch Bayh telling us he's fighting inflation.
The price tag on that baloney is $46 billion.
"Because if Bayh wins, you lose."
"The story of NCPAC is that after Watergate, there were campaign finance reforms to try to control the corruption in spending on politics."
"So what the Republicans did was, they figured out a way around the new rules."
"The focus of NCPAC was to use all the tools of a campaign, but instead of having a candidate, to use it through a PAC."
"We could only give a Senate campaign, in a direct financial transfer of $5,000."
"But the loophole was we could advertise on behalf of a candidate, without their cooperation or coordination, an unlimited amount."
And that's why NCPAC was successful.
"Despite the setback,"
The team will tangle With sledge once again.
"But this time, they'll head North to untapped."
And unclaimed grounds.
This would be A cool spot.
I'm gonna mark This spot right here.
It might be a place To go do a dive.
So far what I've seen from my Bottom imager is some areas.
Where it looks like there Could be some of that gravel.
That I've been looking For the whole time
I've been out here.
I want to go down and see.
If it's actually What I think it is.
That looks like Exposed bedrock there.
But the deeper waters Present greater risks.
Everything's more difficult.
I'm right here.
You don't have to yell.
"I'm reading, fuckface."
- It's for the fucking camera.
- I'm trying to fucking...
"I'm letting everyone else hear it, okay?"
"It's not just for you, mister entitled."
The assumption that wives should...
Why do you think the men's rights movement is at odds with feminism?
"What has created that clash, that war between each other?"
"Well, one, feminism has spent the last 50 years demonizing men, which 1s sort of one of the problems."
"Feminist scholars have characterized men as inherently violent, inherently bad, inherently predatory, inherently oppressive."
They have postulated that masculinity is a disease.
Feminists aren't the only problem.
The problems didn't start with feminism.
"So when I start criticizing feminism, 1 want you to know you're just part of the problem."
They're just part of the problem.
"You calling men oppressors and women oppressed demonizes men, and I believe diminishes women at the same time."
It's a way of telling men to shut up.
It's a way of telling men that their experiences don't matter.
"You tell a man he's prmleged, therefore, anything he's gone through or anything he has to say doesn't matter."
His lived experiences don't matter because he's prmleged.
So how old were you when you started calling yourself a feminist?
Or how many years ago?
"It was probably, about three years agc, I guess you can say."
"I'm relatively new, yeah."
"But I'm pretty loud, so..."
"Silence only helps the oppressor, not the oppressed."
A lot of mras say that feminism doesn't fight for the rights of men.
What would you say to that?
"Cry me a river, really, because feminism is a movement about the discrepancies when it comes to women's equality."
Because we're not up.
Who... who... who told you that?
"Uh, yes, he did try and kiss me."
Stop it.
"But, you know, he's a very tactile person, anyway."
So this whole hands-off stuff doesn't seem to work with Captain Glover.
"No, he's, um, yes, twice, actually."
"At one point Mrs. Hammond did turn round and went, ""Are you kissing Captain Glover?"""
"And I was like, ""No, he's trying to kiss me."""
"Captain Glover has paid special attention to Miss Braund, a lady of modest means."
"With his prize money, of which she is unaware, he would be an excellent catch for her, but Miss Braund's affections have lain elsewhere."
"I really used to like Mr. Everett and I know that he really liked Victoria, and there was a whole kind of triangle thing going on and Victoria was trying to get me and Mr. Everett together."
I really had a crush on him.
"I thought, ""My God, this guy is amazing."""
"Now I just think, no, he's a really nice bloke."
But there's nothing more.
"Although it's really quite funny because, uh, me and Captain Glover had an argument just after the Mr. Everett thing."
"He did actually turn around to me and went, ""Why can't you just get over Everett?"
"Why can't you just get over him, and fancy me?"""
"I went, ""That would make it so much simpler, Captain Glover."
"The life would be much simpler if I could just fancy you."""
"We parted, and we weren't speaking very much the next day, and I think he winked across the table at me, and I thought, ""Okay, we're back to being friends again."""
"I think he's absolutely lovely and we're really, really good friends."
"So part of me just thinks, oh, why don't you fancy him?"
He's so nice to me.
"Come on, Geoff."
So is Miss Braund reconsidering her feelings for the tenacious Glover?
"The day after the fair, as the ladies are eating luncheon, the atmosphere is tense."
"For some weeks, there has been growing hostility between the hostess, Mrs. Rogers, and chaperone Mrs. Enright."
"Mrs. Enright, with her charge, Miss Conick, form the lowest ranking pair in the house."
She is the least important lady here.
"Her charge is the least important one, and she would be bending over backwards not to cause offense to me because she wants to stay here."
Because she just pisses me off.
"I just gave everyone here a little overview on what your research involves, and that you have some pretty interesting documents."
"During their meeting, Halpern shared with the team her discovery of three ancient documents, which she believes prove a connection between the Knights Templar and activities on Oak Island going back as far as the 12th century."
We have a map that shows Nova Scotia.
We have a map of Oak Island.
And then we have the cipher.
"One of the maps, dated 1347, showed various sites and landmarks on Oak Island that match several of the places well known to Rick,"
Marty and the team.
The hand-drawn map is clearly Oak Island.
"And then there are several things, named in French, which have been translated for us."
One is called the basin.
"Well, that clearly correlates to the swamp."
And then there's something on the map which points right about to where the Money Pit is.
And then we have two or three things that we don't know anything about.
"One's called ""The Anchors,"" one's called ""The Valve,"""
"and one's called ""The Hatch."""
When Oak Island treasure hunter Jack Begley later laid a copy of Zena Halpern's map over a satellite image of the island...
Look at the top of that.
It follows it perfectly.
"The so-called ""hatch"""
matched the location of what Dave Blankenship remembered as the site of a strange depression near his property.
This hatch lands kind of where David said...
- The hole is.
- Yeah.
What would cause it to sink in like this?
Something below.
Something gave way below.
"If this is a hatch, it would be a way in, a vertical shaft to enter something."
"That's very, very odd."
It's hard to explain what that is.
"It's clearly, I think, a hole that's been chiseled into the bedrock by humans."
"I don't see any other explanation for it, geologically."
"All right, Jack, if you don't mind, shovel off that gunk down there, and let's see what's underneath there."
"Please,"
I don't want you to.
Please.
It's very emotional when she says
"""There's something I --"""
"Oh, God, I can't even say it."
"""There's something I've always wanted to say to you."""
And he assumes it's goodbye and it's the opposite.
They've spent so many years together.
She never just got to say hello.
"But, you know, they're still going to be together throughout time."
"I was worried, when I heard about what the episode was going to be, that it would get it wrong and that would annoy me because that's not the way I would envision such a thing."
"And it's not what I would envision, it's better."
It was like a buddy-cop movie across the Universe.
You're just a long streak of nothing.
Amy Pond is a groupie.
But you're human!
"The Doctor has very firm views on who can go onboard the TARDIS and it's pretty clear, what they have to be."
"They have to be -- obviously, brave and they have to be clever -- he's bored by stupid people and a coward would last two minutes in there."
I hated Donna Noble when I first met her.
"This obnoxious redheaded woman, and Donna turned out to be one of the best companions, if not the best companion of the reboot."
"She won't take any of his usual schtick and she can give as good as he can get, so the relationship's more fun to watch."
"It was like a buddy-cop movie like where they're going across, you know, the Universe."
It was different from the other companions.
And you get this scene where they're both kind of stuck.
"She's great at vaudeville and that's what this moment is, it's classic comedy."
They both have such strong comedy backgrounds.
I think the chemistry between those two was probably my favorite.
Are we interrupting you?
"I love the way that, you know, Donna would always go like that and shake her fist."
"She was more challenging, I think, for the Doctor and that was a great opportunity to write some very sparkling and very, very funny stuff."
"The scene where they have the confusion about, you know, ""I want to mate""/ ""I want a mate"" is fantastic."
Why not?
I would have had it--
I should have had it in the beginning if it hadn't been for a lot of skullduggery.
"In my hands, Mr. Mason, there is no limit to what can be done with the Norstaad line."
"I'd expand his old shop, use the real estate that it's on."
I've waited and worked all my life for an opportunity like this.
"All right, Mr. Hadley."
"You can keep in touch, if you like."
That's all I wanted to say.
I intend to keep in touch.
"Well, it boils down to this, Perry."
Somers was such a slick manipulator that few in the trade knew that he was close to being bankrupt.
"Apparently, he grabbed at the Norstaad trademark as a last, best hope of survival."
"If he was so hard-pressed, what about the $50,000 down payment?"
"Well, on the strength of getting the Norstaad line,"
"Somers signed some long-term contracts with various supply houses, in return for which they loaned him sizeable sums of money."
"Still this wasn't enough to boost the total up to 50 grand in time, but this didn't faze Martin Somers at all."
"He simply stalled by writing a personal check for 50 grand which he knew would bounce, until, of course, yesterday when he apparently had the balance."
"What about the rest of the cash-- the $200,000 he was supposed to pay in four months?"
"By then, he would have had time to hit the national market with cheap imitations of the Norstaad line."
"And, by factoring his invoices and using the valuable trademark as bank collateral, chances are he could have swung that, too."
"And then would have gone on exploiting the trademark for another six months or so, after which it would have been quite worthless."
Right.
But what a killing he would have made in the meantime.
What did you find out about Latham Reed?
"That, I'm afraid, is going to lift your client right off his launching pad."
Reed is Edie Morrow's ex-husband.
[phone rings]
"Yes, Gertie?"
Put her on.
"Hello, Lisa."
Axel what?
Come in.
The first shuttlepod's on its way.
How long will it take to transfer the antimatter?
Using both shuttlepods...
about four or five hours.
I didn't realize how badly I needed a shower.
I've been spending too much time in that hatchery.
"If you're looking for a new First Officer, you should consider Malcolm."
You're going to want someone on the bridge full-time.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
I'm happy with the command structure the way it is.
This is only temporary.
T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist.
"She's question your orders lots of times, but you've nev locked her up before."
You have to admit... it's a little out of the ordinary.
These aren't ordinary circumstances.
T'Pol refused a direct order in front of the crew.
"I can't have senior officers behaving like that, especially not on a mission this important."
"Maybe you ought to confine me to quarters, too, sir, because I'm still not sure we're doing the right thing here."
"If the roles were reversed,"
I can't imagine these Xindi would do the same for us.
My great-grandfather was in North Africa during the Eugenics Wars.
His battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when they came under attack.
There was a school full of children directly between them and the enemy.
"If his men had returned fire, they might have hit it."
"So he called the commander on the other side, got him to agree to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school."
"There are rules, Trip, even in war."
We have to help these children.
"This is what you wanted to show me, A battle simulation?"
Scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tactical capabilities.
Much more than we'd learn from a standard analysis.
"I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play more games."
"Like the 5th Symphony, it presents itself with a feeling that you know it if you've heard it once."
And you look for it.
"Though you know it, you must hear it again."
"Though you know it, you must see it again."
"Truly, a work of art is one that tells us that nature cannot make what man can make."
Don't put him up on some gigantic pedestal up there.
He was in the trenches.
"The stories would come out of his office... it would be guys would have their wives in final moments of labor, and he wouldn't let them go home or take them to the hospital 'cause they were working on a project, you know?"
And he didn't know day from night.
"You know, and he had no kind of..."
"I mean, I think that most architects who are intensely involved in their practice have this problem, but I think he had a really big problem."
And I think he was very unhappy about not being selected
- for the John F. Kennedy library.
- Sure.
"I mean, you can just see Jackie going into I. M. Pei's office on Madison Avenue, or wherever it was in New York, and there would be flowers lining the corridor."
"And, you know, you'd go to Lou's office, and there'd be an old pastrami sandwich sitting on somebody's desk."
"I mean, don't think that he was always trying to be a prince."
He was very much trying to be a player.
He wanted work.
He wanted recognition.
He wanted...
Doesn't every architect want?
"I can't speak for every architect, no."
I don't know.
I think most architects who are... he was success oriented.
"At the time of his death,"
Lou was $1/2 million in debt.
Here he is chatting with some prospective clients as if he has all the time in the world.
"And in the meantime, he must know he's going bankrupt."
"The office lost money on every project, except the Salk Institute."
"And the list of jobs that fell through, and didn't get built, kept getting longer and longer:"
"the Dominican Sisters Convent, the U.S. Consulate in Luanda, Angola, the City Tower project, the Pocono Arts Center with seating for 9,000, the Fleischer House, the Morris House, the house for cheerful living,"
"Now, listen to me very carefully."
In about 40 minutes you'll have the files to upload.
"Text me when it's done, but do not, I repeat, do not do anything until you hear from me."
"If you don't hear from me by this time tomorrow, launch."
Is that clear?
Yeah.
"-I'll keep this brief, Jaelen."
"Knowing the impossibility of rescuing your companion,"
I can only imagine that you came here in the hopes to see her.
To be with her.
This was a misjudgment.
We will not grant this union.
"As for yourself, like your five companions before you, you will be dissected and studied by our scientists, in hopes that we might better understand your telepathic abilities."
You may be aware that one of our duties here is to see to the...
appetites of our hosts.
"Your companion will be euthanized, and parts of her extracted, for the delicacies."
"As for the son you've fathered, he'll be taken to Capella, where in manhood he will serve as a Draconian agent."
He and ten will father hybrids who will also serve in this capacity.
"So you see, you will be serving a significant contribution to the Draconian cause."
And for this we are grateful.
-The Dulce Base is located beneath the Archuleta Mesa
It's size is 4.6 miles in diameter.
The base has seven levels.
The last two of which are designated for lab experimentation.
These tests are carried out by humans and Draconians.
It's the sixth level where Alyssa is being held.
One of the secret entrances is on the Mesa itself.
The location was delivered to us by one of our allies contained on the disk drive I gave you.
-Can't you just get her to walk in the back door?
-Unless they find me first.
-What makes you think they won't kill you?
-It's a chance I'm willing to take.
I have been reliably informed they've been delayed by rain.
It would be two days before the Union Pacific finally arrived at Promontory.
On May 10th 1869 the two rival companies were face to face.
"A single length of track apart, at the end of the line."
"And in a symbolic gesture of unity that last length of track was laid by a team, from each railroad."
Done.
I can't believe we did it.
"I know we did it, hell I was there for the best part of it."
But damn I don't know how we did it.
I know we would have never done it if it hadn't been for these men.
And I don't forget that I was opposed to the notion of employing them in the first place.
"This railroad, this nation owes these men a great debt, and I sure as hell hope we don't forget it, because I know I won't."
Where we're standing now I feel in a sense it was nothing here but the path of wild deer.
"And now a thousand wheels roll, on their axles will be carried the wealth of half the world."
I think by this day's work we've changed the commerce and finance of the whole world.
We have finished the job that Christopher Columbus started.
What had started as a shovel of earth in a small town in California had become the world's first transcontinental railroad.
"It had taken six years, claimed the lives of over two thousand men, and changed the course of American history."
But a single line of track now stretched across America from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Two thousand miles of wilderness have been opened to settlement.
A journey which had taken six months by wagon train and cost the lives of tens of thousands of immigrants could now be completed in just seven days.
Lincoln was dead but his dream was a reality.
It was now truly the United States of America.

"Raising out of the dust, the legendary knight King himself helped our tired troops to victory."
"I took a sacred oath then, as a loyal knight, to dedicate my whole life to my country and king, to purity, to honesty,"
"to knightly valor and to fraternal love, and to even sacrifice my life for it, if I must."
"Fine words, light colored petals."
I believed in those words.
But the coming years did not bring serious challenge.
"I expected heavy burdens, not knowing that eventually I would stumble on a tiny lump of earth."
Candidates fought in tournament for a girl's hand.
"A girl, red rosebud from God's flower garden."
I did not contend.
"I did not think of marriage, at that time I valued other things more."
"Retreated from the noise of the juvenile play,"
"I spotted one of my fellow combattants, whom the sky did not bless with great physical strength."
The poor guy was clumsy too.
His eyes were lingering helplessly on the winner's award.
"I got pity on his suffering, so I proposed light-heartedly:"
"let's switch clothes, and I'll get the girl for him."
It would have been better if I was struck dead by the lances!
Death would have saved me from my fate's further misery.
At the end of the tournament
I saw the girl.
My world was suddenly upside down.
I was all confused.
What had been sacred to me:
"my faith, my life, my honor,"
"I would have thrown away everything, everything, for one smile of her clear blue eyes!"
"I knew, I felt, that she was the only one, that she had to be mine."
"That she also knows, she must know, that I had fought for her with honor."
"With honor... a man, who is a knight, can not fight in vile disguise."
My poor red flower!
"Neither the real owner of the armor, nor its usurper was worthy for laurels."

"And suddenly, I realized that the purity of my communication was being encrusted by Lou's fantasies."
So Lou didn't get it?
Lou didn't understand what you wanted?
He didn't understand it.
He did not understand it.
And so he was angry as could be angry.
"And he got nice ladies to give tease, where they would complain about me not using Lou Kahn for this purpose."
"By the way, there's not a single shred of any way in which"
Lou influenced downtown Philadelphia.
"Nothing, I know."
Isn't that a tragedy?
"Well, I tell you one thing."
It's... thank... would have been an incredible tragedy if they had built one single thing that Lou proposed for downtown Philadelphia.
"They were all brutal, totally insensitive, totally impractical."
The whole idea of doing circular garages up on Vine Street...
"Yeah, but the idea of leaving the cars outside the city and then letting people walk into the city..."
"- it was a great idea, don't you think?"
- No!
It absolutely wasn't.
It wouldn't have worked for a damn.
"So ultimately, isn't it just two strong men... two strong egos that don't get together?"
"God damn it, no."
"It's an absolutely pure ignorance on Lou's part, and it's the same damn ignorance as the American Institute of Architects is based on now, that you have no responsibility to preparing the way for a system on the larger order,"
and you only do the little things that come along.
So you simply have not understood a word I've said.
Watch where you're going!
"Some of Lou's ideas were utopian and impractical, but this was the '60s."
"And like a lot of people then, he was questioning the way we live."
Do we really want the skyline of every American city to look more or less the same?
Why can't people leave their cars outside the city and walk instead?
To express is to drive.
I always think they look like bits of other animals.
"They've got a monkey's tail, that prehensile tail that wraps around the..."
Grasps the end of the blade.
"Then they've got a horses head, obviously, and chameleon eyes, cos the eyes can..."
Swivel.
In different directions.
Then the most amazing thing is they've got like a kangaroo pouch.
The males have got what's called a brood pouch and they are the ones that get pregnant.
It's very unusual - the male gives birth to the young and...
To live young?
"Yeah, it's an extremely unusual way of reproducing."
So are seahorses in danger?
"Yeah, of course, there's all sorts of threats."
The main threat is traditional medicine in China.
"They get dried and ground up and used as everything for medicine, from asthma to an aphrodisiac."
Thank you.
These little spratty things.
"'In the markets of the archipelago, 'it's hard to persuade artisanal fishermen to limit what they catch."

"That's right, the fin is what goes to make shark fin soup."
A very young one.
"That's the trouble these days - most of the sharks being brought up are small, which is a sign that the big ones are already gone."
Yeah.
"A sleepy time of the afternoon, isn't it?"
"'The trade in shark fins, seahorses and other unappetising sea creatures 'is thriving, in spite of the evidence that they're fast disappearing.'"
"Goodness me.What an extraordinary collection of stuff.Oh, are those..."
"Those are sea cucumbers, which they use in a soup."
"Literally, millions of sea cucumbers are collected from the wild around the world."
"They look like sort of ossified turds, to be honest."
- Why?
Humour me.
No one wears white cotton gloves anymore.
They went outta fashion.
"These women today, who leave home and go to work, ruined everything."
"Katherine Goodrich, Jennifer Lundy, Marilyn Callisto they think that they're doing good by leaving the home and helping others, but they would do a lot more good if they would just stay home."
My mother wore white gloves every Sunday to church.
"She'd get in her blue Chevrolet Impala, put her lipstick on in the rear view mirror then she'd pull her white gloves on, one finger at a time."
"Then she'd just snap her purse closed and glance at her wrist watch, which was small, very delicate."
"Then she'd smile at me and she'd say ""We can't keep God waiting, can we?"""
And we'd drive to church.
I love white gloves.
I guess because they remind me of a time when people would smile at each other on the sidewalks and help each other carry the groceries into the house.
"We would go to Mendelsons drug store and sit at the counter, have a cool milkshake and we would sit on a porch and listen to the night, filled with tree crickets and spring peepers."
"And then, the way that a young girl would wake up one day, sharing the honour that the blessed Virgin Mother had received."
"Our naked bodies were mysteries, they were holy."
My mother taught me that.
She stayed home to raise me.
She would wash my face...
"and my body, clean."
"And when she died, just short of two years ago I insisted that they put cotton gloves on her hands in the coffin."
Why are you laughing?
Stop it.
Stop it.
"Oh, lady you've been very clever, getting all the attention to focus on you."
I don't believe you have MPD but I don't care if you really do or don't.
I don't care how many personalities you may or may not have.
"Because of you, there are eight personalities who will never speak again."
You had no right to kill them especially in God's name!
"And I gotta believe, even if you walk out of here scot free,"
God is gonna make you pay one way or another.
OK.
"If it is a crime to try and end these atrocities, if we are traitors for trying to defeat the enemy, by god we will be traitors!"
We will march to battle without hesitation and we will accept our punishment with pride when we return triumphant!
Admiral...!
Escort him in.
"Yes, sir!"
Hail the Admiral!
Hail the Admiral!
"You will be under our care from now on, sir."
How dare you?
Do you know the crime you're committing?
I'm sure the messenger boat has reached Shimazu and Wakizaka in Sachun by now.
They will attempt a joint attack within days.
We'll just have to intercept them on their return.
That's all.
Konishi has no other way of confirming or not he has aid.
That's right.
"Send me out there one more time, sir."
"No, that won't be necessary."
"If the Messenger boat returns safety, they will think that I have indeed lost my right of command."
And it will be easier for us to lure them out.
"Lure them, sir?"
We will lure the entire Japanese fleet of 400 ships out to the water.
"Admiral, that's enough ships to completely encircle this island."
We don't stand a chance against them in a frontal assault.
"If we're not careful, what happened in Chilchundo could happen again."
The time and location of the fight will be the deciding factor.
"Commandant Kim, if you were the enemy leader, when would you attack?"
"There're 80 ships in Wekyo and over 300 in Sachun, so Sachun would definitely lead the battle."
They will choose a day that provides favorable conditions for
Sachun to attack and favorable conditions that accommodates their escape back to Japan should the joint attack be a success.
Favorable conditions for the joint attack and escape...
When would that be?
It has had its romantic moments.
"I mean, inevitably, if you're sort of thrown together in a... in a sort of cold, wet, windy day, if you have to sort of huddle together to stay warm, from a practical point of view, yeah, it's been..."
"Thanks, Hermit."
"Bit of romance, yeah."
There would be no going back for a Regency lady's companion who chose love over security.
"As a hermit's wife, she could expect a life of harsh practicality."
What's all the juice in there?
Did I say juice it as well as zest it?
"It's like the first time she came up here and she was... she repaired my sugar bag, which had a simple burn in it, and she was there sewing away for about three hours, and she finished it eventually."
"With a huge grin, she passes, says, ""I've finished,"""
"And I was like, ""Ah, that's very good."""
"Tried to open it, and she'd sewn it right through both sides of the bag."
Didn't even check before she handed it over
So she had to cut it all out and start again.
"But now you're good at sewing, aren't you?"
Bit of a learning curve up here.
"As the guests set out for a final picnic, the issue of marriage is never far from mind."
"One step above Miss Francesca in status,"
Miss Conick's future security would also depend on finding a good husband.
I've seen all kinds of practice.
"For her, that's a problem."
I just don't think I could bear to be a married woman to a man who was legally allowed to beat me and rape and whom I couldn't divorce um... and then obliged to have children when one in three women died in childbirth.
Score.
Being a mistress might have been all right.
You had more control of your money;
"you had more control over what you did, who you spent your time with."
A career as a mistress was a high-risk business.
Success could bring independence and wealth.
But disease and destitution lay in wait for those who failed.
"A letter for you, ma'am."
"""Dear Mrs. Enright, with regard to my daughter Hayley,"
"""I'm writing to ask whether or not"
'Vengeance is mine' sayeth the Lord 'and I will repay'.
When for example he has the opportunity to kill Claudius in the prayer scene...
'Now might I do it'.
He could do it then... but he doesn't do it then because it hasn't all come together... he is not all anxious to do it then.
"The complete man would knock me behind it... he would just be doing it in a colder, calculated way."
"Now might I do it pat, now he is praying."
And now I'll do't.
And so he goes to heaven.
And so am I revenged.
That would be scanned:
"A villain kills my father, and for that I, his sole son... do this same villain send to heaven."
"O, this is hire and salary, not revenge."
No.
"Up, sword... and know thou a more horrid hent:"
"When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage... or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed, at gaming, swearing... or about some act that has no relish of salvation in't... then trip him... that his heels may kick at heaven... and that his soul may be as damn'd and black as hell, whereto it goes."
My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
"The dark unspoken undercurrents in the relationship... between Gertrude and Hamlet, occupy the very heart of this great work."
To an extent Shakespeare might have been thought... to have prefigured the work of Sigmund Freud.
"Freud, in later years, sought to unravel the part played by sexual feelings... in the complex relationship between any mother and son."
Psycho-analytical critics have argued that such oedipal jealousy... might be at the root of Hamlet's disturbing description... of his mothers marriage.
But is that really the case?
"Now, mother, what's the matter?"
"Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended."
"Mother, you have my father much offended."
"Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue."
"Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue."
"- Why, how now, Hamlet?"
- What's the matter now?
- Have you forgot me?
"- No, by the rood, not so."
"You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife..."
The Nagle family has been told this process could take up to a year.
"When she told me that he wasn't going to be executed, first I was like..."
"And then I was like, ""So now we have to think about it longer."""
I'm glad that he's not being executed so soon.
They're still giving him a chance.
But I don't know how they're going to try to make him innocent.
"I mean, it was pretty straightforward evidence in the first place."
I always knew that the right guy was in jail.
I always knew it was the right person.
And now they tell me that it might not be the right person.
"And my question is, ""Why are you telling me this now?"""
Robert Pruett has to live with his conscience.
"When he sleeps at night, I hope he has nightmares."
I'm sure he does.
He's still rotting.
I mean...
Is there anything I can do?
No.
Can I just keep on living my life?
Yes.
"I think that doing the work requires a certain emotional resilience that is common to death penalty lawyers, at least common to death penalty lawyers in Texas."
"For every reprieve that you get, you have nine clients who are executed, or something like that."
"And so, if you're going to stay in this line of work, as a matter of survival, you really narrow your emotional range."
"You know, you don't go out celebrating when you get a stay, because the flip side of going out celebrating when you get a stay is that you jump off a building every time you don't."
"If every time you lose a client, you can't get out of bed for a week or a month, you just really need to find something else to do."
Hi.
Is this Jennifer Garza?
My name's Kelly Hickman.
Kelly's last crisis case is defending gang member Robert Garza.
'Four women have been shot dead tonight 'in what police are calling a gang-related killing.'
'Garza was a member of the Tri-City Bomber street gang.'
'Tri-City Bombers are one of the most violent gangs.'
Cassius acts but whether he acts for good motives is more disputable.
Cassius is more obviously a self-seeking figure.
He is more obviously ambitious to be in with the main party.
So I feel that Cassius acts more out of... the desire for self aggrandizement than Brutus does for example.
I do fear the people chose Caesar for their king.
"Ay, do you fear it?"
Then must I think you would not have it so.
I would not; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me?
What is it that you would impart to me?
"If it be aught toward the general good... set honour in one eye, and death i'th'other... and I will look on both indifferently."
For the love of gods so speed me... as I do love the name of honour more than I fear death.
"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus... as well as I do know your outward favour."
"I was born free as Caesar, so were you:"
We both have fed as well... and we can both endure the Winter's cold as well as he.
"Once, upon a raw and gusty day... the troubled Tiber chafing with her shores..."
Said Caesar to me...
"'Dar'st thou, Cassius... now leap in with me into this angry flood... and swim to yonder point?"
'
"Upon the word, accoutred as I was..."
I plunged in and bade him follow.
So indeed he did.
"The torrent roared, and we did buffet it with lusty sinews... throwing it aside spinning with hearts of controversy."
But ere we could arrive the point proposed...
"Caesar cried, 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"
'
"I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor... did from the Flames of Troy, upon his shoulder... the old Anchyses beare, so, from the waves of Tyber..."
Did I the tired Caesar.
And this man... is now become a god...
"And Cassius... is a wretched creature, and must bend his body... if Caesar carelessly but nod on him."
The play focuses upon thejudicial magistrate Marcus Brutus... and it is through him that Shakespeare explores thejourney of a man... who becomes the victim of his own idealism.
Does that idealism make him a noble or simply one open to self delusion?
He would be made to pay.
He must be made to pay.
"The English opened with their knights, as was traditional."
"A massed cavalry charge, and one of the knights, Henry de Bohun, found himself charging an isolated figure, off to the side of his soldiers."
"An isolated figure, wearing a crown."
He lowered his lance and galloped forward.
This was his chance at immortality.
But the Bruce dodged it.
"He rose up in his stirrups, and with a single blow of his battleaxe, split De Bohun's skull from crown to chin."
"With that one stroke, the Bruce became legend."
The schiltroms held.
They pushed forward.
"The English cavalry were sent in again, but the Earl of Moray's schiltrom forced them back, and that was the story of Bannockburn."
"For two days, the Scottish schiltroms held and then pressed forward, hemmed the English in for slaughter."
"And on the second day, the English had had enough."
"So they did what had now become the traditional thing when faced with a Scottish army, its feet and spears firmly planted on the ground..."
They ran away.
"The Scots got down to the profitable business of taking prisoners, and Edward took to flight."
"Robert had too few mounted men to send a sizeable number in pursuit, so Edward escaped."
"Check, but not checkmate."
The haul was impressive.
Robert was able to trade his prisoners.
"He recovered Bishop Wishart, 74 years old and blind, his daughter, his sister, and best of all, Elizabeth, his queen."
"Eight years of captivity had left their mark, and Robert will have known that what she'd suffered was his fault."
All for his costly throne.
All for his legend.
"In the history books and by the firesides, the scale of the victory would swell, just as the tales would grow taller."
"In fact, by the 20th century, the King himself had grown by two feet."
But the facts were rather bleaker.
Only the task of removing the English from Scotland was near completion.
"The attempt to produce a male heir could now begin, but it was perfectly possible that Queen Elizabeth might prove barren."
"Bannockburn had given him his legend, but it had changed nothing else."
"I mean, for God's sake, you know, she can... she certainly lets everybody know how clever she is."
"Mrs. Rogers made a very big thing of the status issue right at the beginning, um, and endeavored, as I saw it... and her voice, her tone and body language convinced me that this is what she meant to do to humiliate me"
We're all doing the best we possibly can.
"From the start, Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Enright"
"Weeks ago, they clashed over their respective charges."
You have tried to cast aspersions on her.
I have not done that on your charge.
"I have been asked what I thought about her, and I said."
I haven't meant to be rude to you.
I've meant to be clear about my feelings.
"It's all in the perception, I believe, mm-hmm."
I have a particular character to deal with whose behavior is irreproachable.
Do stop saying that.
"It's getting terribly boring, madam."
"Yes, and I'm getting tired of the generalizations which suggest that her behavior is less than satisfactory."
"I have forgiven, forborne, and I have reached the end of my capability there now."
"For goodness sake, we've got 12 days or ten days left here."
"Why can't everybody just really enjoy those last ten days without having something as pathetic as somebody's little vendetta, you know, ruining everything?"
"I have now got the very, very contemporary feeling... make no mistake, this has nothing to do with 1811... how dare she despise me?"
"Independently she's a complete nobody and I am somebody, and I am getting very close to telling her that."
The tensions between Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Enright finally explode.
Of course.
"Um, Jesus, did you hear that?"
What's happened?
Are you okay?
"No, I mean, that was awful."
Come and sit down.
What's been broken?
A plate.
"Mrs. Enright then said that she'd had enough of Mrs. Rogers, that she was going to pursue her to an early grave, that she was a foolish old woman, a crashing snob and something else and she threw her plate up the room,"
and walked out of the room.
And Mrs. Rogers is very...
I find too much poverty hard to stomach.
We did everything possible to make the images beautiful
and pleasant to look at.
The forest
"I kept telling the team to forget the rails for the travelling shots, the lighting gear, the machinery."
Nobody listened to me.
They probably thought
"I just wanted to save money, so they bought everything anyway."
They packed the lighting gear back up on the first day.
"We left the dolly out for travelling shots, but the guys who were there to work it started to get depressed."
"The whole team was there to set up the travelling shots, they had nothing to do..."
This part of the shot is just a simple pan.
It looks more real to me.
Let's rewind to see...
I let them set the dolly up to cheer them up a bit and motivate them.
So we used it for the first part of the shot.
But I don't really like it.
I suffer every time I see the trees parading through my shot like that.
"In the other part, it's the same trees, but they don't make me suffer!"
The travelling shot was to cheer them up and encourage the team to stay motivated.
"I used the shot, but it gives me no satisfaction."
"The camera follows its natural movement, that is to say, we don't see it moving."
"Then, suddenly, the forest starts to move, you lose the impression of trees planted in the ground."
"They start walking and the shot is painful for me to watch, I don't like it."
I regret not using a fixed camera for that shot.
They could have done it their way too.
"In the other part of the shot, the movement is more credible."
"It's more in harmony with the two living beings, the scale of the trees is right."
"They are rooted in the ground, not walking, like the people."
"But in the other part, the men and the trees both start walking."
It's a farce!
"This seems more natural, you see the roots going down into the ground."
"As you say, you can look at somebody, you can see the different layers, you know."
And we're not used to looking at a person and seeing them in that way.
"I know what is inside, you know."
"Look, when I take a lady's shoulder"
I know exactly what is now between my finger and my thumb.
You mentioned you might look at somebody you see a muscle move and you know what's adjacent to that.
Have you had the experience with anybody tonight?
"Oh, yes."
Did you see here the muscle... how it comes up?
Please swallow again.
"When this comes up, it's very..."
Exciting?
I was kind of sat opposite the professor.
"He was eating a blackberry fool at the time, and he just kind of looked directly at me."
"He looked me straight in the eye, and he raised his eyebrow."
"And, um, you know when you kind of see somebody looking at you and you think, ""They're looking at me,"""
"and they're thinking, ""I want you for your body""?"
"Well, he was thinking that, but for all the wrong reasons."
"The body is so complex, and there is so much unknown."
"The more I learn anatomy, the more anatomical questions are generated."
"So, for me the body is more of a secret than for you."
Yes.
The professor has invited the guests to make close inspection of his plastinates.
Von Hagens' inspiration was the French artist Honoré Fragonard.
Fragonard plastinated a complete horse and rider using liquid metals in the 1790s.
I'd like to bring you back into the Regency time of Frankenstein.
"With the electricity just invented at this time, just discovered, that there was in the mind of the people it could perhaps bring to life kind of newly put-together body out of parts... out of body parts."
"In this way, I am more than Frankenstein."
I don't need the kind of electric blunder.
I animate the body not by electricity but by putting them in lifelike pose.
The most significant advance of Regency anatomy was in understanding the female body.
"Until then, a woman's body was seen simply as an inferior version of a man's."
The virtue of politics is neutrality.
It's impartiality.
Neutrality?
That is all the more reason why you should rise and rectify the situation.
High Commander Yi Soon-shin has not abolished the army.
There was not once a call for abolishment of the navy in the 200 years of its existence.
Yoon Du-su and his generals are overestimating their own ability and making a grave mistake.
"If you act hastily with unsupported claims, you can get yourself hurt."
You must learn to keep a distance and lay low at times.
This is an advice not as the Prime Minister but as your father-in-law.
"Father-in-law, do you consider me as your son?"
Fathers take a whip to their sons to teach them what is right and wrong.
I would expect you to show me the true path of a scholar.
How much do you know about politics?
I know nothing about politics.
But I do know that a true scholar risks his life for righteousness.
"If His Majesty seeks to forsake the High Commander and the Left Minister,"
I will stop him at the risk of my life.
Duk-hyung!
Father... are you angry?
Or are you afraid?
"If you are afraid, kill them without hesitation."
"But if you are angry, forgive them and give them a chance."
A sovereign does not fear his faithful servants.
He feels fear only when the safety of his kingdom is being threatened.
"If those men are threatening the safety of the kingdom, they are not your faithful servants."
But even the most faithful subjects may provoke the sovereign's anger.
"And as there are more than one way o defend the country, at times they may disagree with you."
"Their approach may be different, but if you know that what they do is for the safety of Chosun, embrace them and show them your magnanimity."
Father...
Benevolent rulers of all ages and have never spared their efforts to win loyalty of good men.
How did you acquire Minister Yu Sung-ryong?
"The road to Scotland's independence seemed very long, and it was blocked."
"Progress now depended on Edward II, who had no reason to make any concessions of any kind at all."
"For four long years, the Scots raided English territories in the north of England, Ireland too."
"Robert lost his last remaining brother, Edward Bruce, all in vain."
Edward took no notice.
He didn't need to.
"He couldn't beat the Bruce on a battlefield, so he'd changed the game."
He'd started playing by the rules that Scotland's bishops used.
He had gone to the Pope.
And the new Pope was desperate to restore papal prestige by sending all the major crowns of Europe on crusade.
Kings who caused petty national squabbles would not be tolerated.
"In 1 31 8, the Scots discovered that the English had convinced the Pope that the war between England and Scotland was Scotland's fault."
"Robert, his lieutenants and his bishops were all excommunicated."
"In addition, the Pope ordered that in every English church, three times a day, a ceremony was to be held at which the name of Bruce was cursed."
The news will have been bitter.
"As the curses rose from every English church, the Bruce came to St Andrew's Cathedral for its day of consecration."
"Almost 700 years ago, the Bruce stood here, along with his old mentor, William Lamberton, but without Wishart, who had died two years before."
He watched as these marks were made.
A generous annuity for the new cathedral was announced.
"He was pious, desperately so."
"The Bruce's spending on things like this - churches, chantries, monasteries and chapels - was increasing."
"Generous grants were made to institutions dedicated to St Andrew, St Fillan, St Thomas, St Ninian."
His people called him Good King Robert.
But Good King Robert wasn't so sure.
He wanted the saints to intercede on his behalf.
"Those English curses didn't seem quite empty, not at least to the man they were intended for."
The fate of the Scottish crown was back in the hands of the papacy.
"And the Scottish clergy, once again, was the Bruce's only hope."
"In April 1 320, a Scottish knight set off for the papal court."
He was a postman of sorts.
He carried with him three letters.
"All were written here, in Arbroath Abbey."
I am not gamesome:
I do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
"Let me not hinder, Cassius, you desires:"
I'll leave you.
Brutus...
I do observe you now.
"Tell me, good Brutus... can you see your face?"
No; for the eye sees not itself but by reflection... by some other things.
'Tisjust...
"And it is very much lamented, Brutus, that you have so such mirrors... as will turn your hidden worthiness into you eye... that you might see your shadow."
"I have heard... where many of the best respect in Rome... except immortal Caesar... speaking of Brutus, and groaning underneath this age's yoke... have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes."
"Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius... that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me?"
"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear."
And since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection...
"I, your glass... will modestly discover to yourself... that of yourself which you yet know not of."
What motivates Cassius?
"In contrast to Brutus, his brother-in-law..."
"Caius Cassius, ostensibly has very clear cut reasons... for wishing Caesar assassinated."
Or does he?
His relationship with the emperor is an unhappy one... but it is not easy to separate his personal enmity... from his deep founded belief in republican sentiments.
So what is his motivation for the murder?
Cassius is the prime mover of events... and the investigation of his character... is essential to the understanding of why Caesar was destined to die.
I think Cassius is a very passionate man actually.
Much less of a man of principle... than Brutus is or thinks he is anyway.
"'Caesar loves Brutus', says Cassius at the end of his attempts... to bring Brutus into the conspiracy."
'Caesar loves Brutus... if he were Cassius now and I were Brutus... he would not humor me'.
If he were loved by Caesar...
I don't think Cassius would be talking Republicanism.
Cassius is an emotive figure.
He is somebody who gets things going.
He is more active than Brutus.
Brutus has to be acted upon...
"It was so tiring and so on the final day, they came in and said, ""We're having"
"""an entertainment evening just, you know, celebrate the weekend,"
"I was like, ""Fine,"" and people are going to get up and do stuff."
"So, this one girl gets up and she reads a poem that she's written about the weekend."
"It's boring but it's fine, you know."
And then this guy gets up with a guitar and sings Morrissey songs.
"He brought the guitar like he knew that bit was going to happen, it really wound me up, I was like, ""It's fine, be positive,"
"""be positive,"" and it was all going fine, it was very relaxed until this guy, Geordie Dave, who's a lovely, lovely man, and he'd come on this retreat because he'd gone through"
a bad break-up about a year ago and he'd lost all his confidence and he felt like he couldn't talk to people.
"He felt like people didn't like him and he wanted to sort of rebuild his confidence and out of nowhere, he just ran to the front of the room and he was like,"
"GEORDIE ACCENT: ""Hello, my name's not on the list"
"""but I've had such an amazing weekend."""
"Sorry, excuse the accent, sorry."
"No, it's good."
"He was like, ""I just want to say, when I came,"
"I thought all of you lot were going to be bellends."""
"It was like, ""But I feel positive, I feel so great about myself,"
"""I feel I can make friends again, I'm back to my old self."
"""I'm just going to sing a song, I'm just going to sing a song""."
"And everyone was like, ""Yeah, go Dave""."
"And I was like, ""This is going to be bad, this is going to be bad."""
"You know you can tell a bad gig, that feeling."
"And, he just starts, he's got no prep, nothing, and he was like - # It's a little bit funny... #"
"Silence, silence."
He's got no instruments.
# ..
This feeling inside. #
"Silence, silence."
"And I saw two things, in his face,"
I saw the moment he re-engaged with his legs.
"I saw him sort of think, ""Oh, we did this."""
"Like, genuinely, that was just a thought, and then I also saw that he didn't know all the words, he did not know the words to this song and he's about to have a death."
I understand it more now.
I was a little disappointed then.
I was a little disappointed then.
Even though I knew he knew it was me.
He felt like I didn't deserve to be on there because I hadn't played the game yet.
Coach?
"Well, that's something that he felt very passionate about is that you earn your right."
Jordan was missing from the cover of s.I.'S college basketball preview.
"But he was in the starting lineup, and with him, north Carolina won its first 13 games, rising to the ♪1 ranking in the country."
Rising to the ♪1 ranking in the country.
"My teammates gave me, you know, open shots and picking for me and giving me good passes."
"The heels finished the season at 27-2, won the acc tournament, and eventually found themselves in another final four, where James worthy put on a remarkable show against Houston in the national semifinal."
Coach Smith always gave you the green light --
Coach Smith always gave you the green light --
"If you saw it, take it."
"And I saw a Lane, and I took it."
It was a monster dunk that kind of set the tone.
I threw it down pretty good.
"I elevated, kept elevating, and twisted in the air."
"Even for me, that was pretty damn awesome."
The final against Georgetown and Smith's old friend John Thompson produced an epic battle.
"Three times before, Dean had been on the brink three times before, Dean had been on the brink of an ncaa title, and this time, despite a 28-point performance from worthy, he was still in danger of losing his fourth championship game."
32 seconds to go.
A 1-point lead for Georgetown.
"Coach says ""okay, we're exactly where we want to be."
"We're in great shape."""
"And, to be honest with you, I sort of."
"Coughed a little bit so I could turn my head 'cause I wanted to check the score, 'cause I wanted to check the score, to make sure I hadn't made a mistake."
But he said it two or three times --
"""we're going to decide who wins this game."""
"I looked at our guys, and everybody's got a little taller, and everybody's got a different look on their face, and as we're going out of the huddle, he patted Michael on the rear end and said,"
"""if you get a shot, Michael, knock it down."""
What is this painful and yet sweet choking sensation?
Secret power?
Demons or angels' invincible will?
"I had already seen that girl, but not like I saw her this time, never."
"And since then, I always see her that way, forever."
Then a herald arrived.
The emperor asked our young king to venerate him.
"Alert, enthusiasm all around me, to take up arms to retort to the insult."
"""For our country!"
"For the king!"""
"Fate strucks with one hand and the other offers easy resolution, but at the end of the road, where man suspects salvation, a new trap is waiting."
"I wanted to fight, like a thirsty man wants a cool spring."
"The storm of war, perhaps, will launder my honor, or it will bring death to my struggling soul."
"But our wise king, having compared our army's strength with that of the emperor's army, devised a strange trick."
He disguised our warriors.
"This carnival disguise burned my skin, like embers."
To put on a disguise again?
"What was dishonest in the tournament arena, will become warrior's virtue on the battlefield ?"
"What brought me shame, can honor the king?"
"For our noble goal, must not we fight with immaculate weapons?"
How can our knight-king open up the gates to such deceits?
The victory was complete.
The merriment ended superbly.
"As a pledge of perpetual peace, the terrified Emperor offered his daughter's hand to our lord."
The tears of shame and helplessness gnawed my throat.
Out of here as soon as possible!
Out of the bloody fair of shame and lust.
How to measure my stumbling to this mad revelry of betrayal and murder?
"The holy knight-king, whose oath I took will maybe forgive my sin."
"And that girl, I feel it, she will love me."
"I weaved fine words, to come up with an excuse for my thoughtlessness."
"She cannot reject me, because heaven created us for each other."
"And because Troy was around so much when Robert was younger, he becomes really, really key for unlocking a lot of that information."
"Come here, Karma."
Come here!
These are my cousin Michelle's two youngest daughters.
- They're so cute.
- This is Karma and Kayla.
Kayla?
My mum's name is Kayla.
That's a cool name.
Karma is a good name too.
It means good things will happen.
- Don't listen to her.
"- Don't listen to me, I'm saying good things!"
"If it wasn't for bad luck, we wouldn't have any."
I want a swimming pool.
"These kids are the next generation, are going to do a lot better."
"Make sure they have a place to live, something to eat, you know."
They don't have to go dumpster-diving for food.
"OK, you all go play."
So you mentioned dumpster-diving.
"When we lived back in Houston, when me and Robert were younger, me and Robert would go, like, to the dumpsters behind HEB and Wal-Mart, and stuff like that."
"Do you have any memory at all of Robert being, you know, physically abused?"
I have tons of memory of Robert being physically abused by his father.
"So, like, what happened?"
"There's this one instance when Robert was... about as young as one of the little girls that's here, he didn't want to smoke weed and his dad kept, every time he told his dad no,"
"that he won't smoke, his dad would call him a pussy."
"And finally, one day, Sam had enough of Robert telling him no, he didn't want to smoke, and grabbed him and started beating him and telling him, ""Look, you're either going to smoke this or I'm going to beat your butt."""
"And so he started, that's when he started smoking."
"'Most of the people when they speak to you, obviously, 'also kind of want to save Robert's life as well.'"
"They're his family, they love him, they don't want to see him executed."
"And so, you kind of have to guard against their bias and make their statements trustworthy by having just as many statements that kind of agree with each other."
"If you have ten statements that all say the same thing by different people living in different areas at different times, it becomes just significantly more persuasive."
"naturally, very shaken."
I have never broken any crockery over an argument before in my entire life.
"But if you put a prick in an animal's backside long enough, it'll eventually kick, won't it?"
"A little bit shaken, because I don't think anybody has ever behaved like that to me before."
This has been ongoing.
This has been an onslaught going on and on and on every day.
And it's horrible to watch and it's horrible to witness.
I don't know what I've done wrong.
"I've tried to avoid an uproar, tried to avoid losing my own dignity, which matters a good deal to me, but if you don't deal with these things, this is what happens."
At the first attack a bully has to be identified and warned immediately not to do it.
This all along has smacked in some way of bullying and I can't bear it.
"And I can't bear unkindness of this level, either."
I have a horrible feeling you might be asked to apologize to her.
I have a horrible feeling I might be asked to apologize to her.
And what will happen?
I have a horrible feeling we both might be asked to leave.
"Well, I'm sorry if I've done that to you, Hayley."
"Well, no, you had to do what you had to do."
It's just something that just occurred to me just afterwards.
It's within the power of the hostess to ask Mrs. Enright to leave.
She could stop goading me.
"And if she does, then her charge, Miss Conick, will have to leave, too."
"Mrs. Rogers is comforted by her charge, the countess."
"It feels like being someone's second, doesn't it?"
Like she's my chaperone.
"and it is kind of like you're the backup,"
"It should be, but it's kind of looking the other way around."
"I never, ever expected to chaperone my chaperone."
We all chaperone our chaperones.
"Mr. Gorell Barnes has been forced to mediate, even though no Regency man would expect to involve himself in women's affairs."
The fact of the matter is what is concerning me here is there is 14 people in the house here and the biggest problem seems to be coming
"Mrs. Hammond and Mrs. Rogers seem to be one side, and you and Lady Devonport seem to be another side."
But I'll be back.
I'm really scared!
"I think, the Weitz brothers, comedy is their first instinct  and I'm a tart for a laugh."
"Funny enough, I find that Toni Collette is, too."
Everyone's pulling in that direction.
I just hope we don't pull too far  and it's still as sad and resonant as it should be.
It's not this candy-coated comedy.
It deals with really serious subject matters.
It does so quite gracefully.
"It creates poignant, moving moments and a lot of depth, which I think makes you appreciate the humor of it even more."
"I think all good comedy is based on sadness, in a funny kind of way."
"If you've got that core there, the funniness is usually funnier."
"In this film, there's a lot of sadness, particularly in the boy's life."
The comedy plays all the stronger against that.
I know the difference between kids who can't settle down and kids who are just miserable.
Look at him!
Don't accuse me of being melodramatic.
- This coming from a woman who tried to...
- Cowabunga!
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
I just felt like a shout.
"Jesus, what a family."
"The movie, when you set out to make it, is a bit of a balancing act  between humor and pathos, and if you go too far in one direction  you lose your balance completely."
You're absolutely on a knife edge.
"It's not, ""Man falls into room takes his trousers down, slips on a banana skin, farts."""
"Which are all hilarious, by the way."
That's my favorite kind of comedy.
"It's light, delicate stuff."
"If you're on that knife edge of tone, it can quite freak you out."
I think that idea that you can switch  from depressed empathy to laughter  is an attractive one for a cinema audience  because contemporary films especially tend to take very much one tone.
We've not become very good at switching moods like that and I think it would be a terrible thing to lose from the cinema.
They know all the weak spots where they can stage their raids.
And they gorge themselves on the fruit of the farmers' labours.
They are almost impossible to stop but the farmers are not prepared to give in.
They bring out their secret weapon.
Specially-trained monkey dogs.
The Japanese Shiba Inu is one of the world's oldest breeds and people have trained them to protect their crops against monkeys.
"There's even a Japanese saying that when people are fighting, they're like a dog and a monkey."
But the rewards outweigh the risks.
They'll be back again tomorrow.
But fruit farmers aren't the only ones having to outwit hungry visitors.
Mr Nakayama has been keeping honeybees for more than 65 years and these sunny forest clearings are perfect for his hives.
"But every year, Mr Nakayama's hives come under attack."
Whatever it is seems to be unfazed by a swarm of angry bees.
Mr Nakayama has put an electric fence around his precious hives but even this doesn't seem to be keeping the culprit out.
So he's called in some experts and they've set up an elaborate trap laden with honey.
All they can do now is wait.
And it doesn't take long.
"Within just a few hours, news comes in that the trap's been tripped."
Professor Izumiyama and his team are here to help.
Although it's wise to tranquillise it first.
It's a young black bear.
"He's strayed dangerously close to the edge of human habitation, looking for something to eat."
"Black bears have attacked people in the past so, for everyone's sake, he can't stay here."
There's just enough room for the bear in the boot.
He needs to be returned to the safety of the mountain but it's a one-hour drive.
The bear could awake at any time.
And there's no cage!
"In this rural area, bear expert Professor Izumiyama is used to taking this chance."
They need to take the bear as deep into the mountain wilderness as possible.
This is the most anxious time for the professor.
"Thanks to Professor Izumiyama, this lucky bear is back in the safety of the forest and out of harm's way."
"All across Honshu, big towns have grown up along the forest edges."
Nay... we will all of us be there to fetch him.
The morning comes upon's.
"We'll leave you, Brutus."
"And, friends... disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said..."
- and show yourselves true Romans.
"- Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily."
Let not our looks put on our purposes;
But bear it as our Roman actors do... with untired spirits and formal constancy.
And so good morrow to you every one.
Brutus tries to turn a murder into an elegant sacrifice.
'Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods... not as a carcass fit for hounds'.
You can't do that when you have got somebody... to kill with energy and ferocity.
The image later in the play is of the conspirators as hounds around Caesar.
"'Here wast thou bade brave heart... here didst thou fall', says Antony."
The image of the stag hunting with the hounds round the bloody corpse.
That seems to me to be a piece of serious self-delusion on Brutus' part.
Also he tries after the killing... when the blood is running on the floor of the stage... again to create ritual out of it.
'Stoop Roman stoop and dip your hands in Caesar's blood'.
Brutus is forced into... justifying the murder of Caesar not because of what Caesar has done... because of what he might do.
"Now this is pretty dicey, isn't it?"
To kill somebody... in case they do something that you fear that they might do.
What if they wouldn't have done that you have to say... is pretty hard luck on anybody:
to be assassinated... on the grounds that they might possibly become... the sort of person Brutus fears Caesar will become.
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
"What enterprise, Popillius?"
Fare you well.
What said Popillius Laena?
He wished today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
Look how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
"Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention."
"For people who don't know the show, it is set in the bleakest, most miserable place in the world and it was always shot at the bleakest most miserable time of the year, so you're talking deep into November,"
"freezing cold, minus five, lashing out of the heavens, and if that wasn't enough, there was two rain machines as well, for extra rain and extra misery, and it was taking a very long time to get this scene"
"and after six hours of this, absolutely freezing cold,"
"I mean, really freezing, you know, bones were rattling and the rain getting into every fibre of every stitch of clothing."
I was genuinely worried.
"I thought I was going to die,"
"I really, genuinely thought, I'm not going to survive this, hour after hour of this, relentless misery and we're an hour from the nearest town, this is how remote it is."
It's like the moon or somewhere.
"And finally, because of bad light, we had to stop, they would have gone on forever and I just said, ""I cannot get into a car so wet and so cold."""
"I went up to the nearest house and I knocked at the door and I said,"
"""I'm really, really sorry but can I have a bath?"""
"I had no choice, I had no choice."
"And granted, I was dressed as a priest and it might have helped but they just kind of looked at me and went, ""OK""."
Did they recognise you from Father Ted?
No.
"It was the first series so no-one would have ever seen it, nobody would have even been aware there was filming going on."
"It was just this extremely wet, bedraggled priest... came to the door and asked for a bath and that was..."
"Yeah, fair enough."
"I like the fact you didn't even ask for a shower, you wanted a bath."
It had to be a bath.
You needed to properly unwind.
It had to be a bath.
"Out of interest, was there bubble bath?"
"No, it was just a plain bath."
A plain bath.
"Are you called, Roisin, ""Ro-sheen"", is that how you say it?"
Yeah.
You grew up in London...
Yes.
..but with this full-on Irish name.
Were people OK with it or did they get it wrong every time?
"Most people say it ""Roy-zin"", you know, it's ridiculous."
"I mean, the CRASH unit had an office that was off-campus, away from the main Rampart station."
They were their own little entity.
"By the LAPD's own account, it was a poorly supervised unit that poorly documented their activities."
Crack was a huge problem.
Homicide numbers were soaring.
"It was a violent time in the city, and what they thought was the ends justified the means."
"""We're there to do a job."
"We're there to take the neighborhoods back."""
"We're there to make sure that regular people who obey the law, can walk down the street without being threatened by these gang members and these criminals."
"You know, when you have a motto like ""we intimidate those who intimidate others,"""
there's a certain attitude that goes along with it.
I don't think this seemed like a great big deal at the time.
I think they feel like they had the backing of the leadership and certainly of the the community.
The victims in these frame-up cases and whatnot are not sympathetic.
"I mean, most of these are hardcore gang members who have committed lots of crimes and you know the saying,"
"""if they werert guilty of this, they're guilty of something else."""
"And, you know, I'm sure that's true, but the question is:"
"Do you grant the power to suspend the Constitution to some 25-year-old cop who decides who it's okay to frame and who it's not okay to frame and you know,"
"""I know what happened here so I'll take care of this,"""
and I think the answer that most people would say for that is no.
The Pager Incident was a key episode in Perez's career.
It's the first case in which he decided to break the law and profit from illegal conduct.
Let's go.
LAPD!
LAPD!
- Don't move!
Hands behind your head!
- Freeze!
LAPD!
Get your ass on the floor now!
Shut up!
"They get inside the door, and there are drugs all over the place."
Did you ever see any physical abuse that happened in the family?
Did Sam ever hit Robert?
Quite often.
Sam was very mean.
"You know, we all lived in fear because of Sam."
I was afraid he'd kill me and anybody around me all the time.
"And he would tell me, ""Aunt Chris, the man beat me,"""
and he would come to me and he would be wounded for being hit over and over.
"Around 12, 11, he was smoking crack and shit and I know cos I smoked it with him."
"Is there anything that you can think of, like growing up, any sexual abuse?"
They had a couple of older men that would come around the trailers.
"And they would come to pick the kids up, ""per se""."
Did you see them specifically take Robert?
"I know, because Robert would come out and... say,"
"""Don't ask me what they were doing."""
Part of you is just... so terribly sad to find that another person grew up in that kind of environment and you realise that they had no chance at life because of what happened to them there.
"And the other part of you is happy because it just, it's more evidence to make a stronger claim, which is more persuasive to a court, and it's something that can be used to save their life."
"So even though they had this terrible, terrible upbringing, it could be turned around and used to benefit them, which is, ultimately, all that we're trying to do."
"Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this meal we're about to eat."
Bless it that it might nourish our bodies.
Amen.
You know what I heard?
"You know on the news, how it came out a couple of years ago that they cancelled the last meals for death-row inmates."
- What?
- The special meals...?
"- Yeah, the last meals that they get, you know, which I... which I always thought was kind of sad."
- Would you have any appetite?
"- You know how I feel, Kelly."
"If somebody has been convicted, why should they be given any special privileges?"
It's not about being given privileges so much as not treating them like animals.
"Well, what about the victim?"
You're right.
The Stewarts had most definitely arrived at the top table of European power.
"There was a hefty price to pay, of course."
"James and his family wanted to impress their powerful, foreign guests with the very best in food, wine and entertainment."
But it was worth it.
The marriage brought the Ste warts international prestige and political influence.
"And there were other, more tangible items on the gift list."
NEIL:
This is some wedding present for a teenage king.
It is.
And the wedding wasn't exactly a shotgun wedding.
It was one of the main dynastic weddings of the period.
"And when James got this gun, Mons Meg, from the Duke of Burgundy, he was being given one of the most impressive pieces of technology available at that time."
Just how dangerous or effective was a thing like this?
"This gun could fire 18-inch stone balls, a good-sized ball, that could go over a mile, actually, especially with a following wind."
And the real danger that this represented was to the castles of the period.
A gun like this brought against a great castle was a real threat in terms of knocking its walls down.
"What does it say about James, though, that he now possesses this?"
Where does it put him in the league table of kings?
"It's putting him right up there amongst go-getters, amongst the main sovereigns in Europe."
"- So James was, in many ways, a big noise?"
- Absolutely.
James H's showy pretensions hid a mass of insecurities.
"He was thin-skinned, prickly, paranoid."
"The king felt trapped, hemmed in."
To the north and west john MacDonald dominated a huge arc of territories.
"Meanwhile to the south, there was another potential rival - the Black Douglas."
"William, Earl of Douglas was a 15th-century pin-up."
"He was popular, he was famous and he was very, very rich."
"His family, the Black Douglases, were the big power in the Borders."
"When William, Earl of Douglas, and john, Lord of the Isles, agreed a friendship pact, it set them on a collision course with James."
"Deals like this were routine, innocuous, they meant as much as a handshake."
But James didn't see it as a courtesy.
Is it a time to squabble over credit?
The time has come for us to gather under one flag and fight together for the future of Vers.
"I have delegated all of my authority to the lord of this newly repowered castle, as well as my soon-to-be spouse, Count Troyard."
This includes the right to decide upon whom to bestow the power to awaken Aldnoah.
"Until the day comes when we achieve victory in this war, it is my heartfelt wish that you think of Count Troyard's words as my own and rally to his side."
"All that we do, we do for Vers!"
"The battle against Earth continues to prove difficult, I see."
"Yes, Milord."
"But to those knights who are anxious regarding this situation,"
Her Highness's words must have sounded like a divine revelation.
Divine revelation?
Everyone knows that she was only able to issue that proclamation because of you.
"To the knights who are unhappy about the present state of affairs, they were words from on high."
Surely they must feel that someone has appeared who will lead them.
You exaggerate.
"But on the other hand, rebel factions are also certain to appear."
There is something that I wish you to do on that score.
Make a display of power?
"Is that it, Milord?"
"No, if we engage with such people, we will never see the end of it."
Start by rooting out the dangerous elements.
We can let the proper authorities take it from there.
Milord?
Princess Asseylum's name will be motivation enough.
And it should be simple enough to strip them of their knighthood with some random accusation or other.
You do not approve?
You think it too underhanded?
"No, Milord."
Quite the opposite.
It is only natural that you would stop at nothing to achieve your goal.
"Ever since the announcement, I..."
"If I may be so bold, you have seemed prepared for the worst."
A great sight.
"200 miles to the south on the border with Indonesia and the Philippines, we are to get a chance to see the adult turtles in their natural habitat."
See you in there.
"Mark tells me these are some of the best coral reefs in the world, but their health is as much at risk as the turtles."
"Dynamite and cyanide fishing, the pet trade and global warming are such serious threats to the reefs and all that are dependent on them, it's feared they may be extinct within 50 years."
"But it's hard to imagine that now, as I gaze in wonder at the grace and beauty of the turtles in their weightless world."
"Wow, that was amazing!"
Extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it in all my life.
"Two turtles I saw, at least."
"So graceful and beautiful, those easy strokes of those amazing flippers."
"I was watching them go off over the abyss, they go over the edge of the reef out to the open ocean."
"We're staying on the island of Mabul, which is home to many different nationalities."
"There are the Bugis, the sea gypsies that roam these waters,"
"Malays, Filipinos, Indonesians from various ethnic groups, and all of them struggling to make a living on this crowded coral island."
Hello.
Sprite?
Sprite.
Dua.
Terima Kasih.
Thank you.There you go.
"'For these islanders, shark fishing is a major resource, 'but one which itself is threatened with extinction.'"
I don't know what species of shark it is - good size one.
Look at all the rows of teeth.
"Oh, my goodness..."
"One, two, three, four, five, six..."
"You can't even count, they go right down..."
There's at least eight.
"It's a conveyor belt, so these front teeth are in use and as they break off, which they do often, literally, the next one just pops up like that, and that works, and then there's another one ready to go,"
and there are others developing further back so they never run out of teeth.
Extraordinary.
"Presumably it was killed for shark fin soup, is that one of the big problems?"
"Some are more than 1,000 years old."
"Here, links with nature are rooted in the most ancient beliefs."
"These sika deer live in the hills around Nara, one of the oldest towns in Japan."
"But, every morning, they leave the safety of the forest and head straight into town."
Their destination is one of the most sacred places in Japan.
The temple is the world's largest wooden building.
Large enough to house a 15-metre statue of Buddha.
It's visited by thousands of pilgrims.
The deer are allowed in because they're believed to be messengers of the gods.
No-one is allowed to harm them.
Legend has it that a god arrived at the shrine of Nara riding on the back of a deer.
"1,200 years later, the deer are still regarded as sacred."
They've become local celebrities.
And they take full advantage of the situation.
150 yen buys you a bag of deer biscuits.
"For many people visiting the temple, this may be as close to wildlife as they will ever get."
But the relationship clearly needs some finessing.
Some of the deer take unfair advantage of their sacred status.
"As with all things in Japan, courtesy and respect goes a long way."
A simple bow is quickly rewarded and everyone is happy.
"When they've had enough biscuits, the Nara deer head back to their home in the forest."
"But as you travel further from these mountain fringes, the landscape of Honshu is swallowed up in an urban sprawl."
Every inch of the remaining flat land to the coast has been taken over by people.
Over 35 million people are crammed into an area smaller than Yorkshire.
"In this concrete landscape, it would seem unlikely that any wildlife could survive."
But one animal has made the city its home and it has a strangely charmed reputation.
People even put fat little statues of it outside bars and restaurants.
"It's naughty, but it's also believed to bring good luck."
Tanuki - the raccoon dog.
"It's a creature of the forest but, as buildings have replaced trees, it's been forced to adapt."
These little creatures will eat almost anything.
There's an opportunity at every turn.
"The zero-G flight flies between 24,000 and 32,000 feet."
This is about the same altitude as a regular commercial jet... but that is where the similarity ends.
The water's the next one?
The path it follows is a series of coaster-like rolling hills... in the stratosphere.
"Just like ""Superman:"
"The Ride""... the super zero-G plane gathers potential energy... as it climbs up at forty-five degrees."
Passengers feel this as an increase in weight.
"Oh, yeah."
Gravity is measured in terms of g-forces.
One G is the amount of gravitywe feel... standing on the surface ofthe Earth.
I'm going to get back down like this and get ready.
"As the plane steeply climbs, accelerating upward... the gravity G count rises and people feel heavier."
All right.
The plane is accelerating us upwards... at about1.8 G at its maximum.
"As the flight approaches, then eases around the apex of the arc... the plane, as well as all the people inside it... are, in effect, in free fall."
Zero-G comin' up.
"Oh, man, what an indescribable feeling."
Holy cow!
"Oh, I'm out in free space."
"Floating, just floating."
This is what an astronaut feels.
The plane's trajectory induces weightlessness again and again... by flying a series of these parabolic arcs.
Even though they are within the cabin of a plane... the zero-G passengers are freely falling towards the Earth just like skydivers.
But what creates the sensation ofweightlessness?
It goes back to Galileo... who showed that all objects fall at the same rate.
"So, as the plane and the people inside fall freely toward Earth... they maintain the same position relative to each other... and that is why they feel weightless."
"The feeling lasted twenty-five full seconds... because, for twenty-five seconds, we were essentially in free fall."
It was like Superman just flying through the air.
"Oh, I cannot believe how it feels."
When thejet's engines reengage and end the free fall... the passengers feel theirweight return.
"As Einstein would say, weightlessness is but an illusion."
This is so awesome!
The whore.
"The lonely, sad, slutty, bitchy whore."
You sat on the sidelines while these four titans battled it out.
You were jealous that a few pieces of poop got more attention than you.
"That's why when the lights went out, you unleashed some thunder of you own."
Thunder of the... chocolate variety.
"Oh, well, that would be fine and dandy... if any of it were true."
Can we wrap this up at some point?
"In due time, pretty face."
In due time.
Isn't it true you thought you'd been pooping the bed for months now?
You chalked it up to your old plumbing and penchant for spicy foods.
"Morning after morning, you'd bury your poop after you rose to hide it from Charlie."
"But... convinced that Charlie had discovered his dirty little secret,"
"Frank pooped the bed again the next night as revenge, only a lot more came out than he expected."
He had gone too far.
I've gone too far.
"Due to the size and severity of the poop, Frank concluded that Charlie had been pooping the bed all along."
"And so he cleaned up the mess and wandered the streets, looking for someone who could replicate Charlie's small and malnourished turd."
"And that's where he came upon his old friend, Rickety Cricket."
Get up!
"Known the world over for his ability to replicate any man's stool,"
Cricket came back and committed fecal forgery.
Which leads us to the third turd.
"Dennis and Mac thought it'd be funny to put the frame on Frank and Charlie, and so they both pooped."
"But, as so often happens, the poop rolled together and two became one."
A turd merger... fused together by fear and hatred... and hair.
But on to the final poop!
A poop that can be traced back to Dee!
But not to her butt.
"The waitress, drunk out of her mind and furious that Dee had pushed her back into the arms of the bottle, pooped in Dee's purse while Dee's back was turned."
"And Dee carried it unknowingly until she arrived here and the lights went out and she was startled, knocking her purse to the floor, causing the turd to tumble where it stands before us, right now."
Physicians were gentlemen.
"They were educated and expensive, but with limited practical ability, they often did their patients more harm than good."
Women would write gloomily about being pregnant again and the dangers that were inherent in it.
"So they were really entering a sort of vale of death, really."
"Yeah, well, yes, they were, and there was... there was that threat, and of course, it was... it was no respecter of persons."
I mean in... in 1817 we had Princess Charlotte... at the age of 21 she had a long and lingering death as a result of childbirth.
"The other thing that is so different from today is the number of children that women had... an average of six or seven, and of course, the... the havoc that that wreaked with their anatomy in scarring and so on,"
which must have made...
Oh!
"intercourse, lovemaking quite..."
Painful and unpleasant as time went on.
One in three women died in childbirth.
I had no idea it was as desperate as that.
"That is so terrifying, to imagine that..."
"Oh, dear, I can hardly put my head around that."
I'm Mr. Foxsmith.
Very pleased to meet you.
"In 1816 Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, the story of a scientist who made a monster out of body parts and brought it to life with electric shocks."
Mercury to work the electric motor.
This is a battery here?
"Copper, zinc and this with acid on it?"
That's right.
"Right, this is all excellent-looking stuff."
Foxsmith is taking delivery of some early electrical apparatus.
"Um... oh, come over here and have a look at this."
"You might be well impressed, actually, if you want to make electricity."
You might be quite good at this.
"You can hold it, hold there, and I can hold this, and I thrust..."
"To Regency men and women, these were fashionable toys."
"They also experimented with electric shocks to treat ague, blindness and hysteria."
Do we get to electrocute anybody?
We've got plenty of footmen that are willing... to volunteer for that.
Finally after five years the light at the end of the tunnel.
After digging in opposite direction for over sixteen hundred feet the tunnels were just two inches out of line.
"We did it damn it, damn it we did it."
The completion of the summit tunnel was a watershed in the shopkeepers' fortunes.
The worst was now behind them.
Regular train services were now running through the Sierras.
At last there was an alternative to the wagon trains.
"Men, women and children would no longer die crossing the mountains."
But the race was not over yet.
There was still hundreds of miles of wilderness between the two railroads.
The Union Pacific was still mired in scandal.
With the men idle Durant had no option but to agree to Dodge's demands.
The affair has been settled amicably.
I have no further comment to make.
Dodge could now get on with building the railroad.
"The two routes were fast converging, and congress finally drew a line where they would meet, Promontory Point in Utah."
It now became a race not for money but for prestige.
Who would be the first to reach the finishing post?
"In the twelve months after breaking through the Sierras,"
Crocker's Chinese labourers laid three hundred miles of track across Nevada.
We've now got this track laying down to an exact science.
"There's no where in the world, no one, not the French, not the British, not even Grenville Dodge can do it as well as we do."
The shopkeepers were now racing across the salt flats of Utah.
And Dodge was heading through the one gap he had found in the Rockies.
"After six years they were just fifty miles apart, and racing flat out for the finishing post."
Close to their goal the Chinese labourers set an historic record.
In a single day they laid an astonishing ten miles of track.
Dodge too was setting a remarkable pace.
"The two companies were neck and neck, anyone could win."
On April 30th 1869 a single train crossed the finishing line at Promontory Point.
Six years and seven hundred miles after spreading the first shovel of earth in Sacramento the shopkeepers had reached their goal.
"We're now waiting on the Union Pacific,"
"If my mother did not threw herself in between us, my rage could have lead me into the terrible sin of fratricide."
"But my loving brother knew, how to keep fanning the flames, without himself getting burnt."
"He ordered his servants to confront me, expecting their blatant aggressivity to deprive my anger of its last restraint."
I killed.
"I murdered a poor, ignorant person."
I became the tool and the victim of my brother's nefarious plan.
My only wish was to say goodbye to my mother.
But the night's shadows whispered bad advice in my ears.
"""She too wants your blood, like wolves."""
"""A snap, and you are free."""
"""Why do you hesitate?"
Kill her!
"You are already a murderer, after all."""
God moves in mysterious ways.
"Was it his will, that sparked a storm that washed away my footprints?"
"Was it his will, or just chance, that lead me to the king's court?"
I don't know.
"Days, weeks, went by."
Time is blurred in my memory.
"At that time it was custom that a knight-errant, visiting the royal courts called out the local braves to a duel."
The loser's weapons were usually given to the winner.
"While wandering in the city, I've heard about the bull-headed Knight, who was defeating our best fighters, one after the other."
He did not spare anyone.
"The king attended every day these tournaments, and each day brought new disappointment for him."
"On the day when two young men volounteered to fight him,"
I ventured among the onlookers.
The king welcomed delegates from some distant country.
"The bystanders whispered that the visitors brought the image of the king's wife to be, in a pledge for the future marriage that could transform our country to an empire."
"At that time, I did not bother with all this."
The fight took my full attention.
"The foreign knight easily beat our first fighter, and I could not help but to look toward the king's tent, to see how he reacts to another setback."
"I was shocked, like struck by lightning, to see my hated brother in the tent, whispering into the king's ear."
- Could have gone to the cafeteria.
This one.
Their coffee sucks.
"You didn't mention seeing me upstairs to anyone else by any chance, did you?"
"No, no, no."
"I mean, I...."
"I wouldn't have said anything to you, but I just thought maybe you might want to talk to someone or something."
Yeah.
"No, I appreciate the gesture."
So what are your treatment options?
I've opted for a radical prostatectomy.
"My urologist, Dr. Peter Singh, do you know him?"
He does a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure for patients with low volume disease.
"Well, that's great."
"Unfortunately, even in the best of circumstances, there's a 25% chance of loss of erectile function."
"Yeah, then you're looking at penile injection therapy, intraurethral pharmacotherapy, vacuum erection devices, or a penile prosthesis to achieve an adequate erection."
"Why, uh, then the good news is that there's a 75% chance of success."
"Well, the procedure also eliminates the ability to ejaculate."
"But the chance of urinary incontinence is relatively low, so at least I won't be wearing a diaper or need an artificial sphincter."
"Oh, well, there you go."
"It's-it's rather daunting, knowing that you may never have sex again."
"Well, it sounds like you're in good hands."
Look...
"I know this is, uh, rather unconventional, and under different circumstances I certainly would have employed a more traditional approach with regards to courtship and romantic methodology, and assuredly enjoyed all the ritual of that, but given the time constraints and what I'm potentially faced with..."
"You know, you might want to just kind of..."
"Look, look."
"If I'm going down,"
I want to go down swinging.
And I'd like it to be with you.
So you want me... to sleep with you?
Yes.
"Wow, that's something."
"Even when you think, this was for all intents and purposes a kid who was sentenced to life in prison for a murder that he didn't even commit himself, that he was present for, that was committed by his abusive father."
"And in this case, if the jury had heard this evidence,"
"Pruett would unquestionably have been sentenced to life in prison, rather than a death sentence."
We're going to bundle it all up and we're going to write it into a legal claim and we're going to go file it in federal court.
- See you later.
- Definitely.
BAGPIPES PLAY AMAZING GRACE
"Today, we remember the brave men and women, our co-workers, who have given their very lives in the service of the people of our state and our country."
Daniel wasn't just a corrections officer.
He was my little brother.
He was my baby.
He was giving and kind and he was always there for his kids.
You never saw him without at least one of them.
He cared for everybody around him.
Their lives had a purpose.
They left a mark and their memory will live on.
"That morning, when he got up and got ready,"
"I'd just had Rebecca, so I was in the bed round about the time he was getting ready to walk out the door."
"And he went to go check on Rebecca, because she was starting to wake up, she was fussing, and he brought her to me and gave us both a kiss and said he would see us later."
Told us he loved us.
And that was the last time.
"When my father passed away, I was roughly two-and-a-half months old, so I don't really remember much."
"The first memory I have involving him,"
I do remember being at his funeral.
I think he looks a lot like Daniel.
Daniel Nagle's children have been raised by their grandparents.
Michael and Rebecca has had a very hard life.
"They first lose their dad and then, their mother gets... on drugs."
"She... is indisposed of right now, she's in jail."
"And if this had not happened to Daniel, Crystal wouldn't be in jail."
"I hold Robert Pruett responsible for everything that's happened, for the road that my life went down, the kids not having their daddy."
I hold Robert Pruett very responsible.
"""a suitable match has now been found for her."
I shall write back to Mrs. Conick that Hayley rather shockingly proposed to me that she might go to London and become a courtesan to fund her ambition to have a literary or political salon... perhaps a combination of both.
"quite how I was going to explain this to her parents, because I thought Hayley's particularly well-equipped both physically and intellectually for these tasks."
Not everyone has turned their back on the prospect of marriage.
Miss Braund has made a classic Regency compromise.
"She may not have fallen head over heels in love, but she is able to see the benefits of a life spent with her wealthy best friend, Sir Jeremy Glover."
I really like the guy.
"I really, really like him."
He's a massive flirt.
"He's a huge, huge flirt..."
"as am I, so we just kind of hit it off on that level."
"And if I had the choice of all the gentlemen in the house, the gentleman I would choose would be, yes, Sir Jeremy."
"Sir Jeremy, in Regency times, would be looking for a wife that could bear him children."
"You would have been good friends and there to support each other, and that's what this is."
"I think I tried to explain to Lisa that, you know, a knight in shining armor does need a damsel in distress."
"Otherwise, he's just running around in his armor looking like a..."
like an idiot.
"The question facing Miss Hopkins is not how to love, but who."
"Oh, no."
Oh...
Mr. Carrington.
Do you think?
"And to think somebody's gone to all this effort and has, you know, picked up on, you know, something that you've said in passing to make you happy is just completely overwhelming."
"With his bold move,"
Mr. Carrington draws ahead of Mr. Everett in the race for Miss Hopkins' heart.
How the hell did you know that?
"To be honest, I kind of probed."
"Oh, really?"
It is a complete and utter fantasy... my bed strewn with rose petals.
"For the last eight weeks, the guests in the Regency House have been waited on hand and foot by their dedicated servants."
Now the master wants to reward them.
"As far as the footmen are concerned, there's two key rules to remember."
Let's get Michael King out of prison and do a couple of coppers at the same time.
"All we know at the moment is, we've got to ask James Barr some questions, also there's some questions to be asked about unreliable evidence."
Now I don't know why Inspector Pearson chucked out Mitchell's statement.
He may have a good reason to have done so.
"But I tell you this, you can accuse Pearson of anything because we buried him last week."
"That's as may be, Inspector, if I was worried about a bit of iffy procedure, that might be just about to resurface as a miscarriage of justice making sure it wasn't there wouldn't be a bad move."
But it was me that was opening up the case on James Barr's first wife.
When you found conflicting evidence why not go straight to your senior officer?
I did.
And both Mr. Mullett and I agreed that the death of Jeanette Barr raised doubts on the earlier investigation.
I'm talking about the point at which you located this conflicting evidence evidence you say you knew nothing about at the time.
Yes that's right.
And I still say...
You didn't attempt to contact either your DCI or the Chief Superintendent.
Instead you went to see your old guv'nor.
Yes.
"Yes, I went to see what he remembered."
The detectives in Chief Superintendent Fairclough's firm were all very loyal to him.
"How far do you take that loyalty, Inspector?"
Charlie Fairclough was one of the best detectives this county's ever seen.
He put away more serious villains than you've had ladders in your tights.
In the days when men were men and women did the typing and made the tea.
"Just a turn of phrase, ma'am."
"Yes well, try this turn of phrase, Inspector."
There's more than one dubious conviction down to your old guv'nor.
"I'd have liked to keep this investigation out of sight until I was ready on all of them, but I've been forced to move."
Just like you.
So this case comes first.
"But don't worry, you were around for some of the others."
"And so was your friend, George Ayre."
The man who saw Michael King in Shepley at ten o'clock.
You might be surprised just how often his evidence puts people away in Charlie Fairclough's cases.
"I was 20, 21."
It should have been the perfect timing.
That's when I was the perfect age for that to be my time but I think I was trying to be cooler than all that.
Plus I had my head in other things.
I was more into Tom Waits at that point than anything that was going on locally.
It was around '94 when I began to really feel like I knew the music I did like.
- The bands like Ween and Guided By Voices.
- Now you're talking.
For sure.
That was a real enlightening period.
"Number one, I felt like I discovered it for myself and it wasn't something anybody else found for me, which is always nice to feel."
- To think for yourself at that age.
- Yeah.
People used to say you were searching for a style.
That was a common criticism.
Were they missing the point?
Had you already realized what it is you wanted to get across?
I don't think I was doing anything but being myself.
"It really wasn't a mystery to me, but it mystified a lot with the people."
"It really, really got on my nerves because I thought, ""You do this, you try doing this."""
No one has given me any help to do this.
That's why they're critics and you're a musician.
They're there to criticize and you're there to make music.
"Out of that chaos came this magic that was ""Hour of the Bewilderbeast""."
A full-length record which took everyone by surprise.
Everyone was expecting this amazing record but not expecting it to be quite that amazing.
It can be quite an intimidating process when you've released various EPs and you've done various shows here and there and it all points to the day you can go into the studio and make a full-length album.
Was it intimidating?
"Not particularly at that point, because ""Bewilderbeast"" was unique."
"I don't think any album I do from now on will be anything like that because it was culled over a period of time, like the clichéd thing about the first record being a lifetime's work, or your life up to that point anyway."
It wasn't really that intense because all that worrying...
I wanted to do something people like and I wanted to do something I liked.
To the last of your project.
To the beautiful
I can't have all these bodies.
Just seems like that every body is involved with drugs not only teenagers but everybody.
And now you're telling me that aliens have come here and they're also looking for drugs.
It's just incredible.
Corpses...all these corpses here.
Dead people...
Please...no more bodies.
It is for me?
You did that for me Chief?
Why?
Why don't you come to me?
It seems to be strange that the aliens are interested in heroin but there could be a lot of reasons for that.
We now know because of the research of few American scientists in the late 70's.
"There are special receptors, opiate receptors in the human brain."
"Heroin, codeine, morphine all belong to the same chemical family derived from the poppy, they' re called opiates."
So that's what they found these Americans.
That there are special receptors in the human brain to receive opiate molecules.
What are these opiate receptors doing sitting around in the human brain?
Waiting for someone to come along and give them heroin?
Look what I got for you.
Some physicians think...
"There's a naturally occuring molecule, in the human body."
That is nearly the same molecular structure as opiates.
Oh you mean to say that opium occurs naturally in the human body?
"Not opium, I said nearly the same molecular structure, nearly the same properties"
Opium users have said that the drug creates a similar feeling to what people experience during orgasm.
Could be that this molecule is realeased into the brain during orgasm.
During orgasm?
That's very interesting.
Are you gonna fuck him?
Jimmy would mess around a little bit in a nice way at a meeting 'cause Dean would always time it where he'd be the last person.
"And at one of our acc meetings,"
"Jimmy told me and Bobby cremins, he says, ""let's hide."
Let's go in the bathroom.
"We'll watch as he comes down the hall, let him go in first, then we'll come in."""
"Let him go in first, then we'll come in."""
"So, stuff like that, to be mess around and, to be quite frank with you,"
I didn't understand his level.
It's lonely.
"""Why are you a little bit aloof?"""
"Well, when you walk in the room, and you're the best guy, you have the best program, probably, most of the people in that room are not going to like you."
Everyone in the room wanted to beat him more so than one another.
"So, I'm encouraged."
"By the mid-1980s, that was especially true of one coach,"
"By the mid-1980s, that was especially true of one coach, just a few miles down tobacco road -"
- Duke's Mike krzyzewski.
"They both lorded over their programs, in their ways."
"I mean, if you think of it in political or ideological terms,"
Dean Smith was the Roosevelt new-deal liberal.
He believed in setting up this big bureaucracy that people submitted their individuality to and then the whole team benefited.
Whereas krzyzewski was much more the kind of sun belt republican.
Whereas krzyzewski was much more the kind of sun belt republican.
He knew we were different.
"I think a lot of other people tried to be like them, and they used Dean as the barometer of who they were going to be, and I didn't want to be them."
"I wanted to be us, but I wanted to be us at that level."
"The first time coach k openly challenged Smith was in January of 1984, when the top-ranked heels came to durham."
He was mad because they wouldn't get his substitutes in the game.
He was mad because they wouldn't get his substitutes in the game.
"He'd send a sub up, and they wouldn't blow the horn to get him in."
"So, he goes up there -- They're in a close game --"
He goes up there and pounds on the scorers' table.
"And it was our scorers' table, so that made me angry."
The play has looked forward from its prologue... to the death of the lovers in the tomb.
"We're expecting that, that's part... of the satisfaction, of expectation in the play."
But the death of Mercutio is a horrible shock.
- Art thou hurt?
"- Ay, ay... a scratch, a scratch;"
- 'tis enough.
"- Courage, man."
The hurt cannot be much.
"No, 'tis not so deep as a well... nor so wide as a church door... but 'tis enough."
'Twill serve.
"Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man."
"Course he's very bawdy as well, Mercutio."
He can't even tell the time without making a bawdy joke.
You remember where the hand of the dial is when the clock reaches noon.
So all of those things are tremendously attractive in the part.
"He gets the superb set speech about Queen Map... which is powered by a kind of... imaginative energy that one doesn't find anywhere else in the play, I think."
"And also he gets... one of the best death lines puns in all drama, doesn't he?"
"""Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man""."
What a way to go!
What a way to go!
Romeo thinks it's all for the best when he tries to stop the fight... and he's the direct cause of the fight going wrong and Mercutio being killed.
"And then when he turns on Tybalt, he's in an absolute fury."
Very often on stage that's played very savagely... because Romeo is beside himself.
"Now, Tybalt... take the 'villain' back again That late thou gavest me."
For Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads... staying for thine to keep him company.
"Either thou or I, or both, must go with him."
One of the particularly attractive things about Romeo... is that he turns himself into a complete prat sometimes.
When he's in an agony of despair and he's lying on the ground... weeping and wailing and failing and...
I've seen performances of that where you just think... the Friar really ought tojust slap him and tell him to pull himself together.
The Friar says so but doesn't actually use the violence.
And then the nurse comes in and then you get a sense that... everything is falling below a level of tragic dignity...
- and I think that's very good.
After three years they were still twenty miles short of the summit.
Beyond lay a fortune in government grants and real estate.
But first they had to beat the mountain.
Dodge meanwhile had advanced three hundred miles from his start point.
"He was now deep in to Indian territory, and facing his greatest challenge."
The Sioux and Cheyenne were two of the most warlike tribes in America and the railroad threatened their way of life.
The sight of these iron monsters hurtling across their homeland was both alien and alarming.
They fought back with a fury that struck terror in to every railroad worker in the Midwest.
On the night of August 27th 1867 a supply train was heading westward across the prairies.
"About four miles out from the rail depot at Plum Creek in Nebraska, the engineers saw a fire on the tracks."
Out of the smoke two men came running towards them.
Indians coming.
Get on the back cart.
"The train ahead had been derailed by the Cheyenne, and the wrecked engine had caused a fire."
The war party could still be heard in the darkness.
The rescuers fled from the scene taking the terrified survivors with them.
"I looked out of the window and I see this, this, this whole pass of Indians out there."
"They, they was riding alongside locomotive, you know firing, shooting their rifles at it, and er, and we was going full chisel, engineers he's trying to outrun them."
"Er, and all of a sudden we, we, we were in a heat you know."
I didn't see what happened to the engineer or the fireman.
I don't reckon they stand much of a chance back there.
Of the twelve victims of the ambush seven were still missing.
The train sought refuge at Plum Creek depot.
Isolated the handful of men prepared for attack.
But instead of the Cheyenne daybreak brought a different sight.
He was the sole survivor of the missing men.
And he was carrying his own scalp in his hand.
By noon Grenville Dodge had arrived at a scene of carnage.
"Seven dead, five linemen shot and scalped."
An engineer and a rail man burnt to death.
This is a war.
We have got to clear the damned Indians out or give up building the railroad.
"He has endured the most appalling conditions on earth to ensure the survival of his chick, and the bond is strong."
"The exchange must be quick, as the tiny chick, unprotected, could freeze to death in seconds."
A task that began in autumn has been completed.
"Despite the huge odds against it, the precious chick has survived the winter and is now with its mother."
And she has food.
The chick's first fresh meal.
Her mission is complete.
"But for other mothers, the journey ends in disappointment."
Their chicks have not survived.
The females' need to nurture remains strong.
Any chick that strays from its parent is at grave risk of being kidnapped.
"The chaos may be a consequence of frustrated parental urge, but the outcome can be tragic."
"For those emperor penguins that survive, the worst is over for this year."
There will soon be abundant food for everyone.
The emperors have taken on the polar winter and won.
The gamble has paid off.
"All other animals escaped, only they remained to raise their young."
"And now, it is they who will now benefit most from the rich southern spring."
Another arrival is the certain confirmation that spring is here.
"The Adelies, having spent winter at sea, have come back, but they have not even mated yet, let alone laid their eggs."
"Now, at last, the male emperors can return to where they are most at home."
One season ends and another begins.
The penguins will soon be joined by migrants and the far south will bustle with life for a few frantic months.
"But there are only a special few, north and south, who can survive winter at the farthest ends of our planet."

And yet everything inside the airplane stays the same.
Kinda fun.
If you do it wrong you can really get into a lot of trouble.
You can really really scare yourself if you do it too fast or too slow or you stall the tail hour heart drops... so that's when I do it by myself to practice it.
Because you don't want to do it wrong when you're trying to show someone.
But the life of a bush pilot is not all barrel rolls and stunt flying.
With funds running low
Claytor needs to start looking for his next paying job.
He decides to leave Namibia flying northeast to Botswana.
"Here, he'll visit an old friend and fellow bush pilot..."
"Perhaps, with a little luck he'll also get a line on some work."
Bush pilots everywhere seem to have an informal network for news and information.
"In Africa, many are involved in wildlife management and conservation, like Lloyd Wilmot."
Just keep a nook out for breeding herds and any sign of vultures and hyenas.
Wilmot runs a safari camp in Chobe National Park.
In addition he uses his plane to help combat poaching in the immense refuge where he is an honorary game warden.
"Today, Claytor has become along with Wilmot to track a herd of elephants just outside the park."
You've a huge herd underneath you right now.
Roger.
I'm turning to the right.
I want to have another look at that herd.
"Okay, I'm in on your left."
Now that they've spotted the elephants from the air they'll continue the search on foot tomorrow.
Lloyd Wilmot is one of the few wildlife experts who routinely approaches elephant without the protection of a vehicle.
He and Clayton will wait at a watering hole for a close up view of the animals.
What do you do if you're surprised by an elephant?
Is there a trick to not getting eaten?
There's no real trick.
The thing is to try and keep the wind in your favor.
If you if you can see him before he sees you you can figure out which way the wind's going and then go down wind of him and keep clear of him but in the ultimate analysis if you are confronted
"you get to something like a big tree, like that."
On the worst stretches of track they built long wooden sheds angled in to the mountain to keep the rails clear of drifts.
As the snow melted it caused major problems for Dodge down on the plains.
"Normally placid rivers turned in to raging torrents, sweeping away miles of track and trestle."
And then came the rain.
Sandbags were all that stood between Dodge and disaster.
"The river has taken a hundred feet of trestle, and if we don't shore up the bank it will take as many miles of track."
I've never seen a winter like this.
We've had temperatures as low as minus forty degrees.
Hundreds of miles of track have been destroyed by frost.
And now with the thaw we get this.
The weather had stopped Dodge in his tracks.
And he was about to face a financial storm that would make his problems with the weather pale in to insignificance.
Up in the mountains the shopkeepers were just a few hundred feet from the summit.
"Beyond they had a clear run across hundreds of miles of mountain plateau,"
Worth millions of dollars in government grants.
But those few hundred feet would be the worst along the entire route.
They had to tunnel through sixteen hundred feet of solid granite.
The burden fell on the Chinese labourers.
They tackled it from both sides of the mountain.
Toiling in shifts around the clock.
Working and even sleeping seven thousand feet above sea level.
They sleep in cabins buried under the snow.
"With er tunnels, they're more like burrows that link them to wherever the hell it is they have to get to work."
"They stay there all winter, never see the light of day."
The long suffering Chinese finally cracked.
They went on strike.
For once Strobridge was on their side.
Now if you don't go in there and negotiate this thing is coming to a standstill.
I've got four hundred men that have already stopped.
There is no plans to negotiate.
"There's only one man running this railroad, by God it's not them."
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
"I came to chapel hill in 1959 as the first pastor of a new baptist congregation that was founded on the university campus, and the day I arrived for the first sermon and the day I arrived for the first sermon"
"who should join the church, but Dean Smith?"
The binkley baptist church was decidedly progressive in a part of the deeply conservative south that was still adjusting to the civil rights act of 1964.
"This civil rights act is a challenge to all of us to go to work in our communities and our states, in our homes and in our hearts, to eliminate the last vestiges of injustice."
To eliminate the last vestiges of injustice.
We had to put it to the test.
"Dean, myself, and a black student went to the pines restaurant, all-white and segregated."
"The door did not open immediately, but when they realized who it was, the door opened, we were served, and that was a milestone moment for this community."
"With Dean's help, some progress had been made,"
"With Dean's help, some progress had been made, but at the state university of north Carolina, the basketball team was still all-white."
Coach sent me to see Rick mount.
He was going to be the first high-school athlete on the cover of sports illustrated.
I saw him play and must've been 100 coaches there.
"You lined up, and you shook hands with everybody, and I think I was one of the few assistant coaches there at the time."
"P he gave me no time, so I went to a pay phone, called coach."
"P he gave me no time, so I went to a pay phone, called coach."
"He said ""what did you think?"" And I said ""he's all right."""
"He said ""all right, Larry?"
He's the best player in the country.
"He's got to be better than all right."""
"I said ""coach, he was a fine player."""
"He said, ""Larry, get over it."
"If he didn't give you any love, don't worry about it."""
"He said, ""well, look --"
"There's a kid in laurinburg, north Carolina, that I think we have a responsibility to go see."
"You know, we don't want to lose an in-state player."""
I drove down to laurinburg.
I watched Charles run up and down the court about three times.
About three times.
I ran to a pay phone.
"I said ""coach, you got to get down here."
"This kid's better than Rick mount."""
"It may look like the French are winning, but on the day, Admiral Lord Nelson had a brilliant plan."
Going for the big one.
"Traditionally, ships would draw alongside."
"But in an unprecedented move,"
Nelson's fleet attacked the enemy at right angles.
The French and Spanish forces were unable to regroup.
"Despite being heavily outnumbered, the English shattered the enemy's fleet of 33 men of war."
"Oh, wow, guys, guys..."
Make it spectacular.
The victory cost Nelson his life.
But it secured Britain's supremacy at sea for the next hundred years.
"¶ Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves ¶"
"¶ Britain never, never, never shall be slave. ¶"
"After the battle, Miss Hopkins breaks Regency protocol to speak alone with Mr. Everett."
At one time they were close.
"It would have been a good match... her new wealth and his old family connections... but when musician Mr. Carrington came along, everything changed."
"He had neither status nor fortune, but Miss Hopkins was smitten."
This caused a serious rift between her and Mr. Everett... and they haven't spoken till now.
"I had a wonderful chat with Miss Hopkins,"
"The two of us sort of had these storm clouds above our heads, and it was as if it rained and suddenly the sun had come out and there was this sort of a nice feeling."
"I mean, we found our friendship again and we just talked really pleasant to each other."
"We had a nice... we just giggled and laughed, and the cloud that has been sort of hanging over me the whole sort of thing just sort of lifted, you know."
"We had a fantastic conversation on the lawn... and, uh..."
"I don't know how much he told, but he, um... he actually proposed to me... uh, with a... um..."
And I declined him.
"And I'm sure he won't have told you that, but I do think it's important that you know that."
I just couldn't...
I couldn't do it.
"I do like Mr. Carrington an awful lot, but I know the feeling is not reciprocated."
"Is it my fault that I've gone for the wrong man, that I've kind of turned the really, really nice guys down in favor of having somebody who's maybe wrong for me?"
So it has been kind of quite a confusing time because I've not maybe allowed myself to explore any relationship with Mr. Everett.
"And if I have hurt him, I am so sorry."
"And so, they could never consummate their love."
"In this way, they would have to rise above your ordinary ""going to the bathroom in front of each other"" kind of love, right?"
And they would go after something more divine.
"They took sex out of the equation, and what was left was a union of souls."
Think of this.
Sex was always the fatal love potion.
Look at the literature of the time.
Lancelot and Guinevere.
Tristan and Isolde.
"All consummation could lead to was madness, despair or death."
"Clinical experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther are united in the belief that true love has spiritual dimensions, while romantic love is nothing but a lie."
"An illusion, a modern myth."
A soulless manipulation.
And speaking of manipulation...
"It's like going to the movies, and we see the lovers' onscreen kiss, and the music swells and we buy it, right?"
"So when my date takes me home and kisses me good night, if I don't hear the philharmonic in my head, I dump him."
"The question is, why do we buy it?"
"We buy it, because whether it's a myth or manipulation, we all want to fall in love."
Why?
Because that experience makes us feel completely alive.
"Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our everyday reality is shattered, and we are flung into the heavens."
"It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon, but that doesn't diminish its value."
Because we're left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives.
"I read an article a while ago that said,"
"""When we fall in love, we hear Puccini in our heads."""
I love that.
I think it's because his music expresses our longing for passion and romantic love.
"And while we're listening to La Boheme or Turandot, or reading Wuthering Heights, or watch Casablanca, a little bit of that love lives in us, too."
"So the final question is, why do people want to fall in love when it can have such a short shelf life and be devastatingly painful?"
What do you think?
Stacy?
- It leads to propagation of the species?
Water tumbles off these mountains at four tonnes a second.
The Shomyo Falls are Japan's highest.
The water cascades over 300 metres - taller than the Eiffel Tower.
"Despite falling so far, the water doesn't roar, it murmurs."
People say it sounds like the chanting of prayers.
It may be a wild journey down the mountains but this raging water is about to be tamed.
"As it reaches the foothills, the torrents are gradually controlled and channelled."
"With so much pure water on tap, people can grow Japan's most important crop."
These are Honshu's traditional rice paddies.
"Flat land is scarce, so these fields have been painstakingly carved out of the foothills and water guided in."
"These man-made marshlands, perched on the edge of the mountains, are a magnet for wildlife."
"At the start of summer, as soon as the rice is planted, mysterious white globes start to appear in the trees around the paddy fields."
The paddy fields can be a dangerous place to raise your young.
Hungry mouths are everywhere.
So some mothers have taken to the trees to give their babies a fighting chance of survival.
The white globes are being made by these Japanese tree frogs.
It's the breeding season and the trees are teeming with frogs.
"The female is with a male at the tip of a branch, perched above the paddy pool."
She's building a nest by whipping up a giant ball of foam with her back legs.
She lays hundreds of eggs inside.
She's attracting the attention of other males.
Each male could still fertilise some of the remaining eggs in the foam.
They're coming in from all directions.
But the foam makes it hard to get to grips with the competition.
Things quickly descend into an undignified wrestling match.
This male's work is done here.
It's time to move on and find other nests.
"But when you're covered in slippery foam, it's hard to leave with dignity."
It's an unusual problem for a tree frog.
"As the days pass, the eggs develop in the safety of their foam nest."
"The temperature rises with the summer sun, and the foam ball dries to form a protective case."
"The tadpoles inside are still moist, and six degrees cooler."
"A sure sign that soon, plenty more will accumulate on this slope as winter advances."
And that is what she needs.
"If she has chosen well, the Arctic wind will do much of her work for her."
"Once the snow here is deep enough, she will dig down to make a den."
"She'll then lie, waiting for her cubs to be born as winter sets in."
The sea ice already covers twice the area it did in summer.
"Those animals that, a few weeks ago, came down here to feed in the sea, are now locked out."
But there are windows in this white desert.
Gateways to the rich ocean below.
Most birds have migrated south.
"But in the frozen Bering Sea, ducks of one particular species are gathering together in a single, immense flock."
Spectacled eiders.
Hundreds of thousands of them.
"With the seas that fed them throughout the summer all but frozen, this is the eider's last refuge."
"Such patches of open water, kept free of ice by strong currents, are given a Russian name, polynyas."
"If this polynya stays open all winter, the ducks will have avoided an exhausting migration."
"It's a gamble and a tremendous risk, especially for the spectacled eider, for this polynya holds the world's entire population."
"Surrounded by ice, these spectacled eiders' survival depends on this single, vulnerable oasis."
And conditions here can change very fast.
A smaller pool.
"Here, common eider ducks are learning a bitter lesson."
An early winter storm has caught them out and the ice is closing in.
"The pool is shrinking, and the ducks are freezing to death."
These gamblers have lost.
"As the sun's influence continues to dwindle here in the north, the cold pushes south into Arctic lands."
Winter brings a devastatingly-destructive force.
Frost.
Ice crystals form as moisture in the air freezes.
"Inside plants, the same thing is happening to the water in their cells and their sap."
"With these first frosts, most plants die."
Their insides ripped apart by ice crystals.
"Coniferous trees, however, like fir and pine, can withstand very low temperatures."
And nothing happened.
"There was no technical foul, so I was angry and I just said, right after the game,"
"I said ""look, you know, it's a double standard."""
"""There's a double standard in this league --"
"One for Carolina, and one for the rest of us."""
That burned coach up.
That burned coach up.
"Five years later, in 1989, the personal animosity between the two coaches reached new heights when Smith became incensed after spotting one of the Cameron crazies with an inflammatory sign."
"The ""Jr can't Reid"" thing --"
It really wasn't that big of a deal to me.
"I mean, I heard about the Duke crazies and how talented and funny they were, so, you know, for me, I was kind of let down, that was the best that they had for me."
"I'm like ""man, I must not be any good."
"I'm like ""man, I must not be any good."
"They didn't even work hard, you know, to get something funny to say about me."""
"But coach Smith took it a different way and, of course, he mentioned that he thought it was a lot to do, you know, with race."
"Initially, Smith lashed out against the Duke fans for stepping over the line."
"Then, he threw fuel on the fire by defending Reid and his teammate Scott Williams, openly pointing out that the s.A.T. Scores of his two black players were higher than those of Duke's white stars were higher than those of Duke's white stars"
Christian laettner and Danny ferry.
"Smith's point might've been well-intentioned, but it led to one of the most intense games in the history of the rivalry, a 1989 acc tournament final."
They were hollering back and forth at each other.
"Krzyzewski would say, ""quit coaching my players!"""
"And coach would say, ""somebody ought to coach them."
"You're not doing it."""
Never any separation between the two.
It was absolutely brutal.
It was absolutely brutal.
"I don't want to say hatred, but it was competitiveness at the highest level, maybe over the brink a little bit for both squads."
Laettner is grabbed and thrown.
"A lot of stoppages, a lot of fouls."
And Scott Williams is down for the third time.
I don't know if they waived the three-knockdown rule.
A lot of jabs thrown and who was going to be around in the late rounds to throw the knockout punch.
Okay?
And we repeat the process with just one end on and clamp.
Anything that gets clamped gets cut.
"All that was left, a partial penis and his tiny testicles."
Rhodes says Ashton urinates through a hole in his penis.
She says she can't imagine now what she'll say to her son when he's old enough to understand what's happened to him.
How could you explain it to your child that you don't have a penis or you might never be able to have kids?
"Yes, men are the majority of workplace deaths and injuries, war deaths, suicides."
They have a shorter life expectancy.
"Warren Farrell makes the argument that prostate cancer and breast cancer mortality rates are similar, but funding disproportionately supports breast cancer research and awareness over prostate cancer."
"The red pill is about looking at these issues in an honest way, even when it's uncomfortable."
And these things are uncomfortable.
But without the willingness to set aside the programming and to set aside the false beliefs about what power 1s and what women are and who women are...
Part of what we do is a pretty serious critique of both sexes.
It's brutal.
But critiquing the sexes is a real valuable thing.
"Feminists don't want you to do it, though, unless you're portraying women as the victim and men as perpetrator."
The red pill is about understanding men and women like everything else in life.
It's a mixed bag.
You've got victims and perpetrators on both sides of the fence.
And that's all.
It's real simple.
It's just not easy.
Hmm.
I...
I think I agree with everything you said.
"But there's... there's still some kind of unsettling doubt, and I don't know where that's coming from."
I'm recognizing all of these very serious men's rights issues.
But what I don't understand is how I could be agreeing with men's rights actmsts.
Is this the same misogynist hate group
I originally discovered online?
The Southern poverty law center has classified that group and men's rights groups as hate groups.
"Well, yeah, I was in Tesco, I'd done some really great shopping and I was on the phone to my flatmate and I was like,"
"""Have we got enough margarine?"""
"And then, suddenly, I got whacked across my face, it knocked the phone out of my hand, and I couldn't understand what had happened,"
I thought someone had started on me.
"So, I sort of looked up and then there were four 14-year-old girls running away going, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"", and I almost never lose my temper - I'm a very placid person - but I lost my rag, so I started chasing them, but I'd been shopping"
"for like an hour, so I had loads of stuff, so I couldn't get up a decent amount of speed."
"But then as I was chasing them, which was more for show, really,"
"I was thinking to myself, ""I don't know what my options are,"
"""cos if I catch them, what am I..."
I give them a talking-to?
"""That made me feel very...very unsettled""."
"So I was running round with all this shopping, thinking,"
"""What am I actually going to say?"""
"And then I heard a lot of laughing from behind me and this girl's going, ""What are you going to do, what are you going to do?"""
and I turned round - and this shows how slowly I was running - cos she was actually in a wheelchair...
"..and she was going, ""I know them, what are you going to do when you catch up with them?"""
"And I was like, ""Well, I haven't decided yet but I'm going to tell them I was very unsettled by their prank""."
So then I chased them round the big Tesco in Cardiff for about what felt like half an hour.
"It was like a sort of Benny Hill but, you know, meets 999."
"And then they left and then I got on with my shopping and then I went to the counter, I felt very...still a bit troubled and the lady behind the counter said, ""Do you know them?"""
"And I said, ""Who?"""
"And she pointed, and they were all by the window going, ""Ha-ha-ha!""."
"So, yeah, that's happy slapping, it's a really fun game."
Did you ever see the little video they made of you?
"No, I didn't, Alan, not that I looked for it every day for about two years."
But I turned like a sort of 1970s West Walian head teacher.
"I was saying things like, ""Just you wait!"
"""Just you wait!"
"""I'm going to give you such a stern talking-to,"
"""And I hope you're proud of yourself,"
"""you've brought shame on yourself, your school, your family!"","
"I was doing all of that, I was 23."
That's the creepiest way for an animal to earn a living that I've ever heard of!
That's revolting - that's lower than a dung beetle.
It's lower than an estate agent or a banker!
How creepy is that?
"'We hear that one of the Komodo park rangers, a man called Pak Main, was 'attacked last month while sitting 'at his desk in the rangers' office on the island of Rinca."
'He's still recuperating at home.'
I hear you had a fight with a Komodo dragon - what happened?
"The dragon bit my foot, the left."
"After a bite here, still in my foot his mouth, so I had to step and take the right of my foot put in the body."
"To stamp on him, yes."
"I would like to make a break of the leg of the dragon, but he more strong and I cannot hold him."
"So the dragon, throw down on the floor, try to bite anotheron the hand."
"Oh, my goodness.You have many more scars here and your hand is swollen."
And then I make like this.
I'm calling my friend.
"Right, so you're shouting with blood coming out of you."
"Help me, help me."
"Well, this is a warning to us to be careful.Yes."
We're off!
"Yes, this is what we've come here for."
"'The wind is fair and all is shipshape aboard the good ship Felicia, 'as we set sail for our encounter with the decidedly deadly dragons.'"
"'Our first stop will be at Rinca, the second largest of the islands 'within the Komodo National Park, 'which in 1991 was designated a World Heritage Site."
"'The result is that not only are the dragons protected, but so crucially, 'are the animals they feed on.'"
We seem to be approaching land.
"Yeah, so this is Rinca."
Rinca.
Seems quite a bare sort of landscape.
"Rather Welsh or Scottish almost - not many trees, and scrubby grass and rocky outcrops."
What sort of animals and things does the Komodo dragon live on?
"Here, they're living on animals introduced by people, actually, the big things like water buffalo, horses, pigs, deer...big things."
"For the past six years, zoologist Pak Deni has been studying the dragons, monitoring their movements, and examining their mating and hunting habits."
"The most recent research indicates that the dragons are in fact highly venomous, so it now seems it's not just the toxic brew of bacteria in their saliva, but also the anti-coagulants in their venom which disable their prey."
"I sometimes wonder whether the technology, designed to make Cinema better, doesn't make it worse, in some ways."
I truly hope I never have to use any of the huge possibilities that are available to filmmakers today.
"One camera, two or three lenses and a tripod are ample for..."
The cockerel
"There's some direction involved here to hold the image and use one shot, instead of three."
The cockerel?
"I don't know if we arranged that, if someone pushed it or not, anyway, it was very welcome."
We thought about the role of time.
"At a certain point, the car is no longer in the frame."
Whereas we needed to have a link between the village and the road.
The frame stays empty when the car drives off.
The dust holds our attention to some extent.
Then the herd passing by helps to claim our attention
the time it takes to notice in which direction the car is going.
"So, as soon as the herd is out of the frame, the car comes back in."
And the cockerel... it's as if he comes into the frame as a special guest and helps to...
Animals help to make everything... the staging of the scene and the atmosphere more natural.
"They help to make us forget the men and women and above all, the film crew."
"Their presence is such that even with no one on the screen, we feel the presence of hundreds of people."
"When a bird appears, its indifference... or a sheep, or another element that pays absolutely no attention to the crew, the scene will play out much more naturally."
"So, it's difficult to cut it out."
I would say the best actor here is the cockerel.
"It's wondering, where should it go?"
Where shouldn't it go?
It acts better than our actor.
"In any case, it helps the acting seem more spontaneous, more real."
Life
"Going by the films I see,"
"Cinema today seems artificial, it looks like fabrication."
As if we were killing life in order to reassemble it.
We turn life into a kind of canned product and call it Cinema.
Cinema is canned life.
"Oh, absolutely, they did, yeah."
"I was relieved when it happened because I knew something bad was going to happen and I was like, ""Oh, this is so great""."
"I remember being in jail in a wheelchair and covered in blood, and thinking, ""OK, now everybody knows"", and that's what I needed at the time and so that did the trick."
Were you doing stand-up at the time?
"No, in fact, it was only after that."
"It was about a year after that that I was like...was able to be like,"
"""You know what I really want to do"
"""now that I'm not in a wheelchair any more is stand-up""."
That was not...
"No pun intended, that would be a terrible joke, I would never...."
This lot loved it.
"I feel guilty, I want to, like, suck the laugh back out of you."
What were you doing for a living when you were drinking?
"I had several jobs, I worked in a warehouse and baby-sat, of course."
"Worked in a warehouse, baby-sat and catered, and in fact, the thing you said about me, the Lionel Richie thing, I was catering at a tiny party and there were like ten guests at the party,"
one of whom was Lionel Richie.
It was like a billionaire who was having the party and they had...
"It was a Moroccan-themed party, even though nobody there was Moroccan, it was, like, old, doddering white ladies in fezzes and Lionel Richie."
"And they had a little Moroccan band playing and the host of the party was like, ""Lionel, why don't you get up there and play with the band?"""
"And Lionel was like, ""No""."
"And then he was like, ""Come on"", and Lionel was like, ""OK""."
So he sat down with a three-piece Moroccan band - they really were Moroccan - and he sat down at a piano and they Moroccan'd around him.
And he played Hello.
"There were ten guests, and, like, me and a couple of other waiters and he beautifully played Hello by Lionel Richie and so just because of how few people were in there, several verses were directed right into my soul"
and it was one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me cos he's amazing.
I once was in Van Morrison's toilet...
..at exactly the moment he wanted to use it.
"Oh, wow!"
Yep.
"It was something like that, it was a private thing."
He was being honoured in Dublin.
"I remember, Bob Geldof introduced him and Van was quite happy to accept the honour but he's a notoriously difficult person and I was a big fan - that's why I was there - and earlier that day, he had asked for a 25-piece orchestra,"
The least weasel.
"A tiny hunter, and the vole's nemesis."
"Its body is exactly the same width as a vole's, so there's nowhere a vole can go that the weasel can't follow."
INSTRUMENTAL
"The weasel's long, slender shape is perfect for hunting in tunnels, but the worst possible shape for staying warm."
So they need a special way of doing that.
She plucks the fur from its body tuft by tuft.
And now she puts it all together to make a cosy blanket under which to sleep in her den below the snow.
Midwinter in the northern forests.
The sun is so low that it's twilight at midday.
"Further north in the high Arctic, the sun has been below the horizon for months and it'll be several more before it appears again."
The male polar bear spends winter out on the frozen ocean.
Few creatures can endure these conditions.
"If he's lucky, he will find a carcass that could provide a little food, possibly that of a fox or another polar bear."
"But otherwise, he must live on his reserves."
"This is the time to scrape by, to wait."
"But on lee-side slopes, beneath the snow, new lives are beginning."
The cubs are born blind and tiny.
"An early birth is easier on the mother, who is barely awake."
"Despite her sleepiness, her instinct to nurse is overwhelming."
The cub's clucking calls stimulate her to produce milk.
And what milk!
It's nine times richer than our own and enables her to double their weight every few weeks.
It's over two months since the autumn snows first arrived.
"In two more months, polar bear families will emerge onto the snowy slopes all around the Arctic."
"But for now, they lie protected within their icy cocoons."
"A hundred miles above the earth, the Aurora lights up the sky."
"After travelling millions of miles across space, solar winds, attracted by the magnetic pull of the poles, collide with the earth's atmosphere."
Trillions of charged particles dance across the sky.
"Above the Arctic, the Aurora Borealis... the Northern Lights."
"In the south, it's the Aurora Australis... the Southern lights, that bring light to Antarctica's long winter."
These spectacular lightshows are only a tease.
I remember my father's hands.
Sometimes that's all I could see when he would sit on my bed and tell me stories about his childhood late at night.
He said he was born on an island with a castle on it off the coast of Estonia in 1901 or 1902.
He wasn't sure which.
He came on a steamboat to Philadelphia with his family in 1906.
"They were very poor, but Lou was good at art and music."
"His drawings won prizes, and he made money playing piano in the silent movie houses."
He told me Philadelphia was a city where a small boy could find what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
I went back to the neighborhood in north Philadelphia to find the places he always talked about.
The whole family lived on the top floor of a tenement.
"And when a wealthy lady gave Lou a piano, there was no room left for his bed."
So he slept on the piano.
"They couldn't afford pencils for him to draw with, but that was okay, because you could make charcoal by burning sticks in the backyard."
"The kids teased him and called him 'Scarface', so he waited until the last bell to go to school."
"There was a girl he loved named Ada, but she loved someone else."
"The next part of the story he didn't talk about much, so I have to rely on the architecture books."
He won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1924.
"In 1930, he married Esther Israeli, and their daughter, Sue Ann, was born ten years later."
Esther worked in a medical lab and supported the family throughout the '30s and '40s as Lou struggled to get commissions and to find a style he could call his own.
It was the era of the new modern architecture:
sleek steel skyscrapers and houses defined by walls of glass.
"Lou tried to design that way, but it never felt right."
"In 1947, with Esther's help, he started his own office with several men and one woman."
He was almost 50 years old and still hadn't found himself.
I wanted to show you some sketches I made when I was... when I was in Rome.
"Then in 1951, he was invited to be architect in residence at the American Academy in Rome and to travel throughout the ancient world."
What he saw changed his life.
"These are the sketches I made a long time ago in Egypt, you see."
"Timelessness, monumentality."
That's what mattered.
"When Lou got back, he finally knew what he wanted to do:"
build modern buildings that had the feel and presence of ancient ruins.
"But I think we have to be realistic, and we have to look at what's happening."
"And, I mean, I'd be really sad to tell my children or my grandchildren that, sorry, there used to be something as magnificent as a dinosaur, but we killed them all"
Strafed with machine gun fire the huge creature's legs are swollen with infection.
Once her wounds are treated
Zola will be given an antidote to the tranquilizer and freed.
May 27th.
The immense animal awakes and rises to her feet but does not move.
"Then, slowly she lowers her massive head to the ground and uses her chin as a crutch to limp off into the bush."
The doctor sounds optimistic but I am not.
"She might survive these wounds but to a poacher, her life is worth far less than the sad stump at he end of her nose."
"Four days later,"
Claytor receives a wire from Janet Rachlow.
Despite all their efforts Zola has died.
"Back on his way,"
Claytor returns to the explorer's life.
He has decided to pay a visit to an orphanage for chimpanzees in burundi.
Claytor heads north toward Burundi.
"But first he'll cross Zambia, and an area called the Kafue Flats."
"I'm now somewhere over the Kafue swamps, and as far as you can see in every direction, it's absolutely flat."
And it's this green patina over dark blue water.
"If you didn't see the sun reflecting, you know that it's just a green patina of growth on top of this vast swamp."
I think if you lost your engine here
I'm not sure how deep it is but you'd probably just mush into this green gunk and just sit on top of the wing and then try to call someone.
You just can't crash here.
"If he did crash here,"
Claytor's tiny plane would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
The orange stripes on the tail and wings are a safety measure.
"If he goes down, the right color might make it easier to find him in the empty terrain he frequents"
Claytor hopes he'll never have to find out if it works.
And crashing isn't the only thing a pilot has to worry about.
I've had a couple of close calls.
"When I got to Algeria, it was right after the military took over."
Teaching me the ways of the world.
"We had wanted to make something more in the vein  of older filmmakers that we like, like Billy Wilder, for instance  who was a tremendous influence on our doing this movie because of the mixture of cynicism and hope at the same time."
We essentially harassed the producers Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro endlessly.
"I think at first, Jane didn't get why the hell  the guys who directed ""American Pie"" should direct this movie."
"It's a comedy, but on the surface it appears like a different kind of comedy."
"Hugh was equally horrified, as was Nick Hornby."
"I think, probably like a lot of people of my generation I thought, ""Oh, my God"", partly because I'd never seen ""American Pie""."
"I adored ""American Pie"", I really did, but I thought that's completely wrong."
"Our film's funny, but it's not  quite as determinedly lowbrow funny as ""American Pie""."
"But then you meet them, and of course, they're these incredibly learned  scholarly, intelligent guys."
"One of them thinks of an idea, and the other one says, ""Let's try that."""
They get double the ideas.
"It helps, because if they think something's a bit  not good, they'll say, and the other one will say, ""We can try it."""
They don't seem to really shout at each other at all and argue.
"If they did, no one ever sees them."
"I think, of all the American filmmakers I've ever met  the most erudite."
Shockingly erudite.
The bastards read books on the set.
I've never seen that.
"While the set's being lit, they're reading quite heavy tomes about the decline of the British Empire or something."
"He'd catch us holding them upside-down, which is a little embarrassing."
They just happen to have a 6-year-old's sense of humor.
It's a very good combination for this material.
"Nick Hornby is a clever man with a childish sense of humor, in a way."
It epitomizes the film.
It was horrible.
Horrible.
But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic.
I think it's important that Hugh wanted to play the character we wanted him to play.
Hugh is every bit as  withdrawn and morally suspect as the character he plays.
I'm not sure he'd deny it himself.
"He's much less like the bumptious  lovable, snuffling guy that you see in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""  or ""Notting Hill"", so I think he was ready to play a character  who's a little closer to the bone."
"""why ain't you dancing?"""
"I was thinking, ""Yeah, he's really giving this guy both barrels."
"""God, I wouldn't want to be in this guy's shoes""."
"He's like, ""There must be something wrong with you,"
"""there must be a wheelchair waiting for you cos you ain't dancing."""
"And I remember, I glanced behind me and I did this because the entire dance floor had emptied, the people were crying with laughter and pointing at me, and I looked at my friend and he was hugging his knees, he was laughing so much."
"And he said, ""You either have to leave or start dancing""."
So I left.
"Then I walked, I had to walk through the now empty dance floor with everyone going, ""Waaaay!"", and I was like, ""Yeah, very funny, very good""."
"So I sat at the back and the manager come up to me and he was like, he put his arm around me and he said, ""You don't have to dance"
"""if you don't want to""."
Were you 12 or something?
I was a bit tearful.
"He was like, ""Don't let him force you do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable"", and I was like, ""I know, thanks,"
"""cheers, mate""."
"So I was sat there waiting for the gig to end and then, obviously, we had to wait for everyone to leave because it was too embarrassing, cos people were coming up to me and taking the piss."
"The manager let us out round the back and as we went out, they were like putting away his decks and stuff and my friend was pissed and he went up to his roadie and went, ""Hey, mate, this is the guy, this is"
"""the idiot, that guy that Grandmaster Flash was taking the"
"""piss out of, look at him, he's there""."
"And the bloke went, ""Man,"
"""that's all part of the show, tomorrow night we'll do that to some"
"""other white dude in Exeter""."
I like the fact you didn't even ask for a shower.
You wanted a bath.
It had to be a bath.
You needed to properly unwind.
It had to be a bath.
"I was in a sitcom, Father Ted, which you know and I remember, we were shooting this episode with a friend of ours called Michael Redmond, you know Michael Redmond."
Wonderful comedian.
"Wonderful comedian, he looks great, he played this character called"
"Father Stone, and the episode was, the most boring priest of all time comes to stay, so he's the worst house guest you can imagine, so that's the episode."
The priests Father Ted and Father Dougal are trying to entertain him so we teach him to play golf.
That just keeps me...
That just keeps me remembering what I did before this.
Life hasn't changed a lot in terms of how I feel inside.
- It's just what happens outside.
- The exterior.
Those early inspirations that inspired you to want to sing and play and write.
Just a handful of people that you can think of off the top of your head who inspired you.
"The definite first one I talked about a lot when the album ""Bewilderbeast"" came out was Bruce Springsteen, and I made a conscious decision I would mention him because an artist with a career that long that was exposed to this country after ""Born In The U.S.A."", which was about the time I discovered him but not because of all the songs, but because of his '70s music really."
I had this romantic notion that I could transport myself back to that time and relive it.
Which is impossible to happen.
He became a massive figure in my life for two or three years.
That was the definite first person I could say was responsible.
I met Bruce actually and told him this story.
He seemed quite flattered.
Definitely without Bruce I don't think...
There's a good chance I might not have gone into music at all.
"What about at home, though?"
What about the bands that came from Britain?
It's a funny one.
"A lot of the British bands at the time, obviously Manchester was the big scene then and I lived about 10 miles out of Manchester, in Bolton."
It didn't grab me.
"I'm constantly criticized in Manchester for saying this, but I'm only telling the truth."
"It was something I was preempting, perhaps what my future would hold."
"It was something I was scared of, a huge scene."
I think a lot of bands suffered from it.
"Something like, further down the line that I could really take it in and understand what it was about and really like the music, like Happy Mondays, especially."
"The Roses, as well."
I'm a big fan of what lan Brown does now probably more so than then.
It's often the case with trends and what seems to be a scene at the time.
You find yourself coming back to it five years later or longer.
Once the hype dies down and music is rediscovered on its own merits and not being caught up in why people are wearing that outfit and why they're buying that record and why they're saying that lingo.
I think I was going through a phase.
"I do like Lowestoft, but I don't think it's got much opportunity for the next generation."
"At that other school I visited, there have been developments."
The day before I met Mr Marshall the
Government inspectors had gone in again and their verdict?
The school is out of special measures.
A sign of hope for the town.
It is difficult to feel pride and to feel like you belong to a school that is in special measures.
That is a clear label that things are not as good as they might be.
To have that removed is an enormously significant contribution to our forward journey.
"As I heard on the playground today, our students said, ""Things are improving"" and they say it with a smile and they are proud of the school that they attend."
That is as it should be for every child.
"Across town, on an industrial estate, you will find Harrod UK."
It grew out of the fishing industry.
"Ron Harrod used to buy old nets from fishermen and sell them to gardeners, that was 60 years ago."
"Today, it is run by his children and now it is a big international business."
"If you have ever watched a football match, you will have seen one of their nets."
The ladies over here are joining the nets.
These are football nets that they are working on here.
"We supply everyone from Wembley, Chelsea, Manchester United, all of the clubs."
This man knows a thing or two about Lowestoft's past.
"Like many here, he comes from a family of fisher folk. 20 years ago, he was made redundant from the fishing industry."
"He is not weeping about it, he says the success of Harrod UK is a sign of hope for the town."
"I came to Harrods in 1996, just as they were doing Euro 96."
We are pushing really hard to go forward.
"Not everybody sees that that still happens in Lowestoft, so places like this are, they are certainly my future and my colleagues' future."
A more positive approach would be good.
There is something that everyone in Lowestoft agrees on - it is difficult to be positive when it is so hard to get here and even harder to get around once you have arrived.
It is the most easterly point in the country as well.
"Once you get here, that is it."
There is nowhere else to go.
We have seen lots of industries close over the years and there's been very little new investment.
"I'm sure it is as a result of roads just to get here, they are so poor."
Or maybe someone else.
"If so, who?"
The politicians?
"It is about whoever is in power at the time, listening to what they have got to say, and finding a way to make that work for our community."
You are saying the fate of Lowestoft isn't going to be determined by the man in
"Westminster, or the man in Whitehall?"
Not at all.
"Some of the problems arise from people thinking that they are going to be our salvation, that we will sit and wait for the right Government at the right time to have the right policies to help breathe life into"
Lowestoft.
That is not going to happen.
That's not what I'm waiting for.
"It wasn't the gentleman in Whitehall who built this school, it was the gentleman in Ipswich, a local government project."
"The town had been through some very hard times, in particular with its economy, and there was a long history of children at the schools locally not doing as well as they could do."
The idea behind this one was to challenge some of those low expectations.
"I think the message to everyone that sees this building, and when you come up the drive and you see that this community has invested in all of this, that embodiment of hope is what helps inspire the children to do that"
little bit better.
"Whenever you film in a school, the head always wants you to talk to the brightest kids - fair enough - and these were bright."
They loved the school but they didn't have much hope for the future of the town.
"When you come to Lowestoft, and you are not from Lowestoft, you don't get the best vibes from it."
"It is quite gloomy, I think, would you agree with that?"
It is degrading the fact that the industry has gone and people sort of look on Lowestoft and think it's had its time and it's past and gone.
"I think it's a small town with big dreams, where you have to - we all look outside of the box and think what else is out there?"
"Everyone has given up with it already, outside the area as well."
"You always see, like, new shops opening and then a couple of months later they shut down."
Do you?
Do you all agree with that?
You don't?
Right.
What do you think?
Lowestoft is lovely.
I really like it here.
"We do seem like a friendly, welcoming community."
"It only lasted two days, and only really did two pieces of business."
"Day one - parliament replied to a letter from the King of France, who wanted the Scots to go with him on crusade."
"""Not just yet,"" said parliament, ""we're busy."""
Day two - parliament issued an open letter called The Declaration Of The Clergy.
"It's not a famous document, but it should be."
The Declaration Of The Clergy published for the first time the ideas that Scotland's bishops had borrowed from Duns Scotus.
"With great cunning, it wove into Scotland's recent history the idea that a king could be chosen, and it did it as though everyone should always have known that such a thing could be."
"The clergy and the ""people"", seeing the virtue of Robert the Bruce, had ""agreed"" upon him, and with ""their concurrence and consent"", he was raised to be king."
It's a very important document indeed.
It sounds almost revolutionary.
"But in 1 309, the ""people"" really meant the important people - the nobility, the clergy, the community of the realm, not the peasants or the drinkers down the pub."
"No, the declaration was written for the people, not by the people, because the people were meant to listen to it."
It was preached in churches.
"It was copied, shown around, repeated."
"It was the party line from Robert's faithful support and prop, the Scottish Church."
"The Declaration Of The Clergy was stage two in Robert's conquest of Scotland, an attempt to persuade the doubters, and there were still many, that Robert was indeed the rightful king."
This was good.
But was it good enough?
The sheer scale of the Bruce's task was becoming clear.
His kingship was still in question.
He was not a legend yet.
Three things needed to be done if he was going to make the throne safe for himself and for his male heir.
"One, he had to secure the loyalty of all of Scotland's nobles and eject the English from any significant holdings."
"Two, he had to force the English King to accept the independent status of his throne."
"And three, he had to father a male heir."
"He hadn't even finished task one, and his wife was still in English hands."
"So no chance of an heir, then, or not a legitimate one, at least."
"But before all of these things, he must become unquestionable."
He must become a legend.
"And for that, he would have to wait five years."
He would have to wait for Bannockburn.
"By the spring of 1 31 4, the Bruce had almost completed his first task."
"Shark fins, they're all dried, ready to go."
"Look, there's sea horses."
Goodness.Look at that.
They're perfectly dried.
What they do with these is they put them in a cooking pot and boil them in water for 3-4 hours and then they drink the water.
"Very, very popular, and millions of sea horses are traded around the world just for that."
"That's a tonic, but there are several dozen different animal products that are being traded for Chinese medicine."
"Things like tiger penises, rhino horns and it's such a huge volume."
"When you think of 1.5 billion people believing in this kind of medicine, demanding the products."
One of the key goals for conservation in years to come is to educate people in the far east not to buy these products.
If you can get rid of that demand then you'll start to solve the problem on the ground.
And it's not only the sea creatures that are under threat from the demands of Chinese traditional medicine.
"The pangolin, or scaly anteater, that lives in the forests of South East Asia is highly sought after for its reputed health giving properties."
"Many are caught, but this one is lucky."
It's going to be released by a park ranger into a protected reserve.
Can we just chat about it a little bit?
"I know a little cos funnily enough, we did the pangolin on QI."
"It's a mammal, isn't it?"
"People often think, ""Gosh, that must be a reptile,"""
"cos I think it's the only mammal covered in scales, isn't it?"
Large scales.
"These are made out of keratin like our fingernails, like rhino horns."
"People call them sometimes walking pine cones, which I think is a great description.That's very good."
"And unfortunately, it's rather delicious flesh, isn't it?"
Isn't there an issue with them being stolen from the wild for the plates of Chinese restaurants and other places around the world?
"Yes, one of the delicacies.And they're expensive and highly rated."
"People drink the blood as well, and they reckon these keratin scales are good for things like blood circulation and swellings, and then they boil them to get the scales off and eat the meat."
He's taken his whole face out of his...
Isn't that fantastic?
And how endangered is the pangolin?
Vulnerable?
"Well, they are a protected species."
"Again, there's a lovely acting choice there."
Is he slightly tongue-in-cheek as he comes back... with all these high romantic answers... or is he wonderfully youthfully naive with all these high romantic answers.
"How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb... and the place death, considering who thou art... if any of my kinsmen find thee here."
"With love's light wings I o'erperch these walls... for stony limits cannot hold love out... and what love can do, that dares love attempt."
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee... they will murder thee.
"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords."
"Look thou but sweet, and I am proof against their enmity."
"""My kinsmen will kill thee if they find thee here""..."
"""Alas, there lies more peril in thine eyes"" he says to her."
"They're wonderfully set off against each other, I think."
Of course when she lets go... with romantic commitment... itjust wipes him off the board.
"""My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep."
"The more I give to thee The more I have, for both are infinite."""
What a wonderful sentence.
What a wonderful sentence.
"Yep, the core and heart of the play, surely, surely."
"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
Th'exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it... and yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou with draw it?
"For what purpose, love?"
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
"My bounty is boundless as the sea, my love as deep."
"The more I give to thee the more I have, for both are infinite."
"Juliet is only just on the threshold of womanhood... a vulnerable child-like angel, wooed by a teenager... who is completely defenseless against the onslaught of emotions... he has never experienced until now."
But should such unfettered emotions... combined with such youthfulness... simply be accepted without a second thought?
Has Shakespeare issued a challenge and made us ask ourselves... should we feel uncomfortable at the extreme youth of the lovers?
I think that this is a question whose relevance today is indisputable... and one which we must confront.
"Where is she, and how doth she... what says my concealed lady to our cancelled love?"
"O, she says nothing, but weeps and weeps... and now falls on her bed, and then starts up... and ""Tybalt"" cries, and then on Romeo calls... and then falls down again."
At the end of the play the Prince says to the Friar:
"""We still have known thee for a holy man."""
Which implies that he will be pardoned.
But the Friar has still failed to secure what he wanted... except by very extreme means.
The Friar wanted to reconcile the two warring houses by the marriage.
"Well, it happened but not the right way."
This was always meant to be a tragedy... and Friar Lawrence is trying to turn it into a comedy.
Death of evil leaves us undeniably feeling thatjustice has been done.
"But the death of beauty, of love, ofjoy?"
We rail against it and Shakespeare knows... that in order for humanity to change its bigotry... intolerance and blind injustice... events must be shattering to the human mind and spirit.
He gives us twin suicides.
Does this fact secure the play's mythic status?
Three deaths.
Young people whose only crime was to love too strongly.
Paris must die for love of Juliet... she and Romeo for the love of one another.
Their suicides side by side in the cold vault... when they should have been warm in one another's embrace... leaves us horrified at the emotional bankruptcy of those... who should have protected them from themselves.
The death scene absolutely... fulfils expectations and gives the play... its necessary shape and indeed its mythic status.
"We know from the prologue... that this is a ""death-marked love""."
We know throughout the play... that this marriage in the tomb is where the play is heading.
"O my love, my wife!"
"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath."
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered.
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks... and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
The death scene of the two lovers is one of the most famous ones in Shakespeare.
And it's interesting to have a play with that and the balcony scene.
"Iconic scenes, scenes people know even if they don't know the play very well."
The lovers speak slightly differently in the scene in the tomb.
Romeo speaks more elaborately.
He has the extraordinary personification... of death as a rival lover.
"Somebody made a basket, it was his responsibility to point to the guy who made the pass at him."
"His approach was ""the guy that makes the pass is just as important, if not more important, than the guy that makes the bucket."""
"Not only were we encouraged, it was a requirement."
"I think some guys now do it just to be cool in the nba, but, man, that was a must."
Some players went so far as to thank the guy who made the pass to them who made the pass to the guy who got the bucket.
To them who made the pass to the guy who got the bucket.
"He used basketball to teach us the importance of saying ""thank you."""
"Unselfish and playing hard are 1 and 1, and if you're tired, you can't play hard."
"If you gave the ""tired"" signal, which is basically a fist in the air, he would substitute for you."
"And when you go to the bench, when you're ready, and when you go to the bench, when you're ready, you say ""coach, I'm ready,"""
and you put yourself back in the game.
"But if he took you out, and you didn't give the ""tired"" signal, because he didn't think you were playing hard,"
It may be a while before you got back in the game.
"The other thing I thought, and this is a little thing coach Smith had, one of your teammates then comes out of the game, you stand up, and you clap for him."
"You stand up, and you clap for him."
"And number 40, Bruce Buckley, steps in for Mike o'koren."
"You stand up, you give your teammate a standing ovation."
"Come on, who thinks of stuff like that?"
He did.
"Without question,"
Dean Smith's most identifiable innovation was the four-corners offense.
"Although he wasn't its originator,"
Smith was its most visible proponent.
"When he felt his team was overmatched,"
Dean would often call for the four corners
Dean would often call for the four corners at the start of the game.
It was designed to keep the ball out of the other team's hands.
"And, in an era without a shot clock, that would sometimes feel like an eternity."
Throw!
Duke decided not to come out and play us.
"They stayed back in the three-second area, bunched in a zone, and defied us to come and play."
"So, large portions of the game, one guy was standing there near the half-court line with the ball under his arm near the half-court line with the ball under his arm for minutes at a time."
"But the female is more determined, or more desperate."
"Having given so much already, she must make the kill."
This is a battle of life and death for them both.
The bison has no strength left.
The battle is over.
Winter deepens.
"The snow continues to accumulate, smothering the forest."
Some trees are loaded with three tonnes of snow.
"It shuts out what little light there is at these latitudes, and that shortens the growing season still further and limits how far north trees are able to grow."
"So, snow influences both the shapes of the trees and the extent of this forest."
"And it affects the animals, too."
SQUAWK!
It helps to have friends if you want to find food at this time of the year.
"Wolverines and ravens, a match made in the Taiga."
It's the hardest time of the year to find food.
But the wolverine knows that a raven's call is as good as a dinner bell.
And the raven has just recruited the best can opener in the forest.
"The moose carcass is frozen solid, but the wolverine has immensely powerful jaws, well able to deal with frozen food."
The raven's bill is more suited to leftovers.
The raven has to be patient.
A wolverine's appetite is legendary.
"According to folklore, it can eat more at one sitting than any other creature in the forest, hence its other name, the glutton."
"What the wolverine can't eat now, it stores in the deep freeze."
"It will bury these food parcels across the forest, planning ahead for leaner times."
"For a few, the snow is an ally."
"Voles stay active throughout the winter beneath the snow, despite the freezing temperatures above."
"Travelling along tiny corridors, they move from pocket to pocket of perfectly refrigerated food."
"Snow is a great insulator, so down here, the temperature never falls more than a degree or so below zero."
"And that's warm enough for a vole to thrive, even if it lacks the stature of a bison."
"In some years, vole numbers boom, and then they are forced to break cover to search for more food."
"The great grey owl is a silent and very skilful hunter, but deep snow can be beyond its reach."
But such snow is no barrier to one predator.
There were dead bodies all over.
"They fired right in to the crowd, the railroad thinks they're law around here."
They treat us like animals.
"I've seen men going down, women too."
I saw the boss man from the railroad.
"He looked like a Cossack, with his hat and his whip."
There was a whole load of railroad men packing pieces disputing the toss with the gaming boys.
A whole crew of them came out in to the street cutting up a ruckus.
"And I hear someone shout, open fire."
"I gave the orders to Jack Casement to clean up the town, when I spoke to him after a while, after the event, he says General, they all died with their boots on."
"And Joesrth has been quiet ever since, as far as I'm concerned the subject is now closed, we can get on with building a railroad."
"Lynch law had come to the Midwest, and it was here to stay."
But the prairies harboured a greater peril than gunmen and gamblers.
And it drew closer with every mile the railroad advanced to the west.
"Within six months of Dodge's arrival the Union Pacific had laid two hundred and fifty miles of track, worth five million dollars in government grants."
"Far to the west, after almost three years, the shopkeepers were still stuck in the mountains, just eighty miles from their start point."
The Chinese workers were at home on the perilous rock face.
But the gunpowder they were using was just not powerful enough.
With the other railroad racing across the prairies the shopkeepers desperately needed to force the pace.
Strobridge decided to try a dangerous experiment.
"It's safe enough, we have a chemist, an Englishman, fixes his stuff up on site."
"Nitro-glycerine, with eight times more power than gunpowder, but notoriously unstable."
"When he's mixed it, well you wouldn't want to go shaking the bottle."
"He say, they pull out seven bodies, some hands, some legs, a few men are still missing."
He say one of the dead man was his older brother.
"Our average daily progress is twelve inches, twelve inches a day that's how long it takes us to drill and blast through this rock."
We've got to do better than that.
"There's a lot of men buried under those rocks, good men."
Bury the stuff.
Now it's back to packed powder and twelve inches a day.
At this rate we'll be in Nevada by the end of the century.
The shopkeepers' dreams of riches were being buried on the slopes of the Sierras.
Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed... and batten on this moor?
Have you eyes?
"You cannot call it love, for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame... it's humble, and waits upon thejudgment."
And whatjudgment would step from this to this?
"O Shame, where is thy blush?"
When Hamlet deals with women... he to most people's minds deals with them very badly.
He deals badly with Ophelia... and he certainly deals roughly with his mother.
"In what he says about his mother's second marriage... her relationship with Claudius, there is something so vividly... graphically sexual that a lot of people have found that... so disturbing they need to find psychological explanations for it."
Good night:
but go not to my uncle's bed.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.
Refrain tonight... and that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence.
What shall I do?
"Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:"
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed...
"Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse... or for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck... with his damned fingers..."
Make you to ravel all this matter out... that I essentially am not in madness... but mad in craft.
Be thou assured... if words be made of breath and breath of life...
I have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me.
I must to England;
you know that?
"Alack, I had forgot."
'Tis so concluded on.
This fellow set me packing.
Some actors make him violent physically with his mother and... that isn'tjust some kind of generalized misogyny or what have you... it seems to me to be something in Hamlet that he is brought face to face with.
I think Shakespeare shows us that his own reactions to that killing... are to throw him into emotional turmoil.
I don't myself think it drives him mad... but it drives him perilously close to madness.
He certainly is in a very pent up state... when he gets to his mother's closet... and of course it is exacerbated by the appearance of the ghost... so I think when he is talking to his mother... all his pent up feelings come to the surface.
It is a most brilliantly written scene the way that Shakespeare... contrives language to give the impression... that we are actually in the mind of a man... is a brilliant technical feat.
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings.
You heavenly guards!
"For many, this scene... arguably the most famous in all of Shakespeare's works... contains the heart and core of the play."
It touches upon the central questions:
what engenders love and hate... driving the bearers of those emotions to such extremes of action.
"It is my lady, O, it is my love."
O that she knew she were!
"She speaks, yet she says nothing."
'Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all heaven... having some business... do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return.
I think the balcony scene is notjust the most famous scene in the play.
"If you say to somebody; ""What's your image of'Romeo and Juliet'?"""
They usually think of a balcony with the two lovers.
That's what's on the cigar labels after all.
But the balcony scene is the scene which is a point of change... for the two people we are most interested in... and it has a very interesting shape to it.
"Romeo and Juliet both begin... very tentative and she in particular, becomes clearer and clearer... about declaring herself in the course of the scene."
"The balcony scene is of course the central scene of the play... the heart of the play, yes I do think it is."
The lovers only really meet five times in the play anyway.
"The Capulet party scene, the balcony scene itself... the little scene at Lawrence's cell... the dawn parting and the final meeting... not quite simultaneous, in the tomb."
"But, yes the fervor, the commitment... the romanticism which we're also allowed to smile at... is the distillation of the mood of the play... in the balcony scene itself, I think."
"O Romeo, Romeo... wherefore art thou Romeo?"
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name... or if thou wilt not... be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet."
"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
"Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."
What's a Montague?
"It is not hand, nor foot... nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man."
"O, be some other name!"
What's in a name?
That which we call a rose... ny any other word would smell as sweet.
"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called... retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title."
"Juliet's marvelous practicality... and Romeo's, I suppose, utterly sincere... romantic absurdity in the scene... is tremendously enjoyable, I think."
"""The orchard walls are high and hard to climb."""
"""With love's light wings id I o'erperch these walls."""
"- Ay, sir;"
You did wish that I would make her turn:
"Sir... she can turn, and turn... and yet go on, and turn again;"
"and she can weep, sir, weep;"
And she's obedient.
Very obedient.
Proceed you in your tears.
"Concerning this, sir, O well-painted passion!"
I am commanded home.
Get you away;
I'll send for you anon.
"Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice."
"Hence, avant!"
Cassio shall have my place.
"And, sir, tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together:"
"You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus."
Othello is the victim of a number of overt racial slurs.
Of course Shakespeare wrote for a different society.
But how can a modern audience rationalize... the vicious nature of racial language in Othello.
For modern audiences the blackness of Othello... is very much complicated by modern social issues... by racial and social issues of the present day.
In some ways I think they are a help in the sense... that they mean that we are less likely perhaps than the Victorians were... to have any sort of prejudices against Othello... because of his race or because of his color.
There were such prejudices in earlier days... and some of the earlier critics of the play... felt that Shakespeare was quite wrong indeed... to present a black man who married a white woman in Desdemona.
This is not something that we are at all likely to feel nowadays.
Othello is an easy target for some of the basest... and worst kind of racial abuse.
"Now making him somebody who rises above... the pettiness of others is very important... and the difficulty nowadays and the danger in the play... but at the same time some of its excitement... is that for a black actor to play Othello... without seeming to endorse... the idea of black men being more angry, more passionate, more gullible... than people who aren't black gives the play an edge... but at the same time a degree of difficulty, of danger."
"It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul..."
"Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!"
It is the cause.
Yet I'll not shed her blood;
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow... and smooth as monumental alabaster.
"Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men."
"Put out the light, and then... put out the light:"
I liked the past.
"For many people, the present is clouded with disappointment."
It is hard whether for politics. -- weather.
"This is written large in the language of Lowestoft, day in and day out, these men of our fishing fleets braved the roughest of weather to gather the harvest of the sea..."
"A group of amateur film-makers, the Lowestoft Movie Makers, build this cinema, and they love a bit of nostalgia."
"Ivan is the town archivist, there is not much he does not know about Lowestoft."
"Now our turn comes, the nets are thrown over to gather the silver all."
"This is a town that has lost its way, like the mining towns and villages, the steel towns and villages, the fishing industry was the cultural glue that gave the town its identity, so the town is now looking desperately for another identity."
"My generation, we are a little bit responsible for holding the town back, too busy being nostalgic and looking backwards."
"By doing that, we are stopping the town being forward-looking?"
"I have got a little badge here that says, history matters."
Which is true!
But you have just been telling me that you cannot live in the past.
But the future is more important.
"The few fishermen who remain fished the way that men have built for millennia, lines slung over the sides of the boat with baited hooks."
It is a hard way to make a living.
"Morning, Steve!"
Only ten boats remain.
"They are small inshore vessels, no more than ten metres long, like this one, Georgi Girl."
"Meet the skipper, Steve, one of Lowestoft's last."
"We always hope for a good catch, there is not many of us left now."
Our family has been fishing this coastline for generations now.
We are struggling to keep it going.
"How is it that you can manage to make a reasonable living, then?"
"It is because we are small and we are a family, and we keep the expenses down."
"Steve did not catch any fish on this trip, a vicious zero easterly wind made BC to rough, but the weather is not his real enemy. -- northeasterly made the sea."
The herrings now come to the attention of an army offshore workers.
"If you want to get some idea about how much things have changed, then come to the fish market on Lowestoft. -"
- Lowestoft quay.
"In the past, they would be shifting 30 or 40 tonnes, today they will be reread that the two ships two."
"Ten, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60!"
"This place was once the town's beating heart, buzzing with sailors, doctors and merchants cutting deals."
Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous... and keeps thee here in dark to be his Paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee.
Time and time again through the play... the idea of death as Juliet's lover is presented.
"When Romeo arrives at the tomb... he is talking about her beauty... which is still unspoiled... by, as he takes it, as he thinks, I mean the irony is that... of course she's still beautiful because she isn't dead."
"But he thinks that death has got her in that tomb, in that grave... to be his ""paramour""."
That insubstantial dead is amorous.
"It's a strange and strong disturbing idea right through the play... but ""Romeo and Juliet"" is operating in something of this territory... it seems to me, throughout."
"""Thus with a kiss I die"", Romeo's last words."
And the last action of Juliet... is to push the dagger into her body.
And the dagger as a phallic symbol is a constant in European Literature.
The consummation of love in the grave... is where the play has been going from the beginning and it's where it ends.
"There is no other destination, I think the mythic status of the play... depends on that disturbing equation."
O churl!
"Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after?"
I will kiss thy lips.
"Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, to make me die with a restorative."
Thy lips are warm.
"But you know, to meet, to love... to be separated by a horrible accident... to imagine that you are going to meet again and to die."
"I mean, what more typical version of the human journey... do you want than the story of this play."
It's all there.
O happy dagger...
This is thy sheath!
There rust... and let me die.
"Here in Stratford upon Avon, the home of William Shakespeare... it is very difficult to escape hearing the name of Hamlet."
"Hamlet mugs and tee-shirts are best sellers in the gift shops... quotations from the play adorn tea-towels... diaries, pens, shop signs, books."
"The focus on this play by the tourist trade, isjust one indication... of how important Hamlet has traditionally been, to western culture."
"Apart from the Bible, Hamlet is the most quoted work... in the English language."
"Hamlet is a young prince, driven to despair... by his mother's hasty marriage to Claudius, his uncle."
"Hamlet subsequently learns, from his father's ghost... that Claudius is the man who murdered his father."
The story of the play deals with Hamlets vow for revenge... and the complexities of his relationships with others... because of this vow.
The exact date at which Hamlet was written is open to conjecture.
The massacre at Plum Creek spread panic throughout the railroad.
The march westward came to a dramatic halt.
Meanwhile up in the mountains the shopkeepers confronted their own killers.
"Frequent avalanches swept all before them equipment, track and men."
They were blowing out tree stumps and a portion of snow fell on them.
"I don't know how many are dead, we don't keep track of them."
To tell you the truth I don't know who they are when they're alive let alone when they're dead.
We're sending the bodies back to China.
Well that's the deal we had with the agents.
They got a right to be buried where they came from.
That's about all we can do.
As blizzards swept across the mountains the shopkeepers floundered in the drifts.
The death toll rose even higher.
Down on the prairie Dodge too was counting his dead.
Seven bodies were recovered from the train wreck at Plum Creek.
"This is a savage useless waste of life, if it continues at this present rate we'll have no one left to build a railroad."
In the wake of the killings the railroad was in constant fear of attack.
Workers were ordered to carry guns at all times.
"For Dodge, a veteran of the conflict between the states, this war had become personal."
"I've fought in the late conflict, I saw many good men killed and wounded."
Never did I see anything to cause me to hate my enemy.
I have seen what they do when they kill a man.
"This is a different kind of war, there is no room in this land for us and them and that's about it."
For Dodge nothing must stand in the way of the railroad.
He began a process that would lead to one of the bloodiest chapters in American history.
Dodge used the power of the railroad to launch a war of annihilation.
"To fight it the government sent in one of the most ruthless generals in the Federal Army, William Tekomsay Sherman."
"Sherman, the man who raised Atlanta to the ground and burned a swathe through Georgia to win victory in the civil war."
"I have six companies of cavalry, and General Custer is coming from the Smoke Hill route."
The more Indians we can kill today the fewer will have to be killed in the next war.
"But the more I see of them the more I am convinced that they will all have to be killed, or maintained as a species of pauper."
"We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux and the Cheyenne, to the point of their very extermination."
"It's the force that yanks the car, the people, and the tennis ball... indifferent to their mass, back down to Earth at the same rate."
"Oh, that's a fantastic ride."
"I mean, feeling oneself drop is amazing."
But what's really great is dropping the ball... and seeing it floating above my face.
"Now--l mean, it's falling."
I know it's falling... but I'm falling at exactly the same rate.
It doesn't matter how massive something is.
"It falls, under the force of gravity, at exactly the same rate."
Thanks to experiments like this... we now know that objects all fall at the same rate.
But what would it take to launch a cannonball into orbit?
"When the famous British physicist Sir Isaac Newton... saw the apple fall that, some say, hit him on the head... it changed the world."
You got the apple falling from the tree... and he looks up and sees the Moon in orbit around the Earth... and judges that not only is the apple falling to Earth... so too is the Moon.
But could the Moon really be falling?
Load!
By thinking of a cannon and the trajectory of the ball it shoots...
Newton used math to unlock a cosmic mystery.
"It came in his landmark publication, ""Principia Mathematica,"" in 1687."
"Isaac Newton has a famous drawing... and in it, he draws a planet and a little mountain."
There's a little projectile first kicked off the mountain... and it falls down a little bit.
"You give it more speed, it goes a little farther out."
Now say you could just increase the force all you wanted.
"It can go fifty miles, it can go a hundred miles before it fell."
By adding more gunpowder and withjust the right angle offire... a cannonball can be made to go faster and farther.
"Inevitably, however, gravity wins... pulling the cannonball back down to Earth."
"The Earth is round and not flat, so Newton realized... that if the cannonball is fired at sufficient speed... the cannonball would actually go into orbit."
"For that to happen, Newton determined... the ball would need to be shot out of the cannon... at17,500 miles an hour."
It starts curving around the Earth... and he realized that there must be a speed... where it goes completely around the Earth... and hits you in the back of the head... never actually hitting Earth's surface.
"And ifyou duck, it'll just keep going... and lo and behold, you have an orbit."
But why doesn't the Moon fall to Earth?
The Moon also has some sideways motion... so for every little bit that it falls down... it also moves off in this direction... and the sum of all those motions is an orbit around the Earth.
Newton also realized that the Earth is in a giant freefall around the Sun.
"With gravity forging the path, our planet rounds the Sun... like an endless cosmic roller coaster ride."
The Sierra Nevada rises to over fourteen thousand feet.
Settlers from the east had to cross this final barrier in to California by wagon train.
Lost in this mountain vastness many of the early pioneers had died of cold and hunger.
Others resorted to cannibalism to survive.
It's the strongest case we could have for building a railroad.
I mean tens of thousands of people have died trying to cross this country by wagon train.
God there has to be a better way.
No one had ever attempted to build a railroad this high.
But the shopkeepers had one major asset.
Theodore Judah was the greatest railroad engineer in America.
"But his plans to build a railroad over the Sierras had earned him a new title, Crazy Judah."
"Well if it's crazy to say that a locomotive can climb a mountain I stand condemned and you may have me let off and confined to an asylum but, but you know a railroad can go where a man or a mule can not,"
provided you find the right route for it.
When an engineer looks at a mountain he sees a series of loops and curves that follow the contour rather like a river.
"There will be obstacles of course that they require a bridge or a tunnel and, well I, I've calculated that we will need up to, well fifty bridges between here, just to get up to the summit and then some thirteen or fourteen tunnels."
Judah had drawn the route through the Sierras.
"The hundred and twenty miles over some of the toughest terrain in the world, reaching a height of seven thousand feet."
But others had to build it.
That would require thousands of men and tonnes of gunpowder.
"To lead the workforce Crocker hired the toughest construction boss on the west coast,"
James Harvey Strobridge.
Strobridge who had lost his eye in a powder blast enforced a crew discipline backed by a pick axe handle he used as his persuader and a legendary profanity.
"Come on now get your ass up there, let's go."
"Come on get a move on that wagon there, for Christ's sakes."
Come on.
"He has a way of persuading people to see his point of view, that's what I hired him for and that's what he does."
"Alright let's go, come on now get this stuff up the hill, let's go."
Come on get it up here.
"Be careful, spark and we're all gonners."
Now watch what you're doing there now.
"You Irish bastard, get your god damn ass down here and bring me up that wagon, you're dirty piece of shit."
"Now come on, fill this thing up, let's go."
"A happy life's long years will prove, that I am worthy of her hand."
"All these years should be able to tilt the balance of judgment, because on the other side of the balance lies only a quick moment's light weight."
"When I saw that screaming girl in the robber's saddle, it was as if I had seen Her."
"At the bottom of a stone pit, lying on dirty straw, with broken bones, tossing around feverishly, I found out that the fruit of revenge had matured."
"The bull-headed Knight's children drew me into a trap, to punish me for their father's death."
No one has ever seen me afraid.
This is more a disease than a virtue.
"But I dreaded that girl, the bull-headed Knight's daughter."
"I, who always longed for pure love, did not know, that this hell of lust and wild passions can burn in the human soul."
The horror and desire to escape multiplied my strength.
I broke out of my jail.
"Perhaps it's not too late, perhaps that girl is still waiting for me, I was hoping."
"It is not possible that for one single fault, the heavenly judge would strike me with such a blow!"
I could hold her in my arms for a few moments.
"A few moments of happiness, while an autumn leaf falls to the ground, while a snowflake melts from the heat of our hand into a water droplet."
"Fate gave this much to me, for a whole life."
Her husband came in.
"My brave fellow champion, and raised his dirty hand on her."
"I would have crumbled him into small pieces, had she not stepped in between us."
"I know, she protected me from the grime, rather than this bastard worm, who, while I was away, stained my name with slimy slander."
The shameful!
"I murdered again, I murdered him anyway."
"""It's a knight's duty to get revenge for the offense taken on a weak lady"", this was my excuse."
While in reality I just wanted to sweep away with my sword the barrier that rose up between us.
"And she, this pure soul, horrified by the idea of blood stained happiness, measured my deed on the balance sheet of conscience."
We were both struck by her cruel verdict.
She rejected me.
I was hoping to find peace of mind in the solitude of a cloister.
I joined as a fellow servant.
"There was no inferior, beastly work, which I did not undertook with humility, to punish myself."
"The king's wife, the dim daughter of the Emperor was summoned by the Creator."
"Our king did not want to stay widowed for a long time, he was looking for the consolation of a new woman."
"But in 2015, there is a real fear that he -- the fish market's days are numbered."
"The guts have been ripped out of this town by successive politicians not getting a good deal for Great Britain, and consequently we have now got a market that is 100 the size it was and we have got no"
fishermen left.
They are more red and the fish themselves now. -- rare than.
"If Ukip has a heartland, it may well be here."
The party wants to be free of the European Union.
"These people want to be free of its fisheries policy and its regulations, which they say can mean half the fish they catch having to be thrown back again."
June runs the auction.
What is real left in this country?
"In the world, what is real?"
"My fishermen are real, they go out, how many men and for their fish or their food?"
"There is no hunters left, they hunt, a brave men, different breed, they have got to stay."
This is why Steve is so worried about fishing.
"He has got two young boys, and they both want to go to see, just like their father and their grandfather. -- go to sea."
"Well, I am going to be a fishermen for our family, so I can make some money. -- fisherman."
I heard that most of the people my age get to learn how to be a skipper.
"I have been fishing with Add a long time, well, as long as I can remember. -"
- Dad.
I have always wanted to do a job that involves the sea.
"I am a fisherman, I always have been, I am proud of that, but I have hoped that I was going to catch some fish, every time I went to sea."
"You can cope with the early mornings and a freezing cold, but not with throwing half the catch back to sea when you have got bills to pay and kids to feed."
"It is terrible, really, terrible."
It is all down to politicians.
"At the moment I feel like I shall not benefit anybody, I am thoroughly disillusioned with all manner of politicians, yeah."
That is how I feel.
"I will probably change my mind, but at the minute I do not think there is any of them that worthy of vote. -- that are worthy of the vote."
"They call this Ness Point, as Far East as you can go and still be in"
Britain.
"They are proud of that distinction, but you pay the price for this in globalisation, unless you have something to special to offer."
Towns like Lowestoft can be forgotten.
"Life was hard in many ways when I was a young man, luxuries we take for granted today simply did not exist, but we knew things would get better."
"We expected to get a job when we left school and earn enough to buy a house, and we could see the country changing for the better, becoming a more tolerant place."
"Men, women and children."
For Sherman there would be no compromise and no mercy.
The first task was to hunt down the Cheyenne war party that had attacked the train at Plum Creek and killed the seven men.
"A number of prisoners were taken, one of them a Cheyenne warrior called Porcupine, he gave a first hand account of the incident."
"We said among ourselves now the white people have taken all we had, we are to do something."
If we can throw these wagons off the iron they run upon and break them open we should find what is in them and can take whatever might be useful to us.
"We cut down one of the big sticks that stand by the track, and just before sundown we tied it to the rails and sat down to watch what would happen."
"Then looking east we saw small light close to the horizon, someone said the morning star has risen."
We sent men on the best horses along the track to yell and shoot in the hope that they might frighten it.
But it kept going until it hit the sticks we had put on the track.
The railroad is death to us.
When the people hear the sound of the bell on the iron horse they mourn.
It is the signal that the life they have known is over.
It was over.
Sherman and the army would drive the native Americans out of the path of the railroad.
Every mile further west would be laid over the grave of their homeland.
"Dodge's Union Pacific was now in Wyoming, five hundred miles from its start point."
While in the mountains the shopkeepers were approaching the highest point of their route across the Sierras.
"They were now running trains high in to the mountains, helped by the invention of small pilot wheels or bogeys that enabled the locomotives to twist and turn with the contours of the track."
As they climbed the mountain threw more obstacles in their path.
The route was severed by deep chasms.
Too deep for conventional bridges.
"So the engineers built wooden trestles, hundreds of feet tall."
The largest wooden structures ever built.
But the worst problem was above the snow line.
"This winter we had forty four snow storms, varying from a small squall to a two week blizzard."
"February 18th we had six feet of snow, the drifts had measured up to fifty feet."
You can't build a railroad under fifty feet of snow.
And you sure as hell can't run a train through it.
For six months of the year the track was blocked with snow.
The engineers had a solution.
To run the trains under the snow.
"I can't believe I deserve to have her, really, and then Oscar comes along and, God bless him, he's just finding his feet, he's only a month old."
"He's shaping up well, as well."
"It must touch me in some way, but when I write music it's touched by all sides of my life, so it's very hard to distinguish whether it's that thing or this thing."
"When I write, it tends to be my relationship between me and the guitar is the most important factor."
Occasionally those outside things creep in.
You went to Los Angeles to record the album with Tom Rothrock who's an inspired collaborator with Beck and Elliot Smith.
What did you learn from working with him as a producer?
"Tom was an inspired choice by me, to credit myself."
"It was a shot in the dark, really."
I didn't know where he lived.
"I didn't know what he was doing, or whether he even knew who I was."
"And I thought, partly because of the Beck comparisons I've always had..."
"I thought, ""Well, sod it, why don't I give them what they want?"""
"""I'll go and work with Beck's guy and prove that I'm nothing like Beck."" Because I want to be my own artist and I'm sure Beck does."
"Beck's a genius, or close to it."
You've proved that point.
When you listen to the work you've done with Tom and the work Beck's done with Tom and even Elliot Smith...
They're very unique musicians.
"There's some affinity because we're all men, solo artists, and we all sing and write songs."
"A very tenuous thread, though."
A very tenuous thread.
"You've been open with people so far, about this record."
"Normally, I don't like to go too far ahead of myself or with whoever I'm talking to about the next record beyond, but you seem keen to talk about it."
"You've been working on this for a bit, now, and you told me upstairs you've got 17 songs."
"Yeah, when I was doing the press and interviews for ""About a Boy"" again, I'm somebody who prides himself on being honest and I couldn't not mention the fact that I'm in the middle of the next record because it's on my mind, really."
"To let people know what I'm thinking because when I'm asked questions about the soundtrack even when I've done the odd few little gigs, recently I'm struggling to remember lyrics, because I'm 17 songs into the next album with another 20 that are in my head that I haven't tried to record yet and it's pretty terrifying to try and remember words to something I've just finished..."
"Oh, the horror!"
The horror of being prolific.
"It's not really prolific, because half the songs are crap."
"- I think we'll be the judge of that, son."
- Prolifically crap.
"What I've worked out with working with Tom Rothrock and the methods that we've achieved is that I know, for a fact, I can make an album in six weeks from initializing it to mixing it."
"You're not safe either. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your dish was confused,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bizarre.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's almost like you're trying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to outsmart your competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"You can bamboozle every amateur &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;behind you, but you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;cannot bamboozle us three,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
let me tell you.
"Sorry, chef."
I just didn't...
This is my first time cooking a risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stay there.
Based on that risotto...
The person leaving is...
Dave Mack.
Ohh. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your time is done&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please bring your apron&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on your station&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and leave the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
Thank you.
"Thank you, chef."
"I'm disappointed, but, at the same time,"
I'm glad I got to compete at this level.
The judges did make a mistake by sending me home.
I have a lot of creativity.
Thank you very much.
What can you say?
"You know, hope for the best, plan for the worst."
Tali.
"You have dodged that bullet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but, Tali, you are flying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by the seat of your pants.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Back on your station. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Whew!
That's the sigh of relief.
"I dodged the biggest bullet of my life, and..."
I don't want to be in that position again.
"(Announcer) Next time on &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's the first team challenge of the season..."
Yeah!
(Announcer) And the surviving home cooks are going to war. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Hit the deck!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) Each team will battle it out to feed America's heroes.
Get a grip and wake up!
(Announcer) And the losers will go head to head in a pressure test...

We have 1 million kinds of singing every person in Nubba sings in his own way

The first upper Egyptian poem
""" I found my Grandma before the oven"
She was looking after its flame
She caught a sight of me
"She asked:""what's the wrong with you, son?"""
Why I see concern killing you?
Why I see sadness inside your eyes full long times
And your voice...
Is missing!
"I said:"" O mommy my body is ailing"
And my heart is moaning loudly
If my scream comes out
Will makes farms forget its green color!
Then I crouched
I crouched beside her as usual
And told her everything inside my heart
I asked her many questions
The answer
The answer
The sentry makes fun of the minister
But my conscious grandma understood my words
"Then she told me ""O son"
"It was me who marched out to ""Abdel Nasser"""

We turned my living room into a big dance floor
- Wow!
[Indistinct muttering]
We've now chosen three dishes that stood out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Really stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first person we'd like&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is...
You know that you want to call my name.
"Please, please, call my name."
Ryan.
Let's go.
[Applause]
I'm really not surprised that my plate is one of the top dishes.
These other cooks are gonna have to step up their game if they're gonna want to compete with me.
The next person we'd like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go, Samantha.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
I was one of the only people that decided to do something truly new.
I think a lot of people are gonna be jealous of me.
The third person... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please come down...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Scott. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
My mind is just racing.
I know that I wasn't 100% proud of this dish.
It was not executed properly.
Congratulations.
"I mean, your three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you, chef."
Thank you.
You managed to cook what we think are the worst three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of this mystery box challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Listen carefully. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This season,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we've rewritten&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the rule books,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so none of you should ever get&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;too comfortable&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this kitchen,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because we could ask you to leave at any time, starting now."
What?
(Becky) We're all gobsmacked.
We just can't believe it.
It's crazy to me.
"And I'm just like, what the heck is gonna happen now?"
"Okay, we'll taste all three dishes."
Whoever we decide has plated the absolute worst dish will be handing back their apron.
"Ryan, bring your dish up to the station, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Ryan) I made a balsamic, rum-glazed duck breast with some caramelized bananas."
Are you proud of this?
It ties right together.
"Andy Puckett, Ph.D., Director of Planetarium &amp;amp; Visualization Theatre:"
And that's the beauty of the College of Arts and Sciences.
It really exposes you to ideas and ways of thinking that you wouldn't necessarily have been exposed to.
"Jocelyn Krebs, Ph.D. Biology Professor:"
"Especially for undergraduates, it's really important to get a balance of science and liberal arts education."
I was a Creative Writing major before I became a scientist.
And you can't be a successful scientist without being able to write.
Narrator:
The College of Arts and Sciences:
"Biology, Literature, Geology,"
"Music, Philosophy, 37 different programs that together create a balanced, well rounded education."
"Alvin Amason, Native Arts Program Director:"
"I personally don't care if they are an Arts Major, or Anthropology or something close to that."
I think that what they can pull out or identify with in our program will help them through all their endeavors.
All that education is very important to be well rounded
"Xio Owens, CAS-Alumni:"
"As I've gone through my educational career,"
I've also found so many opportunities that
I never would've thought were there.
But they're right here.
"You know, in my hometown, in my home state."
"Steven DeLoose, CAS, Theater Student:"
I was looking around the country at some prestigious schools:
"University of Virginia, University of Michigan, places like that."
And I decided to come to UAA.
And I would not change it for the world.
"Chris Barnett, CAS-Biology Graduate Student:"
It's been a great benefit for me to be able to stay here and to be able to do world-class biomedical research and get papers published.
"Steve Johnson, Director of Seawolf Debate Team Associate Professor:"
"The Opportunites that exist here are just outstanding because we are a relatively new state, because we are a relatively young university, because we embrace that ethos of Alaska so intimately in what it is we do."
Narrator:
That's hazelnut and walnuts.
"Next to it, some tapioca maltodextrin."
I wanted to give it a little bit of...
"You know what it is, it's garbage is what it is. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What you did on that dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is inappropriate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and ultimately kind of disgusting."
"Congratulations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The cranberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the nuts, the gooseberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; already just unheard of in a risotto."
That is a disaster.
[Whispers]
"Oh, dear. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Damn.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Serve us your best.
Anybody.
[Whispers]
"Damn it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Last but not least,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Dave Mack.
"I'm looking at my dish, the plating and everything was fantastic."
"My dish came out exactly how I wanted, and I feel very confident."
"What we have here is some morel mushrooms, some portobello mushrooms."
"Used some veal stock, a sauvignon blanc."
Did you wash the mushrooms?
I didn't wash them out completely.
"If they're not rinsed super well, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;especially the morels,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it's like a dirt sponge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you taste that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and it's just gritty.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It's just really bad.
Don't grab a morel. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why do you tell me&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to avoid?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm here to eat the dish or should I eat selectively?
As you wish.
[Utensils clatter]
A little too sandy for me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Big mistake.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Guys, some basic stuff &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;like feeding us sand&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and things like that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; not good."
I screwed up.
But I hope that they're able to see through that and still see my culinary greatness.
"We tasted some fantastic risottos and, sadly, some disastrous risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We now need to come up&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with a decision."
(Announcer) The judges must now decide which home cooks are the bottom three.
"From these, one more person will be sent home tonight."
This is a subspace of L2 from -1 to 1.
"And it is a subspace spanned by polynomials of degrees of 0, 1, 2 to up to N-1."
"There is a self-evident naive basis, mainly sk is equal to tk, k going from 0 to N-1."
This naive basis is not orthonormal and can be quite badly behaved when N becomes large.
"Our goal will be to approximate vector x, which is sin t over this sub-space, so sin t does not belong to P3, so we have to find the orthonormal projection of sin t over this sub-space P3."
"From the basis s k, we can build an orthonormal basis using something called the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure that you're probably familiar with from linear algebra."
"So, you take the original set s k and you derive the orthonormal set u k using an algorithmic procedure which is given in steps below."
"At each step k, you first derive p k as s k minus the projection on to the previous orthonormal set."
"And then, you renormalize p k into u k by simply dividing by its norm."
"Let us see the Gram-Schmidt procedure on a set of two vectors s 0, s 1."
"So, they are obviously not orthonormal to each other."
"So first, we normalize s 0 into p 0 divided by its norms, that gives you u 0, which is of length 1, it's the blue vector."
"Then, we compute the projection of s 1 onto the subspace, using u 0, so that's u0 inner product with s 1 times u 0."
"Then, we subtract this from s 1: that gives us p 1."
"And finally, we normalize p1 into u1 which is the blue vector."
"Now, we have two vectors that span the same space and are orthogonal to each other."

Pray...
For every prophet delivered his message
For every messenger completed his message
And for every faithful one of us believe in his religion
Pray for your chosen prophet
And I don't fabricate excuses
I am not a religious broker as well
My words aren't Logarithm
Nor secrets
For God's sake let's pray
Let's pray special pray
"Just like us ,Has an origin, thought, and meaning"

His voice in our injured nation brings us together
By his cameo will heal every foreign

My name is Sary Sameer
Slang poet
And traveling
This is what I'm talking about
That Egypt has hundreds of things
Excuse me for this tension
(Folklore) existed in Egypt
The journey started 3 years ago
As a result of writing special poem
For my passion about the southern culture
I kept studying until I wrote it
Then I went on my journey
For the whole southern culture
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
Welcome to Boston Aikikai.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TACClOLl:
Here we are in Chinatown.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
The dojo itself started in July 2010.
"So, when the group started then, we were in the basement of the community center in Roslindale."
"Then, we moved to Chinatown, where we've been for the past two years."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PARKER:
"But no matter what, you know how there's a saying, ""home is where the heart is?"" That's like what I feel about our dojo."
"It doesn't matter, like, where we are -- it's the people in it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;EBATA:"
"For the new dojo, it means more time."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAClOLl:
Keep learning with Vu Ha Sensei and the rest of the students.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
People who enjoy or love aikido or martial arts can come together in their own space and kind of... be with other people who have the same kind of passion or enjoyment of that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;GONGVATANA:
"I think at some point, you know, there's not going to be any more dust and we won't have to wear a mask while practicing."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TAWA:
Just to train every day.
That's something that I've wanted to do for a long time.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Now we have an opportunity to have our own space, which is what we're trying to work on."
"This is our project, getting this new space."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PERRlNS:
"I like having a dedicated space, where we have the freedom to practice outside of scheduled classes."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;HA:
[VO]
"Boston Aikikai is made up of members: we might have a nice space and all, but the dojo is the people who come and practice."
So whatever that number divided by 2.
"So the pulley itself, the acceleration of the pulley is half of this number, which is 1.59 meters per second squared to the right."
"I know this was a fairly difficult problem and the key realizations though, I think that you had to discover or realize in order to be able to do this was a couple of things."
"One, that the acceleration of this pulley is half the acceleration of the block, or the acceleration of the block is double the acceleration of the pulley."
You have to realize that.
And then you just have to work out the net horizontal forces and realize well the only thing pulling on this block is friction going backwards and tension of the rope to the right.
And that same tension of the rope is constant throughout this wire or through this rope.
"And on this pulley, and this might not be something that you had already realized about pulleys, but now you will, is that since the rope essentially goes around the pulley, it's pulling twice on the pulley."
"And the tension's constant, so it's pulling with a tension of"
T on the top and the bottom.
"And if you realized those things, then it's just a"
little bit of algebra to get the acceleration of the block and the acceleration of the pulley.
"Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you too much."
I would call this a five star problem if you would see this type of problem on physics competitions.
"So if you know how to do this, you're doing well, at least as far as tension and ropes and friction are concerned."
I'll see you in the next video.

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
"Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance"
"Another heartache, another failed romance"
"On and on, does anybody know what we are living for"
"I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now"
"I'll soon be turning, round the corner now"
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on [guitar solo]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
"I can fly, my friends"
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show (show must go on)
"I'll top the bill, I'll overkill"
I've got to find the will to carry on
On with the
Show (show must go on) The show must go on
"So in this last module, since we're talking about the writing process."
"I want to make sure to just give a few last tips for the very final draft,"
But the corpses around me piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
And when I awoke in my hospital bed
"And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was dead"
Never knew there were worse things than dying
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
To the green bushes so far and near
"For to hang tent and pegs, a man needs two legs"
No more waltzing Matilda for me [instrumental]
"So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed"
And they shipped us back home to Australia
"The legless, the armless, the blind, and insane"
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
"But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared"
Then they turned their faces away
And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
"And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march"
Reliving the dreams of past glory
And I see the old men all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
"And the young people ask me, ""What are they marching for?"""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
Because why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules
That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
"If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead"
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
"Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall"
"Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol"""
That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life
"I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time"
We are born to defend each other's heart
We are born to love this person
Born to have the day with you.....
We are ready to move in together...
Ready for a journey together...
"Hold our dreams, hopes, and hearts into each others' hands"
Where are you?
And who you are?
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you... you really exist in my faith
We are born this way.... to be each other's soul mate
This is the instruction from above
Bestowed to us and across in someday this life...
We are born to defend each other's heart

Here is seems to be a problem of not enough data and not a very good smoothing algorithm.
"We have to want until next week to see, but it's, it's kind of clear to many of us that perhaps this larger arrangement, the network, the environment as a network might be greatly influencing the kinds of resource dependencies as well as the kinds of meaning."
Making and sense making that go on between firms in that environment.
Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
Across every ocean
For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you
"I can't say no, I can't say yes"
I can't even write down my own address
"I can't touch Heaven, it's a little too far"
It's the only way to travel
Got dreaming on a par
I'm staring through the window
Wondering where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every nation
From the harbor to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state
They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no to you
"I can't stand up, I can't stand still"
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense
That dish belongs to...
Felix. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Congratulations.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Bring your dish down please, darling."
(Felix) It's a huge validation.
This is definitely one of the proudest moments that I've had in my life. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come and stand over here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I'm trying to just be humble and, like, you know, keep my composure, but I don't think that Felix deserved to win."
Which sucks.
I'm so bummed.
Great job.
Really good job indeed.
"(Felix) I did a Chinese five-spice seared duck breast, and I did a sauce for it, and eggplant and sweet potato chips."
Phenomenal execution.
Very nice.
"The sauce and everything on the plate really worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) We recognized it immediately as being&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; restaurant-quality, and the flavor &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is fantastic.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Felix)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix is now a frontrunner.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The competition is on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"So, Felix, for winning today's mystery box challenge, you're coming with us to find out your huge advantage &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in the next challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go."
"Well done.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) As the winner of the mystery box challenge,"
Felix is now the first home cook to enter the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; pantry.
"Here, Felix is in control of the first elimination test."
Each elimination test will see at least one person
leave the competition.
(Felix) I'm surrounded by the most amazing fresh produce.
It was the most beautiful pantry I had ever seen in my life.
(Announcer) Felix now gets to choose the style of food or the dish that everyone must cook.
"However, the one thing she cannot control is the theme of the challenge."
That is in the hands of the judges.
"Today, you'll be cooking one of our three most intimidating dishes."
I'm down.
"Even though I was practically raised on it, it's a dish that intimidates me because it's so difficult to execute."
And it's a dish that takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen and my mother's kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is Italian risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"And risotto refers not only to rice, but the technique involved in making it."
"Because, as opposed to steaming it or boiling it, we saute it."
"There is one dish that always gives me the chills, because you can't hide behind adding different little touches &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and ingredients&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and garnishes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"#The sun, it shines on everyone."
"One, two, three,"
"#The sun, it shines on everyone."
Again.

"In the last June 30, numbers of Egyptians went down on the streets of cairo and other cities to protest against the first elected Egyptian president Morsi"
The army interfered and did a coup against Morsi depending claiming that its decision was a respond to the call of the huge number of protesters on the street as army claimed and their numbers varied
Army used a military chopper to take footage for the protests and market it to the media and the world
And the number of the against President Morsi protesters were like stock market exchange
The numbers race (variations) posed mathematical questions before being political
Some used Google Earth to investigate
"Out of the ordinary, Google made a statement to deny all these claims"
"Wael Fakharany, the regional manager of Google said"
"""All the statistics that were cited to Google about the protest in june, 30th or pro president Morsi are fake"" without going into too much mis-claims about the number of protesters"
"Analysts, specialists and some western media websites tried to use the technology of Google Earth"
"Not to count numbers but to measure the area, hence the capacity of the streets and squares to carry the protesters"
"They found that the space of Tahrir square is at most 53,000 square meters"
You are not alone.
I will be with you.
"Then, Jesus's commandment is:"
"""Go and make disciples."""
"So, Jesus has disciples."
Jesus wants christians.
"And so, the confusion in this verse,"
"I can't talk about the whole book, but at least in this verse, the confusion is there."
"""I do not wish to make you christians."""
Because Jesus WANTS people to become christians.
"A christian, a disciple, a disciple of Jesus."
"""Polak's Question:"
"Round 3"""
Earlier at the UN COmmission on Narcotic Drugs
"In 2008 Vlenna, Frederick Polak, a Dutch psychiatrist asked Antonio Maria Costa, HEAD of UNODC a simple question:"
"How does Costa explain the fact that the cannabis consumption levels are not higher in the Netherlands than in the neighboring countries, although in the Netherlands cannabis is available for consumption by adults?"
"Costa silenced his ""NGO Partner."""
"Embarrassed by our video, he decided to make his first official visit . . ."
"Mr. Polak asked Mr. Costa again at the International Harm Reduction Conference in Barcelona on May 15, 2008."
Good morning.
"Fredrick Polak, psychiatrist from Amsterdam, well, this is a continuation on the question I already posed, which I will very shortly repeat, the relationship between the availability of cannabis in the Netherlands, and the relatively low or average level of use, which in my view is contrary to the theory of prohibition."
"But now I would like to ask Mr. Costa, we heard that you made a visit to Holland and you visited a coffee shop and a consumer room, and I would like to ask you, what did you learn in Holland, and what are your impressions?"
Regarding Mr. Polak's sort of a continuing of questioning on the relationship between availability in Holland and high Availability of what? level of use.
"Availability of drugs, and the level, availability of alcohol and the level, availability of tobacco and the level."
I'm surprised Mr. Polak there is no focus as well on tobacco and alcohol.
"Here is the thing, for a number of reasons"
I am getting close to the Netherlands emotionally and culturally and many other reasons a country that I respect
"I decided in order to address the errors as scientifically as we could possibly do,"
"I decided to travel in a study mission to Amsterdam, the core if you wish of initiatives which are obviously quite problematic,"
"like the coffee shops, or for that matter the sex windows, where women are exposed in big windows at street level."
I decided to go there.

"Because the need for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to advocate for themselves is not limited by boundaries, Partners programs are being conducted in most states in the U.S., and a number of foreign countries."
"The individual needs vary, but there are some common themes."
The desire for full inclusion often rises to the top.
I think that the tips and the tools that you learn about advocating for yourself or for others are great.
You can use them for any disability

"While many graduates focus on issues of housing and employment, Doug Hedrick has zeroed in on respect, campaigning for the use of language that sees individuals with disabilities as people."
"The father of a son with autism, Hedrick went before the board of his"
local school district and got action.
"The eight month program gives you a lot of tools in your toolbelt, and I'm just starting to use a few of them."
Some of the ones that I've used is being able to speak to school boards and facilitating a People First language policy.
"What Partners asked me to do, in the course, was to change or create policies, and I saw an opportunity with my school board in Burke"
"County to say, let's use a People First"
language policy let's adopt that.
And the interesting thing is ... and this is what I've learned in Partners.
When you explain this to people. people generally do the right thing.
"People want to facilitate change if it's the right thing, and using a People First"
language policy is just a very good thing.
"And they adopted this policy last year, and they're using it today."
[male narrator]
Others have joined Hedrick as advocates of people first language a movement that has been supported and pressed by the North Carolina
Council on Developmental Disabilities
"Together with other Partners graduates, Hedrick has helped push for People First language with webinars, telling supporters how they can carry the message to their own communities."
"They are demonstrating leadership in their communities, as many Partners graduates do."
Debra Wilson completed the program and later was named a member of the
North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities.
Thank you.
"Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites."
"As a child studying these eternal masterpieces,"
Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
"Late at night, after hours of practicing,"
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
It all became music to me.
I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me.
"But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression,"
"I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument."
"The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience."
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
"The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source."
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas.
"When composers write music for me,"
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello.
"I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I."

bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF:
And to our two-part look at immigration.
On the U.S. Supreme Court docket Wednesday is a tough new law in Arizona.
NewsHour correspondent Tom Bearden traveled there recently and sets the scene for tomorrow's arguments.
TOM BEARDEN:
Daniel Bell's family has raised cattle on this land along Arizona's southern border since the 1930s.
"But in the past few years, he's had to repair the simple barbed-wire fence that separates the U.S. from Mexico more and more often, because the steady stream of people entering the country illegally are always cutting it."
"DANlEL BELL, Arizona:"
So this is a common occurrence every day that we deal with on the ranch.
"But, of course, that only happened because there were occasions when the Mongols did slaughter entire towns."
"So, with all that background,"
let us return to the question of Mongol awesomeness.
"First, 5 arguments for awesome:"
1.
The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian trade.
"The Silk Road trading routes that had existed for about 1,000 years by the time the Mongols made the scene, had fallen into disuse, but the Mongols valued trade, because they could tax it, and they did a great job of keeping their empire safe."
"It was said that a man could walk from one end of the Mongol empire to the other, with a gold plate on his head, without ever fearing being robbed."
2.
"The Mongols increased communication, through Eurasia, by developing this pony express-like system of way stations, with horses and riders that could quickly relay information."
"It was called the Yam System and it also included these amazing bronze passports, which facilitated travel."
3.
Another thing that travelled along Mongol trade routes was cuisine.
"For example, it was because of the Mongols that rice became a staple of the Persian diet, which I mention entirely because I happen to like Persian food."
4.
"The Mongols forcibly relocated people who were useful to them, like artists, and musicians, and, especially, administrators."
"As you can imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative tasks,"
"like keeping records, so they found people who were good at that stuff and just moved them around the empire."
"This created the kind of cross-cultural pollination that world historians, these days, get really excited about."
And 5.
"The Mongols were almost, unprecedentedly, tolerant of different religions."
"They themselves were shamanists, believing in nature spirits, but since their religion was tied to the land from which they came, they didn't expect new people to adopt it, and they didn't ask them to."
"So you could find Muslims and Buddhists and Christians, and people of any other religion you can think of, prospering throughout the Mongol empire."
"And, it's that kind of openness that has led historians to go back and re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as a precursor to modernity."
"But there is another side of the story that we should not forget, so here are 5 reasons why the Mongols might not be so great:"
1.
Here is Genghis Khan's definition of happiness.
"""The greatest happiness is to vanquish"
"""your enemies, to chase them before you,"
"""to rob them of their wealth,"
"""to see those dear to them bathed in tears,"
"""to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."""
I can't believe this is happening.

"Kevin Kelly has talked about how the technology of the instrument, the piano, or the technology of musical notation, allows Mozart and Beethoven to emerge through that and so now that the new sort of pallets for aesthetics design for IA is the technology of life itself i just think that is really exciting and i think it measured cross the threshold in the sense like evolution has become self aware he has woken up, you know Carl Sagan says: i think that he used to referred to the moment when it actually starts"

My weakness is the poor self-confidence I have when it comes to dancing.
"There are many steps, there is a lot of information and you feel a little stiff."

"While in Denmark and also to some extent Sweden, we draw all the people to the cities and closing small schools, and then ""you wonder"" why people move away from the local areas.."
Could we learn from Norway?
Ole:
Ehrm ..
I've actually been working together with Norway.
Seen cultural cooperation with..
"""Nord Trøndelag"" it's called where they have jazz festivals and where they work with art and business certainly, but also the schools that are around in the villages totally worn out"
"Norway don't always use there oil money in the right way, I would say .. but some things we can learn from Norway"
"In particular, we could learn modesty of Norwegians"
Norway has the largest number of middle managers who do not want to be leaders but I like the Norwegians because they remain committed to their values
I have stayed in a folk dance farm up in Norway which was organic awarded in Norway very special..
They made the costumes and danced under the midnight sun
It was very cozy.
I also have a stringed instrument
Martin:
Yes you play the violin and viola..
Ole:
Yes!
This gives rise to ... and that's a leading question ..
Is it something that gives perspective to all this philosophy?
Ole:
"Well, first it's a good way to get thinking as music affects your mentality"
Martin:
Sherlock Holmes also enjoyd it
Ole:
"Yes, but it's proven with children and so on that in music, at least, classical music because of its mathematical structure you become more gifted by playing and wierd enough .."
"If you have thought a lot in a period you will also be better at playing but generally yes, music is incredible"
"Especially classical music for ... especially Bach who is fabulous but the entire Danish culture is far down the road built on societies and associations and in music clubs, it was the amateur music which has been an excellent element in creating precisely those things that you're talking about because of democracy, in spite of lack of skills and abilities you have been allowed join in anyway"
Martin:
"But then we're back to Peideia, the bourgeois formation included music, cause it was good in developing people into good people"
I also think it has something to do with the nobility.
They had so much time and could do what they thought was fun and what gave them the most and it was to ride and fencing and paint watercolors speak French and of course play music and they would not go down as modern nobility does today with drugs and self-pity because the transcendental activities built them up as human beings rather than take them down

"I say that what Gaddafi's security brigades are doing in their violent, deliberate indiscriminate attacks on Libyan cities can only make hearts break and is scarcely to be believed"
"The Libyan people, who began their uprising peacefully asking for their rights and still want it to be peaceful, even though the regime has forced them to take up arms the Libyan people must now bear their responsibility."
"In the following way: in the liberated cities, the people must continue to go out in protests to call for their rights and to stress the unity of the country, and to support the countries which have declared their support for the Libyan people, and condemn those countries which have taken an opposing position, and those who are still in the position of spectators, especially the Arab nations must be urged to take a position."
Libyan ex patriot communities must also take on this role.

"Thank you for joining us for Managing Content on Shared Drives, a recorded web seminar delivered by the US National Archives and Records Admministration's"
National Records Management Training Program.
"In this online briefing from August 2012, Beth Cron from the Office of the Chief Records Officer shares tips on managing electronic records and other content on shared drives."
Let's join the seminar.
Paulette Murray:
My name is Paulette Murray and I'm with the National Archives and Records Administration.
I'm very excited to get today's online briefing started.
"Today we will have Beth Cron, and she'll be discussing managing content on shared drives."
These online briefings were created by NARA to present current records management subjects to a widely geographically dispersed audience.
We'd like to thank you for attending today.
This series of online briefings will allow us to maximize our limited government resources.
This briefing will last approximately one hour.
"This hour will include a presentation on the topic for approximately 30 minutes, and then we'll open up for question and answer."
"As your phones are on mute, and if you have called in, please feel free to use the chat box to ask any questions during the presentation or during the question and answer sessions."
"Today's briefing is titled Managing Content on Shared Drives, and we have Beth Cron with us today."
Beth is a member of the Records Management Policy section within the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
"Her team developed the NARA bulletin ""Guidance on Managing Content on Shared Drives"" and it was released in December 2011."
This webinar is based on research and content of this bulletin.
"The Records Management Policy Team has also produced guidance on Web 2.0 and social media records, cloud computing, and e-mail archiving applications."
Check out the Records Express Blog updates for the latest news from the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
And with that said I would like to introduce Beth Cron.
Beth Cron:
"Thank you, Paulette."
Good afternoon and good morning to those of you in other time zones.
I just want to say thank you and welcome to the webinar for today.
First of all I'll provide you a little bit of background on the shared drives bulletin and how it came about.
"Based on feedback that we received from agencies and NARA staff, our management decided that we should develop a bulletin on managing shared drives."
"Through development of the bulletin, we interviewed a number of agencies on the configuration of their shared drives and asked them about any reorganization projects that they've done on their shared drives."

"Rational numbers, integers, whole numbers, and natural numbers were infinite but a particular type of infinite he called ""countable""."
"Irrational numbers were also infinite, but what he called ""uncountable"" a much larger infinity than the countable rational numbers."
Cantor established a hierarchy of infinities.
We saw that real numbers are formed by combining the rational numbers and the irrational numbers.
Since real numbers include irrational numbers which are uncountable real numbers are also uncountable.
"In other words, the infinite collection of real numbers is the same size infinity as the infinite collection of irrational numbers."
Unlike the rational and irrational numbers every point on the number line corresponds to some real number.
If you randomly pick a point on the number line it will always correspond to a real number.
There are no gaps in the real number line.
This means that you can move smoothly between any two points and never encounter anything but real numbers.
"Since there are no gaps, the real numbers form a continuum a property which is essential for calculus."
So now we know that between any pair of irrational numbers are an infinite number of rational numbers and between any pair of rational numbers are an infinite number of irrational numbers.
And don't forget that there are infinitely more irrational numbers than rational numbers.
If this makes your head want to explode then congratulations!
You are on your way to becoming a mathematician.

"In terms of the budget and the Grand Bargain, what we're hearing is the discussion, especially on the Senate side between democrats and republicans, is to do another Grand"
Bargain.
The additional tax increases won't be what you call a big tax increase.
They will go in and change the tax loopholes.
They will eliminate some of the big tax loopholes that benefit some high earners and some big businesses like Exxon and others.
But if they can get the tax code to where it ought to be they will generate probably another $600 million in tax revenues.
And the President started a big bruha amongst the democrats and the republicans last week where he's actually beginning to start talking about cutting some of the entitlement programs.
"We're talking about Medicare, Medicaid, Social"
"Security, beginning to make some cuts on those because so many of the Baby Boomers are retiring and entering into that retirement workforce."
And that is ballooning those costs associated with it.
So that is the deal.
Can you increase the taxes by closing loopholes enough and can you increase revenue enough on the other side to spur economic growth and to rebuild the infrastructure and then keep the country from going into a recession.
We think the politics are excellent in the Senate.
It's hard to say what's going to happen in the House.
But there is some discussion that hopefully some of the regulars of the
"Republican Party will begin to talk with Boehner, can begin to talk with members of the House."
"And it may be a situation where it won't be a majority bill in the house, but if Republicans and Democrats are free to vote on the issues themselves when it comes to the budget there may be enough votes to cobble together some democrats and some republicans to get something passed in a Grand Bargain or in a budget."
"The downside of that is with the Republican Party trending so far to the right now is that most republicans don't necessarily fear a democratic challenger in the next election, but they fear an even more conservative member of the party upending them in a primary."
That's the politics of it.
So we don't know what's going to happen in the House.
I know there is some work going on.
I know the
"President is having these meetings now with republican individuals separately with lunches, dinners, and everything else, and also collectively."
We hope all of that will come to some sort of fruition.
I will speak a little bit more about CSBG after the conclusion of the CSBG presentation.
Brad:
"Great, Arley."
"Thank you very, very much for that overview, and let's turn to Mark Schmeissing who is the NASCSP"

"Mark has been analyzing the numbers for CSBG and it looks like we've got some pretty big challenges on our hands, Mark."
Mark:
"Thanks, Brad."
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
So it must also be on this perpendicular bisector
"And finally, it also is equidistant from A and C. because those are both R away they both sit on the circle"
So it must be on the perpendicular bisector of AC as well
So AC is right over here.
And this is what the interesting thing is
"We're seeing that the three perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of this triangle they do definitely intersect, but they're intersecting at a point outside of that triangle"
And that point is the center of this circle.
"So once again, that last idea is"
"O is equidistant from A and C, so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and C"
Which would look something like this
"So once again, we see that three perpendicular bisectors are intersecting at a unique point and O really is the circumcenter so, if you take any circle and you put any triangle whose vertices all sit on that circle, the center of that circle is its circumcenter"
So we just drew a situation where this is a circumcenter that sits outside of the triangle proper.
So point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle.
And point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle right over here.
It's going to sit on all three perpendicular bisectors and we know that because it's equidistant from all three points of any of these triangles where the vertices sit on the circle itself.

"However, there are many objects in the Universe that do emit radiation at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"For example, in the 1930s it was discovered by accident that there are radio waves coming from the depths of space."
"Some of these waves have the same frequency as your favourite radio station, but they are much weaker and, of course, there's nothing to listen to."
"In order to ""tune in"" to the radio Universe, you need some sort of receiver: a radio telescope."
And desire this public
"Notice may be given of their Resolution, so their Parents and Friends may have sufficient Time to be providing Homespun Cloaths for them."""
[laughter]
It was like: 'we are making a proclamation.
"Mom, send me some clothes.'"
[laughter]
That was like--okay.
[laughs]
But the feeling was there.
[laughs]
"And even better, they want their parents to provide homespun clothes,"
"""that none of them may be obliged to the hard Necessity of unfashionable Singularity, by wearing imported Cloth."""
Okay.
"'Mom, if you don't send me clothes,"
I'm going to have to wear imported clothes and I'm going to be really unpopular'-- so--[laughter] guilting the parents.
"Okay, but anyway that's--Yale students of the 1760s actually making acts of protest, organizing themselves into active protest."
"Now Yale isn't unique in this way, actually."
"Throughout the--this period, colonial colleges in a variety of different places were places that tended to brew sentiment-- political sentiment that was rebellious or outraged at some of the acts being imposed by the British government."
"Actually, Yale and Harvard and the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton, tended to be particularly well-known as sort of seedbeds of unrest-- particularly angry students who had strong political feelings, but there were other colleges as well where the students really were provoked to acts of protest in a variety of different ways."
"And I--this morning in researching for this lecture,"
I found a bunch of Princeton/College of New Jersey students who decided that no one in Princeton should be drinking tea.
So they went out into the town and just personally forced their way in to people's houses and when they found tea they burned it.
"That would be really popular--right?--and then one of them said something like, ""That was a real frolic."""
[laughter]
Okay.
[laughs]
The town must have been very pleased.
"I think in another college the commencement exercises, the speeches that the students gave at a commencement exercise, at a pretty early point actually, they debated, one for, one and against the possibility of independence."
I think that was in 1769.
You had students at one college who decided that would be what would be happening at their commencement ceremony is they would have that debate.
"It's a really early point and again, pretty radical."
"So we're kind of looking at a long-standing pattern of college students being bold and radical during times of political controversy and political unrest, and this is happening throughout the colonies in this period."
"Hi guys, this is another video from LifeSlGNS."
"Just a quick one this time, erm it's May so May the Fourth be with you guys."
I hope your all well.
Erm this is just going to be a quick one saying that I am sure you are all aware that LifeSlGNS is a user led organisation.
And by that I mean that we rely solely on donations from you guys and we are extremely lucky to have such generous people who are willing to give us all these donations to help us carry on our work.
"And during this month we are going to thank every single person who donates £5 or more within the UK, sorry guys it can't be further."
"By sending them, one of our shiny new magnets."
Yeah!
"This is what they are, this is what they look like."
Little magnet.
"They've been designed by our Wedge, and they have the brand new images and motto on them."
So it's a little Lighthouse.
"To get your hands on them, basically you just have to donate £5 or more during May and when your donation is received we will email you within 24 hours of your request to get your postal address, which is only going to be used for sending you your gift and then it will be deleted, so we won't spam you to death."
"So if you can possibly spare a fiver this month please consider just donating five pounds to us, it will do a really good deed for us guys and really help us out."
So pretty please?
(laughs) And it will be a lovely decoration for your fridge so who wouldn't want this?
"That's it guys, thank you."
"And I hope you are all having a wonderful May, bye."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Secretary Salazar:
"Thank you very much, Neal Muholland, and thank you to all of the members of the National Parks"
Foundation for your outstanding work and for making this day possible.
Thank you for the work you do to protect America's natural heritage and its culture.
On behalf of the Department of the Interior and the National
"Parks Service and my colleagues on President Obama's cabinet, we are honored that you are all here with us tonight to celebrate this great American holiday tradition."
"Seventy years ago this month, just weeks after the bombing of"
"Pearl Harbor, in those dark days,"
President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined here together in the White House to light the national Christmas tree.
"During those dark days, President Roosevelt called on the nation to view the lighting of the tree as a reminder that we set our faith in human love and in God's care for us."
"Tonight let this tree remind us that in all times, the light of love and good will shines brightly across America and around the world."
"This occasion is also special for all of us, because we are gathered here in Presidents Park, one of the 397 national parks under the care of the service, and here we light our nation's spirit of peace, hope and joy for the holidays."
"Now on this remarkable night in these remarkable times, it is with great honor that I introduce someone who never rests, someone who never tires, someone who never quits, someone who is a champion for American peace and prosperity for all of its citizens, the 44th President of the the United"
"States of America, Barack Obama!"
"Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters."
"The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline, over and over."
"Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers -- that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure, which is currently rated at a D minus."
"So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,"
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
"And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites."
"They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,"
"like risk and responsibility,"
"like peripetia and anagnorisis,"
"like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone."
"It's been great talking to you and get back to work, will you?"
(Applause)
The same statistic was run for female students.
"Again, I made up the data to illustrate the effect."
Females tended to apply predominantly for major B with 900 applications for major B and just 100 for major A.
The university accepted 80 out of 100 applications in major A and 180 out of 900 in major B.
Please tell me the rate of acceptance in percent for major A for the females student population.
I believe the first step I took at the Mechina was my first step towards success in life
"After you finish the Mechina, you have the tools to succeed later on in life, in the army, in everything that follows"
"I think this Mechina in general isn't a Pre-military Academy, but a preparatory academy for how to live life"
"When we thought about erecting an institution in the city we deliberated what kind of institution it should be, and we decided that this is what Am Yisrael really needs now"
I went to Rabbi Drukman and asked him who should lead the Mechina
He told me to call Rabbi Boaz [Sherman.
"They asked me to lead the Mechina, to found it"
I debated about it and in the end
I decided to go ahead with the idea
"We brought a bus from Ashkelon, some guys from here and there we told the guys we recruited:"
"""Guys, there will be a new Mechina here next year"""
It was a very special experience.
"We began with 30 guys, ""the pioneers"" who came to the Mechina."
They began the idea in a really nice way.
"We came to Kiryat Malachi we sought a place for the Mechina, though we couldn't find a suitable place so we rented an apartment and a storage area which would serve as our Beit Midrash."
In search of pastures and water sources they frequently cross the border with their cattle and goats.
"Cholima Logid, a father of nine used to cross the border to trade livestock. but he was confronted with different challenges."
Diseases cross the border with ease.
Pastoraslists can only rely on services offered at endpoints in either Uganda or Kenya.
Like here in Moroto Uganda where local organizations maintain routine checkups.
But there are differences in the quality and the prices of the veterinary services offered on both sides of the border.
And the lack of coordination makes it difficult to control disease outbreaks.
"With support from the European Union and ECHO this situation prompted IGAD, FAO and other organizations to initiate programs harmonized animal health care on both sides of the border."
April 2013 a Memorandum of Understanding between the government of Uganda and Kenya is signed.
The agreement commits both governments to develop programs for animal health care in the border regions.
The local NGO ACTED initiated the process.
ACTED's role began in August 2011. when we initiated a cross-border meeting ona very local level just among the district veterinary officers.
At that time it was to address and outbreak of Brucellosis.
We learned at that time that the dvos didn't have the freedom to work together without blessings from their ministries. and as a result we needed to move to ministry level.
Under the RlSPA initiative
"FAO liaised with the governments of Uganda and Kenya and animal health coordination was moved up the political agenda, resulting in the"
Memorandum of Understanding.
The next step is now to implement.
And the implementation entails development of a program program that is going to look up specifics on how to coordinate and share information.
Number two on how to have common activities.
For example in animal health.
How will they synchronize the vaccinations and treatment information.
The sharing and surveillance.
So that's a critical part of memorandum.
After the devastating drought that hit the Horn of African in 2011 governments in Eastern Africa spearheaded initiatives to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities
This new partnership is an important step.
One of the first issues to tackle is a frequenty reported lack of drugs to treat sick livestock.
Here Timothy Kelae is spraying a goat against tick.
But getting the spray and other treatments and medicines is a major issue.
The MoU will not necessarily provide the drugs  but the key thing is the implemenation of it which is going to be through the program.
The program now will go specifically to where the need is.
If there is a need of drugs
It's bringing it down into the soil.
It gets processed and de-nitrified and goes back up as
N_2.
There's some industrial fixation; the Bosch-Haber process is doing that.
"This runs off, gets into the ocean and fertilizes the ocean."
"If we look at the impact of nitrate and sulfate on human problems and on terrestrial ecosystems, one of the big ones is acid precipitation."
"So this stuff right here, all of human industry and cars and so forth, which in the United States has been concentrated in an area mostly roughly between Chicago and Pennsylvania, right here, this area, because of the-- remember our Hadley cells and the jet stream and the reason that the air is flowing from west to east across the continent-- all of that emission is getting picked up and it's getting dropped on lakes in Canada and the Northeastern United States."
"So in 1955 the pH in this region of the country, in freshwater bodies, had dropped to 4.6; that's starting to get pretty acid."
And by the way it was a much bigger problem for a lake that was sitting on granite than for a lake that was sitting on
limestone.
Why would it be more of a problem on granite than on
limestone?
Student:
Limestone's basic.
Prof:
Limestone's basic.
It's also a buffer.
So limestone will basically put a lot of carbonate into the water and buffer this.
"So this was a big problem, and in fact some lakes were"
losing all of their fish populations.
"However, there were improvements in air quality control around the country, and this has spread, but in many places it's also been ameliorated."
"I'd say it still remains a serious problem, and it's a situation that also causes international tensions, because basically Eastern Canada is getting hammered by"
"U.S. industrial and car emissions, because the flow of materials around the planet does not respect the arbitrary national boundaries that humans have created."
It's even worse in Europe.
"In Europe the industrial production of Germany, which creates a huge load of acid in the atmosphere, gets dumped on Scandinavia, which is old Scandinavian basalt shield; so they don't really have any"
limestone buffer up there in Scandinavia.
And that's one of the issues that gets talked a lot about in the European Union is how to equalize these kinds of costs.
"Because basically Canada is being treated as an externality by the United States, and Scandinavia is being treated as an externality by Germany."
So that sort of thing needs conflict resolution.
"Okay, water."
"The hydrological cycle is critical because you can't grow plants without water, and you can't grow humans without water either."
"And as the human population has gone up over five, and now through six billion, fresh water on the planet is becoming very, very scarce."
Now what does statement two tell us?
6 of the cans sit exactly along the length of the carton.
"So they're telling us that these cans, there's 6 cans that fit right along the length, which we figured out from statement number one."
But that also gives you the same information as statement number one.
Because you know that these are cylindrical cans.
I think it's a safe assumption to say that these are circles.
Yeah.
"A cylinder, you're assuming that the tops are circles."
"So if you say that 6 can fit that way, then you know that the diameter of each of them is 8 centimeters and then you can make the same argument that the diameter's 8 centimeters to say that 4 can fit the other way down."
"So two, alone, is also sufficient by itself."
"So the answer is, what is that, C?"
"Both statements-- no D, each statement, alone, is sufficient."
See you in the next video.
You are a good person
You spend time with your family
You work out at the gym
Come on..

You conserve water while showering
You like nice clothes
You give to charity.. ..you re-cycle you drive a prius but you use your bike when you can you enjoy the occasional distraction at work and you always send a card on mothers day always
But theres a part of you that tells yourself that you're not so good that you could be doing more that the world is falling apart at the seams and all youve been doing is yoga
one day you see that the rainforest is being destroyed at a staggering rate of 32 million acres a year
Thats the equivalent of a football field ever 78 seconds

"Well this is what you're not going to do: ""i quit"""
"You're not going to quit your job,"
"leave your family, get on the next flight to nicaragua, take a bus to the end of the jungle then hoof it across rivers lakes and streams, quest to very heart of the rainforest. ""take me to the heart of the rain forest"""

It is around now you're living out the cliche gringo fantasy of becoming an honorary native and leading the resistance forces but screw it.
The dietary restrictions for the MAO inhibitor actually only apply to the nine milligram and higher doses.
"So, the lower end we don't need to necessarily restrict."
"It can be a little confusing for patients, so you have to be pretty clear on it."
And you still have to follow the wash-out rules that we just talked about.
It's not any simpler in terms of getting the patient on or off the medication.
But this is a new drug that just became available in the last couple of years.
"So now we're going to talk about the SSRls, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors."
"And these consist of Citalopram, Escitalopram,"
"Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine,Paroxetine, and Sertraline."
And we're going to talk about some of the differences between each of the agents.
"This is a class of drugs, but they are all unique, and just because someone tries one and has a positive or negative experience, doesn't mean they will have the same experience on another agent."
"So, oftentimes we think of the SSRI as just being this simple, easy drug to work with, and it just increases the amounts of serotonin - it doesn't have any affects on other receptor sites."
"But, as you'll see in the next slide, this isn't as clean-cut as we envision it to be in this slide."
"So you can see we've got the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but we've got all this other noise going on that makes each combination of the antidepressant, how they use these other receptors, give each drug its unique profile."
The first SSRI that we're going to talk about is Fluoxetine.
"This is Prozac, Prozac weekly,"
"Serafem also, and Fluoxetine generic."
Fluoxetine has multiple indications.
"It's indicated for Major Depression, which we're focusing on."
"It's also indicated for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"
"Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is where the Serafem actually comes into play,"
"Bulimia, Panic Disorder, and Bipolar Depression - when it's combined with a different antipsychotic."
The average dose of someone taking fluoxetine is twenty to eighty milligrams a day.
It only needs to be dosed once a day.
The weekly preparation: basically the rule is ninety milligrams is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
So ninety milligrams a week is equal to twenty milligrams a day.
"Some of the unique aspects of fluoxetine: it has a very long half-life, because it has an active metabolite."
"So the half-life is up to even three, four days."
"So, it's a positive for patients who forget to take their medication from time to time, because we're not going to see any symptoms of withdrawal, the blood levels are going to stay pretty clean, we're not going to have any issues with that."
We do see some levels that can see some synergistic effects.
"Now, all these drugs"
- we talk about SSRls increasing just serotonin - you get indirect effects on other neurotransmitters.
"Because healthcare costs are rising extremely rapidly, the impact of including a much smaller healthcare weighting is a reduction in reported inflation."
"By simply reinstating the actual level of healthcare spending, our reported CPI would be several percent higher."
But the most outlandish adjustment of them all goes by the name
"""hedonics,"" the Greek root of which means ""for the pleasure of."""
"This adjustment is supposed to adjust for quality improvements, especially those that lead to greater enjoyment or utility of the product, but it has been badly overused."
Here's an example.
"Tim LaFleur is a commodity specialist for televisions at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where the CPI is calculated."
I'm guessing he works in a place that looks like this.
"In 2004, he noted that a 27-inch television selling for $329.99 was selling for the same price as last year, but was now equipped with a better screen."
Hmm.
"After taking this subjective improvement into account, he adjusted the price of the TV downwards by $135, concluding that the screen improvement was the same as if the price of the TV had fallen by 29%."
"The price reflected in the CPI was not the actual retail store cost of $329.99, which is what it would cost you to buy, but $195."
Bingo!
"At the BLS,"
TVs now cost less and inflation is heading down.
"At the store, they're still selling for $329.99."
Hedonics are a one-way trip.
"If I get a new phone this year and it has some new buttons, the BLS will say the price has dropped."
"But if it only lasts eight months instead of 30 years, like my old phone, no adjustment will be made for that loss."
"In short, hedonics rests on the improbable assumption that new features are always beneficial and are synonymous with falling prices."
"Over the years, the BLS has expanded the use of hedonic adjustments and now applies these adjustments to everything from TVs, automobiles, washers, dryers, refrigerators, and even to college textbooks."
Hedonics are now used to adjust as much as 46% of the total CPl.
So what would happen if you were to strip out all the fuzzy statistical manipulations and calculate inflation like we used to do it?
"Luckily, John Williams of shadowstats.com has done exactly that, painstakingly following each statistical modification over time and reversing their effects."
"If inflation were calculated today, the exact same way it was in the early 1980""s,"
Mr. Williams finds that it would be running at closer to 13% than the currently reported 5%.
"This is a stunning 8% difference, which explains much that we see around us."
It explains why people have had to borrow more and have been able to save a lot less - because their real income was actually a lot lower than reported.
A higher rate of inflation is consistent with weak labor markets and growing levels of debt.
It fits the monetary growth data better.
So many things that were difficult to explain under a low-inflation reading suddenly make sense.
The social cost to this self-deception is enormous.
And it kind of makes sense.
"You have a cluster of people together and you have a variety of different avenues, ways for students to make their thoughts known, so colleges and, as I said, particularly Yale became known as the sort of seedbed of sedition."
"As one Loyalist said of Yale in the 1770s,"
"The college is no longer remarkable for its scholarship but instead for ""its persecuting spirit, its republican principles, its intolerance in religion""-- but this is a person of"
"Loyalist sympathies, who says, 'Yale used to be great."
It's all downhill now.
"They have those crazy, wild, radical students.'"
"Or, as a British officer put it in 1779-- he happens to be the British officer who invaded New Haven-- quote, ""That place (New Haven) is a spacious and very considerable town; it has the largest university in America, and might with propriety be styled the parent and nurse of rebellion."""
Okay.
"We are the parent and nurse of rebellion--'Yale, hate Yale.'"
"Okay, but this is not to say that colleges in this period are"
"little isolated seedbeds of rebellion and everybody else is sort of sitting around whittling pieces of wood, thinking, 'oh, I wonder what the British are doing today.'"
Right?
It's not as though the colleges are isolated from the communities or that the colleges only notice the communities when they're going to go out and burn random citizens' tea as they did in New Jersey.
"There were obviously, there were connections between whatever was going on in these colleges and whatever was going on in these towns, and we're going to see that play out a couple of times in this lecture today."
Sometimes things that went on in the town spread their way onto the Yale campus.
"An example of this is in the late 1760s when there was a rally on the New Haven town green against British policy, and the Yale students apparently attended that rally and got very stirred up by the rally and decided to continue it on the Yale campus, at which point a big group of students decided it would be a really great idea to declare their political sentiments by toasting English radical John"
Wilkes.
"And they decided not--And I don't know where this number came from, because I didn't have time to research where the number came from, but you'll hear why I questioned it."
They decided that they would toast John Wilkes forty-five times.
[laughter]
Okay.
That's forty-five drinks.
[laughs]
"So one observer, who I gather from my research this morning had Loyalist sympathies, said that ""instead of drinking 45 glasses in honor of Wilkes and Liberty,"" the Yale students ""drank themselves 45 degrees in extremo"
"DRUNK."""
[laughter]
"So we've got plastered Yale students like: 'yeah, liberty'--[laughter] but that's the town spreading into the realm of the gown."
"Now, in the 1660s we're seeing these sort of public demonstrations-- New Haven, Yale campus protesting policies-- but not anything that dramatic happening."
But things become worse as relations between England and its colonies became worse and as actions became more aggressive on both sides.
"People in New Haven, as in a lot of other places, became more aggressive in their politics and became stronger in their actions."
"They made bolder decisions, and a great example of that is again here in New Haven, 1774."
"The Senate passed a Budget Resolution for the first time in four years, and we were able to get an amendment issued by"
"Jack Reed with the support of Susan Collins, Senator Merkley, and others to increase the budget authority in FY ""14 by $50 million for weatherization."
And there was a lot of Republican support for that.
So the work that Arley and I have done to raise the visibility of the program on the Hill will continue.
"We need to do a briefing in the House of Representatives, and we really, really, need to target Republicans."
We've asked for your help on these letters and when Elyse joins us we're going to need your help on another ask coming up here in just a few days in the Senate.
We'll talk about that when Elyse joins us.
So that right now is where we are with weatherization numbers.
The chess game continues.
What's the next move in the chess game?
Let's go to the next slide.
"Well this year, as opposed to the preceding year, it looks like the committees in both the House and"
Senate are committed to doing regular order.
"Regular order means hearings, markups, and actually reporting legislation."
"Something that we haven't seen a lot of in the last few years, unfortunately."
"So, we've already submitted testimony from Tim Warfield to the House Appropriations Committee on the"
"FY ""14 budget."
"We'll be submitting testimony in the Senate on May 9th, and there's a member request"
letter which Elyse is going to talk about which is due in the Senate on April the 29th.
So we're going to build support.
"We're getting these higher numbers, hopefully, in the appropriations for weatherization in FY ""14."
"Obviously, and I think Arley will get into this later on and will talk about CSBG, the fate of this budget that the president submitted is ultimately wound up in the success of any kind of grand bargaining talks."
The CR (Continual Resolution) will expire in May.
"The debt ceiling has to be raised, depending on who you talk to, it may be June, it may be as late as July, but it's coming, very, very soon."
"And the President is going to try to make an effort to get what's referred to as the Grand Bargain, and as you know in the budget the President submitted, he recommended repealing sequestration, which has had a shock effect on every agency's budget on things like training, and conferences, and travel for both contractors and agency people."
"And there's going to be an issue with the President's recommendation to cancel sequestration and then replace that with $1.8 trillion in cuts over 10 years, cuts which would call much less heavily on domestic programs."
That's something to watch on a negotiation on Grand
Bargain.
"The committees meanwhile will go ahead with what I refer to as regular order, meaning there will be hearings, we will have questions submitted to friendly members to raise at the hearings on weatherization, and our main task here is to continue to raise the profile of the program."
"It has taken considerable hits on Capitol Hill, as everyone knows, because of adverse publicity."
But the ARRA process is now over.
All of the ARRA money has been expended with the exception of some nominal balances in a handful of states.
"Although these particles may be difficult to study, they are plentiful."
Each second more than 50 trillion electron neutrinos from the Sun pass through you.
"Finally, astronomers and physicists have joined forces to build gravitational wave detectors."
"These ""telescopes"" do not observe radiation or catch particles."
"Instead they measure tiny ripples in the very structure of space-time, a concept predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity."
"With a stunning variety of instruments, astronomers have opened up the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, and have even ventured beyond."
But some observations simply can't be done from the ground.
The answer?
Space telescopes.
Hubblecast is produced by ESA / Hubble at the European Southern Observatory in Germany.
The Hubble mission is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.
Now it is a time of simplification:  everything becomes simpler.
"It is simpler to wash our clothes,  our dishes, to travel in space."
"Though, unfortunately,  the culture becomes simpler."
"The culture becomes different:  it changes its rate, its depth, and many other of its parameters."
"I'm not going to judge this process, it has many objective  and positive causes: the changes of communicational forms,  even new communicational civilization is connected to the Internet and different technical innovations which really make many things  simpler and better."
But there is also a loss of depth.
"There are also subjective elements  connected to, for example, simplification of culture in our country which is not always very positive."
"And we understand perfectly  that because of the development of different media, TV, etc., we also lose much."
What can we set over against it  without judgment?
"We can create ""spaces of complexity."""
"Unfortunately, there aren't many genres  where these spaces are possible."
"It is very difficult to combine this  with different new institutions, but it is real to combine this with  traditional institutions like museums."
Museums have all chances to be justified  as spaces of deepening of culture.
"Unfortunately, till now  they don't work this way."
For reforming them this way  we should work a lot.
What does this job consist of?
"First of all, goal-setting."
Every museum action or movement from ventilation of repository  to working with every audience --
I'm not even talking now  about the main tasks --
"like exhibitions, expositions,  scientific events, etc., all these actions should be considered  in connection with goals."
"The goals form themselves  and goals form the depth, and, at the same time,  they solve many tasks."
"It's gotten $2,000 more expensive off of $20,000, so it's gotten 10% more expensive."
"You, as the economist, what you would say is, as the way you've defined it, your consumer price index, and this is abbreviated with CPl, consumer price index, your consumer price index is up by 10%."
"Or another way, based on the way you measured it, and it changes from country to country, and even within countries, they change the way that they do these basket of goods, but by the way you've measured it, you would say that price inflation, or, you would say that the price inflation has been 10% between year 1 and year 5, or in general everything got 10% more expensive, or you would need 10% more money to have the same standard of living."
"In general, when people are just referring to inflation, so if you just see the word ""inflation"" being referred to, especially in modern times, they are referring to price inflation."
"This general increase in the price of goods and services, measured by some type of basket of goods."
"There is another type of inflation, and that is monetary inflation."
Monetary inflation; and they are related.
Monetary inflation is inflation due purely to an increase of the money supply.
This is increase in money supply.
"In general, if this increase in the money supply does outstrip the productive capacity of the country, it could very well lead to price inflation, but in general what people measure, when they talk about inflation, from one year to the next, they're talking about this basket of goods."
They're talking about price inflation.
"The other thing that you'll sometimes see, maybe in year 5, someone says,"
"""Hey; I could sell you this house,"" so this is in year 5,"
"""I could sell you a house,"
"""and this house in year 5 is $660,000."""
"Is $660,000."
"Someone might ask, what would be that price if we adjusted it for inflation in year 1 dollars?"
"What they're saying is, if you adjust for how much value your money has lost, because if things are getting more expensive, that means each dollar is being worth less."
You can buy less with each dollar.
"When people say, ""How much is that,"
"""adjusted for inflation in year 1 money?"" you're essentially saying,"
"""What amount of money would that house"
"""have had to cost in year 1,"
"""that when you adjust it for inflation,"
"""when you increase it by 10%,"" so that's the same thing; increasing by 10% is the same thing as multiplying by 110%, or multiplying by 1.1, so, ""what amount of money would that house"
"""had to have cost in year 1,"
"""that if I multiply it by 1.1,"
"""I get $660,000?"""
"We could do a little bit of quick math here, to figure that out."
"If we say, let's say that, I don't know,"
let's call it P.
P is the price of the house in year 1.
I am from Canada so I have some beautiful Canadian maple syrup.
Canada number three which is the dark amber maple syrup.
Hmm.
So good!
"I love it more than the light maple syrup and this has more flavor and for sure not using the table syrup, those are like the maple flavored syrup, donít use those."
"Itís gotta be the pure stuff, those other maple syrups have a lot of refined ingredients."
They usually made from corn syrup and those arenít very good for you so donít use those.
See how our vegetables are doing.
They are staring to sweat which is a good thing.
Think of it like a sauna.
A good dressing thatís made properly gets nice and thick like this and like I said this is a glazed that weíre gonna put over our carrots and parsnips and so whatís gonna happen is its gonna thicker even more in the oven and what makes a glazed is a little bit of sweetener so thatís why weíre using the maple syrup coz that what makes it have that beautiful glazing action.
"Ok with the mustard seeds you wanna wait until you can smell them but once youíve been able to smell them, theyíre gonna burn pretty quickly after that so timing is critical."
Then what youíil do is take your vegetables which should be nicely softened but not necessarily fully cooked coz they are gonna go into the oven.
"Get them all out, give the glazed a"
little last stir and then pour it right over the vegetables and get it nicely mix in there.
"So there they are ready to go into the oven, more glazed is better because then you can drizzle it up whatever else your eating."
"These mustard seeds are getting mix nicely as well now theyíre not necessary, if youíre not a huge fan of mustard or you canít find the whole seeds just leave them out."
The glazed on its own is nice as well.
"So pop this up into the oven, the glazed needs about 5 minutes to thicken a little bit and to soften the flavor because itís gonna be pretty strong raw so you do need to bake this sauce."
So pop this up to the oven five minutes maybe more if you like.
"So there they are, maybe hard to tell on the video but the sauce has actually glazed around the vegetables meaning that itís gotten kind of sticky and thicker and just plain yummy."
Like I said excellent as part of an appetizer night or some side for another dish you can find the recipe for the maple Dijon glazed vegetable at HealthyVeganRecipes.net.

The world health organization declaration of a flu pandemic is a frist of such a virus in more than 40 years
The WHO's director general is Margerat Chan
The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic
We are the in the earlist day of the pandemic
The virus is spreading under a closed and a careful watch no previous pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely in real time right at the very beginning
The declaration of the bug widely know as swine flu is a pandemic rasies the alert level world level
The move will trigger a wave of heightened health measures among the WHO 193 member states but its succession to pandemic status refelcts only its geographic spread not how virulent it is
"The new strain of swine flu emerged in April in Mexico and the United States 5 year old Mexican boy,Edgar Hernandez was among the first cases"

"They come one by one, all seeking answers to puzzling questions and ways of coping with the uncertainties and challenges that life can bring."
"Almost universally, they leave with new optimism and new tools to help them deal with the issues of concern."
They are people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or the parents of children with disabilities and most have felt the frustration and pain of struggling to deal with the system.
These individuals have come to Partners in Policymaking and their needs and circumstances vary.
But all have sought ways to find new answers and to bring about change.
They learn how to make their voices heard to play a role in policy development.
"Wanda Mills has lived with difficult disabilities for much of her life, but persevered and went on to employment with the tax department in the town of Sylva"
"When her parents passed on, she moved to her own residence, cooks all her own meals and maintains the household."
She credits the Partners program with helping her to interact in the community.
It has changed my life completely.
"I have always wanted to be a public speaker. and that was a crazy idea, but Partners helped me realize that I could be a public speaker."
That has always been a life dream of mine.
"From my perspective, it is to help parents of children with disabilities to not put their child in a box, but let them be all they can be, however little though that may be."
That is so important.
[male voice]
Wanda is increasingly speaking out on issues of concern to people with disabilities addressing groups in a number of North Carolina communities.
"The Partners program director,"
"Deborah Whitfield, an attorney who herself is a graduate of the program in Texas understands the growth process and now keeps the proceedings on track in North Carolina."
"There are some challenges, people who believe, that you know they can't do it because many of them haven't left their own communities."
Many have never gotten on public transportation.
Many have not even lived in a hotel room.
"So when you see those individuals who come to this training for the first time, get that experience and soar it is a delight to be a part of that process."
[male voice]
"The creator of the Partners advocacy program, Dr. Colleen Wieck, of Minnesota, said it was prompted by a specific need and then grew from there."
"The last witness at the 3-hour hearing was a young parent from International Falls,"
Minnesota.
"And, everyone was giving her mixed messages about what to do to testify in front of U.S. Senator Dave Durenberger"
"And, after that hearing, two of us got together and we realized, we could teach the skill that was missing."
"And, we could do this in a systematic way, as well as teach best practices about disability services."
"And, as a result, we created this eight weekend program that's designed to teach both- what is best practice in education, assistive technology, living and employment, as well as how to communicate with local, state and federal officials."
"And we can see some increase: you can see in the top that there's some norepinephrine activity, some of the serotonin 2C activity that we highlight could increase some norepinephrine and dopamine."
"So if you think about some of those initial symptom comparisons we talked about,"
"Fluoxetine is a little more activating, may help a little more with concentration, may be helpful in some of the sedated and fatigued patients."
"With its long half-life and active metabolite, though, it might not be great for the elderly."
"There are a lot of drug interactions, though, with Fluoxetine, both with the Fluoxetine and the active metabolite."
"So you have to be careful with using the drug, in terms of drug interaction monitoring."
"The next agent we'll talk about is Paroxetine, and there are multiple formulations, again:"
"Paxil, Paxil CR, and Paroxetine."
Paxil versus Paxil CR: the only difference is that the CR is better upon initiation.
Paxil's a little difficult to start.
It's very hard to get on and off of this drug.
"So, the CR has a little bit different absorption, and so it absorbs lower in the stomach, rather than in the stomach, more in the intestine, so you don't get as much nausea with the drug."
"And so you do some slight dosage adjustments, but there's no benefit of Paxil CR over Paxil or Paroxetine after the first two weeks of treatment."
"So, again, we don't really see anything in terms of the use of this agent."
The dose of Paroxetine is anywhere from ten to eighty milligrams.
"Again, multiple indications:"
"Major Depression,"
"Obsessive-Compulsive, Panic, Social Anxiety Disorder,"
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,"
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder."
"As we talk about some of the other anti-depressants, you may not see as long of lists of indications, which is fine, it doesn't make any one drug more superior to another when they have more indications."
It's just what that particular manufacturer decided to study and gain FDA approval for.
But it doesn't make a drug better or worse than another.
"That doesn't make a drug that's not indicated for something that we can't use it for something, potentially."
"Some of the unique aspects of Paroxetine is it does have a very short half-life, so we have to be careful with withdrawal."
Withdrawal can occur by missing one dose of this medicine.
"And the withdrawal is something like a flu-like symptom, flu-like phenomenon, so people get very nauseous, sweaty, they may feel a little off-balance, they may have some reality distortion, often, too."
"So you have to be careful with this one, with someone with compliance issues and forgetting to take their medicine."
"This is probably the more sedating, calming agent, so it's better with patients who have insomnia, they might see a little actual fatigue."
"We do see some anticholinergic side effects, though with Paroxetine: the dry mouth, sedation, constipation."
"And we can see waking, clinically, with Paroxetine also."
"Across the board, most of the antidepressants are weight-neutral."
He was a researcher and a doctor working out of the
University of Minnesota.
"And you might recognize his name, or perhaps you've heard of the K ration which is the type of food packets that the soldiers in World"
War two ate was named after K for Dr. Keys.
"He worked in a variety of different backgrounds in and round of nutrition, but we do refer to him as the father of the"
Mediterranean diet.
"Another thing that he was very well known for, was his book in his publication called The Biology of Human Starvation."
"This way published in the post world war two era, and he really did some of the seminal research on reef feeding, and how we feed an individual who has previously starved."
"But that, but back to his work in the Mediterranean diet realm."
"In the period from 1958 to 1970, he conducted what was called the Seven Countries Study."
"And he surveyed men in eighteen different areas of seven different countries, and these men were aged 40 to 59."
"He was the first person to scientifically explore what associations existed among diet, disease risk, in different contrasting populations."
"He did a very thorough chemical analysis of foods that people in these different areas ate, and also did documentation about the foods that they eat."
He demonstrated the degree to which the diet and in particular saturated fatty acids and cholesterol
"levels, would predict present and future heart disease."
"Now to you, especially at this point in the course, you It might come as no surprise that a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol helps to reduce heart disease risk."
"But at the time, Dr. Keys was fascinated by middle aged American males who had really high risks of heart attacks."
"How come other comparable males in other parts of the world, weren't having the same experiences and the same rates of heart attack."
And that's really what he initially sought out to study and he turned into really starting to exploit and really highlight the benefits of eating a Mediterranean diet.
Sort of the basic principles of the mediterranean diet.
It's primarily a plant based diet that includes herbs and spices for added flavor.
"There are some animal products but red meat intake in particular is limited, there is a focus on fish and on poultry."
There's low intake on processed foods and the emphasis is on fresh whole foods.
It includes fish and foods from the sea and a moderate consumption of dairy and wine.
There's also the notion that activity is part of the healthy lifestyle.
"And as far as the fats go, there's a focus on good fats with the primary fat of the Mediterranean diet, being olive oil."
What you see here is an image that's showing the Mediterranean diet pyramid.
This is a visual teaching tool that was developed or introduced in 1993 and it's a collaboration between the
"Harvard School of Public Health, the European Office of the World Health"
Organization and the non profit organization called Oldways.
It's based on the dietary traditions of the people of Crete.
"The island of Crete in the country of Greece in Southern Italy, around 1960."
"Hopefully, it won't die, but I'm going to aim for a grand slam, and we'll try."
"But one way or another, what I am going to do today is get across some of the ideas in a concrete way that I had been thinking I was going to approach in an abstract way and that just didn't get me excited this morning, so it's a little experiment for me."
"And what I'm going to do, my little experimental thing, is I'm actually going to be talking about citizenship and"
leadership and the American Revolution by focusing on Yale and New Haven.
This was my brilliant thought for the morning.
"Ah ha, I could focus right here."
"I could talk about us here now, and look at-- throughout the 1770s--some of the ways in which people were actually experiencing the Revolution, some of the ways in which the Revolution was getting them to take action, what it is they were doing, why they were doing it, who was doing it, who was taking action."
So again we're not just going to be looking at three elite guys in a room sort of writing proclamations but we're actually going to be talking about students and the people of New
Haven.
"So that's my experimental lecture for this morning and, as you're going to see, average New Haven residents took strong action at an early point in the growing conflict between the colonies and Great Britain."
"So really, in a main and a sort of major way what we're going to be looking at is their story today, the story of average people in New Haven."
Students are kind of above average because they would have been from more elevated families.
"We're going to be looking at students too, but we're going to be looking at a lot of what's happening just in the town of New Haven, which in a way is the best way to look at the Revolution, which is really how it's unfolding on the ground."
Plus this means I get to talk about the British invasion of
"New Haven, which--I've been waiting for my moment."
I've never actually talked about it in this class before.
"I discovered it when I was writing the introductory lecture and then having discovered it it was like: 'okay, well, now I have to find a way to talk about the invasion of"
New Haven.'
"So after I had my brilliant idea I realized ha,"
[laughs] this means I get to talk about the attack on New Haven in today's lecture-- so that will be there today too.
Okay.
So let's actually turn now to Yale and New Haven at the opening of the Revolution.
"And most of the lecture today is going to focus on the 1770s, but I will mention in starting that Yale students were certainly caught up in all of the fervor that I've been talking about in past lectures."
"And I know I mentioned once before that Yale students decided in protest at one point to give up importing fine wines,"
[laughs]--the sacrifice--on the part of Yale students.
"In the 1760s, Yale students,"
"like many other people throughout the colonies, were engaged in acts of sort of personal protest like that, giving something up."
Okay.
"Maybe on the part of Yale students it was just fine wines, but still-- Or on another occasion in 1769 in response to the Townshend Acts and then the idea of non-importation, the senior class of Yale came up with the following proclamation, which they made publicly:"
"""The Senior Class of Yale"
"College have unanimously agreed to make their Appearance at the next public Commencement, when they are to take their first Degree, wholly dressed in the"
Manufacturers of our own Country:
Letting go of the negative emotions and generating the positive ones.
Compassion is a positive emotion.
"It's not just something you talk about, and just throw that word out ""compassion""."
"Yeah, we all know we should be compassionate."
"And I'm sure at the Dalai Lama's talk everyone's saying ""yeah we should all be compassionate""."
"But then afterwards when somebody cut in front of them in the traffic jam - ""You stupid..!"
"You shouldn't do this!""."
"We have to actually act compassionately, be compassionate, generate this positive emotion."
"This is actually how we do this, you know, through our mindfulness, and our care and our understanding of life, we realise that whatever we're faced with in life, that's result of old kamma, what's the kamma we're doing now?"
"By generating this beautiful allowing this moment to be, respecting this moment, but being kind to it, being gentle, we are actually developing these positive wonderful emotions, of respect, of gratitude, allowing things to be, compassion, even inspiration."
What a beautiful emotion inspiration is.
When somebody says something or does something and it just raises your heart and gives you happiness for hours sometimes days sometimes years.
These are the emotions we should be developing.
"Imagine if we were a nation, a world, which ran more on inspiration rather than its opposite, desperation."
"Inspiration, it uplifts us and gives us energy, because the positive emotions empower you to do something really worthwhile in this world."
"The negative emotions - anger, fear, depression, grief, what does that do - that immobilises you."
"Anger sometimes gives you some energy, but it usually just wears you out after a while."
You can't do anything in this world - you can't do things.
"The positive emotions give you power, and open the path to achievement, achieving something really worthwhile in this world."
"Things like love, compassion, they're not something which is your birthright."
"You develop these, you train for these things."
"Just like an Olympic athlete, you train and train and train, by guarding your mind, changing the outlook, making good kamma, mental kamma, with whatever you have to deal with in life."
Allow it to be.
"Be kind, be gentle."
"When you create this beautiful kindness and gentleness, this wisdom this compassion grows and grows in you."
This is not just in your life.
"Even in that book which I wrote, ""Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond"", I made an important point even in meditation."
"Successful meditators are those who have an understanding of their emotional world, because even the path of meditation is an emotional path."
Very early on you have to suspend your intellectual thinking and feel your way through the path of peace.
To allow that peace to develop into the amazing emotions which sometimes you get in deep meditation.
"There's so much joy and happiness, and why does that come from?"
"Because you're grateful just to be in this moment, no fault-finding, so gentle to every breath, to every mind-moment"
"A couple more things about sick day management for diabetes, if you feel that you are dehydrated, and usually you know you're dehydrated if you look at the color of your urine, the closer it is to dark yellow or orange."
Amber colored urine implies that you're very dehydrated.
"Drink things like water, club soda, diet soda that's caffeine-free or even you can drink salty beverages like tomato juice or chicken broth when you're sick."
"If your blood sugar is low and you're sick, make sure that those drinks that you're drinking include some sugar."
So drink 100 percent juices or sports drinks.
"It's okay to drink regular soda but you want to stay away from the caffeinated ones or try tea with, With honey for a little bit of carbohydrate, plus your fluids."
"If you are interested in learning more about some basic meal planning tips for people that have diabetes, please check out some of these websites and articles that you see listed here."

"One of the myths, I think, concerns the financial side."
"There is a conception, or a perception, I guess, that"
United States education is quite expensive and is not affordable and out of reach for many students.
"So the two-year college system actually helps to dispel that myth by providing outstanding opportunities to cut the cost of the bachelor's degree in half, at least."
"So most two-year community colleges would cost between $5,000 and $7,000 a year."
"And Foothill and De Anza colleges right now are about $5,300 for a whole year of tuition."
"And while you're studying there for two years, you're completing for same courses of major U.S. Universities, particularly those that are on our articulation agreements -- for example, UC Berkeley -- or even private instutitions,"
"like University of Southern California and Pepperdine, St."
"Mary's, for example, or Santa Clara."
And you're not paying their tuition for the first two years.
"So when you transfer, you receive course credit."
But you've saved the difference on the costs.
And another interesting characteristic is that there are more scholarships available between second and third year while you can already establish your academic performance.
"You participate in extracurricular activites, which are plentiful at many college campuses."
You can build up your resume.
And you already appear as a well-rounded student with significant experience studying in an American insitution.
And you are then able to receive more partial and sometimes full scholarships.
"It actually provides a wonderful opportunity for a student to get a bachelor's degree, sometimes from a very prestigious university, while not having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars."
So that's probably one of the most important myths that I hear.
PAUL McVElGH:
It's true that community colleges in the
United States are both technical and vocational kinds of institutions.
But the big difference from the typical community college in other countries is that they also have the transfer capacity.
"So I see this as an attack not so much on Assata herself, although of course she deserves to be brought home."
"She deserves to be able to live out her life, and with justice and peace."
"It was wonderful that you allowed people, through this program, to hear Assata's words, because, 40 years later, people really don't know the details of the case and are not aware of the extent to which she was targeted by the FBI by the COlNTEL Program, as Lennox pointed out."
"And it's amazing that in 2013, where she is living in Cuba as a political refugee, having given— having been given political asylum by Cuba, she is still pursued."
"And actually, this is an invitation for anyone to travel to Cuba illegally and to kidnap her and bring her back to the United States, if not shoot her dead."
"This is—as I said, was an extremely shocking revelation."
JG:
"And, Angela Davis, the government statement that she remains a threat to the United States, the implication being that she's somehow still trying to organize attacks on the country, it really is mind-boggling."
"It's one thing to say, ""We have a case here of someone who's still wanted."""
"It's another thing to say that they're still a threat to the United States, when there's been no indication over the last 30, 40 years that Assata Shakur has been involved in any type of movements or organizations directed against the United States government."
AD:
"Well, see, there's always this slippage between what should be protected free speech—that is to say, the advocacy of revolution, the advocacy of radical change— and what the FBI represents as terrorism."
"You know, certainly, Assata continues to advocate radical transformation of this country, as many of us do."
"You know, I continue to say that we need revolutionary change."
"This is why it seems to me that the attack on her reflects the logic of terrorism, because it precisely is designed to frighten young people, especially today, who would be involved in the kind of radical activism that might lead to change."
"But you're absolutely right, Assata is not a threat."
"If anything, this is a—this is a vendetta."
"She is innocent, and many of us have looked at the evidence."
"And as Lennox pointed out, there's no way that she could have possibly been the person who killed Foerster, because she had her hands up and was shot in the back with her hands in the air and could not have used a gun at that time."
"And so, to represent her as a person who continues to be a threat to the U.S. government in the way that is described is, it seems to me, an effort to strike fear in the hearts of young people who would be active in the struggles that are represented historically by Assata and struggles that continue today."
"Struggles against police violence, for example, continue."
The fact—consider the fact that so many people have been killed by the police in recent years.
And I'm thinking about Kimani Gray in New York.
"I'm thinking about Alan Blueford in Oakland, of course Oscar Grant in Oakland."
I'm thinking about—there's some 63 people who were killed last year in Chicago by the Chicago police.
AG:
"Lennox Hinds, this issue of what this allows the U.S. government to do?"
"To be on the Most Wanted Terrorists list, I mean, does this mean the government could move in, like they moved in on Osama bin Laden, for example?"
Could—
LH:
I think what Angela said was right on point.
"It is an open invitation, not only with respect to the United States government, but for anyone, in Cuba or elsewhere, to become a vigilante, to go there and to not only apprehend and bring her back, or to kill her."
She's often shown reading an open book which would be that of the Bible which already existed.
"In other words, the Light of Heaven comes down."
That's the annunciation the Spirit is entering into Mary.
That light crosses a candle.
And that candle is the one by which Mary is reading.
"In order for the medieval painters to show how bright is that divine light, the candle is shown with a wisp of smoke."
"Because, in comparison to that light, mere earthly light is as if it were darkness."
Isaac Asimov wrote Asimov's Guide to the
Bible.
"It's not unreasonable for him to understand perfectly well that, that image of the wisp of smoke at the end of the evitable conflict is not in fact the extinction of knowledge, it is in fact the advent of a new millennium brought to us by the perfect robots."
The conflict is now evitable.
We read that last story quite differently if we understand it as a composite novel.
"From the 1950s on, people began to be able to write novels rather than short stories."
"You see, something important had happened."
"Right after the Civil War, the American News Company bought warehouses near the railheads surrounding major cities."
"If someone printed a periodical in any city, they could sell their print run to the American news company, which would take it and sub divide it and send the different sections to their own warehouse, those around the country, where the subsection of periodical A will be joined with the subsection of periodical B and so on, and then, in that region of the"
"American News Company would deliver all of the periodicals that it had contracted to, to distribute."
"So the American News Company, in fact, became the de facto distributor for virtually every national magazine in the"
United States.
And it had no competition.
"After a while, American cities grew."
"And what had been cheap warehouse property near the railhead, often became very valuable property next to the downtown railroads, next to the downtown railway station."
"And in the 1950s, a Wall Street group realized that the value of the property that the American News Company owned was greater than the profitability of the"
American News Company.
"So they bought it, and over a period of a few years, they dismantled it, they sold it for it's property."
No other national distributor ever came to replace it.
"In fact, we only have real national distribution again for a few journals that can afford to send their material through satellites and beamed them down to printing presses around the country."
"As for example, some newspapers now do."
"Before The American News Company disappeared, there were 38 science fiction monthlies published in the United States."
"By the time The American News Company had been entirely obliterated, there were four."
"Obviously we can't support many, many writers writing short stories who are going to turn out fix ups."
"On the other hand, in the early 1950's Ian and Betty Ballantine suddenly realized that instead of having soft Bantam books be a later publication of hardbound books that had already come out, it would be possible to have softbound books as original publications, and starting in the early 1950's Ballentine Press began to have paperback originals."

Last year president Barrack Obama established April as national sexual assault awareness month this weekend the 139th airlift wing raises that awareness by hosting a 5k walk-run at Rosecrans over 150 members either walked or ran in support of the event
"Major Barb Denny leads the sexual assault prevention and response program at the 139th and says this is the first time they've held a 5k we wanted to do something different this year than we've done in the past and we thought this was a good way to get people together work on our fitness and just have a lot of fun sexual assault is actually a societal problem, it's one that we really need to raise awareness for so we can make sure victims understand they can come forward the event also took donations that will go to the YWCA in St. Joseph it's a non-profit group that has programs aimed at assisting individuals who have been victims in domestic violence"
Master Sgt. Jackie Moser works at the YWCA in her civilian job and says the program is for both women and men
The YWCA has always been a huge resource for her program because they have several different different programs that can assist women and men that have been sexually assaulted
This weekends event raised over 600 dollars that will go to the YWCA to support that program

"Today, we're going to talk about some things that are ingredients in success of a team or a group."
"And in the stead of the roles on this particular lecture, we are going to look at some others things that are outside the person or at least are different processors that a person may bring or ingredients they bring into the group that has nothing to do with the actual functions of that person or what they actually do."
"There's sort of external variables that affect the group, but yet they're important."
"And so the three things we'll look at here that are these variables that have a lot to do with group success, or can detract from it, are what we are going to call norms, status, and power."
"And I think you can already figure out that norms can be a good thing or a bad thing, and same with status and power."
When power is used properly and ideally it's a good thing.
It is used properly for positive force in a group.
"Now, let's start with norms."
What I'd like to do is define these three terms and give examples of them and actually do a little more detailed analysis of how they affect a group.
"And these are things you're going to want to pay attention to when you're in a group: what the norms of that group are, is status affecting a group, and how is power influencing the people in that group - is it a positive force or not."
Let's start with norms.
"And I have come here today to offer you my condolences and my regrets and importantly to apologise to each of you for this tragedy."""
"General Allen's new directive to limit airstrikes comes nearly two years after his predecessor, General David Petraeus, also issued new rules that were billed as a major step toward reducing civilian casualties."
Syrian government forces have launched new attacks in several parts of Homs province in one of its largest offensives in recent weeks.
Syrian activists say at least 35 people were killed in bombings in the city of Homs as well as nearby towns.
The attacks come days after UN monitors were able to reach the village of al-Qubair in central Hama province in the aftermath of a massacre of up to 80 civilians.
"Syrian forces had previously blocked the monitors from visiting the site, fueling allegations the regime was trying to hide evidence of the killings."
A member of the UN team said the observers had come across human remains.
What we saw most [prominently] were two homes — one was damaged mainly from the rockets and BMBs and other calibers-small and large calibers bullets.
We found a variety of different kinds of bullets there.
The other was burnt [buildings] with bodies inside the bodies.
You can smell the burn of dead bodies.
"You coan also see body parts in and around the village."""
"According to UN figures, government-backed forces in Syria have killed more than 10,000 people during the more than year-long uprising against the Assad regime."
"President Obama took criticism from Republicans over the weekend after saying the private sector is ""doing fine."""
"Obama was comparing the private sector's gain of 4.3 million jobs in the past 27 months to the public sector's loss of 550,000 jobs over the same period."
"On Friday, Obama clarified his stance."
The economy's not doing fine.
"There are too many people out of work, the housing market is still weak and too many homes under water, and that's precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that could make a difference."
"What I've been saying consistently over the last year, we've actually seen some good momentum in the private sector."
"We've seen 4.3 million jobs created, 800,000 this year alone."
Record corporate profits.
"And so that has not been the biggest drag on the economy."""
"While Obama's comments drew widespread scrutiny, Republican candidate Mitt Romney drew far less media attention after openly attacking the hiring of firefighters, police officers, and teachers."
"Speaking in Iowa on Friday, Romney invoked the recent election in Wisconsin to criticize Obama for pushing a measure to help states regain public sector jobs."
He wants to hire more government workers.
"He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers."
Did he not get the message of Wisconsin?
The American people did.
"It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people."""
Attorney General Eric Holder has appointed two prosecutors to head a probe into recent leaks of information on classified government programs.
"Holder announced the investigation after bi-partisan anger over published reports revealing President Obama's secret ""kill list"" as well as the U.S.-Israeli use of cyberweapons to target Iran's nuclear program."
The FBI had already announced a probe of the cyberweapons operation last week.
"That is our big power, our power of delay."
Now people may ask why should the House of Lords exist?
Why should you have a chamber with any power at all if it is not elected?
"And that is a perfectly good question, but there is also, I think, quite a good answer."
You need in any Parliament to get the best results for the country as a whole.
"The proper balance is between democratic accountability with also a large number of Parliamentarians who are not primarily constrained by the political party they belong to, but are able because of their background, having been successful in business, in industry, in the arts, in politics or whatever, are able to make a personal contribution."
"And as long as the elected chamber has the last word, even if it is only after a year or so, then we feel that that balance is being properly maintained."
In the old days the House of Lords was as powerful as the House of Commons.
If you could not persuade the House of Lords then they effectively had a right of veto.
"That progressively became more unacceptable throughout the 20th Century because they are not and have not been an elected chamber, and therefore at the end of the day they are not a democratic assembly."
"So what we have now is a situation where the House of Lords, the most it can do is delay legislation for up to 1 or 2 years."
"That is quite a power to have because sometimes the Government is anxious to get legislation on the statute book and if the House of Lords is disagreeing or blocking, then compromises have to be reached that are acceptable."
Bills come to the House of Commons predominantly.
"They are looked at in various stages, but perhaps not in their entirety."
And then they reach the House of Lords.
"The House of Lords is not duplicating what the Commons does, it is actually going over some aspects of bills which may not have been looked at all."
"The House of Lords is, if you like, supportive in that the House of Lords scrutinises, advises and makes changes if possible to the amendments which come from the House Commons."
"The House of Lords is not a law making body, it is a scrutiniser, it is an advisory body and it advises the Commons on some of the"
legislation which goes through the Commons in an attempt to improve it.
"And often when a bill is being discussed during the Commons it comes to the Lords, the Lords makes some amendments to it; hopes to make improvements."
"Then it goes back to the Commons, to look at again."
"Many times the Commons approve of what the Lords have done and accept the amendments; many times they will not, so they change it back again."
It comes back again to the Lords; the Lords will look at it again.
"But at the end of the day, when you have had this to-ing and fro-ing and the improvement of legislation, the Commons has its say because the Commons is the supreme authority; it is the elected authority."
"But the relationship is there in this bi-cameral Parliament, and this is how it should be."
Parliamentarians are the agents of scrutiny within the United Kingdom's Parliamentary system.
But how do they execute this crucial role and how much influence do they have?
"When a bill is introduced into Parliament it goes through many stages, both in the House of Lords, where I sit, and in the House of Commons."
In the House of Commons a small committee will look at the detail line by line.
In the House of Lords any single Member can propose an amendment to a bill and it has to be debated and looked at.
So there are lots of opportunities to change the bill.
"But perhaps where that falls down is that, in most cases, the Government whips will not want to see too many changes to their bills."
"Creating official tweets official websites, where you could see exact calls to meeting."
"I'd like you to tell me if it was easy for you to get that information, if there was any tension, how the whole thing evolved..."
It's complicated.
JL:
"Yes, it's complicated."
"I can give you lots of good examples, and one bad one which changed my attitude."
And I think it was the second big day.
The second big day.
We're talking about the 17th or the 18th.
"In an assembly I heard twice, twice, how everyone in the assembly, 1500 people, unanimously approved of demonstrating on the day of reflexion."
"The assembly moderator asked if they knew what they were doing, and if they were sure they wanted to demonstrate and call a demonstration for the Saturday."
And everyone said yes.
I informed about that immediately through Twitter about the demonstration call on the Saturday.
"From the moment that was decided in the assembly, it went through the legal commission, the communication group, and they decided"
NOT to call the demonstration because it would bring them too many legal problems.
"So they denied that the assembly had made that agreement, they said they would be there, but that they didn't call upon anyone to go."
"As they were denying that, the communication group denied to me that the assembly had decided to demonstrate, and they started calling everyone who had said the assembly had made that decision manipulators, rather than explaining it another way."
"I understand that kind of thing, no-one's asking the Puerta del Sol communication group or the legal commission to work as a large corporation press office, I can't ask that of them, but from that first moment you realise that if you really want to inform of the shades of what's happening there, you have to spend hours and hours there, experiencing it first hand and not allowing any official press release to tell you what's going on."
Just like in the rest of the world.
"But it's more in this case, because it's much more complex."
"From that moment on I knoew that the key to everything was in the legal commission, in the commision to dynamize assemblies, in the commission coordination group... what the 15M was, and what it was going to be, was developed in these work groups."
And I just did my job and worked hard talking to people and meeting people.
Calling and having coffee with people.
Meeting people who understood that journalists are not always dangerous or have bad intentions.
And from then on I was able to write reports of my own.
"And in a few years, read them, share them, check them, criticise them, and see that I took a chance."
"Reports like the first 40 hours of Sol, many hours going through non-official channels to inform about what was happening."
"Or a report, also very sensitive, that I titled:"
"""The Sol camp, trapped in itself"", about the problem that arose regarding if they should camp or not."
"Obviously you have to talk to a lot of people and be very careful not to hurt feelings, to avoid taking anything to the category of definitive, because nothing was definitive- or official- there."
"But on the other hand, while I say that all the journalistic work was done getting around the official channels, on the other hand regarding diffusion and communication, the heights that the 15M got to in social networks was spectacular."
The community management in Twitter from @acampadasol is spectacular.
So that established the supremacy of Parliament over the Monarch.
Parliament is rich in history and its continuity has been a great strength but how does that weight of history impact the way Parliament conducts its affairs in the 21st century?
We are a people who grasp the importance of symbolism and history.
"We do not do it simply through weakness, nostalgia or conservatism; we do it because it holds our nation together."
"It is like a web; it holds each and every one of us together, and it holds our country together."
"And it is good that we have some of the traditions and symbolism of past years; for example, the State Opening of Parliament by the Queen in the House of Lords."
"It is not the Queen's address, it is the Government's address, it is the Government's legislative programme that is enunciated there."
In the House of Commons on the green carpet there are two red stripes in front of the frontbench.
The frontbenches are two sword lengths and a foot away.
"In the old days Members would get out their swords, 'en garde!' They would be unhappy about parleying, about talking and they would get a bit rough with each other."
"And so we have this symbolism; the symbolism of the Speaker's procession every day through Central Lobby and most importantly, the carrying of the mace."
The mace is the symbol of the Monarch in Parliament.
These are traditions which we still cling to and I know full well from my experience that these are the traditions that the people of this country like to cling to and certainly enjoy.
"So how does Parliament go about its work, be it reform or proposing and passing new legislation?"
"The Government of the day drawn from the political party with the majority of MPs after an election, or a coalition of parties, seeks to drive the country forward using its own legislative agenda."
The government runs the country.
Parliament acts as a check and a scrutiny body on the people who run the country.
There is a very clear distinction between Parliament and Government; not as clear however as in the United States.
In the United States they have the separation of powers.
It is a fundamental doctrine.
The President cannot be in Congress nor can any Members of his Government.
But nor can any individual Senator or Congressman be Members of an American cabinet.
We do not use that system.
"It is a very different system but we still draw a distinction because although the members of Government are Members of Parliament,"
Parliament is far more than just those MPs who are Ministers.
"At any one time there are a maximum of 70 or 80 Members of Parliament who are in the Government, but there are almost 600 who are not."
"So if Parliament disagrees with the Government then Parliament can, as it has done on many occasions over the years, refuse to go along with what the Government wishes."
"At the end of the day the Government is the servant of Parliament, not the other way around."
"Parliamentarians, with their areas of expertise and interest, are the crucial actors in this process as they scrutinise the work of the Government, representing their party and constituents ."
The MPs in the House of Commons have a dual role both in representing their constituents and acting as legislators.
"MPs have the power to advocate and represent on behalf of those who have little power themselves; their constituents, working and living in their constituency."
"But MPs also have the power to formulate the legislation, to make the laws and to determine the priorities for government, including the spending priorities and what the country does internationally."
Around that you'll see the
Performance Management and how we use all our vast scores of information and data to frame and demonstrate our valuable outcomes in ways that meet both our network's and external audience's needs.
It's important to note that it goes from the federal level to state to local levels and then back up to the state and federal levels as well.
There is complete accountability at all levels in the network.
"That's all that I had for the Community Services Block Grant presentation, but there's a number of questions that have come in that I will be running through, and the first thing to note is that these slides will be sent out as an addition to the webinar."
These slides will be sent out after the presentation.
So the first question refers to the chart about the Community Services Block Grant figures and whether there could also be a chart that compares the House numbers and the Senate numbers.
We communicate through the StateOfPoverty.org.
That's our NASCSP online blog.
As soon as we have those exact figures from the Senate and the House we'll be posting those on our blog to run through the comparisons of the different numbers.
"In addition, when we get the final fiscal year 2013 numbers we'll also be sure to share those with you as well so that you can see how they match up to previous years and any potential future proposals."
Another question that we had was about open competition on the President's budget.
The competition specifically in regards to those core federal standards.
It speaks to how the states will be required to implement immediate open competition to serve the affected communities.
I think that language is important to note.
It also describes how the current distribution of funds to states and territories and tribes will be maintained.
So it
looks as though the system that they're proposing would include competition within the states but not competition among the states.
"However, I want to put a caveat on that as I say it to say that this is simply a proposal in the budget request in that this language could change and could be shaped differently once it gets put into legislative language and it goes through Congress as well."
There's another question about states that receive the minimum allocation of Community Services Block Grant funds.
That formula is really put together by the office of Community Services.
They could tell you why each state is receiving the amount that they're proposed to receive.
I don't have specific information on that formula but I will certainly be looking into it and will get back to you with more information on that.
Brad:
"You have a question, Mark."
Todd Richardson asks if you can tell us why the President dislikes Community Action Network.
When did he begin to want to end our work?
Mark:
Well that's a very interesting question.
It was two years ago that the President mentioned in the
"State of the Union Address that he was going to propose cuts in his budget to things that were, ""near and dear to his heart"", like Community Action."
I can't speak to the President and whether he likes or dislikes the program.
"In less than a decade, forced evictions have become a reality to over a quarter million Cambodians."
Communities at risk are now documenting injustice and resistance with video.
"By raising their voices above the bulldozers, video is forcing dialogue and accountability."
"In the wake of the Cambodian civil war, Dr. Pong (...) Kek (??) created the organization LlCADHO to promote human rights and monitor violations."
"Since partnering with WlTNESS in 2007, LlCADHO has been working with video to create change for communities at risk of being illegally forced from their homes."
"We have to show to, first of all, our government, to the Cambodian public and to the international community... what is really happening in Cambodia."
And the evidence is taken by the video-camera so this is evidence that nobody can deny.
LlCADHO and WlTNESS are amplifying voices working to provide justice to the families affected country-wide
Right now there are 50 cameras in 18 provinces in the hands of community organizers trained by LlCADHO and WlTNESS.
One of those is the Venerable Luon Sovath... a monk whose village was forcefully evicted in 2009.
He has been documenting the on-going violence and rallying communities to stand up for their rights.
We are trying to teach and train the community to persevere using non-violence to gain justice... in order to claim our land back.
"Video is the source of information, and information is a community's power."
After people see the inustice through picture and video... we believe things will change.
Since exposing the truth of what happened to his village Venerable Sovath continues to produce videos... regardless of on-going threats from the government of being disrobed and imprisoned.
"Now known as the ""multimedia monk,"" the Venerable advocates for non-violent forms of resistance."
LlCADHO's work has resulted in documentation of the forcibly evicted that would otherwise have gone untold.
"Demanding action from audiences in Cambodia and worldwide, these are powerful tools for justice."
Let's go through an example.
In the last lessons you may have noticed our examples have been centered around social science.
"Like social networking, with the cloud example and your engagement in class."
But in this lesson and the next we'll be using a lot of examples from the fields of biology and medicine.
Since statistics is heavily used in those fields as well.
"I drew a finch here, and that's because this next example deals with the beak width of finches."
"Specifically, scientist have looked at finches to make hypotheses about evolution."
"By mapping a trait over time, like beak width."
We can tell if the environment is selecting for a particular size of beak width.
Maybe there's a particular beak size that better help this finch survive.
But sometimes there are random fluctuation in beak width due to variation in the population.
Some finches just have bigger beak widths than others.
Therefore to determine whether there is a significant change in beak width within the population over time.
We need to use statistics.
They're all different kinds of scenarios you can come up with here.
"The thing to note there is it's such a simple enhancement to TV, yet it makes it so much more interactive."
"So all of your TV, all of the Internet and a way to find everything you watch, want everything you want to watch, as well as the way to integrate the TV and"
Internet together.
"One last thing I'm happy to announce, soon we'll be bringing tens of thousands of the same applications you can get on your mobile phone to your TV."
We're going to be launching support for Android Market in early 2011.
"TV, a full web, tens of thousands of applications."
Google TV gives you access to more entertainment than any other living room device you've ever experienced.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Brittany."
So that was phenomenal.
I think you've seen two really
historic things today.
"The first, of course, with Google Television, you saw--and it happened so fast, you got used to it--you saw an active browser with a picture and picture window of the screen show that you would or previously selected in your web search."
"You also saw in the selection in search that you had five television shows, 230 YouTube videos and 5,000 other sites that you could visit over Star Trek."
"All of a sudden, we can combine the two together."
"The other thing that's happening is because this is a Chrome-based solution, talking about browsers, you can actually program this, and it'll be possible, over time, to actually write programs and program your television to do exactly what you've always wanted to do rather than just yelling at it, which is what most people do."
"So--and in Hugo's presentation, you saw the ultimate extension of what we could do technologically by having people who, at least in theory, can't speak the same language, literally being able, with a little bit of help, to communicate and do an economic transaction on the shoe department."
"The important thing here is that these are things that were the stuff of science fiction a few years ago, and now they are very, very real."
So what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the political context of all of this.
And then talk a little bit about the future and then take your questions or comments.
And thank you--thank you both again.
"The Internet is creating a great Internet disruption, and that disruption is changing so many things."
It's affecting so many of us in so many different ways.
It's--there are many quotes in this.
"Joseph Schumpeter called it the ""perennial gale of creative destruction,"" that over and over again, some assumption that we had is no longer true and a new assumption takes forth."
And the Internet has replaced the economics of scarcity.
How difficult it is to get to things with the economics of ubiquity.
You have to be everywhere.
You have to be--you have to be all over everywhere all the time.
"And any business that's built on controlling or restricting the flow of information is having difficulty, whereas businesses that are about popularizing information, getting it as broadly as possible, tend to benefit in this new world, and you see this from our technology."
"And all of these disruptions are both terrifying and exciting, especially, obviously, for the incumbents that are affected by this very seriously."
I'll call it P1.
"That x 1.1 ... x 1.1 is going to be equal to $660,000, when you factor in the 10% inflation over these years."
This is simple algebra right here.
You can divide both sides by 1.1.
"Divide both sides by 1.1, and we get, these cancel out, you get the price of that house in year 1; $66 divided by 11 would be 6."
"You could work it out with a calculator, if you don't feel comfortable with what I'm about to do, but this would give you $600,000, if you work this math right out here, and you could figure out the decimals."
What we could do ...
I think you get the general idea here.
You can use your calculator.
"I did this one in my head, but the general idea is, a house in year 1 that is $600,000, $600,000, if you factor in the devaluing of the currency, or how much more expensive everything got, in year 5 would cost $660,000."
"You might hear someone say, when they're talking about inflation, or they're talking about price increases,"
"""This house in year 5 is $660,000,"
"""which is equal to $600,000 in year 1 money."""
"As an example of that, I live in a neighborhood where the houses have gotten all of a sudden, because I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, it's not a fancy neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination, but the houses now are quite expensive, and we have neighbors who moved in in the '50s, and they say, ""My God; I bought our house"
"""for $10,000, and now people"
"""are selling these houses for so much more."""
"The reality is, is that it is true; the house has appreciated, but $10,000 in 1950 was actually a lot, a lot, of money."
Doctors and engineers did not make that much more than that much per year.
I don't know the exact amount.
"The reality is that you actually have to adjust money for the year that you're talking about, and you have to adjust it for inflation."
"If you believe this 10% inflation number, hopefully people's incomes also increased by the same amount, so the same person with the same skills and the same job, who could afford the house for $600,000 in year 1 could now pay $660,000 for it, and it won't take an unusually large chunk of their expenditure."
It would take the same chunk that it did in year 1.
"Hopefully that clarifies things a little bit, and I'll, in the future, do more videos, going into the details of inflation."
Only rarely is there an opportunity to participate in a molecular happening.
"You are going to have that opportunity for this film attempts to portray symbolically, yet in a dynamic and joyful way, one of nature's fundamental processes- the linking together of amino acids to form a protein."
We know now that the three dimensional structure and the function of a protein is determined by the order of amino acids along the backbone of the molecule.
So protein synthesis involves programming and assembly and this film with people portraying molecules using the dance idiom tries to animate these two processes— the programming and assembly of a protein.
"Our genes carry the instructions for ordering the amino acids of each protein, those instructions are encoded in a messenger molecule and RNA depicted in this film as a long snaking chain."
Each of the message units is played by three adjacent people in the chain.
"Colored head balloons indicate the bases— green for guanine, blue for uracil, yellow for adenine."
"If there is a message, there must be a way to translate that message."
That's the job of the ribosome and of the transfer RNAs.
"So that, you know, what's going to happen to that"
PVC pipe that exists in your house when your building gets torn down?
What's going to happen to the copper piping that delivers the water?
"Well, the PVC pipe, you can almost be assured is going to be either burned or it's going to be discarded in a"
landfill.
But the copper piping is highly likely to be recycled because of its market value.
So differences in these programs are normally associated with the way that they allocate credits or points to buildings for different purposes.
"But they really are quite similar in their attempt to promote energy conservation, concern for chemical life cycles, as well as human health."
"So the Green Building Council evolved, beginning in 1993."
And this is what I want to focus on now for the remainder of the session.
"And it is a voluntary nonprofit organization that has no government affiliation, although it was started by a grant from the U.S."
Energy Department.
"So this is created with a board of directors that include people that have expertise in architecture and engineering as well as some of the largest development firms, construction firms, in the nation."
There are really not a number of people on this board or on the staff that have deep environmental or health expertise.
And its orientation has predominantly been to promote energy efficiency.
"They claim that the benefits of this leadership in energy and environmental design, which is what the LEED acronym stands for, that it has three predominant purposes."
One is to promote environmental quality.
The second is economic development to basically stimulate a new type of building and new building materials that are more environmentally responsible.
Sorry about the noise.
And also to promote healthy lifestyles within buildings and communities.
"And by healthy lifestyles within a building,"
I'll give you one example.
"A colleague of mine works at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and they have a relatively new building."
"And just as a healthy lifestyle attribute, they decided that instead of putting a staircase in the back of the building and the elevator right near the front door when people walked in, that they would reverse that."
"So the elevator was put in the back and the staircase was surrounded by glass panels that made it really light, sunlight steams through and attractive."
"So that people, when they go into the building, normally walk up the stairs, a seven- or eight- story building."
So that this individual who directed the National Center for
"Environmental Health told me that he and his staff, that nobody uses the elevator, everybody goes up and down the stairs."
"So it saves energy, the elevator is not used much."
"And it also is healthy, it's burning up calories."
So that the purpose of LEED falls into a variety of categories.
"One is sustainable sites, another is water efficiency, another is energy and atmosphere, another is materials and resources."
[laughter]
"And in later years, he said he so enjoyed himself reading Blackstone during that period that he decided to become a lawyer right there and then."
Okay.
It's this one lone little reading calm student in the midst of not a lot of other reading calm students from what
I could tell.
"Unlike that little Blackstone student, a volunteer company of about seventy Yale students-- which is roughly half of the student body at that point-- formed to fight."
They were led by Captain James Hillhouse.
He is indeed New Haven Hillhouse.
"He was a Yale graduate of a few years before, so he's not that much older than these men."
"And a Yale senior, who ends up being one of these fighting Yale students, offers an account of what happened at this point."
He says--He notes that troops landed in the south part of West
"Haven, ""about five miles from the center of the town."
"College was of course broken up and the students, with many of the inhabitants, prepared to flee on the morrow into the neighboring country."
"To give more time for preparation and especially for the removal of goods, a volunteer company of about a hundred young men was formed, not with the expectation of making any serious stand against such a force, but simply of retarding or diverting its march."""
"So these students formed; they don't think they're going to beat the British, but maybe they can delay them a"
little bit.
"""In common with others of the students,"
"I was one of the number, and I well remember the surprise we felt the next morning (July 5) as we were marching over West Bridge towards the enemy, to see Dr. Daggett,"" who is the former President of"
"Yale, Naphtali Daggett, who is now a professor of divinity, so he's a Yale professor, ""how surprised we were the next morning, to see Dr. Daggett riding furiously by us on his old black mare with his long fowling piece in his hand ready for action."
"We knew the old gentleman had studied the matter thoroughly and satisfied his own mind as to the right and propriety of fighting it out, but we were not quite prepared to see him come forth in so gallant a style to carry his principles into practice."""
"So, they see this professor go riding off with his gun, going to fight the British, like: 'wow, [laughs] that's pretty impressive.'"
"And I think in the first lecture I mentioned this, and said it was the President of Yale riding out."
"Daggett had retired as President, so for the sake of accuracy, he's now not President but a professor riding off to fight the British with his gun."
So now this student goes on:
"""Giving him a hearty cheer as he passed, we turned down towards West"
"Haven at the foot of the Milford Mills, while he, Daggett, ascended a little to the west and took his station in a copse of wood where he seemed to be reconnoitering the enemy like one who was determined 'to bide his time.'"
"As we passed on towards the south we met an advanced guard of the British, and taking our stand at a line of fence, we fired upon them several times, and then chased them the length of three or four fields as they retreated, until we suddenly found ourselves involved with the main body""--"
"Okay, [laughter] so it was--a couple of soldiers were like: 'get them, uh oh [laughter]--""and in danger of being surrounded."
"It was now our turn to run, and we did for our lives."
Passing by Dr. Daggett [laughs] in his station on the hill we retreated rapidly across West
"Bridge, which was instantly taken down by persons who stood ready for the purpose to prevent the enemy from entering the town by that road."""
Okay.
"These are, by no means all of the potential applications."
"And I'm only going to give you, an example or two in each category."
"As a way to get you thinking about, the potential in these areas and the different kinds of approaches that might be involved."
The first example is something called Zamzee that comes from an organization called Hope Labs and Hope Labs is a non-profit that uses games and game-like systems for better health outcomes.
"So they do some wonderful work around using serious games for cancer patient recovery, but what I'm gonna focus on now is something that they make called the Zamzee."
And the Zamzee is a little device.
"That, is, an accelerometer that keeps track of how active you are."
How many steps you take when you walk up steps and so forth.
And so it measures your physical fitness activity.
"So therefore, it's similar to the Nike plus system that I mentioned earlier."
And also to the Fit Bit system that some of you may be familiar with but Zamzee is interesting.
Because it's targeted at low income teenagers.
There's a terrible problem in the United States about obesity and sedentary
lifestyles among low income communities and especially young people.
So Zamzee is an attempt to focus in on that problem using this device.
And it works the way you might expect.
"You get your activity level tracked, and based on that you earn points, and you can unlock badges for various kinds of achievements, you can level up and you can win various kinds of rewards or, or earn various kinds of rewards based on your points and so forth."
Standard kind of set of game mechanics that we've seen throughout the class.
"But what HopeLabs has been able to show is that this device, which is designed in a way that's focused in again on these particular communities, actually produces real results."
So they did a randomized study of 350 teenagers in this community and found a 30 percent increase in activity levels with the Zamzee.
"So that's an example of something which the, again the same basic device, the same basic mechanics get used in commercial applications but it can be targeted and focus in on achieving a social benefit."
We've seen several other health and wellness applications already in the course.
The Kia system for wellness activities by people in enterprises.
Fitocracy to get people to work out and go to the gym more.
"Here is another one, though, that's a"
little bit different.
"This is something caller Superbetter which is, a, a product of Jane McGonigal's company which is also called Super Better."
And Superbetter is about improving people's life.
Allowing people to overcome illnesses and to motivate themselves around these kinds of health challenges using gamification.
"So she developed it after she had a concussion that's why her character you see here is Jane the concussion slayer and she created her own little game for motivating her to engage with family and friends, and to go through the various kinds of steps that she needed for recovery."
"And Superbetter is an attempt to generalize that for all kinds of situations where people have health problems that they are trying to overcome, or otherwise trying to improve their situation."
And it uses things like quests.
"Back in about 1955 or so, a forward thinking atmospheric scientist started measuring the carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere right here at 11,000 feet on Mauna Loa on the big island of Hawaii."
And he chose that because there you're about 2500 miles out from any continent.
"The atmosphere has been well mixed by the trade winds, and you're going to get a very, very well mixed sort of standard signal that's not contaminated by any local industry or anything like that."
This is what it looks like.
"This is the Mauna Loa direct measurement signal over here, and these are inferences of past levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere."
"This is parts per million by volume in the atmosphere, over here."
And you can see that there's a signal that human industrial activity has been increasing carbon dioxide level arguably since the late nineteenth century-- okay?--and it's accelerating upward.
These are from ice core measurements that are done mostly in Greenland by Danes and Swiss who go to Greenland and bore down through the icecap.
"Now let's put that in perspective, okay?"
"So this is today and this is 500 million years ago, and these are all different kinds of measurements of carbon dioxide through the last 550 million years."
"And the 30 million year filter is--this is a moving average, a 30 million year moving average--and basically what it shows is that most of the time the earth has had a lot more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than it currently has; much more than anything that has been contributed by human activity and industry in the last 150 years."
"This is estimated by various different methods, and it has a couple of striking features."
Look what happens to carbon dioxide between the Ordovician and the Carboniferous.
It is sucked out of the atmosphere.
Where do you think it went?
Student:
Over there.
Prof:
Some.
Some went into reefs.
It went into your gas tank.
That's when oil and coal were made.
"So when land plants first evolved--and that was when- that was the first big forest, planet covering forest, and it was warm and moist-- in those carboniferous swamps, you know, generation after generation, for thousands of generations of plants, built up."
"Then there's an interesting re-injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the Permian, and it happens particularly at the end-Permian crisis, and this re-injection then does have the oceanic element."
Okay?
"So some of that stuff did get stored,"
"like in the Black Sea, right here, and then with the end-Permian extinction and the breakup of Pangaea and the re-ordering of the oceanic circulation patterns it got re-injected."
Then throughout the Mesozoic--so throughout the time that the earth was dominated by dinosaurs and their other relatives-- it was pretty warm and plants could really grow.
"They were getting--by the way, carbon dioxide is a fairly good fertilizer; so plants do grow more rapidly when they have more of it, if they aren't being limited by some other nutrient."
"And then when we get into the last 65 million years, here, carbon dioxide is going down, down, down, until we get to what we perceive as the normal concentration-- right?--the normal concentration being down here."
"Well it was a lot higher, for a long period of time."
I think there's an important message in that.
"On this couch we have had talkes about the importance of planting the world's deserts and there's a lot of desert in Africa, about 9 million square kilometers of desert infact"
"Now ... if they were green, perhaps there wasn't a great need to go up here in order to take over our values then perhaps it was..."
"Well, I think of the fact that you want to make small units strong and if that was to be spread all over the world .. then it also has something to do with the simple infrastructure and where to get food from"
Ole:
"Yes, but it's easy enough to turn desert development for the're made ​​of things we have done ourselves, right? and at the same time we have to look at the fact that the entire world population could be fed by an arial equivalent to france so we're not really that bad of yet.."
Martin:
"But in the middle of the Sahara, they are.."
"They are, and therefore we must make Sahara fertile it would be a great picture and we can easily do that"
Martin:
"And you would be willing to spread the Danish society, perhaps not as it is now, but in some ideal version, places around the world?"
Ole:
"At some point, I would say that the Danish ... and Scandinavian ... not only the Danish .. came closest to an ideal society that has existed such a relatively stable society seen in world history partly because, after second World War the right and the left wing, stood together deciding that people who could not support themselves was in their right to recieve govermental support"
"It was not a charity, it's about to change into now, right."
In the Baroque period they started to give civil rights ..
"The ""soras theorists"" fought for that.. you get political rights in the 1800 century and in the 1900 century, voting and so on and finally after the second World War Il, you get the social rights"
Martin:
"But there are some fundamental problems that we also need to look into today, in order to resolve them"
One is technological unemployment which means the more machines we get the less work there is !!
The second is the combination of democracy and market as democracy hasn't been standing alone since ancient greece
It is the combination of free market forces that does that you have advertising that manipulates around with people you have messages that are becoming more and more superficial for everyone to understand them and you have journalists and spin doctors who sit in all the management positions and you have the media talking down to people
This issue we probably also need to be addresseing too?
What do you say?
Ole:
"Yes, we have a terrible problem in the fact that we don't even own our country"
"If I had that much power, we should also be able to impose the small units but these small units would of course also be knowledge, culture and information-units and ie. on those that type of advertising would rebound because it did not fit their reality but again one must be careful that it doesn't accomplish a totalitarianism"
Martin:
But you have only until 21.12 so I guess it can not avoid becoming a totalitarianism?
Ole:
"No, it is very totalitarian..."
Martin:
"Norway, for example, already has these units cause they have their little villages and has a right to theater, public swimming baths and other things"
"Great things happens, especially culturally out in those small communities"
"In appointing the prosecutors, Holder rebuffed calls from lawmakers to appoint an independent special counsel outside of his office's control."
"At a White House news conference on Friday, President Obama rejected suggestions the leaks may have come from his administration to bolster his re-election bid."
The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive.
It's wrong and people I think need to have a better sense of how I approach this office and of how the people around me approach this office.
"Wildfires are continuing to spread through parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming as high temperatures fan the flames."
"The High Park Fire in Colorado has already scorched more than 20,000 acres of land amid high winds and temperatures above 90 degrees."
"More than 1,800 people have been evacuated across the four states."
New figures meanwhile show 2012 continues to be the warmest year on record in the United States.
"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this spring has been the warmest of all time and last month was the second-warmest May since record-keeping began more than a century ago."
The average temperature for the 48 states not including Alaska and Hawaii from March through May was more than five degrees higher than the 20th century average.
New figures show this year's military suicide rate is on pace to reach a record high.
"The Pentagon says there have been at least 154 suicides among active-duty troops through last Thursday, a rate of nearly one each day."
The figure marks an 18 percent increase over the same period a year ago.
More U.S. soldiers have died by taking their own lives than been killed on the battlefield.
Spain has agreed to accept a European Union bailout offer of up to $125 billion dollars for its debt-ridden banks.
The move makes Spain the fourth and largest European country to accept emergency international aid as part of the continent-wide sovereign debt crisis.
"Details on the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, with no mention of new austerity measures that have sparked an uproar across Europe."
"After the bailout was announced, demonstrators with Spain's Indignado movement gathered in Madrid to protest."
We are saying that this is a scam precisely because the aid should not be for the banks.
It should be for the citizens who are the most affected by this crisis.
Not the bankers.
I don't think they are doing as bad as the citizens.
"The crisis has its origin in the markets not in the citizens."""
"In Iraq, at least six people have been killed and 38 wounded in a bombing of a crowded square in Baghdad."
The attack targeted a gathering of Shi'ite Muslim pilgrims.
"Hundreds of a people rallied in the Chilean capital of Santiago on Sunday to protest the screening of a new film honoring the late military dictator, Augusto Pinochet."
"The premiere of the film, titled ""Pinochet"", drew a number of former ministers and army generals who served under his regime."
"Protesters came under assault from supporters of the film, who threw rocks, eggs and red paint at the large crowd."
"Lorena Pizarro, head of a group representing victims of the regime, denounced the attacks on protesters."
"They are violators of human rights and today this is the only response that they have: to suppress us, to be violent towards us, to mistreat us and abandon [their country]."
"They, those genociders are inside the [theater]."""
"Three people were killed in Auburn, Alabama on Sunday after an argument at an apartment complex turned violent."
"And so what we see happening in our school system is by the time people get to 8th or 9th grade, they're taking algebra, they're smart kids, they have a great algebra teacher, but they're still flunking algebra because they have that 10 percent gap from 5th grade math, that 15 percent gap from 4th grade math."
So the way we're doing it is we're actually teaching math the way you would teach anything else.
If you learned to ride a bicycle you would stay on that bicycle until you master the bicycle before you try a motorcycle or a unicycle or anything more advanced.
So what we're doing is we're making sure every kid has all of their gaps filled.
So they literally start at one plus one equals two and they don't move on until they have 100 percent mastery.
Dylan:
"Very quickly, Ben, what do you see is the barrier to scaling this?"
Ben:
"I think it's money, getting Khan Academy the resources they need to fill out their programming and then getting school districts to adopt a pretty innovative solution."
"I think teachers are going to want this, it's going to help them do their job and I think given what we're facing, as I said 50 percent of a 600,000 person school district is looking to not graduate from high school, there aren't more jobs for high school dropouts right now."
This must be adopted.
Dylan:
"Listen I wholeheartedly agree and I thank you Ben Goldhirsh as America's thoughtful southern Californian for bringing that to our attention and Salman it's a true pleasure to meet you, congratulations on what you've achieved up to this point and do let us know what we can help you with in the future."
"Check out all of it, of course, on GOOD's website."
The very active capturing a photograph digitally introduces some softness into the photo.
"If you shoot JPEGs, your digital camera probably tries to correct for that but if you shoot raw photos that was come out of your camera uncorrected and without sharpening treatment."
"To compensate for the inherent softness in a digital photo, particularly raw photo, you can specify sharpening settings here in the Detail panel of Lightroom's Develop module."
This is the same Detail panel that
I showed you in the last movie on noise reduction.
"If your Detail panel isn't open, you can open it by clicking the triangle on the right of the Detail header."
Before you start with the sharpening settings you do wanna come down to the noise reduction section and tweak those settings because otherwise you might end up sharpening specs of digital noise.
Now before I show you how to change the sharpening settings keep in mind that its fine in many cases to leave these settings at their defaults.
There are couple of reasons for that.
First of all if you're working with a raw file.
The sharpening controls are on and by default they are applying some sharpening.
And if you're working with a JPEG as I said your camera probably already applied some sharpening and in that case the default for the sharpening controls will be zero for that reason.
"Moreover, this is just the first stage of sharpening."
This is sometimes call capture sharpening and as I said its purpose is just to compensate for the softness that you get by shooting a photo digitally.
"Later, when you're ready to output a copy of the photo for print or for viewing online, you'll do more sharpening."
And that sharpening will be geared specifically toward that particular kind of output that you have in mind.
You might be doing that in Lightroom's Print Module or Lightroom's Export Dialog box both of which are covered later in this course or if you brought your photo into
Photoshop to do your final work there you'll do some export sharpening in

Unless you're faced with a disability you don't think about the needs of people with disabilities.
People are not scroungers who are on disability especially people with MS.
"I would prefer to be earning a living wage, rather than on disability but unfortunately"
I've got MS and there's nothing I can do about it.
Hello I'm Danni
I'm the Senior Public Affairs Officer at the MS Society and we're here today to hand in a letter to the Minister for Disabled People regarding our concerns about Personal Independence Payment.
"46,000 people with MS will be shifted from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payment and at the moment the government are getting that wrong, the criteria they're using are too narrow, so too many people with MS will lose out if we can't get the government to change the criteria."
"We've had over 4,000 signatures, 96% of all MPs have seen our letter and over 25 MPs have signed the letter."
"There's a few of us here today, representing the 4,000 people."
It's a chance for us to be heard.
We feel so strongly about it; we've got to make a stand.
There's one particular issue where I and the MS Society have a real problem;
"If you can't walk in a safely, timely or regular manner above 20 metres then you should get the higher rate mobility ."
Currently that's only a guideline; that's not good enough.
Well I'm concerned about losing my freedom because I've got a Motability vehicle which is at risk.
"What I'm lobbying the government, very, very strongly with -"
- with the MS Society - is to move that to a regulation.
"If it's a regulation; the assessors have to follow it and that will mean our anxiety, our real anxiety, that many people with MS would lose higher rate of mobility, which would mean they lose their Motability car will not be an issue."
"If I lose the DLA; I lose my car, and then I lose my independence."
No car; I'm pretty much stuck in the house.
"So effectively, in the long-run if A goes up faster than the marginal product of labor diminishes, then overall quantity can increase even though k, the underlying level of land, is fixed."
"That's what Malthus missed, is that there's two factors going on over time."
"The marginal product of labor's falling, it's true, for a given plot of land."
"But we're making each plot of land so much more productive, it's overcoming that."
"And as a result, food production is actually rising per capita."
"So since 1950, world food consumption per capita has gone up 40%."
"Despite the fact that the Earth's not gotten any bigger, and despite the fact the population's grown a"
lot over that time.
And basically this huge increase of agricultural productivity has overcome the diminishing marginal product of labor.
There's actually a great little box in the Perloff Text about a single individual and his contributions to that.
A scientist who led what's called the Green Revolution.
"He experimented in Mexico with different methods of improving agricultural productivity, and then essentially brought those to Southeast Asia--"
"India, Pakistan and other places."
"And they estimate, saved about a billion lives through the increase in agriculture productivity he made possible for this Green Revolution in Southeast Asia."
"Really, just changed the entire trajectory of that part of the world through the agricultural productivity improvements that he put in place."
"So it's very interesting putting a personal face on this impersonal letter A, how one scientist can really make a difference in that case."
"This also leads to the larger question which this course doesn't spent a lot of time on, but which is more of a macro question, which is what determines the overall standard of living in our country?"
"The standard of living in our country, that is basically for a given level of labor we supply, what determines the"
"level of our utility, of our social welfare, given how much"
labor we can supply?
"Well, ultimately, what's going to determine-- or another way to think of it is what determines the amount of stuff we can have for a given amount of labor effort we put in?"
"Well, that's society's productivity."
Society's productivity is how much more we can have for each given level of labor input.
So what determines how much stuff we can have?
"Well, it's k and A. Given a fixed amount of labor input, given how much we work, what determines how much stuff we can have, with how much capital we have, and how productively we make use of it?"
"Now, productivity in the US has followed a very interesting trend."
"So productivity, which is how much we produce for a given amount of inputs, has followed an interesting trend."
"From World War II until about 1973, productivity grew rapidly in the US."
Productivity grew at about 2.3% per year-- 2.4% per year-- from the end of World War II through 1973.
"That is, working no harder and having no more machines, we can consume 2.4% more stuff every single year."
That's pretty impressive.
"That means we can just sit around, work no harder than we were, and have no more machines, and produce 2.4% more per year."
"This is not formal guidance, but it's provided as tips for how agencies can deal with legacy content on shared drives."
And also think about day-forward planning procedures for the proper management of shared drives.
I've emphasized that these best practices and tips can be used for that cleanup process before records are moved to an electronic record-keeping system that may be able to automate many of these responsibilities and steps.
These high-level steps are shown on this slide.
"They include planning the project, identifying key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities, evaluating the current state of the shared drive within the agency, identifying and removing unwanted content, managing the content, and developing day-forward policies and procedures."
"When developing a project plan for organizing shared drives, consider these following items here."
Developing a communications plan can be helpful to tell others in the agency about what records management is planning so that they can be involved and know the purpose and scope of the project.
"Also identifying the shared drives that are candidates for organization, or that need to be organized."
And this can show where to focus energies.
Identifying and procuring and services or technologies to assist in the process.
"If procuring a contractor, this could include conducting a market survey, interviewing vendors, and preparing a statement of work."
"Once you've identified the shared drive and have the technology or contractor available, you can conduct a pilot to test the process and develop rules for the rest of the organization for how this can be done."
Paulette Murray:
Beth?
Beth Cron:
Yes?
Paulette Murray:
"It looks like we have two questions in the chat, if you want to tackle those quickly."
Beth Cron:
I'm seeing that.
"The question is, ""What is the NARA status of using auto-classification to assist in the shared drive cleanup?"
"Is it acceptable?"""
"Yes, this is something I'll address in the next few slides."
Auto-classification tools can be helpful in doing this process of running queries.
Having the technology or the software group related records can make the organization process much easier.
So we'll talk about that.
"In our own shared drive cleanup project at the National Archives, we used some tools to run queries on a shared drive."
The records officer Susan Sullivan led this records project.
We used the tool to help us identify the content that should be managed and the content that is either non-record or had met its disposition time.
"The next question is, ""Is it highly suggested that the records management be granted access to shared drives?"
"Should this be in policy?"""
I would say that is something that would be determined at the agency level.
- there is a number for everything these days - and you might have heard of Dunbar's number; who has?
"OK, good."
Dunbar's number is essentially a cognitive limit to the number of people one can have or maintain stable social relationships with.
Any guesses how big is that number?
One?
No.
How much?
49.
"OK, we're getting closer."
"It turns out it's 150, which, if you think, is not that little."
"So if previously, when you were counting your friends and people you like to talk with, if you counted more like 49 or 60, even if you got it up to 100, you can see that there is still quite some space or room for enlargement, so to say, of mind and heart in respect to other people, which leads me to the next question."
So how do you establish and maintain a meaningful relationship?
It seems that it doesn't happen in these business card swapping and bar hopping occasions.
It seems that relationships that are meaningful or serious are grounded in meaningful experiences.
Let me explain you what I think these ways are or what these experiences  that bond us are.
"Let me explain it with a simple diagram, sort of my take  on Maslow's pyramid of needs, and I apologize for such a cliche, but, you know, whatever works, as Woody Allen would say."
"What we have at the bottom of that pyramid, I would say, are random social gatherings."
"You can get to know people in public spaces: bars, nightclubs, or events."
"Usually, in those circumstances, a considerable amount of alcohol is used, and not without a reason, because you might have noticed that with every next drink you become more sociable, and people become more interesting, and you can certainly form at least some type of relationships that way, but you might've also noticed that these are not the most lasting relationships, so I wouldn't suggest you to stay on this biological, so to say, level."
"The next level, I would say, is that of geographical proximity."
"We are friends with people we grow up with, that are right next door from us."
And you certainly do share some basic interests and needs with your neighbours:
"you don't want to be robbed, or you might need to share some home appliance once in a while, and, of course, less and less so, but at least the option of becoming friends with your neighbours is always there, it is physically available."
"But again, as I said, less and less so these days."
"So, the first level, strangers in a bar; the second level, neighbours; the third level, of course, family."
"These are actually people you can rely on, who will show up, most likely, in that hospital."
"Of course, you inherit a certain group of people, and then you add a few more, but then altogether, that is a rather narrow group of people, unless you're working hard on the number of children, or something like that."
"So we move to the next level, and this the level, I would say, the majority of our friendships form, and this is the level where actually our interests bring us together."
"Hopefully, you study what you're interested in, hopefully, at a university you like, hopefully, you ended up working in a field that you're interested in."
This is actually the level that you can spend days and nights talking about subjects that nobody else seems to care about.
"This is where you're bound to run into shared troubles, or find out something, or you create something new."
"It's all great, and altogether, I would say, for many people it's perfectly enough with people and their friends from the combination of these levels."
It's true that we all can make person choices and back away.
"It's true that we might reinvent the net to be a very different type of technology that encourages concentration, it's true that our employers might say 'no don't stay connected all the time go away and think for awhile', but I think you're right."
That all the trends in society point to a continued devaluing of that whole way of thinking that doesn't fit in to our kind of utilitarian kind of problem solving mode.
MAN 3:
"I would like the chance Mr. Norvig a little bit, as much as I admire and respect your research work, I think you made a methodological mistake in you poll because you missed a sort of large part of the population."
"I think a different results would come out of this poll if you ask the chairs of University computer science departments, let's say California State of Dominguez Hills or"
Florida Gulf Coast University or University of Idaho.
"Next maybe I think Google wouldn't hire my students if I told them to get their knowledge from Wikipedia, although it is a very good tool."
"And finally, I think that you have to take a look at Universities which offer degrees online, so there's many more examples, so I would say the question 'Is Google making us stupid?' is a valid question because there is a large segment of the population which is just not getting anything out of this."
And I have a question for Mr. Carr.
You mentioned at the beginning about the probably your very first computation on a machine know to humankind although you didn't call it that way which is the clock.
"Some of these great philosophers like Louis Mouthford or you know media, people like"
"Marshall Mcluhan recognized the changes which a clock makes, I mean enforced on us."
"And they say that we don't eat when we want to eat, but when there is a specific time we go to work at the same time, not because there's a need to work but because there is a time to go to work."
Do you see these tendencies with the internet because this is what they call a big megamachine right?
"And I know this, everybody does now."
PETER NORVlG:
Lets see if we can answer thes two question.
I'll go first.
I think you raise a good point that technology sort of accelerates differentials.
"And that leads now can do better and those who don't have the right education are farther behind, so there's a bigger gap."
I sampled one part of that gap and not the other and that is a very important question for society.
"I think, you know, one of the points over here was 'well people aren't reading books anymore' well that's somewhat true, but now completely."
"Harry Potter sold 4 million copies, the Twilight series, I hate to admit it, sold over 100 million copies"
"My generations equivalent to that, which has been selling for over 50 years would be the Narnia books, and that only sold 120 million copies so I feel so bad I got to go out and buy another whole set."
So in general there is a whole lot of reading going on.
Non-required book reading is going down slightly.
"Sixty-one percent of people said they read a book for pleasure in '92, whose down to 57 percent in 2004."
"Total sales of books are up certainly worldwide literacy is down by fifty percent since the seventies, so, but that's probably more to do with wealth than with literacy per say or the web."
"So, it's mixed; magazine readership is way up, newspapers is down, reading on the web is up."
It's a complicated picture and there's a lot going on.
I thing we do have to try and educated everyone and we have to be creative in the ways we do that.
And so we have shown that Wn is a
Matingale.
"Now let me mention this example is quite complicated, but it was worthwhile introducing because it is easy to generalize this example to the case where you allow random bets on each play of the game, as long as those bets only depend on what you've seen up to that point, you will actually still get a Martingale."
"For a final example, we look at something called Polya's Urn, we won't go through all the details, in fact, you can complete the details yourself."
"Considering urn, which contains red balls and green balls, so we've got some urns like this, there are red balls in there and there are green balls inside this urn."
"And at each time step a ball is chosen randomly from the urn, if the ball is red, then it's returned to the urn with an additional red ball."
"If the ball is green, then it is returned to the urn with an additional green ball."
"So what we're going to do is we're going to see that there are n plus 2 balls in the urn, at time n."
"And this follows, because we begin with two balls, and after every play of the game we add an additional ball, either an additional red ball, or an additional green ball."
"So we have n plus 2 balls in the urn, after time n."
Let Xn denote the number of red balls in the urn after n draws.
"Then, if Xn is equal to k, Xn plus 1 can only take on two possible values, it will take on the value k plus 1, or the value k."
"It will take on the value k plus 1, if the ball withdraw on the nth plus 1 play is a red ball and that will occur with probability k over n plus 2, k because there are k balls-, k red balls in the urn and n plus 2 because n plus 2 is the total number of balls in the urn."
"Likewise Xn plus 1 would be equal to k given Xn equals k, if we draw a green ball, because if we draw a green ball we will not be adding an additional red ball."
"So Xn plus 1 equals k, given Xn equals k that occurs with probability n plus 2 minus k divided by n plus 2."
"And now, what we claim and what you can easily check, is that Mn, which is equal to Xn divided by n plus 2, is a"

Prof:
"Now I want to turn to the lecture, and I'm going to start the lecture with my true confession of the day."
Okay.
I did something a little insane and I'm not entirely sure how this is going to work out.
I did it for you.
"I--Basically, on the syilabus it says that the title of this lecture is ""Citizenship and"
"Leadership"" or ""Leadership and"
"Citizenship."""
I don't even remember which one I put first.
"And initially, my idea had been when I wrote the syilabus for this course before the semester even started-- well, this is going to be a"
"lecture that has something to do with new ways of-- how the Revolution changed people's sense of themselves as citizens, how people were behaving differently because of the approach of Revolution and then because of the fighting of Revolution."
And I was going to talk a little bit about crowd actions and about how the Revolution itself wouldn't really have been possible without crowd actions.
"I talked, I know, a little bit about mob actions and we've seen some in action."
"So I was basically going to talk about how the Revolution politicized people, how it--on a mass scale for many different kinds of Americans-- brought them in to the public sphere, made them think and act politically in a way that perhaps they hadn't before."
And then I was going to accompany that with a brief discussion about the elite in this environment being on the one hand appreciative of the sort of mass popular involvement because there would be no Revolution without it-- that is the Revolution--but on the other hand they're elite folk so they're all-- some of them at least are a
"In his view, the family and associates of anyone who..."
"Sorry, I've used that word ""commit""... who suicides..."
We have to have a verb in there somewhere;
"I don't like turning nouns into verbs, I'm sorry..."
"So, commits suicide suffer enough grief without having it played out in the news media."
So where I stray from the media party line on reporting suicide is that I think he was right.
I haven't had any personal family brushes with suicide that inform that stance.
It's just my view as a human being who happens to be a journalist.
"They are human beings, believe me."
And as a teacher and media commentator.
"I found it interesting, by the way, that very few people have considered what this does to journalists, yeah, but I think, in Australia, there's the Dart Institute, is doing a lot of work about the trauma that journalists face."
"I mean, we are seen to be inhuman, possibly because of the things that we do, but..."
"So I won't, for what I'm saying today,"
I won't get any thanks from the Commonwealth Press Union
"News Media Freedom Committee, because we're all aware that the Committee, which acts on behalf of newspapers, radio, TV, magazines, has been campaigning for a relaxation of the suicide reporting rules."
"And people like me are expected to sort of fall into line with that, because it does seem on the surface to be a reasonable case for an extension of freedom of expression."
"But I break the rules, partly for the reason given above, and I'll explain the other reasons."
But I'd first like to look at what led to this stand-off between the Ministry of Health and the news media industry.
"It's obviously a lot more relaxed today because of the work that people like SPlNZ are doing, but there is a stand-off situation there, believe me."
"Prior to 1998, the matter of suicide coverage by the media was settled and little debated within the industry, as far as I'm aware."
"The informal, self-regulating benchmark was set in the late '70s by a couple of Press Council decisions against, oddly enough, Sunday News."
The Council upheld complaints about the paper's lurid suicide stories.
"To the best of my knowledge and experience, these became the convention for any subsequent coverage by any kind of media, and we've used them ever since in journalism school when we teach this to students."
"Basically, it's report the name and that death was self-inflicted and nothing more, if you're allowed to do that by your local coroner."
"What happened in '98 was, unfortunately, typical of the way some government bureaucrats regard the news media."
"My wife is one, and I know this personally."
She regards me with great suspicion.
The Ministry of Health issued a report which set out the way journalists should thenceforth report suicide.
"Its mistake, unfortunately, was not consulting the news media itself, which is tantamount to standing on a melting ice floe and poking a starving polar bear with a small stick."
"At that time, the Newspaper Publishers' Association"
"Chief Executive, Phil O'Reilly, he's the man who now pops up for Business New Zealand ubiquitously, a man, I will tell you, who's not far short of a polar bear in stature, and probably equal in terms of reaction time."
"He headed up what could only really be called a retaliatory campaign that not only attacked the Ministry for its discourtesy, but set about refuting its case for tighter media controls, which is what they were seen as."
"That the records are authentic, that they are what they claim to be."
That the records have not been altered or changed.
"And also that they can be located, retrieved, and opened."
"The fourth challenge is structuring folders, subfolders, and files within a shared drive to associate with their approved records schedule."
"This is a common idea that we saw with agencies, but it requires planning before using the shared drive to develop a structure that aligns with the approved records schedule."
It then requires those responsible for creating and managing records to follow that structure.
"So what that would look like is, the folders would line up with the items in the agency's record schedule."
Another challenge is implementing and maintaining audit trails to track the use of records.
"This is challenging because documents stored on shared drives can be edited, changed, or deleted by anyone who has access to that drive if there are not access controls in place."
It's difficult to find an audit trail of who has modified a document.
Property fields that are associated with the files are rarely populated with metadata.
And there could be missing context to the documents.
That's one thing to keep in mind.
"Organizing records and related dispositions when offices may change, merge, or cease to exist."
"When a shared drive is structured to correspond to the specific offices, that would need to be updated and changed if the offices went away or merged or moved to a different place."
This was the case at the National Archives when we recently underwent our Transformation.
We've had to reconfigure and update our structure for our shared drives.
"The last challenge is monitoring the record copies of long-term, temporary, or permanent records for technological obsolescence."
There's no built-in capability for shared drives to monitor when records should be migrated to their next version of the format.
And it may be necessary to use other tools to accomplish that.
Let's talk now about records management responsibilities.
Agencies are responsible for managing their records in accordance with 36-CFR Part 12 Subchapter B.
That's the long name for the NARA regulations.
Over the next few slides I'll look at the responsibilities that are in 36-CFR-123620.
These are the high level responsibilities that agencies must follow.
This specific regulation requires these following functionalities for managing records throughout their life cycle.
The first is to declare records.
That means identifying and filing the record copy within the shared drive and assigning unique identifiers to the records.
It also means capturing the records.
So it means importing records from other places or
linking them to other systems.
And then also organizing the records so that they're associated with their approved records schedule and disposition instructions.
A couple of other little ones:
They're nice.
Nice people are sympathetic.
"There's an old Hollywood adage: if you want to show us in 30 seconds who the hero and villain are, have one person pet a puppy and the other person kick that puppy."
Students:
Awwwwwwwww
Brandon:
Ok?
"We laugh at it, it's very simple."
But if you're aware of these sorts of things you will see people doing essentially that ALL the time in films.
This is how we know they're a bad guy.
"In fact they go overboard, they get generic, they get bothersome."
"I'm so tired of the opening scene where the villain is doing something, he hires somebody to give him this item or he picks it up, and then he kills them."
"It's like ""OK, well, he's the bad guy."
"He just killed the person that did him this favor, we know he's the bad guy."""
"But the reason they're doing that is that it takes them about 30 seconds to tell you who the bad guy is, right?"
"So, show them being nice, or, you know, not."
And another one is: people like them.

"For example, if you look at this diagram, you will notice that the bottom of this slide is where small children put their hands on."
"Every time the rain stream down the slide, more radioactive materials accumulate."
There can be a difference in radiation level between the right side and the left side.
"If such difference occurs and if the average radiation of the slide is 1 microsievert, then one side can measure as high as 10 microsieverts."
We should do more emergency decontamination work in such places.
The ground right under the roof gutter is also where children frequently put their hands on.
If you use high pressure washer you can reduce the radiation level from 2 microsieverts to 0.5 microsievert.
"However, it is extremely difficult to lower the level to less than 0.5microsievert, because everything is contaminated."
"Buildings, trees, whole areas."
"You can lower radiation dose of one place, but very difficult to do that for the whole area."
"Then, how much will it cost when you seriously do the decontamination work?"
"In case of ""Itai-Itai Disease"" caused by cadmium poisoning, to decontaminate half of cadmium-contaminated area of roughly 3,000 hectare, the government has spent 800 billion yen so far."
"How much money will be needed if we have to decontaminate the area 1,000 times as big?"
"So, I'd like to make four urgent requests."
"First, I request that the Japanese government, as a national policy, innovate the way to measure radiation of food, soil, and water, through using the Japan's state-of-the-art technology such as semiconductor imaging detectors."
This is absolutely within Japan's current technological capability.
"Second, I request that the government enact a new law as soon as possible in order to reduce children's radiation exposure."
"Right now, what I'm doing is all illegal."
The current Radiation Damage Prevention Laws pecifies the amount of radiation and the types of radionuclides that each institution can handle.
"Now Tokyo University is mobilizing its workforce in its twenty-seven Radioisotope Centers to help decontaminate Minami-Soma City, but many of the centers don't have a permission to handle cesium."
It's illegal to transport it by cars.
"However, we cannot leave highly radioactive materials to mothers and teachers there, so we put them all in drums and bring them back to Tokyo."
To receive them is illegal.
Everything is illegal.
The Diet is to blame for leaving such situations as they are.
"There are many institutions in Japan, such as Radioisotope Centers at national universities, which have germanium detectors and other state-of-the-art detectors."
"But how can we, as the nation, protect our children if these institutions' hands are tied?"
This is the result of the gross negligence by the Diet.
"Third, I request that the government as a national policy mobilize technological power of the private sector in order to decontaminate the soil."
"There are many companies with expertise of radiation decontamination; chemical companies such as Toray and Kurita, decontamination companies such as Chiyoda Technol and Atox, and construction companies such as Takenaka Corporation."
Please mobilize their power to create a decontamination research center in Fukushima as soon as possible.
It will take tens of trillions of yen to do the decontamination work.
Identifying personal materials and non-records.
This could be extra copies or reference materials to ensure that they are maintained separately from federal records.
And then the final one on this slide is to identify the record copy and maintain it in an area designated for federal records.
This is what we were talking about with having the shared drive structured to match the records retention schedule.
"The next one is to establish and enforce naming conventions that are applicable at the folder, subfolder, and file level."
Some agencies have developed naming conventions that actually include the series in the title.
They may even have cutoff and disposal instructions within the title.
That's structuring the folder and subfolders to be associated with record schedules.
"Another strategy is to use metadata, file plans, and other tools to link related files in all media."
And then working with IT staff to ensure the integrity of the shared drive.
This means the access controls and audit trails.
To seek their assistance to see what kind of capabilities your system has.
"And if it's possible, to create audit trails."
"And then another one as always, training staff in the use of shared drives and records management responsibilities."
One thing to note here is that some of these strategies rely on manual intervention that could be done by an electronic system automatically.
There are some extra steps that would need to be taken in doing this in a manual way.
"I just want to remind you that if you have any questions at this point, go ahead and put them in the chat box."
And we'll be monitoring those.
The important thing to note about NARA's transfer guidance is that it applies to permanent records regardless of their location.
"So if they are permanent records, then they must be transferred to NARA in accordance with the transfer guidance."
I will make a side note here that the NARA team is currently updating the transfer guidance for permanent electronic records.
And this may result in the inclusion of additional acceptable formats.
So keep your eyes open for the upcoming guidance.
"If records on a shared drive are well-organized, this process of transferring permanent records to NARA will be much easier."
"For some other NARA resources and the toolkit for managing electronic records, we added a number of resources on shared drives."
These are from different organizations around the world.
"They're not endorsed by NARA, but are provided to show how other organizations or governments are encountering similar issues."
Go ahead and check that out.
This is a question that was in the bulletin.
Agency staff should contact their agency records officers to discuss specific questions about managing content on their shared drives.
And then the agency records officer can contact their NARA appraisal archivist.
In the next few slides I'm going to go over some information that we provided in the appendix.
"Gets captured affected by its gravity, loops around and comes back."
"Okay, now since he was going very fast I wanted this to be relativistic, he needs quite a bit of acceleration to flip the direction of that velocity, so he'll to get near the star or the star has to be very massive whichever way you wanna think about it."
"And this gives us another point of view on what is going on here and why it is that in an unambiguous way, not the usual time dilation that is symmetric between two, Two inertial frames but in an asymmetric way honestly physically the moving twins clock was running slower than the stationary twins clock and it somehow has to do with the acceleration and the idea is imagine braking up the trajectory in sort of three pieces."
Piece number one is the piece over here until he approaches the star.
"So, some at this point, we imagine we can ignore the gravity of the star and everything is inertial and indeed, The stationary twin thinks his brother's aging slower."
The moving twin thinks the stationary twin's aging slower.
And indeed the same thing obtains here.
And all the symmetric Lorentz invariant.
Lorentz transformation's back and forth describe what was going on here.
And then there's the region in between these two events where there's this high acceleration.
And now we have a sense of what is going on here.
We know that during this period the blue clock runs slower than the black clock.
"But from our point of view its somewhat clear, the black clock is very far away from the star, the blue clock is running very near to the star."
"The blue clock runs slow during this period because of a gravitational red shift, and how much gravitational red shift?"
"Well that depends how mass of the star in is, is and how close."
"And that is determined by how massive the star has to be and how close you have to get to it in order to deflect this velocity V change your velocity from plus V to minus V, zooming you back towards Earth."
So at
"least without a calculation, you can do a calculation, but it's some intuitive level that is clear that indeed The accelerating phase of this moving twins trajectory is the part the phase of the journey during which unambiguously the moving twin ages"
less than the stationary twin in a way in which they both agree that this is not a question of.
"Whose clock is measuring it, but he the literally he is edging slower this is because we can now see the asymmetry."
He is at the bottom of the gravitational level and his brother at the top.
"So, thinking about the gravitational time dilation is a very power tool and in particular, it gives us the way of reasoning our way through the twin paradox and understanding what there had been being going on."
Hi.
"I'm Wheeler Winston Dixon, James Ryan professor of Film Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and this is Frame By Frame."
When you go to the movies you expect to see a movie... but you don't expect to see commercials.
"But more and more these days, you're seeing commercials in front of a movie."
"It's even gotten to the point where they have what they now call a ""pre-show""... which is actually about 15 or 16 commercials strung together for a variety of different products..."
"You know, soft drinks, cars, things like that..."
"Things that they think the audience will buy, which is 18 to 24 year olds."
"Although this is new in America, it is not new in Europe."
"I remember in the 1960s, when I went to Europe to see a screening of ""Rebecca""..."
"I was shocked by the practice, which is still prevalent in Europe, of what's called a ""pause."""
"Now clean on clean, we place our second pair of gloves."
"One side-note though, just from experience, is the more sweaty your hands get, the harder it is to put on secondary pairs of gloves, so if you're purchasing gloves, a light powdered glove is not a bad idea, or a powder free that's just a good quality glove."
"Now we can take our disinfecting solution, spray down the contaminate."
"Be careful not to spray it hard, because if you do, it can glance off and shoot the contaminates off the surface that you're working on, and now we've got another cross-contamination issue, and we're gonna continue to have to clean up."
Make sure that you spray in a circumference enough that you're really decontaminating the greater part of this surface.
"Now we're gonna take another disposable wipe, and now we're going to clean the second phase, and get the rest of the existing contaminate off the surface."
And we're going to dispose of that in a bio-haz bag.
"Again, keeping dirty-dirty and clean-clean, we're gonna dispose of those in the bio-haz bag, and this should be our last time that we actually have to put on gloves, even though they're clean, and ideally the disinfecting bottle is clean, we really want to break this chain of infection through putting a personal protective equipment piece between us and the potential pathogen."
Now we're going to mist-spray a saturation of the disinfecting solution.
"If it is made out of bleach solution, be careful it doesn't get on other products that have color, it will bleach those products."
"Maybe it's a carpet, or other things."
"And now we're going to put this stuff away properly, but we're going to let this wet surface literally dry on its' own, which is the prescribed amount of time for the chemical to be in contact with the hazard, or potential hazard, the bio-hazard, in order for it to completely have its' kill time."
Hey!
"Welcome back to 20 Minutes Or Less, my name is Elliot Morgan,"
I'm Trisha Hershberger.
So 17 year old Savannah Dietrich was sexually assaulted in 2011 by 2 boys after she passed out from drinking at a party.
Months after the party she learned that those 2 boys had taken pictures and shared them with people.
Then news of the assault spread around her Louisville high school.
Last month the boys who attacked her struck a plea deal.
They plead guilty and were charged with felony sexual abuse and misdemeanor voyeurism.
"Dietrich felt this was not an appropriate punishment and that it amounted to a ""slap on the wrist""."
"Then the court added an order for the victim herself: don't talk about it, or go to freakin' jail."
Because nothing sends a better message to victims of sexual assault than telling them not to talk about it.
"When Savannah heard this, she cried, logged onto Twitter and tweeted:"
"""There you go, lock me up."""
"And then proceeded to give the names of the little worthless pieces of trash, and then finished the tweet up with:"
"""I'm not protecting anyone that made my life a living hell."""
She immediately violated the stipulation that she not say anything.
The attacker's attorneys then asked a Jefferson District court judge to hold Dietrich in contempt for lashing out on Twitter.
She could face up to 100 days in jail and a $500 fine if convicted.
So to summarize: the boys who violated this girl got to have it both ways.
"They were able to make what they did public to whoever they wanted to know, and then they were able to tell a court to keep it quiet."
"So, this is different from organizational"
learning where internal efficiency and improvement is the focus.
Resource dependence theory is primarily focused on relations with the external environment rather than on one's within the firm and as such resource dependence theory views organizational conditions in a particular way.
"It presumes there is an environmental determinism, which means that an organizational behavior can be explained by looking at the organisations context such as such as external constraints and control."
It also assumes that an organizations' specific goals are contingent on dependence relations that keep it alive.
"So, these are the relationships that secure its necessary resources."
"Within this context of resource dependencies, the firm's general goal is to find greater certainty."
"So relationships that persist, and are clear, and advantageous, as well as autonomy."
So they're looking for relations that render them independent or in control.
"Last, organizations are viewed as responding to resource dependencies in at least two ways."
"They can either comply and adapt to these dependencies, or they can avoid and manage them."
So what are the core features of resource dependence theory?
One of the most important features of the theory concerns the resources involved and how they establish dependencies.
"To identify resource dependencies, it helps to ask, what are the key resources in an environment?"
Who controls the resources in question?
Resources come in a variety of forms and they're valued differently depending on their importance and availability.
And they differ in terms of who has discretion and control over them.
"There are various types of resources that firms depend on, such as physical materials."
These might be actual materials the organization builds a product from.
But firms may also depend on technical resources like information or knowledge as well.
"And last, they may depend on social resources, like prestige and reputation that enabled them to survive."
All these resources can vary in value.
On the one hand their value can differ by the value of the resource.
Is it in demand?
Is it valued?
Does the firm need the resource to survive?
Is there a critical resource?
For example what does Stanford need to survive?
"Does it absolutely need students, does it require a physical location, books, teachers, money, heating, food?"
What can it live without?
What can't it live without?
"Is there a demand for safety, healthy food, expert teachers and awards?"
"As you can see on the slide in front of you, the number for CSBG that the President has proposed is $350 million."
This is the same figure that he proposed the last two years.
"This chart shows a comparison of what was actually distributed in FY ""12 compared to the 2014 requests."
We use 2012 as opposed to 2013 because of the sequestration impact and the exact figures on the allocation for states and tribes haven't been released by the office of Community Services.
We've heard from them today that they are still working on getting those dollars released and that we should have a more accurate figure on 2013 numbers relatively soon.
There are a couple of things I want to point out about the President's proposed budget that you can see from this chart.
The first glaring one is the hole in the
CSBG Reservations.
This is discretionary funds.
In 2012 there was about $35 million that was given to rural facilities and community economic development grants.
These things have been zeroed out in the
President's proposed budget which does impact some of the other dollar figures according to the formula as well.
The $343 million for states and tribes is still below the threshold that has been set in the CSBG statute of $345 million.
That means that the minimum state allocation drops down to ¼ of a percent as opposed to half a percent which means that there are approximately five states that are going to see a roughly 75% cut in their funding if the President's budget were to be passed whereas most other states would see on average about a 45% decrease from their fiscal year 2012 figures.
You can see there's a link at the bottom of that slide for the 2014 budget justification for the department of
Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families.
I'd encourage you to take a look at that document after this webinar.
It has a break out for each state's potential allocation.
You can take a
look and see how the President's budget specifically would impact your state and your funding.
There are a number of other items included in the budget this year beyond just the significant cut request.
There are a number of proposed reforms as well.
These are a couple of quotes that were pulled from the document.
"You can see that it says, ""The Department of Human Services will continue to work with national and state partners on future refinements to ROMA and NPI systems to assure that these systems contribute to a performance-based program and funding approach""."
As we look through these reforms that are proposed in the budget their goals are really a performance-based program and funding approach also repeated from previous budget requests that they are interested in targeting
"Community Services Block Grant resources to high-performing, innovative agencies."
This is not new
language.
This is language that the President has included in the previous two budget requests.
And it has set the tone for how they are approaching these proposed reforms.
This brings up a number of questions and issues in the current structure of the block grant and issues pertaining to how the formulas would work in distribution of dollars that we'll talk about in a minute.
You can see some of the other additional reforms that were proposed.
"If you're not paying into social security and not paying FlCA taxes, those dollars are not recorded by the Social Security Administration."
"Your retirement benefit is based on your average indexed monthly earnings for your thirdest, your 35 highest earning years."
"In practical terms this means each year earnings is indexed or increased by, By the total inflation experience until the age of age 60."
Then the 35 highest years are added together.
"If you do not have, if you do not have earnings in 35 years, the missing years are replaced with 0s."
That total is divided by 35 and then divided by 12 and rounded down to the nearest dollar.
That is the basis for calculating your benefits.
"Again, social security is based upon your highest 35 years of earnings."
"Any sort of years where you do not work or pay the social security, there's a zero."
"That would dramatically decrease your, er your average indexed monthly earnings."
The primary insurance amount is the amount that you'd be paid each month if you retire at the full retirement age.
"People who, people suggested that Social Security should be means tested."
"That is, reduced for people that make a lot of money."
"The facts are, the formula used to calculate the PlA is a defection means, is a defective means testing, in that it rewards a higher percentage of Al, AlME To"
lower paid workers.
"As you can see from the calculations here, the more money you have made, the less you get back on a percentage basis."
"Therefore, social security is already more or less means tested; however, this is not to say that means testing may not come up again in the future."
There are exceptions to the plan.
"The Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad"
Retirement Act Employees have a parallel system that is nearly identical.
"State and Local Government Employees that have not participated in Social Security for a total of 30 years and will not be receiving a pension from that, from that employment will have their benefits systematically reduced by the windfall elimination provision."
"This means that again, state and local employ, government employees that have not paid into social security, will not be receiving a benefit necessarily by social security."
"Or if that benefit is there it may be reduced in order to eliminate a windfall to that employer, employee of receiving two government benefits."
Their spouse benefits may also be affected by the government pension offset rules.
"If you are working and drawing benefits before your full retirement age, your benefits will be reduced."
"It is very important that before you go to retire, you begin to examine your social security statements as previously discussed."
"Many employees are in the assumption that just because they were working and paying taxes, they are actually paying in to social security, but again, many government employees, state and local do not pay into social security and therefore their benefits may be lowere than they expect."
"Full retirement age is currently un, undergoing a planned increase."
And just as it did a few years ago.
"As you can see, full retirement age for nearly, for early baby boomers is 66."
"While the late benefit, while the, while the late baby boomer generation will have to wait until they reach age 67 and a half."
67 years of age.
"Under the threat of ISA, the powers-that-be had a free hand to do whatever they chose to do."
"They consolidated their power, . ensured trusted personnel running important government departments, adjusted their emoluments, and further entrenched the meritocratic system."
The result is the widening gap between the elite and the vast majority of the people.
The resentment which had been accumulated for years morphed into a mini tsunami in the last general election.
Why is the ISA outdated?
Why should the ISA be abolished?
"The precursors of the ISA were the Emergency Regulations and the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance (PPSO), the latter was promulgated under British colonialism."
"How many people were arrested and detained under these three legislations respectively, and for how long were they detained?"
"Even though we do not have the exact figures, we can certainly state that interrogation methods and detention measures which were deemed too uncivilized by the British were summarily ignored by the ISA."
The methods used by Singapore government were more high-handed;
The above three legislations were the products of Cold War following the ending of the WWIl.
"One of the ""crimes"" we were alleged to have committed was ""to advance the communist united front""."
That was in 1987.
"Two years later, the 1989 Hatyai Peace Accord was signed by the three parties involved, three years later, in 1990, Singapore and the PRC established formal diplomatic relations."
"What is interesting is the resurrection of the communist bogey in 1987, whereas we now know that the Malayan Communist Party had by them been working to seek a peaceful solution to the years of conflict between MCP and the Malaysian government."
"Was the allegation of ""advancing the communist united front"" an excuse?"
Was it a kind of political manoeuvre?
Or was the allegation doomed to fall apart even before it was challenged?
"Moreover, is the subsequent close relationship between Singapore and the PRC a bid to set up the so-called ""communist united front""?"
"Most of the state leaders in the PRC are members of the Communist Party of China, aren't they?"
"Singapore needs the ISA to deal with terrorists, this is the currently prevalent view."
I guess very few people would deny the existence of terrorism.
Our contention is that there are enough laws to counter terrorism in the context of Singapore.
"Historically, the ISA has been exploited as a tool to suppress and persecute political dissidents and opponents."
It has been a monster who would keep people under detention without trial for over 30 years without blinking an eye.
It should be relegated to the rubbish heap of history.
Imagine this scenario in a family.
"Regardless of how mischievous their children are, if parents act to have them locked up without giving them the right to defend themselves or state their case, how can they profess to be promoting a graceful family?"
How can they profess to be advancing an inclusive society?
The government should sever ties with the ISA if they are serious about building a society which puts the interests of its citizens paramount.
"Of the 24 people who were arrested in 1987 and 1988, they are those who have emigrated and lived in exile, and they are those who would not like to be reminded of the painful past."
But there are also not a few who have not forgotten how they were dealt with.
"For starters, if inflation were calculated"
"like it used to be, Social Security payments, whose increases are based on the CPl, would be 70% larger than today."
"Because Medicare increases are also tied to the CPl, hospitals are increasingly unable to balance their budgets, forcing many communities to lose services."
These are real impacts.
"But besides paying out less in entitlement checks, by understating inflation, politicians gain in another very important way."
"Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is how we tell ourselves that our economy is either doing well or doing poorly."
"In theory, the GDP is the sum total of all value-added transactions within our country in any given year."
"Here's an example, though, of how far from reality GDP has strayed."
"The reported number for 2003 was a GDP of $11 trillion, implying that $11 trillion of money-based, value-added economic transactions had occurred."
"However, nothing of the sort happened."
"First, that 11 trillion included $1.6 trillion of imputations, where it was assumed that economic value had been created but no actual transactions took place."
"The largest of these imputations was the ""value"" that the owner of a house receives by not having to pay themselves rent."
Did you follow that?
"If you own your house, the government adds how much they think you should be paying yourself in rent to live there and adds that amount to the GDP."
"Another is the benefit you receive from the ""free checking"" provided by your bank, which is imputed to have a value, because if it weren't free, then you'd have to pay for it."
So that value is guesstimated and added to the GDP as well.
"Together, just these two imputations add up to over a trillion dollars of our reported GDP."
"Next, the GDP has many elements that are hedonically adjusted."
"For instance, computers are hedonically adjusted to account for the idea that, because they are faster and more feature-rich than in past years, they must be more additive to our economic output than their price would indicate."
"So if a $1000 computer were sold, you're recorded as contributing more than $1000 to the GDP."
"Of course, that extra money is fictitious, in the sense that it never traded hands and.. it doesn't exist."
"What's interesting is that for the purposes of inflation measurements, hedonic adjustments are used to reduce the apparent price of computers, but for GDP calculations, hedonic adjustments are used to boost their apparent price."
"Hedonics, therefore, are used to maneuver prices higher or lower, depending on which outcome makes things look more favorable."
So what were the total hedonic adjustments in 2003?
"An additional, whopping $2.3 trillion."
"Taken together, these mean that $3.9 trillion, or fully 35% of our reported GDP, was NOT BASED on transactions that you could witness, record, or touch."
"They were guessed at, modeled, or imputed, but they did not show up in any bank accounts, because no cash ever changed hands."
"As an aside, when you hear people say things like ""our debt to GDP is still quite low"" or"
"""income taxes as a percentage of GDP are historically low,"" it's important to remember that because GDP is artificially high, any ratio where GDP is the denominator will be artificially low."
Now let's tie in inflation to the GDP story.
The GDP you read about is always inflation-adjusted and reported after inflation is subtracted from it.
"This is called the ""real"" GDP, while the pre-inflation adjusted number is called ""nominal"" GDP."
"So instead, you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error, and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one."
"You can cut the figure, you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before."
(Applause)
"Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure, so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram."
"We don't replace teachers, by the way."
"We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced."
"Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?"
"So after some guided trial and error, the child will discover, with or without help, that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result, transpose it, glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before: cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue, and tile."
"Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two."
But we discovered it by self-exploration.
"So, in addition to learning some useful geometry, the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies, like reduction, which is the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one, or generalization, which is at the heart of any scientific discipline, or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations."
And all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps.
"So presently, we are doing the following:"
"First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps."
"And because we cannot do it on our own, we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author, any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education, can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming."
"And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style."
"The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London, and, you see, just like"
"Salman did about 90 years ago, the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people, because at the end, it's all about people."
"And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall, and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students, and I'd like to try to preach it to you."
"Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term ""mensch."""
It basically means to be human and to do the right thing.
"And with that, what this graffiti says is,"
"""High-tech schmigh-tech."
"The most important thing is to be a mensch."" (Laughter)"
Thank you.
(Applause) (Applause)
Normal first and second heart sounds.
Listen to the following example.
Normal first and second sounds can be heard.
"Each pair of sounds,"
"lub dub, lub dub will begin with the first sound and end with the second."
Listen to these sounds and keep in mind the systolic and diastolic periods in the cardiac cycle.
"As I said I just couldn't be more impressed both in terms of what it's doing for my partner Isaac, but for how I'm getting some of my old high school math back."
Let's begin lesson six.
We're going to look at human factors this week.
A couple of things involving managing people in organizations and how to maintain information assurance.
We're also going to be talking about.
Good security awareness training programs and what they consists of.
"So, when you finish this lesson, you'll be able to describe how the human element factors in the information insurance planning."
"Additionally, you understand the role of security awareness in successful programs, and then you're going to be able to identify and describe the key principles that should drive security awareness programs, and we'll have a few other tidbits about people along the way."
"So, the people problem, and its impacts on IA planning."
"Well, we're the weakest link, for certain."
How do we control the people factor?
"Well, we can vet them, we can train them and we can monitor them."
"So, as far as vetting is concerned, what we're attempting to do is to keep out the bad apples."
"So,"
The federal governments in the United States does have a process by which they give security clearances to people.
"Especially when they're in sensitive positions, whether they're designated managers."
This affects their access and their clearance levels depending on the vetting process.
And the depth of the background check varies depending on the sensitivity of the person's position.
So here are the kinds of categories that might exist.
"Different government agencies have different names for these categories but we have non-sensitive, non-critical sensitive, critical sensitive, and special sensitive."
"Now industry, at large, doesn't have such a formal structure."
"However, they do have categories for information and for positions in organizations that are informally described."
"So you'll have things like company proprietary or company confidential, as opposed to public information."
"So some of the people controls that you can implement at an organization, is where do you place the Chief Information Security Officer?"
"Obviously if the ClSO is in the C-Suite, they're in a better position to influence information assurance planning and get the other executives aboard who support, are needed, to do a successful program."
"And, you can also look at hiring."
"You have sight security plans from the Federal government, that deal with hiring policies and background investigations, you might even find that in the industry as well."
"As far as managing people is concerned, one of the key ideas is separation of duties."
"So that, if you have a sensitive function, there is never just one person responsible, for example writing a check to vendor From beginning to end of the paperwork series, you'd want to have more than one person, to ensure that someone is not tempted to write the check and divert money into their own account."
There's access administration.
How do you control passwords and who has access physically to certain systems.
And there may be data destruction policies.
I want to say 1 more positive thing about the core.
"And to do that, I'm going to illustrate, another coalitional game example."
So this is called the airport game.
"In this example, there are several different cities in the same geographical area that need access to airports and the different cities are different sizes and so they need to be able to accommodate different sized airplanes."
They have to decide between each building their own airport or building a regional Airport and sharing the cost of building the regional airport amongst all the cities.
If they build the regional airport it's cost is going to depend on the largest plane that has to be accomondated.
"So, whichever city in the coalition that builds a regional airport Needs the biggest aircraft is going to set the size of the airport for everybody."
"Otherwise, everyone just builds their own airport."
"So we'll model this as a coalitional game as follows, and, as of course, the set of cities And the value of each coalition is ba sically the amount of work that was avoided as compared to having all of the airports built individually for each city."
"So, more specifically, the value of a coalition is the sum of the cost of building runways for every city in S Minus the cost of the biggest runway which is the one that actually has to be built for the regional airport."
"Well I'll define a convex game as follows, a game is convex If, for all, coalitions that are strict subsets of n, the value of the union of those subsets, of those two different coalitions, is at"
least as big As the value that the first can achieve by itself plus the amount the second could achieve by itself minus the amount that the coalition in common between these two can achieve for itself.
"So notice that we, we already talked about superadditivity. this is a stronger assumption because superadditivity assumed that s and t had an empty intersection."
"Whereas here we're allowing them to have an intersection and we're, we're just subtracting the value of its intersection."
"So, so this speaks about also cases in which s and t."
Do have 1 or more agents in common.
"Nevertheless, convex games are, are relatively common and the Airport games is an example of a convex game."
So the reason I mentioned convex games is to say some nice things about the core.
"And here are, are 2 kind of positive theorems about the core."
"First of all, in the case of convex games, the core always is nonempty."
"So, there's always at least some way of dividing payments between all of the agents to support the grand coalition and in a way where no subset of the agents would be willing to deviate in order to, to benefit themselves Secondly, even better, the Shopley value is in the core for convex games and so that means that for these particular games, dividing the value of the grand coalitoin in a way that is stable and dividing the value of the grand coalition in a way that is fair are not goals that are at odds with each other."
"So in these games, it's possible to do both."
"Hey guys, this is Heather from healthyveganrecipes.net."
"Today, I'm going to share my garlic herb sauce recipe."
I'm coming to you from our new kitchen in Ottawa.
Phil and I have moved to Canada's capital.
I grew in a suburb just outside of the city called Kanaka and its been exciting for me to start getting to know downtown a little bit.
"I didn't get out here very often, so we are right downtown and right near the - we're having lot of fun."
"This is my kitchen, a little bit smaller than what I had in Victoria but it works."
What
"I'm going to show you today is this garlic herb sauce recipe - a bean sauce, which"
I haven't done in a while and it's one of my favorite things to make.
"And we called it Padugo, bleeding for the cause."
"Anyway, the first village we created in Bagong Silang has inspired many people to discover that they can do it."
And many of our people abroad started to build their own village in the poorest towns or barangays where they came from.
"And after we launched this in 2003 with various schools, a lot of young people who became our volunteers, we have been able to build 2000 communities and impacted then the lives of about 1 million people."
And what is interesting is that our latest count is we've had already more than 1 million volunteers in our communities.
So it has become the work of nation building.
"And lately, we are very happy that our legislators have also taken notice and are now have filed a bill called House Bill 4374, it's the House Bill for Volunteerism for Nation Building."
"And the goal is to build 50,000 communities, one per barangay following the Gawad Kalinga model."
"So that's addressing the issue of social justice for 5 million families in our country because that will now become the platform for good citizenship, for productivity and for bottom of the pyramid wealth creation."
"And so, after building the first village, we're now embarking on the second phase."
We call it the phase of social artistry.
"We're now building the Enchanted Farm village university in Angat, Bulacan."
This is the first of 25 farm village universities.
Farm because it really encourages people in the city to go - to find opportunities in the countryside.
"It is about the management and the business graduates of the top schools in the city to work with scientist and to work with the agriculturist and to work for the rich, to work with the poor for us to really transform this country into a land of squatters, into a land of rebels in the countryside and to be able to see that we have over 12 million hectares of underproductive land where we can plant coffee and cacao."
"Because what is to me is really disturbing is a country that can feed the cattle and the carabaos and produce milk because we have kakawate, we have grass, we have malunggay and we have, you know, napier, everything is here, but we import 99% of our milk."
"And we can produce the best chocolate, we can produce, you know, the best ice cream using"
local ingredients and so on.
"So now, the second phase is to really look at the different industries that are undeveloped."
"Like our chocolate, we only - we consume 36,000 tons of chocolate beans but we produce only 6000."
So why should we import?
"And to me, it's very tragic that the producers of cacao and coffee are from the equator belt and down but the rich countries own the brand and own the wealth."
"And so it's very, it's important for us to really just, you know, go back, reconnect with the resources that we have."
"And so, we hope that we can - we are moving to the phase of sustainability through innovation."
"Before Gawad Kalinga, it was not the practice in this country for landowners to donate their"
land to the poor.
"But when we show that if you have ten hectares of land and you give two hectares of it, we can bring 100 families out of being informal settlers, out of living in the slums and build communities where people have strong values, that people can build their homes and can now really have the motivation to work or send their children to school."
"We realize that we'd trigger economic development, we bring peace and order, land values start to go up."
"And so, land owners now - now, we have land coming out of our ears."
"So in seven years, we're able to raise enough land in 400 towns good for 1 million families."
So I don't think it's a problem for us to get land for 5 million - to get 5 million families out of being informal settlers in this country.
"You know, it is about solidarity."
"You must have a much higher goals than simply ""for profit""."
"A failed Ministry is a Ministry that exists just for the pastor, his ego, his vainglory, that can also seem blessed, popular, well-known, but if does not serve God ..."
"If one day you do not odranno the words ""well done, faithful servant"" then you realize that his entire life was a failure."
"If you have a pastor, mask and pretend to walk with God, an empty religiosity and bereft of intimacy with God, although you can succeed to darla to drink that God is with you when in reality God is far from what he wants from you ..."
"Failure is just that: no fear of the Lord, having attracted rather by success."
"The Ministry failed, therefore, is what happens outside the standards of God's Word, and although it may seem ""blessed"":"
"Because the Church is full, many people follow the Shepherd, it becomes economically ..."
"God knows our hearts, and he knows what motivates people"
"Therefore, although the world is to be a success, for God is a failure!"
"Paul says in 1Corinthians, cap 2 that on judgment day, God's fire ministries will progress, and what was built with second-rate material, like wood, hay and"
"Straw, will be consumed by God's judgment."
You are referring to the leaders who will be judged by God and set out the substantiating hearts.
There will be many surprises that day.
"Sometimes the opposite happens: a faithful person, but his Church is not large, neither popular nor famous, in fact if the leader is faithful to the Lord, the worst can happen, as persecution, hatred, the beatings ..."
"For this reason we cannot judge whether the Ministry is blessed or not through external results, but we have to await judgment day"
When God will reveal what lurks in the hearts of everyone.
A failed Ministry is a Ministry indicating the Church to follow a conceited man who does not align to the Biblical parameters.
"Therefore, a person can also be very popular, reaching up to television, but if the Ministry is centered in one person and in his thoughts and desires, has failed."
"Everything that is not aligned with the word of God, humbly before Christ, is a failure and this will be revealed sooner or later."
"When the pastor is attracted by other interests, and not by mere proclamation of the word of God."
"When the focus of the Ministry is anything other than this, when a Conference despite deploying several books, he idolizes the preacher ..."
"When presiding over a very charismatic, who knows how to stir audiences but has a goal dismissed from Gospel,"
This Ministry has failed.
"It can be whatever you want, but not a home."
"Despite many times people who do these things are genuine, are genuinely deceived, and if they fail to understand what really makes a home blessed, as fidelity then everything they do will be failed."
The Ministry failed is that Minister who thinks only for himself.
"His mind is occupied by profit from money, in promoting its glory!"
"When its priority is to first floor, appearing as much as possible in the radio, tv, is a failed."
"GAP missions (Group of adoration of the father) began with a meeting, where the servants of God, decided to share their faith to build other people through the testimony."
"With the passage of time, many lives were built, and the Ministry was born."
"I could divide our history into two parts the first was that of his birth, and the second that it is this that we are experiencing is the discovery and confirmation of vocation from God."
To heal lives and ...
I think that the most important thing for any human being to understand who you are and why you are on this planet - what is your purpose?
"For somebody, their entire purpose is to be mother and create children and reproduce."
And another person needs to be architect and another person needs to be baker and make the bread.
Another one - gardener.
Every single human being has his own quality.
The most important is to find your own center in your life and to understand who you are.
And not spend energy doubting - our biggest problem especially with young people is doubt.
There's so much things to consume - you like this and then you don't like that and you try this or try that and you are losing enormous amount of energy which actually losing self and you're losing perspective of who you are.
"The moment you find who you are and you know your purpose, then this is it."
I was very lucky that very early in my age
I understood my purpose to be an artist and then which artist - I have to find out which is my best tool because some people are great painters but I understood that my tool was performance.
That's all I can do.
My body's my tool for work and that is just the tool I am working with.
"But you know, to talk about - I mean to tell people what they can do with their body - it's like I'm not a kind of Dr. Abramovic to tell them now you have to do this or that, the only thing I can do is to tell them that the most important is to look deep inside yourself to find the center, your own center."
"You see Abramovic Method Exhibition which I am doing here, actually is interactive and public have to interact with objects, it's one of the ways of getting in the center with yourself because they're minerals and when you enter to do this, you have take your watch away, you have to take your mobile, your computer, you are dressed in white coat, you put the headphones to completely block the sound and then you sit in one of the chairs behind me for as long - a certain amount of time and that process of sitting, you start really connecting to yourself."
And what you have to do is listen to your intuition but you have to really listen to intuition.
"You see that's a great question because in the 70's, Vito Aconci, a very great America artist said, he used the term, body art, and he said, the body is my place, the body is the place where things happened and that's why I call it body art."
"But then later on, in the late 70's, the completely body art disappeared."
First there was not performance because there was nothing to sell so the galleries wanted to have the goods to sell and performance artists stopped making performances.
And then in the late 80's there was a big problem with AlDS and lots of people died so attention to body become very strong.
So in the late 90's the performance came back but didn't come back in the museums and the galleries but they came in the nightclubs like in
"New York, Berlin and London like these kind of people doing works in the nightclubs."
"And then later on, again the performance came back in the form of the Vito Aconci work and then MTV and so many different directions and then went to theater, you know then film."
"So the performance is like a fan, it's coming and going."
"Performance is time-based art, is living a form art and the most important is immaterial."
And because it's immaterial that's the ultimate thing that really gives the future to perform is because I think the new technology is virtual and performance is the same.
So I think for me the future of art is actually art without objects - it's immaterial a form of art and this music and performance.
"No, Internet definitely has a huge function,"
I just heard a very story -
"There's a guy who is a science fiction writer in America, Kim Stanley Robinson, who wrote the book came out called 2312, and I'm one of the characters in the book named"
"Abramovic, and I said, what am I doing?"
"Oh he said, you are making the performances on the asteroids in Mercury in non-gravitational space."
So communal coughing first of all please.
[many coughs and laughter]
Thank you.
[more laughter]
Okay now be quiet.
And of course there is no way to control these things so if you have to cough just make peace with the coughing and let it happen.
But the title of this evening's talk is going to be on dealing with your emotions.
"Somebody asked me, a couple of people asked me for subjects to talk about this evening and I wanted to focus on the big subject of your emotions and how we deal with them, especially in Buddhism."
Because this will cover a couple of requests which people have given for the Friday night talk.
And you may notice that quite often when I give these talks on a Friday evening I don't really spend too much time talking about the theory of Buddhism and the intellectual part which is just really the realm of thought.
Of course that's part of Buddhism and you can read about that in books and sometimes I do go into those more intellectual and ephemeral parts of philosophy of Buddhist
life.
But what's more important I've found in practice is this emotional world and how to deal with life as we face it in our modern age.
And especially how we deal with emotions which have a huge effect upon on our physical and mental wellbeing.
And those emotions range from despair to raw anger to inspiration to love to compassion and all those emotions are a very important part of our life.
"And sometimes the theories and intellectual abstractions, sometimes they don't address the reality of our emotional world."
And I want to talk about that this evening - how we deal you know with those emotions
"- how we identify them and make sense out of them and learn to move forward with those emotions, because I do and also the Buddha identified a distinction between emotions, there are some things which we do call the negative emotions which are problematical, there are things such like you know grief, being angry, being afraid, wanting revenge, having a broken heart."
"Whatever else those negative emotions are we realise they do impinge upon our happiness and our success in life, they do hold us back from progress."
So those are the negative emotions and there is many more you can include in that category.
"There is also what we call the positive emotions, things like inspiration, things like compassion."
And one of the great positive emotions which too many people often forget about is a positive emotion of peace.
And I put that in the realm of emotions because that's something that's solid which empowers and motivates you; I'll be talking about that towards the end of the talk - usually we have to start with negative emotions first of all.
"And of course I have to deal with that a lot, people usually come and ring me up, or come and send me emails or come and talk about their negative emotions."
"Very rarely do they come up and say, ""Ajahn Brahm, I'm so happy!"
I'm having a wonderful time!
Everything is going well in my life!
"I'm just having so much joy!"""
[laughter]
"They say nooo..I've just broken up with my boyfriend, ah just my husband has run away with my best friend, I just got the sack from work, I've got cancer, someone has died, that's what, the stock market has gone down or the Eagles have lost, or whatever it is."
People they're always complaining about the negative part of their life - so that's what you have to deal with first of all.
And even sometimes in my monastery people actually ring me up for counselling - we call that Dial-a-Monk service [laughter].
"Or do they fundamentally involve to have storage, revocation, identity, and all the other aspects that traditional email systems have?"
"Or, do email systems themselves broaden what they do to take on some of that characteristic?"
I think the innovation is great.
"In Google's case, we have a very successful instant messaging product."
And that's what most people end up using.
"And having said that I think it's wonderful, Twitter's success is wonderful, and I think it shows you that there are many, many new ways to reach and communicate, especially if you are willing to do so publicly. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;MARY:"
Any other questions?
Yep?
"We're moving to the fourth row, third row. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:"
"Another big picture question, if you don't mind."
"You said the economy is dire, and that you don't see a sign of a current bottom."
"But, as you look around the world, do you see many regional differences in how badly areas are affected, and then in general, just as a world-wide view, how do you feel about broadband penetration rates, especially in Latin America, but elsewhere around the world, and whether the economic slowdown is going to dampen that move toward broadband penetration in other countries aside from the U.S.? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
What's interesting is Latin America is doing so well.
I was joking with my friend who lives in Mexico that maybe Mexico should bail out the United States.
The fact of the matter is that Latin American economies are now in a position of having higher growth than many of the other countries world-wide.
"I don't think we see anything different than what's been publicly reported, which goes something like this."
"The United States, because of our economic structure, is likely to both have a quicker descent and a quicker recovery than Europe."
"That Europe is offset by some number of quarters, and we believe that all of that is true, based on the data that we've seen."
"We also believe that India and China are being affected, but to a lesser degree, for all the reasons that have been said publicly."
"What we don't know is, what does this do to the long term capital structure of these economies?"
"I don't think anybody knows, when all of the government stimulus is done, and remember that the government stimulus in crisis here is not as bad as, for example, as what we're seeing in Britain or, for heavens sakes, Iceland."
"We don't really know what the extent of that will be in terms of both the nationalization questions of the institutions of those industries, and consumer confidence in savings rate."
"There's sort of negative examples if you look at Japan, which is, after 13 years of recession, Japan went from essentially a culture that was at least interested in brands and at least interested in real consumer behavior as defined by America, to a country that was sufficiently traumatized that they are now very, very heavy net savers, because their economic structure and labor markets also changed to also favor much more at risk employment."
Those are big changes if you're Japanese.
And I don't think anybody knows to what degree that will affect the United States.
"My personal view, and I've said this very strongly, is that Americans love their credit cards."
"And that if you think about what we have to do in our country, we basically have to solve the credit problem, we have to get the job situation at least stable so people are not afraid of losing their jobs, and we have to do something about the housing crisis."
All of those issues are being worked on now.
"When those things are done, it's a reasonable bet that Americans will go back to what we do best, which is to spend money."
[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Just one non-Google question, Eric."
"It communicates perfectly, don't even think about going in me backwards."
I will hurt you and mess you up.
So Alex started out talking about users and how we can't blame users because it's not the stupid users.
"I'm going to argue that users, in fact, are very smart."
It's actually a hard problem to design a system that people can't figure out.
"Even think about things like cryptography, or DRM, or even code obfuscation, where it's difficult to create something that people can't reverse engineer."
"So if this is also true of Uls, then why are we here talking about making things easier?"
The reality is that people just don't care that much.
"If they care enough, they can figure things out."
"But in reality, they have a lot of things competing for their attention, whether it's all of the other apps in the"
"App store, all of the other sites that are going on, all the TV shows, they're watching Game of Thrones, The"
"Bachelorette, both, and comparing, I don't know."
"So if something is really easy to use and people don't care, then it doesn't matter."
"So my argument is, if we do things to help people to care more, move over to the right, then even things that are very difficult, like learning how to drive a car, people are going to do it."
"Things that are really difficult like riding a unicycle, and I know that some people care a lot about this, but in my case, I haven't cared enough to learn how to use it yet, or something that's both easy and care a"
"lot about, like eating a sandwich, that's going to happen all the time."
"So the tricky part about this is that a good portion of these decisions that we make as what we're going to care about, what we don't care about, actually happen a lot below the conscious level, and this plays out in the kind of research that we do."
"It's actually pretty hard to find out what people care about, and if you ask them questions like, why do you"
"like that, or even, what do you like, people are really bad at giving answers."
You get kind of garbage data back because we're not very good at even introspecting and knowing these things.
"So as designers, our job is to understand this and help people to make choices."
"Now, there's a lot that happens in this process from when something hits our eyeballs for the small percentage that it reaches the top of our brains."
"So you may have had this experience in elementary school where the teacher told you that the eyes are not, in fact, at the top of the head, that the eyes are in the center of the head, and there's probably people in your class that argued."
"Or in my case, I remember being the artist in the class, thinking that my eyes had betrayed me, or how could I have not seen this?"
"It's so clear, once you get the ruler out."
"And as it works out, there's a special unit of processing in our brain for facial recognition, and this is speculation on my part, but I think it's probably less important, the information from the eyebrows to the top of the head, and so our brain just kind of squishes it, and what we think we're seeing isn't really what we're seeing."
This idea that design and these ideas of perception happen below consciousness aren't new.
"In fact, there are many people that have made this made this point that sometimes the best design is invisible design."
"A very famous essay on typography-- famous for those of us who are really into typography, so famous for a small subset-- where Beatrice Warde makes the case that good typography should be like a crystal goblet."
"It's transparent, that you can't see it."
"You see the content inside, but the glass is doing its job best when it's almost not there."
So a bunch of psychologists at the beginning of the last century--
But needing to have those experiences to reflect on.
"And again asking it in a genuine way not just like we're trying to motivate you so we want to ask you, but its like as someone creating this learning space, I'm interested to know what you thought and in that process it gets them thinking."
Mitch:
"Another set of questions here that I thought were interesting, its already come up in the discussion that its not one size fits all, that motivation is complex."
It varies from one part of the trajectory to another whether you're a beginner or expert as Avi mentioned.
But also it could vary by personality style or learning style.
Like here's a specific question about motivating introverts versus extroverts and strategies for facilitating a diverse group where different people seem to thrive on different approaches.
So how does one deal with the diversity?
When you work with a group of people and different people might respond in different ways.
What are ways of facilitating?
Avi:
"So it goes back to that idea of having environments that are supportive, you want actually to challenge people to engage in an activity that they may not feel completely comfortable engaging it start with but then you do it in a safe environment, then reflect on it, how did you feel, what did you learn about yourself in doing this."
How would you motivate yourself in the future if you find yourself in such a situation?
"The principles of belonging and sense of safety and the fact that your voice is heard and is taken into consideration, I think is our principles for promoting motivation among a diverse group of people with the addition of choice."
Like what
"Natalie said about the dimension of authority in the target, providing variety of ways by which people can perform the task and people will find it more comfortable to do this, or to do that based on their personal tendencies."
Mitch:
"Actually any experiences either from Scratch online community or from local things like Clubhouses, experiences where clearly there always are diverse backgrounds, interests, styles about ways of managing that."
Natalie:
"I do think that there are different roles, I do think like sometimes the presentation at the end, some people really want to show their stuff."
"But then also like smaller along the way you notice something, someone who might not want to speak out showing what they've been doing."
And actually online people were talking about having times where people get to work on their own who are more introverted but then having sharing times.
So i do think it is some kind of a balance.
"Like in the Scratch online community, we have multiple interests that we are supporting and there are ways of getting recognition."
"And we've just been asking, and I've posted, why do you use Scratch, we're trying to get at some of the motivations and its really interesting because some of the examples so far, young people are saying like I want to work with my friends and I like collaborating and I want my name to be known and I strive to do the best possible thing."
And its an interesting mix of learning and performance principles all in the same thing.
So I think having a variety of ways that people can get recognition and be sharing and taking on different types of roles too that you've been working on seems like one way to do it.
Which again in certain environments is easier than others.
Mitch:
Its probably something we need to think about especially in online spaces.
I think in physical spaces we have a lot more experience of how to allow different ways for people to play different roles.
"And I think in some online spaces, the way to get, theres a certain way that people are seeking visibility."
If it buys The rights of 1500 it must be better off by buying additional rights than by incurring higher pollution abat ement costs.
"As a consequence, by giving the firms the rights to pollute in the form of two rights and then allowing them to re-sell those rights all firms can favor the selling of the rights to pollute."
"And the, benefit of that is, that the cost of pollution abadement goes down, and when the cost of pollution abadement goes down, there are more resources available for, upping the environmental quality."
"Improving the environment, over what you would otherwise be able to acheive."
"I noted in this lecture that global warming is a highly contentious, academic and, political issue."
"There are esteemed scientists on both sides of this issue, some with extreme views."
Some might say the sky is falling.
"Others might say the equivalent, no problem."
"Why, why me worry."
As I mentioned at the start I have not tried to settle the climatic debate.
I couldn't even if I tried.
"Remember, I'm an economist not a geophysicist."
"What I've tried to do in the lecture is to explain how the pollution problem, the global warming, Warming problem included might be considered with the hope of developing solutions."
"If there is a real problem worthy of serious consideration, and that is a big if."
"I can add that if the global warming problem really does exist, there are serious obstacles to solving the problem."
Partly because of the large number of nations that must cooperate.
"To clean up the global climate, and partly because of the mobility of capital and jobs around the globe."
"If one or a few countries tried to solve their pollution problem and contribute to solving the world's pollution problem by exacting taxes or imposing, imposing costly regulations on polluters, Polluters can move to, some, with some relative ease, to national venues, that do not impose such environmental regulations, and taxes."
"Indeed, other nations might put out, the welcome mat, to polluting industries, and add subsidies to entice them in. just to get, the manufacturing jobs, and income"
Incomes.
"But these nations might figure that they'll be worse off because of the poll ution but on balance they can be better off with a combination of more pollution and, and more jobs and more income."
"The forces of world competition can press firms to produce in environmental, environmental areas where constraints are the most relaxed."
"Remember, competition can give rise to the maximization of the production of goods that these things get value."
"That it can do the same with the production of bands, things that subtract from value like."
"Indeed if advance countries hike their environmental controls, polluting firms may move to undeveloped countries with more relaxed controls."
"With the end result being an increase in pollution, and they made need to make the move even when their in favor of improved environmental quality."
Why?
"The pressure, of competition."
"The pressure of other firms moving, to more congenial, in, environments, in terms of regulation and taxes, who might then have a cost advantage."
"Needless to say, global warming is a rather large prisoners dilemma problem, that just might not have the easy solutions that environmentalist's want and seek."
"Remember that economics has been dubbed the dismal science, and for good reason."
"For now, I am pleased that you have been with me."
"Well we can actually, by looking the Amazon rainforest, we can get a pretty clear idea of what was going on in the periphery of the Mediterranean."
"So the transpiration from the trees, in the Amazon, is taking a huge amount of water out of the soil and putting it up into the atmosphere every day."
"So wherever you are in the Amazon Basin, usually by noon or about 2:00 in the afternoon, you've got a cloud sitting over your head, and that's the water that came out of the ground that day."
"And there's also moisture, of course, that's coming in from the Atlantic, and it's blown west, up towards the Andes, in the clouds."
"And because of this transpiration, if you look at a molecule of water that's coming in off the"
"South Atlantic, by the time it hits the Andes it's gone in and out four times; it's rained four times by the time it gets to the Andes."
So having the forest there is making very efficient use of that water.
It is a positive feedback loop whereby the presence of the forest is maintaining the presence of the forest.
"And if you cut down the forest, the rainfall will decrease and the total plant growth will diminish, and that will accelerate the conversion of forest into savanna."
So this is an extreme case of that process.
In the Amazon there's enough stuff coming in off of the South
"Atlantic, and it's at--remember if you"
"look at your Hadley cells, it's in a region of the world near the equator where you have warm moist air rising."
"So you're going to have planetary forces generating rainfall, whether there are trees there or not, but you move just 30 degrees north, to the Mediterranean, and you don't have that."
"Here, at the Mediterranean, you have got, in your Hadley cell circulation, you have got cold, dry air falling, and you don't get the planetary forces regenerating and replenishing the rainfall and the forests that had been there had been an important local source of transpiration into the atmosphere."
"So at the equator this is what you get, and boy is this stuff efficient at getting water up into the atmosphere."
One that a lot of you have read a lot about I know is atmospheric carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses and global warming.
"And it is the immediate source of carbon for terrestrial organisms, but it's really only a tiny part of the global carbon cycle."
"So if we look at the carbon cycle, and we look at storage in gigatons of carbon-- the storage here is in black and the flux in gigatons of carbon is in purple."
So there's about 750 gigatons of carbon in the atmosphere.
In the surface of the ocean there's about 1000 gigatons.
"In the deep ocean there's 38,000 gigatons of carbon, and so forth."
Okay?
"So vegetation has got a bit less; all the vegetation of the globe has got a bit less carbon in it than there is in the atmosphere, and only about 1/50^(th) as much as there is in the deep ocean."
And there is carbon which is moving between all these compartments.
"The fossil fuel and cement production of the world has got about 4000 gigatons stored, and it's putting about 5 gigatons per year into the atmosphere."
"So if we look at that flux, overall there's a big exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere."
There's a pretty big impact of photosynthesis.
Plant respiration is putting just about everything back into the atmosphere that it's taking out.
So this is pretty much a wash right here.
The increment from fossil fuel and land use looks pretty small compared to the overall process.
"But the critical thing is whether or not at equilibrium you're just pushing that equilibrium a little bit, because these are rates, and rates accumulate."
"What is the greatest barrier, the greatest resistance point to this?"
Salman:
"Well I think that one, it's such a radical change to what traditionally happens in a classroom."
"If you're telling someone to do homework in the classroom, it's not called homework anymore."
"But I think once teachers and students get used to it, it's kind of like they start to think about they even did before."
"Probably the biggest problem, I wouldn't call it a problem it's actually a great thing, in the same classrooms we have a pilot over here in northern California where you have a 5th grade classroom, this is their math curriculum, and that same 5th grade classroom there are some kids doing 3rd grade math and there are some kids doing trigonometry and the teacher needs to feel comfortable with that."
"But what's cool about it is that they're getting a dashboard, they see where everyone is and every student can work at their own pace."
Dylan:
"If you were to look, Ben, at the problem of having different, same age, but at different places, right?"
That's the whole thing with the educational system is you got one kid doing trigonometry and another one who's trailing behind.
"How do you see this, what did you see about this, that you felt not only addressed the drop out rate but addressed the variability of how people learn?"
Ben:
"I mean if you look at decreasing budgets and increasing class sizes, we need to solve the efficiency problem and teacher's time is a limited amount."
"So having this technology where they can evaluate on a person-by-person basis where their kids are at and they can have their classroom time to work with their kids who are at different levels directly so they can be taking the lectures at home through Khan Academy, that's a big solution to a critical problem."
Dylan:
Salman walk me through very briefly how this works.
"Let's say I've got a couple of kids, they're in a traditional environment,"
"I'm intrigued by what your saying, how would it work?"
Salman:
So every student works at their own pace.
"They literally do exercises at their own pace, they start at one plus one and they keep moving up all the way through algebra or trigonometry, however far they want to go."
"If they have trouble with anything the videos are there, they can actually watch them at home or in class time and the teacher when they come to class, they don't give lectures, they don't grade homework, they don't give exams."
They literally just get a dashboard and they see where every kid in the class is and some kids may be ahead and some kids might be behind.
"And we actually see them flipping around, some of the kids that were behind race ahead later on and all the teacher does is look at the kids who are stuck,"
"look at the kids where the video and the software isn't enough for them to get past that problem and then the teacher just intervenes on those kids or even better, gets one of the kids that are already proficient on that module, because they have all of the data to actually tutor their peers."
So you can have a class where everyone's working at their own pace.
Dylan:
"Got it, you say that instead of penalizing failure and rewarding test taking ability like our current system does right now, education should encourage failure and experimentation but demand mastery."
Why do you think this model achieves that?
Salman:
Well what we do is we force...
"In a traditional model, I'll give you some lectures, homework, lectures, homework and then we have a snapshot exam and regardless of whether you get a 70 or 80 or 90 percent on that exam, we move onto the next concept and no one ever asks what was that 10 percent you didn't know."
"A group of about sixty men from New Haven, normal townspeople--I'm going to talk about them in a moment-- decided that they were going to hire someone to teach them military exercises so that hopefully they would learn something and that somewhere down the road if they had to be they could organize themselves into a military unit and protect the town of New Haven."
Okay.
So here's sixty random people in New Haven who hire someone--
"I think they paid him three dollars a lesson or something-- to teach them how to drill, and what to do with guns, and how to walk in formation, and basic military things so that they would know what to do, in case they ever actually had to fight."
Again that's kind of a dramatic action.
That's a big step to take.
'Okay.
"Now I need to be militarily drilling in case I need to defend my family, my property, and my town.'"
"So that certainly gives you a sense of what it felt like, what was sort of floating in the air at this time for people in New Haven to take that kind of an action."
"In early 1775, they met as a group and they decided that they would really organize themselves into a real military unit, as opposed to guys taking"
lessons on how to drill.
"So they met, they voted on uniforms, they figured out the best way to obtain arms so that they'd know where they'd be getting them from, and then not long after that they actually wrote to the"
"Connecticut State Assembly and said that they, quote, ""Anxious for the safety of our country and desirous of contributing all in their power to the support of our just rights and liberties, have formed themselves into a military company""-- and then added that they wanted the Connecticut State Assembly to officially make them a sort of district military unit."
So they wanted official recognition from the Connecticut
State Assembly.
"Again, really interesting--random sixty guys: 'maybe we better know something military.'"
"Then after that they decide: 'oh, okay, well, maybe we actually had better--we could organize ourselves so that this will actually be real."
"Hey, now that we've organized ourselves, we can actually get state recognition so that we'll be on call and armed and ready in case something bad happens.'"
"Again kind of an interesting chain of events, series of personal decisions on the part of those random sixty men."
Now let's look for a minute at who they are.
One of them apparently owned a hat store on Chapel Street.
"One of them was a barber who was described, quote, as ""a rather eccentric person."""
"I don't know what that means, although I was dying to have the time to figure out why the barber was rather eccentric, but we have an eccentric barber who's one of the sixty, a chair maker, a few sailors, someone who was just described as a man of leisure--"
"[laughter]--it's interesting to ponder what that means-- a lawyer, a few grocers."
There was a grocer who lived on State Street and a grocer who
"lived on the corner of Chapel and Church-- and of course for me researching this this morning, it's really fascinating to be finding people living in places that, of course, we all know."
"That's always--Because you can exactly picture: oh, the corner of Chapel and Church."
I know exactly where that person lived.
"One person worked in the New Haven bank, and decided that he wasn't really very skilled at horsemanship; in case that they were going to fight, he probably would need to know how to be really good on horseback."
So apparently he regularly took his horse into his yard and practiced on the horse in private.
"He took it into his yard so no one would see that he was the guy who had to practice horsemanship, but he was sort of there doing his own little private drilling so that he'd be prepared in case there was actual fighting."
Okay.
"However, Lorenzo and I like to focus on this."
"We call it the 'concrete ceiling,' and it's visible: you have to be at home, you have to perform all the domestic duties."
"In this case, we talk about professional self-limitation, about personal barriers that women set for themselves some times, but few working men do."
"And it has to do with the limitation which arises from having to compromise, especially when having children."
This happens to some professional women on a daily basis but very few men.
"There is an element of inequality that we think explains better the final uneven result in salary, in access to managing positions and others, than the first theory."
"And especially, that this can start diminishing as more women have more managing positions."
And this one is somehow more persistent.
"It's also very related to the gender slots that our culture imposes on us from childhood, right off the bat."
I've also brought up here education.
"Then, if we think the concrete ceiling is more important than the other one, how do we support this idea?"
I will talk now about the next idea that is the gap hypothesis.
Women have been in the labor market for decades.
"It's a mature process, it has been going on for years, it's not new."
"However, it has not be accompanied by a parallel process of men accessing the care taking activities, to family responsibility in the same conditions as women had since the beginning of history."
This is an emerging process right now.
"And therefore, there is an imbalance, a gap that creates instability."
"A very clear shortcoming is the stress that is experienced some of the women that try to combine work and family, but being the only ones responsible for those tasks."
"This is also called sometimes the double shift or burden, and a lot of women face it, but not so many men."
"In addition, this isn't simply an empirical phenomenon."
I think any of us can look around and we basically see it.
"This is also very likely, the root of discrimination in the labor market."
What is discrimination in the labor market?
"When it comes to hiring, to promote someone professionally, when you have candidates with similar profiles, some get chosen in terms of the social group they belong to: ethnic, cultural, and in this case, gender."
"As we say, this could explain this discrimination in a somewhat relevant manner."
"We identify two types of discrimination, which is the most important."
"Firstly, I want to talk about the theory of Gary Becker, a great economist, Nobel Prize winner"
"- we're also economists, and our point of view is one focused on economy - whose theory of discrimination is also called the theory of taste, or of the preference for discrimination because it assumes that the employer has prejudices."
"In this case, if the discrimination is based on gender, then they're a misogynist, they don't like working with women."
"They don't hire women, or they don't promote them."
"This type of discrimination, as Becker puts it, tends to disappear with competition."
"If markets introduce more competition, an incompetent worker, as the employer of this example, will tend to be displaced by competition."
The most important thing that you have to remember when holding a baby especially a newborn is to cradle them holding their head and neck up to make sure that the head does not fall too back or too forward.
"There are few different holds that people prefer when holding a baby you can hold the baby chest to chest, you can hold the baby stomach to stomach on an angel, you can cradle the baby, you can hold the baby in what's call the football hold where you put your hand underneath their chin flip over the baby and pull them out stretch this way sometimes when people are walking around and need another free hand this may be helpful."
Some parents have the head lean back against the baby and hold them this way where they put their hands supporting underneath between their legs and hold them this way really as long as the baby is comfortable and you are comfortable and its safe it is important for you to do what ever is the most comfortable so you can do it often.
There is nothing that prompts bonding as much as holding and being close to your infant.
"A lot of parents when their arms get tired like to even put the baby in their lap so you can look right into their eyes this was my most favorite hold with my three daughters because they can grow up and fit right here as they grow and you can look into their eyes you can talk to them, you can hold their hands, you can play with their feet its a wonderful way to be close to the baby and but also see your baby because sometimes in certain holds like this one its hard to really see their whole face."
"So remember keep their head up and try to hold your baby as much as possible its really crucial for bonding during those first couple months that the baby feel very safe, very secure, and very much attach to mom or day."

JON GRUBER:
"At the beginning of the lecture, we're going to actually talk about productivity, one of the most important topics in economics."
"And really one of the most famous applications-- or, more generally, misapplications-- of the principles of diminishing marginal product in the history of economics."
Many of you may have heard of a guy named Thomas Malthus.
"He was a famous philosopher who, in 1798, posited the theory that we're all in big trouble."
And he did so following the basic tenets that I've taught you so far.
"Malthus pointed out look, we've got-- he said, think about production of food."
"He said, with the production of food you've got, as with any other production process-- he didn't put it in these terms, but basically he was appealing to what we"
learned last time.
"He said, like any other production process you've got two inputs, labor and capital."
"But with food, the capital is land."
"And unlike other kinds of capital, it's fixed even in the long-run."
"That is, we talked about the long-run being defined as the period of time over which all inputs are variable."
"Well, land is never variable."
"There's a certain amount of land on earth, that's not variable."
"And at the end of the day, production of food is essentially just short-run, there is no long-run."
"At the end of the day, production of food, capital's fixed, it's only labor."
"Moreover, in that situation labor has diminishing marginal product with a given amount of land."
"It doesn't matter how many workers you have, there's only so much you can grow on it."
"Obviously, as you increase workers you can grow more originally."
"But eventually, you'll run out of useful use for those workers, yet the demand for food will not stop growing."
"A-2 was the first open source project, because A-2 was given to UNlVAC's customers."
"For the first time customers were given source code to an interesting project, and they modified it and made suggestions and gave them back, and that helped to significantly improve the next A-3 and going on."
So open source is almost as old as computing.
"It's not quite as old, because it turned out open source didn't work unless you had multiple people with the same machine, and up until this point all machines were one offs."
"You'd build it usually as a research experiment and you'd learn things doing that, so the next one you built was going to be very different."
UNlVAC was the first time that people could share software across machines.
"A-2 led to A-3, and then to AT-3, which eventually got renamed as MATH-MATlC."
MATH-MATlC is now beginning to look like a modern programming language.
"In fact, it looks quite a bit like"
"FORTRAN, which was developed at about the same time."
"It was a huge advance in software development, and like all huge advances it was rejected by some of the best programmers of the day, who contended that programming took too much creativity and dexterity, that you couldn't replace the human with a machine, it's just not right."
Waa.
It's not going to work.
"It turned out they were wrong, that they completely misunderstood what these series of tools were intended to do; not to replace them but to help them be more productive."
One of the features of MATH-MATlC and FORTRAN was READ and WRlTE.
One characteristic of both of those systems is that they would stop the program while the I/O was happening and then suspend the program until the I/O was finished and then they would resume.
The thinking was that there's no reason to do anything else because the program was useless until it got the data it needed anyway.
It was also modelled after the way people were thinking about hardware at the time — that you've got a black box and it's got an input and it's got an output and something that happens in the middle.
So there's this symmetry between input and output.
"Later we find that there's not a good reason to demand that symmetry, but at the time we had it."
It was extremely influential.
"When we moved into timesharing, we took the same languages with us."
"We also invented some new ones, so we got BASlC, which was sort of a beginner's version of FORTRAN, but had basically the same model."
"The problem with writing interactive programs in those sorts of languages is that the programs are highly modal, so the user can only type in what the program is expecting at any point, because each READ statement is going to be different in its expectations of every other READ statement, and the user doesn't get to choose which READ statement it's going to execute next."
"Now, it turned out this worked really well for timesharing because it depended on the blocking in order to allow it to have the appearance it could be serving multiple people simultaneously, because once one program was blocked, others could run, and it turned out most users spent most of their time looking at the print out trying to figure out what to do next."
Virtually all programming languages have blocking I/O. READ and WRlTE are in almost every programming
language.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"ALGOL didn't specify I/O, and C was the big exception; it had no I/O at all, which was great because it meant you could modify the environment that you were going to run C in to use any I/O model that you wanted."
"So it was going to be a great thing for doing experimentation — except that it came with standard I/O, and that's the one everybody used, so it might just as well have been built into the language."
"Everything blocks, which is a shame."
"Meanwhile, in some of our research laboratories in places like SRI and Xerox PARC, people were experimenting with other models for how to do interactivity in programs."
But they're really openings.
And there is another one here.
"And the separation between these lines D is 0.088 millimeters,"
less than a tenth of a millimeter.
When you look at them you cannot even see that they are two lines.
"Our laser beam has a diameter of about 3 millimeters, which is 30 times larger than this distance, 30 times larger."
"So what I'm going to show you now that this is our laser beam, is not to scale, the laser beam is much larger than that."
"And so the light will go through some parts of these slots, as far as our laser beam reaches, and we are now capable of predicting when we're going to project it there, here are the two slots which are like so, and so you're going to get interference patterns in these directions theta, and we can calculate what the position X is going to be there between the maxima."
"And so if that is the screen and if this is X equals 0, and if this is X1 and this is X2, and of course the whole thing is symmetric, you can always go in the opposite direction, you can now calculate, and you have all the tools,"
"I did it for you in great detail using sound, but you have all the tools to do it now, you know D,"
"I'm going to tell you what lambda is, it's 6328"
"Angstroms, and one Angstrom is 10 to the -10 meters, so you can calculate all the direction theta for which there are maxima and for which there are minima."
"Minima means light plus light gives darkness, an amazing concept."
"And you can then if you know the distance from here to the screen, which is capital L, you can calculate what the separation is as we see it on the screen, and L is roughly 10 meters, maybe 11, but that's not so important."
"And so I calculated, and you can confirm that -- and you should confirm that, that the angle theta 1, I will only calculate theta 1, which is the angle then to this point, theta 0 is of course always 0, right, that's the easiest,"
"I find that theta 1 is 0.41 degrees, that is for maximum, and that means that X1 given the distance of 10 meters then becomes 7.2 centimeters."
"So from here to here on the screen, from maximum to maximum, will be about 7.2 centimeters, and from here to here will then of course also be about 7.2 centimeters, and in between you will see darkness."
"The light from the two sources, 180 degrees out of phase, and that will give you darkness."
Let me turn on the laser.
And turn off the lights.
Make sure I have my -- OK.
And there you see it.
"There you see a maximum, darkness, a maximum, darkness, a maximum, darkness, and so on."
And the separation if I didn't make a mistake between the maxima is indeed about 7 centimeters.
"Imagine what an incredible moment this is in your life, that you actually see that light plus light can make darkness."
"So the waves go simultaneously through both openings, and each opening acts like a"
"Huygens source, and the net result is that these two waves arrive there on the screen 180 degrees out of phase at the locations of darkness."
"The censor is of course that they have exactly the same frequency which is what they do, because we have one laser gun going in and so the wave goes through both slots."
"So we're guaranteed, and that was the secret, that Young understood you're guaranteed that the waves are not only the same frequency but they're even in phase because they both go through to both slots."
Now if you look very carefully here you will see of course that these maxima don't have the same strength.
We will understand next lecture why that's the case.
"They would have very closely the same strength if the opening where we scratched out the black on the slide was much, much smaller than the separation between the two slots, so to speak."
You know it's very worrisome if you disconnect for a while and think 'oh my friends are saying something and I don't hear it or there's new information about something I'm interested in'
"So I think the net, just as in someways I suppose the abundance of calories, and cheap calories encourages overeating, I think our natural instinct to overvalue the new, is fed by the technology."
"And, unfortunately, the expense of overvaluing the new, is sometimes we don't spend enough time looking at what's really important."
"If you have a new piece of information, but you know something new and trivial is coming, you often shift your eyes, shift your glance to consume the new stuff."
PETER NORVlG:
"Yeah I don't know if it's the net that contributes to that,"
I know it certainly makes the new available.
"I think its a pervasive problems in humans and not just humans, but in all mammals, that they value the short term over the long term."
"And Georgia Ansley in the Great Down of Will, says that the roots of addiction is that people say 'yes I see the benefit of taking this alcohol or drugs right now, and I can kind of discount the long term negative effects' and you need to be able to have some discipline to get past that and say 'I'm going to think about the long term, in a rational way and not just go for the short term effects.'"
And so we need those kinds of societal rules.
We need the parents saying 'you can only watch TV or you can only use video games or whatever for so much time.' We need the teachers saying 'you're not allowed to do this in the bathroom'.
"And even for adults, the need their ways to limit their own usage and make good use of technology."
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Unfortunately, we're going in the other direction, however."
We're giving ever younger kids cell phones with unlimited texting plans.
We are putting TV's and computers in their rooms and we are not supervising them.
"I mean anything we can do to counter those trends I'm all for, but we still have to pay attention to what's really going on, and the fact that it's becoming more and more socially accepted to be distracted all the time."
To talk to your spouse while glancing at your stream of email on your iPhone or something.
"I mean these things, to do it at a restaurant, I mean these things are becoming accepted in society."
"We seem, we're not imposing that kind of discipline and you know, maybe we will, but I don't see any signs that that's happening."
It seems to be going in the other direction.
PETER NORVlG:
"Again, it seems like every generation has its complaints about that., that we're all going to hell in a hand-basket , and we have been for every generation."
Let's see.
"I wanted to, I guess in a few minutes, we are going to do the question and answer."
"We talked about the information overload, we talked about the sort of addiction and irrational behavior and so on, and we talked about reading and deep reading."
"I guess one thing I wanted to say about that is, it seems like sometimes you're trying to have it two ways, that you're saying the experience you're really aiming for is this deep reading where we're contemplative and reflective and engaging in a deep way, but you're complaining about the web technology saying that it's changing our brains."
"And it seems to me that it can only change our brains, if it's engaging us deeply."
Is that a contradiction?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"It is kind of a contradiction, but I think there's, as I write in the book that one of the, probably one of the most profound characteristic of the net is that it seizes our attention only to shatter it."
"So, we become, we are immersed in the medium itself, very deeply immersed, but what we are immersed in is constant distractions and constant shifts of our attention and shifts of our focus"
"That means talk about it in your video, show it visibly on screen, use annotations and even in the description text of the video, which actually shows up right alongside of the video, right on your channel page there."
Make sure that you're talking about the subscribing there as well because ultimately the goal of the trailer is to talk to non- subscribed viewers and get them to click that subscribe button and become a part of your community.
YouTube also says to entertain the viewer and don't just tell them what you do and what you're about but show them.
"Use b-roll, use clips from past episodes and videos, really show them what you're all about and what they can expect if they subscribe."
"Number 3, they say to indicate somehow what type of videos that you make and then also kind of hint at your posting schedule and when people can expect new content from your channel."
"Number 4, they say to keep in mind that most viewers will potentially have already seen one of your other videos and that's why they're coming to your channel and they kind of check out more about what you're about."
So keep that in mind as you craft your script and what you're going to say in that video.
"And number 5, they say that there's no perfect length, but to keep it short and I think we can all agree with that."
"I say probably about 30 seconds is sufficient, although the one in this trailer doesn't do that but that's because I made it long ago and I'm going to fix that later."
"The YouTube tip that I would add for this is when you're explaining about what you do, make sure you include why you do it because I have found that most people don't really care as much about the what as much as they care about the deeper meaning behind it, the why."
"And if you can identify and articulate that quickly, what that is, I find that that's usually more emotional, more engaging and even if people aren't really interested in what kind of content you're doing, if they're really on-board with why you're doing it sometimes they will subscribe to you also."
"We've already talked extensively about why it's important to answer that why question both for you and for your audience, so click it right there if you want to go watch it or also link to it in the description below if you're watching this on mobile or something."
So I hope that's helpful.
"I'd love to hear from you guys, as always, what tips and advice do you have for your channel trailers as you've been experimenting with these and making them and maybe even finding out what's working and what's not."
"I'd love to hear from you guys and leave your comments, even if it's not just for me but for all the other video creators who will watch this."
The rest of you guys go check out what other people are saying because they usually leave good stuff.
And if this is your first time here we'd love to have you subscribe.
Why?
Because I believe that all you guys have a message that is important that people need to hear and I want to do whatever I can to help you guys spread your message so that the who people need to hear it can hear it and thus be impacted and I really enjoy helping you guys do that.
"So to do that, we talked about YouTube tips and advice every Wednesday."
"Tomorrow on Thursday we'll do some Q and A, just answering some of your questions and on Tuesdays we take a look at online video news and talk about what it means for us who are video creators."
"So all that is coming up, subscribe and I will see you guys tomorrow for some Q and"
A. Bye.

I know that records officers experiences in agencies with the level of access they're granted is highly variable.
So that may be something to discuss at your agency.
If that would be appropriate.
"And if it's determined that they should, that could be incorporated into the policy."
"So that doesn't answer the question, but I don't know that I can make that assessment."
"If that doesn't answer your question, go ahead and ask a followup on that and I can try again."
So the last one on here is to document the lessons learned from the pilot.
From this experience you can identify ways to improve for your next steps in conducting the project.
A successful organization and maintenance of shared drives is going to involve many stakeholders.
Senior management are key to serve as champions for the project.
"Records management staff ensure that the policies and procedures are maintained, and then followed."
"Information technology staff manage the network operations, information security, and help desk services."
"The subject matter experts, those end users that actually create and use content, can provide information about what's there and can tell you what's actually on the shared drive."
Staff responsible for litigation holds and pending information requests.
For FOlA or Privacy Act.
They can be helpful to prevent the deletion of any responsive content.
Organization of the shared drive involves analysis of the current state.
The current shared drive structure and any practices.
"This involves reviewing any IT requirements, IT platforms, enterprise architecture, security requirements."
All of these help to understand the impacts on the project or that the project may have on the systems.
To collect data regarding the current status.
"This could be the number of shared drives within an organization, the volume of content on each of those shared drives, the current directory structures, the file types and formats that exist, and file dates such as when the file was created or last modified."
"And then it's also helpful to evaluate any pending IT plans that could impact the project, such as a planned migration to a new shared drive or a consolidation."
Or any other technology issues or refreshes that might be happening or planned for the near future.
And then identifying and reviewing any controls that are currently in place.
"Such as certain offices may have their own naming conventions, version management, file plans, or ways they apply metadata to files."
And then the last one on here is to interview SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) and any other stakeholders to understand how they're using shared drives.
"So in identifying and removing unwanted content, think about using rules and queries to identify unwanted content."
"Some of this could include system-generated backup files, temp files, old applications, old install files, multiple copies of files that contain identical content in different formats."
In our experience we found that we often had a word document and the associated PDF.
"And they were the same document, but there were multiple copies in different places."
"This could include digital photos and videos that could be stored in another, more appropriate location."
"Essentially, you want to follow these symptom sets, and find out where the patient is at."
"It's actually an acronym that's commonly used: it's DSlGECAPS, and we'll kind of talk about it."
"You see a depressed mood, so again, assess their mood."
"Sleep: oftentimes patients with depression have difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep, so their sleep is often poor."
"Their interest in activities, guilt, their energy level: so how much energy they have to complete tasks."
"Their concentration: their ability to concentrate and follow through with things - again, somewhat feeding back into some of those productivity issues."
The appetite: oftentimes patients who are depressed don't necessarily eat more - they actually eat less.
So there's weight loss associated with depression and loss of appetite.
"That's physical slowness, or the psychomotor retardation, so kind of assessing them visually, as you're seeing the patients and looking at them, and saying, ""Okay, do they have kind of a spring in their step or not?"
"And is it coming back?"""
"And then, ultimately also any suicide risk."
We need to get some lab assessments when treating depression.
"We need to get a CBC, we need to make sure the patient's not anemic, or some other issue going on medically."
"Thyroid: patients with hypothyroidism, one of the biggest symptoms is depression."
"So, if this is just hypothyroidism, we can correct the thyroid, and avoid anti-depressant treatment."
So that's something we'd best rule out from the initiation.
"And the urine drug screen, again: substances of abuse, both during the intoxication phase and the withdrawal phase can cause symptoms of depression."
"So, looking at our treatment options, we've got lots of options out there."
"So, this is why it's becoming more prevalent, and more and more patients are being treated for depression, is because our treatment options have really grown."
"We're going to talk about some of the historical ones, but then we're going to spend most of our time talking about the agents that we do use, with utility, most often."
"So, when we introduce the antidepressant, you can see that it takes some time for the clinical effect to come across."
"So, what's happening is, we need time for the neurotransmitter to increase, we need time for the receptor sensitivity to down regulate, or the number of receptors to go down, and when those two things occur is when you see that bottom line of that affect, or the ""sad face"" going to the ""happy face""."
"So, we need to be patient with our medications, and allow for this process to occur."
"So, one of our treatment options that we can use, or some of the older drugs, are tricyclic antidepressants, or TCAs."
And this class is primarily serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
So they're actually going to prevent the brain from sucking back up serotonin and norepinephrine so it can't be used.
The amount of serotonin and norepinephrine really depends on the particular compound that is out there.
"We don't use a lot of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of depression anymore, and we'll talk about that: it's primarily due to the side effects."
"You will see these agents being used outside the scope of depression, for treatment of headache and pain, and things like that."
"So they are still used, but not necessarily in the treatment of depression, and they're used at much lower doses."
The side effects of tricyclic antidepressants are significant.
"And that, again, like I said, is the limiting factor of the drugs."
"There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them, to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance."
"Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time."
"When I started in this field, we thought there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 -- a very rare condition."
"Well, now we know it's more like one in 100."
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us.
"The societal cost of this condition is huge, in the US alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars."
And you know what?
"Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wraparound services -- services that are very, very intensive."
"And those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year."
"Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment, because now we know that autism creates itself as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you."
"Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point, and intervene and treat --"
"I can tell you, this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition."
"Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life."
It's not that that window closes; it doesn't.
But it diminishes considerably.
"And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't have access to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe."
So I feel that we have a bioethical imperative.
The science is there.
But no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community.
"And we just can't afford that missed opportunity, because children with autism become adults with autism."
"And we feel that those things we can do for these children, for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences -- for the child, for the family, and for the community at large."
So this is our view of autism.
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism.
"In fact, we believe there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes."
"And we actually have a bit of a question here, because if there are so many different causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?"
"Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism."
So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
"And the answer is what lies in between, which is development."
"And in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life, because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism."
Autism creates itself.
"Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others."
So how do we do that?
"So for each of these categories, I'm not going to spend much time on this."
"But for each of the categories, you can achieve points in different directions."
And you can imagine that the way that these points are allocated category by category could have a pretty significant implication for providing encouragement.
"By the way, why would a developer want to be LEED certified anyway?"
What's the value?
"Well, I mentioned one value that would be to the building industry at large, which is creating an incentive for a new line of products and a new approach to building design that would create jobs and cause the industry to grow generally."
"But most developers are in this because they know that if they achieve certification and the property value is higher, they can demand a premium for the structure or the complex."
"So that in this case, the sustainable sites category allows one to seek about twenty-three percent of total number of credits that are possible."
"So that these can be awarded for brownfield redevelopment, for alternative transportation, the bike storage area that you find behind Osborne Laboratory caused FES to gain additional points."
"The management of storm water, trying to manage a heat island effect, reduce that intensity of heat absorption by creating green roofs."
There was a green roof that's on part of that site.
"Water efficiency also is a source of possible points, about nine percent of the total."
"So that within this category, appliance efficiency, fixtures and fittings are good examples of different ways of saving water as well as the landscaping that I mentioned earlier."
And I wanted to mention a couple of kind of relatively recent technological designs.
"One is these leverless faucets that sense your presence, either by an electronic eye or sensing heat that causes them to turn on and off."
And it's kind of interesting.
"You know, I have become more curious about this and watch people's hand washing behavior, particularly in places like airports."
And it's really common to have a whole array of these things on a countertop.
And people often have to move from one the other to get one to work.
"And after that happens a number of times, people I think are more likely just to not wash their hands."
So there's a sanitation problem that is potentially associated with it.
"If you go into the men's rooms and look at the flushless urinals, you will immediately recognize that there is a serious problem in Kroon."
And it's led many to argue that they really would rather make the tradeoff between the odor in the bathroom that might otherwise be managed by improving the heating and ventilation system.
"So that right now, no water is used in this toilet, only a synthetic compound is put in to try to maintain its sanitation."
But it often is not as effective as it is promoted to be.
So that water efficiency can be achieved in a variety of ways.
"The faucets themselves are often fitted with restrictions in flow so that if you're interested in taking a more powerful shower, you'll need to figure out how to get the flow restrictor out, which many people do try."
The flow restrictor itself is governed by local and state building codes.
"And it was kind of interesting to me, it was an education for me."
"When I wondered, I asked a plumber who was installing a new faucet in my sink, and I said, you know, I really would like a larger rate of flow in this sink so that I could be more effective in washing dishes or whatever."
"And he said, well you know, you really don't understand the energy implications of not restricting the flow."
"And if you thought about it, then you'd realize that the energy costs are really quite high to move the water to your home."
So this is where the nutrient-rich waters are coming to the surface.
"And in a place like the coast of Peru, you have millions and billions of seabirds, that are eating billions and trillions of anchovies and sardines, that are feasting on trillions and quadrillions of shrimp, that are eating algae, coming up there."
Okay?
"So you have the cold Humboldt current coming up and bending offshore here, heading out for the Galapagos, and as it's moving out towards the west-- in the Southern Hemisphere, remember, it is coming up towards the equator; the equator has a greater angular velocity than the southern part of South America, and the water is getting kind of left behind by the planet, as the planet pulls out this way."
"And because you have a continent here, there's no water that's left there to flow over and replace it."
"So the only place it can come up from is the bottom, and it comes up from the bottom and fertilizes this zone off the"
West Coast of South America.
"Well over the course of hundreds of millions of years the seabirds that nest on islands offshore, so that they can get away from the predators that would their eggs on a continent, have built up a huge deposit of guano on the Chilean Islands."
"And this was a matter of international significance, prior to the First World War, because nitrogen was so critical in the manufacture of arms."
"You remember the Oklahoma City bombing, when Timothy McVeigh simply took nitrogen fertilizer and mixed it with diesel fuel, and put it into a truck and blew up a building."
"A lot of energy in nitrogen; okay, nitrate, powerful stuff."
And this is where the world supply was.
"And, by the way, that repeats at many other upwelling areas around the globe."
"And just prior to World War One, Haber and Bosch figured out a way of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere, as ammonia and urea--they did it at high temperature and pressure-- and that was actually what kept"
Germany in the war between 1916 and 1918.
Okay?
So the reason I am mentioning this is that I'm trying to use a vivid example that shows you how the flow of materials between different compartments and ecosystems has actually influenced world history for human culture.
And in this case it was basically the seabirds taking it out of the ocean and putting it on land; and putting it on in huge quantities.
So now there's about 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer produced every year.
"It's about 1% of global industrial energy, and it sustains 40% of the global human population."
"So these kinds of processes actually are part of the substructure of our modern and post-modern culture, and it gives you some feel for an ecosystem service."
"Prior to the Haber-Bosch process, this fixing of nitrogen out of the atmosphere could only be done by biological organisms, and this is an estimate really of how big that ecosystem function was."
"Okay, so let's run through some of these cycles."
Almost all the nitrogen that's on the surface of the planet is biologically inaccessible; it's in the form of
N_2.
N_2 is a molecule that is extremely difficult to react with.
"And there are--it can be converted into something that's biologically accessible, primarily by bacteria and by cyanobacteria and by lightening."
"So if you go out and simply have a lightening storm pass overhead, and you compare the rain that you get out of it, with and without lightening, in the five minutes or so after a lightening strike directly overhead, if you're holding a cup out there, you're going to be getting nitrogen fertilizer."
"It'll be fairly dilute, but it's over a huge area."
Much more important are the bacteria and cyanobacteria that can convert nitrogen into nitrate.
"And most of that's going on in the soil, okay?"
So this is biological fixation.
"The way that Dan is gonna try to defraud the system is by attempting to create another transaction, in which he assigns the 5 BTC he got from Carol to somebody else."
Let's call this person Fred.
"Fred could be Dan's alter ego, could be a friend of Dan's."
It doesn't matter who Fred is because we know that Fred isn't the rightful owner of these bitcoins.
What Dan is gonna try to do is he is gonna try to take those 5 bitcoins that he got from Carol and he is gonna now try to take these 5 bitcoins and assign them over to Fred.
"This is something that we don't want to allow because that would mean that somehow Dan was able to spend these 5 bitcoins twice over, he's effectively double spent those bitcoins."
"Obviously, one of these transactions should be considered fraudulent."
The other one should be allowed to go through.
"It's important to keep in mind that if Dan just tried to spend the same coins again without trying to cover his tracks or anything of that nature, everybody out there would know that Dan is up to no good because thay can see from the existing longest transaction block chain, namely this existing chain from the beginning, they can see that Dan already spent these coins before, he shouldn't be allowed to spend these coins again."
"What Dan has to do is he has to create a different transaction block chain that contains just the second bogus transaction in it, and this will be the transaction to Fred, and that would leave out the other transaction to Pete."
"Hopefully, everybody else will start to accept or believe this newer chain."
"Since everyone in Bitcoin ultimately goes with the transaction block chain that contains the most work, namely this longest chain that we talked about,"
"Dan has a chance, he has a hope potentially of being able to pull off this type of a fraudulent scheme."
The real question now is how likely is it for Dan to succeed.
"For Dan to be able to pull this off, he has to start off with the transaction block chain that existed previously and he has to try to add to that transaction block chain a different transaction."
"So, rather than having this previous transaction where he gave money to Pete, he is gonna try to create a new transaction and add it to the transaction block chain that contains this other fraudulent transaction between Dan and his friend Fred."
This is gonna be the bad transaction between Dan and Fred that will be in this new block.
In Bitcoin lingo this idea is known as a fork in the chain.
And what is meant by a fork is that somehow there is more than one version of histories.
Somebody tried to rewrite their tracks or to cover their tracks and to revise history the way we know it.
What that really means is that there is now somehow more than one version of what happened out there.
"In this example, one branch in this fork is legitimate and the other branch is bogus."
The legitimate branch was the one where Dan paid his friend Pete for pizza and the bogus one is this follow on transaction where Dan attempted to pay his friend Fred with those same exact bitcoins.
"Remember that any transaction block that's added to this transaction block chain has to contain within it a proof of work puzzle, or solution rather to a proof of work puzzle."
"Otherwise, noone will accept the chain."
"So, if Dan wants to cheat the system, he has to secretly solve a new proof of work puzzle himself."
"But the challenge for Dan is that he is starting off with a bit of a handicap, because there is already this longer chain out there that people have started accepting."
"Keep in mind that because this chain is out there, other nodes may have started to build on top of this chain."
"Every ten minutes, somebody is adding to this chain on average."
"So, there is this longer transaction block chain out there and Dan wants to create his own fake chain."
"So, in order for that chain to be believable he has to now be the longest chain out there and he has to basically do all this proof of works to create the chain that is longer."
"To come up with this longer chain on his own,"
"Now, the problem comes If x and y are different."
"So consider the situation where x and y are different machines, different architectures."
"Alright, And I've been implying that they are, but they don't have to be."
"I mean, I mean, you could compile on, one kind of architecture and run the same code on the same architecture."
But the interesting situation is when x and y are different architectures.
"And so let's consider something like, you know, in, in, you know, machine X, let's say we have the instruction, A=1.5+3.7."
"Mm-kay, And you would like to constant fold that down to a=5.2 Alright?"
"Now the problem is that if you simply execute this as a floating point operation, on, architecture x, the round off and you know the floating point semantics in architecture x maybe slightly different, from these semantics on architecture y."
"It could be that if you do that in architecture y, directly, that you might get something like a.5, you know, a=5.19."
"There might be a small difference in the floating point result, depending on whether you execute the instruction here or here."
"And this becomes significant in the case of constant folding and, and cross compilation."
"Because some al gorithms really depend on the floating point numbers being treated very, very consistently."
"So if you're going to round off the operation one way, you need to do it that way for every time you do that particular operation, And by shifting the computation from comp, from run time when it would have executed an architecture y, back into the compiler winds of executing architecture x."
You can change the results of the program.
So how do cross compilers actually deal with this?
"So, so compilers that want to be careful about this kind of thing, what they will do is, they will represent the floating point numbers as strings inside the compiler and they will, do the obvious, long form addition, and multiplication, division operations are the floating operations directly on the strings."
"Keep the full precision Inside the compiler And then, in the generated code, produced the literal, that is the full precision flowing point number And then let the architecture, of the architecture y decide how it wants to round that off, okay?"
So that's the really careful way to do constant folding of floating point numbers if you're worried about cross compilation.
"Continuing on with local optimizations, another important one is to eliminate unreachable basic blocks."
So what's an unreachable basic block?
That is one that is not the target of any jump or fall through.
"So if I have a piece of code, that can never execute, and it might never execute because there's no jump that jumps to the beginning of that piece of code and it's not, it doesn't follow after another instruction that can fall through to it."
"Well than that piece of code, that basic block is just not gonna be used, it's unreachable and it can be deleted from the program."
This has the advantage of making the code smaller.
"So obviously, since the basic block is unreachable, it's not contributing to the execution costs of the program in terms of the instruction count."
So the code is never executed.
"So it's not really slowing down the code because, you know, extra instructions are being executed, But making the program smaller can actually make it run faster because of cache effects."
"So the instructions have to fit into memory just like, just like the data."
"And if you make the program smaller, it makes it easier to fit the program in memory, and you may increase the spacial locality of the program."
Instructions that are used together may now be closer to each other.
And that can make the program run more quickly.
Before continuing on I want to say a word or two about why unreachable basic blocks occur.
"I want to discuss some of the basic principles of psychopharmacotherapy, that need to be thought about when we're looking at all of these treatment options."
"Essentially, first, we need to make sure that the diagnosis is correct."
"So we need to have a good assessment, and this is fundamental in the treatment selection."
"Oftentimes, medications alone are not sufficient for complete recovery."
"So, patients may need to be referred to some sort of counseling or non-medication based therapy plan."
The phase of illness is important in terms of the specific intervention and duration of treatment.
"So, again, this may not apply as much in depression treatment, but in various mental illnesses, we really need to look at how the patient is presenting at that moment and how we select the medication."
"The risk/benefit ratio must always be considered with treatment planning, so we need to make sure that we know the positives and negatives of the selection."
We need a prior personal or family history of good or poor response to a specific agent.
And this usually can help us dictate a first choice.
So this will be some of the things that you need to make sure you get in terms of the information of each individual patient.
"Each individual patient will present with different target symptoms, and how their illness is presenting."
Not every patient will present the same.
"So you need to get a good baseline assessment for depression, for example, of how they're functioning:"
How is their sleep?
How is their appetite?
How is their interest from baseline?
So you can use those individual markers as treatment response.
And then we always need to be aware of adverse events occurring.
So we need to observe the patient for the development of adverse events during the course of their treatment.
"When looking at the treatment of depression, we're going to be talking about a lot of symptoms."
And we're going to be talking about some chemical imbalances.
"And some of the primary chemical imbalances we see are with serotonin, commonly referred to as 5HT, and norepinephrine, commonly referred to as NE."
"And you can kindof see some of the symptoms we're going to be talking about, and how they relate to the different deficiencies."
"So with serotonin, we tend to see the depressed mood, some of the anxious symptoms, maybe some of the panic, the fears; we also see some related obsessions and compulsions and some of the appetite issues with serotonin."
"Interestingly enough, bulimia and eating disorders are often related to a serotonin deficiency also."
"On the norepinephrine side is where we see a lot of the cognitive function, the difficulty with concentration, attention, and memory."
"We also see the depressed mood on the norepinephrine side, but the last difference is that we also see the physical fatigue and psychomotor retardation, so that physical slowness and lack of energy."
"So it's just an interesting way to look at how the medication selections, and how they're affecting the different neurotransmitters may actually affect some of the symptom sets when you're assessing the patient."
"When we look at an episode of depression, we're not only looking at a time course of something happening immediately."
So you can look at the bottom of the slide that you see.
The time course to depression is over six to twelve months.
"So low emitting paints, varnishes, polyurethanes, are now designated."
"So that if you look at the can of oil-based paint, you'll find that roughly two and a half pounds of volatile organic compounds are contained."
Whereas certain paints are now manufactured with no volatile organic compounds.
You might also think about the compact fluorescents that pose kind of an interesting problem in that they contain mercury.
"So that this is a piece of personal advice for you, as you install or remove compact fluorescents, be really careful about them."
"Because if they break in your room, it's going to scatter mercury around, and the mercury will vaporize."
"If it gets into a rug and you vacuum the rug, the rug is going to give off the mercury vapors, and it will increase the volatilization rate."
And it will be just about impossible to completely remove the mercury from the room.
So this is a problem associated with the compact fluorescents that is turning into a rather interesting and serious dilemma for waste management.
So not many people really want to take an old burned out light bulb back to a recycling center.
"In fact, the probability of getting it there without breaking it is probably not too great."
"And also, think about again, plastics and landfill."
An increasing proportion of the interior built environment is made up of a variety of plastics that we've talked about in the past.
But the extremely low chance that plastics are going to be recycled is a logic to rethink the way that points are allocated.
There was an interesting debate inside the Green Building
"Council about polyvinylchloride plastics and whether or not PVCs ought to be either banned or whether or not you would have credits removed if you used PVC, as opposed to a more recyclable product like polyethylene, that most soda bottles are made out of."
"But they decided not to do that, which is quite curious."
"So thinking about the kinds of materials that are put down on floors, the sealants also."
This is encouraged.
"Credits can be gained if you choose not just the low VOC paints, but also the clear finishes."
"Also, you'll find a variety of products, including this type of a vinyl flooring that you could see in"
"Kroon Hall, particularly in the stairwells, that gives off volatile compounds that I haven't been able to identify and the manufacturers are not required to label."
"So think about the variety of different products that go into the construction of a building, and how these products may change the chemical content of that environment."
So that the quality of the air exchange system is really critical to govern the chemical exposures that occur.
And this is particularly the case in a new building.
"As an example, rugs."
"Rugs may be made out of natural products, natural fibers, such as wool or cotton or now increasingly some reed material from South America."
"But rugs that are made out of synthetic compounds and their backing, many are recommending that those be aired out in a warehouse or in a garage for a period of time, up to a couple weeks before they're installed so that occupants of new buildings would not be exposed to those fumes."
A couple of other examples that are not managed by LEED.
Certain golf courses have been certified.
Whereas the expectation on the part of the Green Building
Council is that the chemicals that are used are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
"So that's really pretty much doing the ancestor computation, which by the way is a transitive closure."
I should have mentioned that earlier for those of you familiar with transitive closures.
It's basically that operation.
So we're going to compute these superiors so that we'll have every manager and employee relationship with a manager is arbitrarily above the employee.
"And then once we have that superior relationship computed, then we write a actually a fairly complicated query, so this is the final query of our with statement."
And this one says we've got this recursive relation superior.
We're going to the salaries from the employee relation where the
"ID is either the manager of the project X, so that's the first half here, or an employee, that's managed by the manager, of project X. Okay."
"Now this down here, I just want to emphasize this is not recursive, it just so happens to have that same structure of union, but there is nothing recursive happening down here."
So this is just a regular sequel query.
"Once we have the superior relation, that's the transitive closure of the manager relation."
So let's take a look at superior.
"Superior, here this is recursive with the union, says that if we have a manager and that's the MlD and ElD."
Then if somebody is managing someone else then they are their superior.
"Notice by the way, I didn't specify a schema here, so the schema is implicitly going to be M-I-D-E-I-D."
So we're going to put manager relationships in.
"And then, if we have a superior relationship, so if we have an MlD managing an"
ElD in the S relationship then we can add one more
"level, because we join with the managers saying that if"
S is a superior of Y and why is the manager of Z been X's superior of Z. This parallels exactly what we did with the ancestor computation in the previous example.
"Again, it's going to be rather anti-climactic to run the query, but let's do it."
"And, we find out that four hundred is the total salary cost of Project X when we count the manager of project"
X together with all of the people underneath that manager in the hierarchical structure.
So when we think of recursion we often think of transitive closure or expanding hierarchies as we've done with our examples so far.
"But if we step back for a second we can see that there is a quite a bit simpler way to express the query that finds the salary burden of project X. Now not only is this actually nicer to look at, it's probably much more efficient, depending on how smart the query processor is."
"In our previous example, if the query processor executes the query in a straight forward way, it would compute this superior relationship for the absolute entire company hierarchy before it figured out which of those people were involved in project X. Now, a really good query processor might actually figure out to fold in a project X but, not necessarily."
Here's an example and here's a new formulation of the query.
We're actually going to tie
X specifically to our recursion.
What we're going to compute in our recursive [xx] statement here.
So this is the temporary relation we're computing is a relation containing just a list of the IDs of the employees who are involved in project X.
"Once we have all the employees involved in project X, the query down here is trivial."
"But there is some higher, supply curve that looks like this."
"That it, we can call it S2, that captures, the, all costs."
"Private and social, private and external costs."
The.
"Vertical distance A B is an indication of these external costs that are not captured, and if it's a truly competitive market these costs can't be captured by the producers."
The producer tries to incur these internal.
Internal costs.
"That is, if the producers try to abate the pollution, then their cost structures will be higher then their competitors."
"And, their competitors will be able to charge, lower prices than, than they do."
So if there's an opportunity to externalize some of your costs on the surrounding communities.
"Then, in a competitive market producers must externalize those costs."
Well this means though that the equilibrium market price is going to be P1 and the quantity is going to be Q1.
But the true equilibrium
"Where all costs and all benefits are captured by the relevant curves should be this, this higher intersection, where the thin supply curve intersects with the demand curves."
"That is if all costs were captured by producers including the pollution cost, then the price would be P2 and the quantity would be Q2."
Well that's not gonna happen without government intervention in a highly competitive market because again While producers are going to be pressured to externalize any costs that they can.
"That means that in this kind of market, where there are external costs involved, there is going to be overproduction."
There is going to be also underpricing.
Of the good.
That is consumers are going to be able to get a price that does not capture all of the cost.
"So you can say part of the problem here is that these producers are emitting waste, emitting pollutants, but it's also, you can also say, well, pollution's are take, I mean, consumers are taking advantage, this pollution through lower A lower prices."
"Now notice that for each of the units be tween Q2 and Q1, the true marginal cost of production, the true marginal cost, where all cost are considered, those marginal costs are greater than these marginal values of these units, that is The costs of production exceeds, consumers evaluations, of those units."
"It means, that for every unit between Q2 and Q1, the additional cost, is greater than the additional, benefit."
"So, in a sense, there is a misuse of resources equal to this triangular area x, y and z."
And that's what we refer to in economics as an inefficiency.
We can get that inefficiency in another way and just basically say that the value of each of these goods is the vertical distance between the demand curve and the horizontal axis.
"If you add up all of the marginal values of all these units or if you just integrate across Q2, Q1 under the demand curve you're going to get, additional value of these units equal to Q2. x, z, Q1."
"If you add up all of the cost which are the vertical, the marginal cost of the vertical distances between this stanard supply curve and the horizontal axis, then you're going to get additional, cost of producing these goods equal to Q2, x YQ1."
"This additional cost exceeds this additional value by the tune of this triangular, area there."
"Well, you might ask, how can, this inefficiency, be remedied?"
"Well there's an obvious way, that's been used, and that is that, the government can come in, and impose regulations, on the firms."
"Force firms to abate, their pollution."
As far as sugar and sweetened beverages ago for most people with diabetes there certainly is not a lot of room for these products.
"I've worked with people however who love regular soda or they just love fruit juice and they really want it to be a part of their meal plan, and I can certainly work it in there although the key is that the portion sizes are often smaller then you would normally see for the general population."
There's not a lot of room to have a 20 oz regular soda.
"But if the person wants 6 or 8 ounces, I can work that amount of carbohydrate into a well-balanced meal plan."
"But the key is to really limit the sugar and sweetened beverages for all people, but particularly for people who have diabetes."
What does the research say about the relationship between sweetened and sugary beverage intake and diabetes?
"In 2010 a group of researchers performed a meta-analysis of 8 different prospective cohort studies, looking at a total of over 300,000 subjects."
The people that had a diet that was high in sugar-sweetened beverages were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
The highest versus the lowest quantile of sugar sweetened beverage intake had a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
And what this data is showing you is that the intake of sugared sweetened beverages should be limited in order to reduce the obesity related risk of chronic disease.
Okay?
So ther e's nothing magical about the sugary beverages that's going to give you diabetes.
Diabetes or we know that people who are more drinking sugary sweet beverages are going to on average gain more excess weight and then excess is going to play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Saturated is also of importance for people that have diabetes.
You might think well saturated fat is something that effects your heart disease risk profile and well that's true.
We know that there is a very strong correlation.
Between people who are at risk for diabetes or who have diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk.
So the recommendation for saturated fat is that it be restricted to less than 7% of calories and that works out to about sixteen grams of saturated fat for someone on a two thousand calorie diet.
"To put that into prespective, one ounce of regular cheese has about five grams of saturated fat."
"So you've got to keep your cheese, you meat, your full fat dairy, butter, lard intake as low as possible in order to help reduce heart disease related risks in diabetes."
Trans fat should also be minimized because of the same potential for increasing heart disease risk factors.
Trans fat along with saturated fat.
Brings our bad cholesterol levels up and has the potential to also slightly lower the good cholesterol levels.
Alcohol is a consideration for people who have diabetes.
"For people that drink alcohol in moderation, it can certainly be worked in as part of a healthy meal plan, but excessive alcohol consumption or alcohol consumption in the absense Absence of the other macro-nutrients can be very problematic and can cause hypoglycemia and even, in some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis in others."
"If you do drink alcohol, it should be done so in moderation and moderation is defined as no more than one drink per day per women and no more than two drinks per day, on average, for men."
"So, what exactly is a drink?"
This picture here is showing you the standard amount of drink.
Now some of this information might vary from location to location because of the different percentage in content of alcohol in some commonly consumed alcohol beverages.
But roughly twelve ounces of regular beer.
5 ounces of table wine or 1 and a half fluid shot of 80 proof liquor.
And 80 proof liquor is 40% alcohol.
So this is not something that someone wakes up in the morning and feels suddenly depressed the next day.
It usually takes them a period of time to slip from that normal mood phase down to that depressed phase.
"And then, on the same side, you can see that it doesn't immediately turn into recovery or remission, so we do have a time lag that we need to address."
"Often times, in the patient's first episode of depression, you will not see them seek treatment until they're at the very bottom of this illustration."
"Versus someone who has suffered from multiple episodes of depression, they may know kind of the slippery slope that's ahead of them, and they may start to seek treatment halfway down the slide, the slope, versus all the way down to the very bottom of the barrel for their symptom set."
So now let's get into the actual diagnoses that are required by the DSM-IV.
The DSM-IV is the book within psychiatry that classifies all the mental illnesses.
"So, for depression, we're requiring at least five or more symptoms, present for two weeks, most of the day, nearly every day."
"So, of these symptoms, we have depressed mood, and loss of interest or pleasure."
Keep in mind those first two symptoms are asterisked and bolded.
"That's because one of the five symptoms must be either depressed mood, or loss of interest or pleasure."
"Then some of the others are: appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and suicidal ideation."
"Continuing with the diagnosis, we need to add that these symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning."
Symptoms are not due to a medical condition or drug use.
And symptoms are not due to bereavement.
"So again, this is not an immediate reaction, due to some sort of loss."
Patients - everyone is still going to go through the normal grief process.
And then symptoms are not due to another mental illness.
"So we have to make sure, again, we have the correct diagnoses."
The DSM also categorizes some different types of depression.
"For the most part, what we're going to be focusing on is Major Depression in the typical sense."
"Atypical Major Depression - patients tend to have a little bit different subset of primary symptoms, meaning they tend to have more sedation, sleep more often, and actually have an increase in appetite."
And then psychotic depression patients can also become psychotic when they are depressed.
And so those are some other categories that are out there that I wanted you to be aware of.
"Dysthimia is kind of a situation where it's not a full-blown depression, it's just their general their mood that they're at is a lower level mood."
But it doesn't necessarily meet criteria for full Major Depression.
"There can be organic causes, so it can be traumatic injury to the head or brain."
Could be substance induced or medication induced.
"We know alcohol is a depressant, we know certain beta-blockers for blood pressure control can cause depression."
So there's different types that we need to be aware of.
"But for the majority of this discussion, we're going to be focusing on the typical Major Depression."
The reason we spend so much time emphasizing the importance of depression is: the prevalence numbers continue to rise.
"It's also found in foods like liver, eggs, dairy, meat, poultry and seafood, which of course are all of animal origin."
So what exactly is gluten?
"Gluten is the protein that's found in wheat, rye and barley."
"Technically, that's a misnomer, Gluten really is found only in the endosperm of wheat, but certain transport proteins in rye and barley can also trigger and set off allergic reactions."
"And so we say, in general, it's the protein from wheat, rye, and barley."
What about oat?
You sometimes hear people that have Celiac disease don't eat oats.
"Oats by themselves are inherently a gluten free food, but the majority of the oats that we eat are processed in facilities that have come into contact with either wheat, rye, or barley."
"So unless you're absolutely certain that you're eating a gluten-free oat product, most people assume that the oats have been cross contaminated, and people with Celiac disease would leave them out of their diet."
So where is gluten found in the diet?
"If you can't eat wheat, rye, and barley, then there's a lot of things that are automatically out of the diet, breaded foods, breads, most cereals, pizza, stuffing."
"But there's less obvious sources of gluten as well, beer has gluten, so do some candies, communion wafers, marinades."
"It's very important that a person who has Celiac disease, become quite proficient at"
label reading and investigating the ingredient lists.
"People with Celiac disease often find themselves calling up food manufacturers to see, does this product contain gluten or not?"
Take a look at these two fried foods.
These are both sides that you might choose if you are at a fast food restaurant.
"On the left-hand side, you see french fries and on the right-hand side, you see onion rings."
"Taking a closer look at these ingredient lists, which one do you think is not appropriate in the diet of someone who has Celiac disease."
"Well, if you look closely at the onion rings, you can see that one of the ingredients that makes up the batter of the onions is wheat flour."
Wheat contains gluten.
"But what you might not know, is that if these two foods were fried together in the same fryer, neither would be appropriate for someone with Celiac disease, because the french fries have come into contact with the oil where the wheat from the onion rings was fried."
"So people who eat out who have Celiac disease, have to be very careful to avoid cross-contamination."
"So if there's all these gluten-containing foods that people with celiac disease can't eat, what can they eat?"
"Well, that's one area where celiac disease dietitians really hone in on."
"If you're going to adopt a gluten-free diet because you have Celiac disease, it's important for your overall psyche and general well-being, that you think of this diet of something that involves a lot of new foods that you get to try."
"As opposed to just, well all my favorite foods, I can't eat now."
"Cereals made without wheat or barley malt, corn, fruits and vegetables, milk based items, potatoes, rice, many fruits and vegetables, these things you can make up a very well balanced gluten-free diet."
"Grains are important, for individuals that have Celiac disease, everyone should be aiming to eat more whole grains."
"But there's a number of different whole grains that you might not have originally considered as part of your diet, that are gluten-free, that provide you with important vitamins and minerals, and a good source of fiber."
"What about people who follow a gluten-free diet, when they don't have celiac disease?"
"This is something you're seeing a lot of, especially in the United States."
"The Chinese say, failure is not falling down."
Failure is refusing to get up.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
In this segment I'm going to return to dependency parsing.
"Right in the first segment, I introduced the idea of dependency syntax, but let's look again at how that worked."
So the idea of dependency syntax is you connect up the words of a sentence by putting arrows between them that show relationships of being modifiers or arguments of other words.
"So here, in this example, we've got the head of the whole sentence submitted and it's got its dependents, so it's got bills submitted by somebody and then also the auxiliary verb were."
"Now, not necessarily, but quite commonly the arrows are typed by the name of some grammatic relation."
"And so we can see that here, where we've got the subject of a passive, the verbal auxiliary, and the prepositional relationship."
The other things that you should know about is just a bit of the terminology.
"So firstly when we have an arrow we always have the thing that is the head, or the governor, here submitted, and the thing that is the dependent, modifier, inferior; various words are used as you can see over here, here bills."
"So that they're the two ends, the governor and the governed thing of a dependency."
"Now, beyond that there's actually some inconsistency about how things are done."
So in these slides and in the original dependency grammar work of Tesnière the arrows run from the governor to the dependent.
But you can absolutely also find other work that points the arrows the other way.
"And actually if like here you're using height in the tree to show what's dependent of what, you actually don't need to have any arrows at all."
You could just draw these on lines without any arrowhead on them.
"Okay, so, as in this example, normally what you find is that dependencies form a tree."
"So that there's a root node, and then, from there, everything heads down with words having a single head, and in a nice acyclic manner."
"I should mention also that it's actually quite common to add sort of one pseudo node at the top, often called root or wall which points at the head of the sentence."
"That actually makes things a lot cleaner, both in terms of the parsing algorithms but also in terms of things like evaluation and representation because then you get the property that every word of the sentence including the root is the dependent of one thing."
And so you can think of it as doing an assignment process of working out what is the governor of each word of the sentence.
How does dependency grammar relate to the kind of phrase structure grammar that we've concentrated on so far?
"Well, the central innovation is really that dependency grammar is built around the notion of having heads and dependents, whereas the basic case of a context-free grammar, there's no notion of a head whatsoever."
And actually things have moved on from there.
"If you look at modern ex, modern linguistic theory, that means things like"
"X-bar grammar to linguists, or our modern statistical parsers whether the"
Charniak-Collins or Stanford parser.
All of them have a notion of head and use it extensively.
"So for example, in all these parsers, there's a notion of head rules where it'll identify some category as the head of a larger category."
"And as soon as you have head rules of the kind that we discussed before, well then you can straightforwardly get the dependencies out of a phrase structure representation."
"The question is, ""Do you use a shared drive for record-keeping?"""
Or do you use a shared drive to store records?
I see we've got 16 yes's.
We've got almost everyone answering.
"This looks like we have - I won't try to guess the percentage, but the majority of the people said that they do use a shared drive to store records."
What we found is that this does match with our experiences in talking to agencies about their shared drives.
This is helpful to get an idea of where the attendees are today.
Thank you.
So let's look at the question of whether a shared drive can be a record-keeping system.
"First, record-keeping systems must meet the NARA regulations in 36-CFR-1236."
This includes a list of the requirements for an electronic record-keeping system.
The thing to note here is that we included a shared drive on its own with only default settings and no additional configuration or steps taken does not provide the functionality of an electronic record-keeping system.
"However through consultation with our office of general counsel, we determined that shared drives could be record-keeping systems through a combination of manual and automated policies and procedures."
And so in the next few slides I will outline those policies and procedures and the functionalities that must be in place when using a shared drive in order for it to qualify as a record-keeping system.
To do this - managing records on a shared drive that does provide the functionality of a record-keeping system will be a challenge.
"And it does require significant manual intervention, as we learned in our interviews with agencies."
One thing we found is that smaller units or offices may have better success with the scalability of such an implementation.
"For example, we spoke with one agency that had a shared drive set up just for their records management staff."
They had success with managing the controls and the files on the shared drive with this limited staff.
Now I'll go over to the challenges for record-keeping on shared drives.
"As I mentioned in the previous slide, a shared drive can be a record-keeping system through a combination of manual and automated policies and procedures."
But these are the specific challenges that must be addressed.
"We outline them in the bulletin, and I have them listed here on the slide."
The first challenge is ensuring that records are scheduled and managed according to approved disposition.
"As I explained with some of these other challenges, it can be challenging to ensure that records are associated with the approved disposition when they're in various places and may not be organized on a shared drive."
"Following up with this, identifying the record copy when multiple copies and versions exist."
There's no built-in feature for shared drives to identify one copy as the record copy.
But it is possible to create a folder structure or use naming conventions to do this.
But it can require that those who create the files or manage them follow specific rules to do this.
The third challenge is implementing controls to protect the trustworthiness of records and their related metadata.
Examples of this include protecting access to folders and drives that contain personnel or other information that shouldn't be seen by all the people that have access.
This also includes taking steps to ensure that characteristics of trustworthy records such as reliability that the records represent the actual transaction.
And so we might wanna test that assumption.
Now we've looked at sample autocorrelations.
"And, you know, kind of looked at the magnitude of them as a, as a rough gauge for this assumption."
But we'd like to have a rigorous statistical test.
We'd like to test the hypothesis that the
J flag autocorrelation is truly zero.
Versus the alternative that it's not zero.
And you know again if we reject this assumption then you know that's evidence perhaps that there is some systematic time dependence in the data that we could use to forecast future returns.
And if you can forecast future returns then you know you should be able to make you know better portfolio decisions make for money in terms of looking at our assets.
"So, This type of assumption is often used in the context of determining, you know, whether or not we can develop a systematic training strategy to make money."
And in the general finance literature there's something known as the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis.
"And the efficient markets hypothesis says, you know, asset return should correctly and fully reflect all relevant information about firm valuation."
And one of the implications of an efficient market is that continuously compounded return should follow should be uncorrelated over time.
"That is, the news entering market should be unpredictable."
"And so this is another, another use of this hypothesis is, so it's a, actually test a form of the efficient-market's hypothesis."
"And then finally, and this is one of things that I like to emphasize in this class, is, Is testing the assumption that the parameters are constant over time."
"So, you know, the reason why I called this model the constant expected return model is that it emphasis that when we use the model we are assuming that the parameters are constant over the data sample that we are looking at."
"And, and this is based on the assumption of covariance stationary of our stochastic process and you know the underlying in covariance stationary is that the economic environment is constant."
And we all kind of know that that's not true.
I mean the economic environment changes over time.
"And, and the characteristics of assets change over time."
"So, so if we have five years of data, and we want to estimate the mean, well if we, the question is can we assume that the mean is constant over a five year period."
"If it is, then we can use all the data to estimate the mean, and so on."
"But if the mean is changing over time, then, you know, if we're estimating over a five year period, where the mean is, is actually increasing over time, then we're gonna make a pretty big mistake in assuming the mean is constant in, in how we estimate over a full sample."
Same thing with volatility and correlation.
"You know, volatility and correlation are changing over time then we should adapt the way we estimate the model to try and to take into consideration how these things are changing."
"And so In this context here, you know before we go out and estimate parameters, we would like to know, are they really constant over the sample or not."
"And so we will talk a little bit about how we can, we can try to determine this from the data."
Okay.
So these are the kinds of hypothesis we are going to look at.
"And I will go through each one of these and given an example of, of how to do a particular hypothesis test with, with data."
"""At the beginning"
"Okay, so stack."
"It operates just like those cafeteria trays that you know where you put in a tray, and the last one that got pushed in, when you take the first one out, that's the last one that got put in."
So these are called push and pop.
In a stack context both are constant time.
"So if you swap out the queue, you swap in the stack, make a couple other minor modifications, breadth-first search turns into depth-first search."
"For the sake of both variety and elegance, I'm, instead, gonna show you a recursive version."
"So depth first search is very naturally phrased as a recursive algorithm, and that's what we'll discuss here."
"So depth first search, of course, takes as input a graph G. And, again, it could be undirected or directed, it doesn't matter."
"Just, with the directed graph, be sure that you only follow arcs in the appropriate direction, which should be automatically handled in the adjacency"
lists of your graph data structure anyways.
"So, as always, we keep a boolean local to each vertex of the graph, remembering whether we've, st-, we've been there before or not."
"And of course as soon as we start exploring for S, we'd better make a note that, now we have been there."
"We better plant a flag, as it were."
"And remember, that first search is an aggressive search."
So we immediately try to recursively search from any of S's neighbors that we haven't already been to.
"And if we find such a vertex, if we find, somewhere we've never been, we recursively call depth first search, from that node."
The basic guarantees of depth-first search are exactly the same as they were for breadth-first search.
We find everything we could possibly hope to find and we do it in linear time.
And once again the reason is this is simply a special case of the generic search of procedure that we started this sequence of videos about.
It really just corresponds to a particular choice of when you have many crossing edges between the explored nodes and the unexplored nodes which one you explore next and basically you always bias towards the most recently encountered nodes.
"So it just corresponds to a particular way of choosing amongst multiple crossing edges between the region of explored nodes and the region of unexplored nodes, essentially always being biased toward the most recently discovered explored nodes."
"And just like breadth first search, the running time is going to be proportional to the size of the component that you're discovering."
"And the basic reason is that each node is looked at only once, right?"
"This Boolean makes sure that we don't ever explore a node more than once and then for each edge, we"
"look at it at most twice, one from each end point."
"And given that these exact same two claims hold for depth first search as for breadth first search, that means if we wanted to compute connected components in an undirected graph, we could equally well use an outer for loop with depth first search as our work horse in the inner"
loop.
It wouldn't matter.
"Either of those for undirected graphs, depth first search, breadth first search is gonna find all the connected components in O of M plus N time, in linear time."
"So, instead, I wanna look at an application particular to depth first search, and this is about finding a topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph."
So let me begin by telling you what a topological ordering of a directed graph is.
"Essentially, it's an ordering of the vertices of the graph so that all of the arcs, the directed edges of the graph, only go forward in the ordering."
"You could provide incentives, perhaps, to purchase healthy foods, so maybe food stamps would go further if you purchase healthy foods, so that would be playing with the relatively expensive prices of the healthier foods compared to less healthy ones."
"Again, you come up with this issue of how to define the two groups, but if you could define the two groups, economists might be a little more satisfied with still allowing consumer choice, but directing them towards something, rather than not allowing as much choice as is allowed now."
Another alternative might be simply to provide more nutrition education to food stamp recipients.
"Economists might like this one even more, because here the intervention is to make more information available, but you're still allowing the consumer to make their own decisions when all is said and done."
"So, different choices, no one has universal agreement that it would be a good choice or the best choice, but now, you can look at these and start to think hm."
"How would it change incentives, which ones are more heavy handed, which ones are a little more laissez faire and how can we get people to adopt this decisons to purchase healthier foods while being as close to laissez faire as possible, if you want to think like an economist."
"You've forced to think like an economist except for this course, but that's the economic logic behind things, getting people to make better decisions but being as laissez fair as possible."
Medicare.
Should medicare charge higher premiums to people of a less healthy weight.
"Here's another thing where it might seem like, we have an obvious answer."
Let's give people an economic incentive to control their weight.
"We can talk about this with medicare, we can talk about this with private players as well and certainly if you think about life insurance we are willing to do this for life insurance."
"If you are not healthy individual and you want to buy life insurance, you're going to pay a higher premium than somebody who is a 35 year old absolutely trim marathon runner."
Why are we willing to do this with life insurance but not health insurance?
"I don't have the answer to that, but you need to ponder that when we think about this."
"And even Finkelstein is an economist who might otherwise say, well, give people incentives to behave right, again starts to ask questions like, how far down this slope are we willing to go?"
Starvation!
So there is nothing new there.
But that is only according to your opinion.
"In our opinion, our new era will not bear any of those sufferings, none of this silly talk."
"We will witness a new found freedom, welfare and well-being in the upcoming era."
"I pray to Allah to strengthen those fighters in Tripoli, spare their blood, and grant His mercy upon the martyrs."
I pray to Allah to accept those who have fallen dead in all of the Libyan cities as martyrs.
God willing we will continue in our task of establishing contacts with others in the Libyan cities and will head on towards Tripoli to assist them whether in order to outnumber the opposite side or to donate blood.
"There are people marching, even from the far east of Libya, to assist our brothers and dear ones in the west, in Tripoli."
May Allah grant us the victory and May He help us getting over with this.
May Peace of Allah and His Blessings be upon you.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Ok.
We're going to practice administering intramuscular injections at this station.
"And for our intramuscular injection, of course we need our medication that's appropriate, and we would have needed the appropriate gauge and length needle, and the appropriate size syringe based on the amount of medication that we're going to draw up."
"Prior to administering our medications we should go and wash our hands, alright?"
Wash our hands and then we're going to prepare our medications.
I do recommend to charge devices like this with a computer because the computer psu can deliver cleaner power and charge the device more gently but you can use this somethimes.
"Travel adapter its called, guess thats what its intended for but otherwise I recommend charging it with a computer appilies to every mobile device, the battery will live longer nothing more inside the box and we get to the phone its self plastics protecting the phone got obviously the black version"
"looks very nice a few more little protective plastics wrapped around many small ones, that was not so with the s3 but thats probably because the s3 had no straigt edges, but curved ones and with the s4 they are straight, which makes holding the device much easier and more comfortable already fingerprints on the back"
"looks like a textured surface but it is slippy not as slippy as with the s3 feels a bit more grippy and less slippy thats positive on the bottom that looks like a speaker 13MP camera and the flash light samsung engraved on the side a volume rocker, chrome edges on the bottom microphone and micro usb plug on and off switch and lockscreen button and on top we have a 3.5mm jack for headphones, some more plastic, which I take off now and an IR-emitter that means that the device can work as a universal remote for all devices like tvs or recievers very usefull if you have multiple devices in your living room youa lways have the s4 with you, pull it out of you pocket and you can switch tv and reciever on and then you watch uefa chamionsleauge. important, dont miss it ;-) unlike with the s3 the little notch for opening the back is no more on top but on the side goes a bit more strong possibly because it has not been opened yet and here we have, just like with the s3 sim card slot, microsd slot and the place for the battery and beneath that the speaker which is covered by this grill on the back cover not a bright white interior like the s3 but you cant see it anyways and I guess thats it for the unboxing"
Thank you for watching

My name is Mike Weiner.
"I live in Medfield, MA with my wife Susan."
"We have two children,"
"Ben, who is 26, and Zachary, who is 23 and is our child with Special Needs."
"Our children, irrespective of the disability that may be effecting them,"
They all have some need for support.
And that need initially comes form their immediate families.
"In today's discussion, we'll focus on the psychological factors that impact entrepreneurial strategic decisions."
"Within our objectives, we will look first at the factors that influence decision making and motivation."
And we'll also spend some time talking about cognitive biases and heuristics that are common in entrepreneurship.
"To start the discussion, there's a question."
"Well, what do we mean by strategic?"
"And by that, we mean things that are not simple. that are dynamic."
That are complex that involves some necessary plans of action.
And also involves some level of uncertainty and are difficult to predict.
And this requires significant resources and thought and analysis.
And that the results of these decisions can be significant. so we're not necessarily talking about where you may go to dinner or what color clothing you may buy.
"But these are things that are substantial and that there are significant gains and loss of time, money, reputation, etc., that are consequences of the decision for the better or for the worse."
There are many traits that influence decision making among entrepreneurs.
"One is certainly a personal attributes and characteristics, and we'll discuss those."
"One is the attitudes towards the venture, towards the decision."
There's a risk propensity that we'll discuss as well.
There's an element of motivation.
"There are certainly emotions that are in play, and there's this cognitive element that we've discussed before regarding how you perceive and think about decisions."
"So, it's an illustration of what we mean by uncertainty and how you may perceive risk."
And we'll take a look at a simple example of given the choice of playing one of two games. the first game would be flipping a coin.
"legislative committees that are dealing with legislation as it goes through the House, they are open to the public; the select committees, they are also open to the public. When select committees are examining very important people, on a particular issue, it is open for the public to see."
It is as transparent as we can possibly make it.
"There may be other methods that we can use as time goes by, but we are constantly wanting to make certain that the people of this country, and internationally, know precisely what we are doing and our door is wide open to do so."
The Parliament is a public building and members of the public are free to come to Parliament to meet with their MP or a Peer to seek a resolution to a problem or attempt to influence.
"Charities, campaigning groups and commercial interests also seek to influence"
Parliamentarians by lobbying for their point of view.
Members of Parliament are elected to represent their local constituents.
I have over 70 thousand people that I am meant to look after.
But that does not mean that we have to agree with everything that our constituents tell us.
We have to make our own judgements.
"But of course, at the end of the day, a politician is elected to serve their local constituency, so of course they have to represent the views of the people who elected them otherwise they probably will not get re-elected."
"Sometimes, constituents hold very different points of view to me."
"I mean, I am a Labour MP and there are lots of voters who are Conservative in the constituency."
"I do not necessarily agree with them but to me it is very important that they understand, even though I may not share their viewpoint, that I still represent them."
And so it is very important to me that I go and see them and make the case why it is that I am not going to vote a certain way that they want me to vote.
Lobbying is something that is going on all the time.
It depends how you define lobbying.
"When I first entered Parliament in 1970, I would not say that lobbying was in its infancy because lobbying goes back to the 19th Century and before, but there was less organised lobbying."
"People would come to the central lobby of Parliament to lobby their Members of Parliament on individual issues, or on matters of social concern, or on general issues of taxation or whatever."
"But to say that there was no orchestrated lobbying at that stage would be to tell a downright lie, of course there was."
But it was much less sophisticated and much less organised than it is now.
There are now dozens of companies that depend upon lobbying for their very existence.
"There are all sorts of pressure groups and interest groups that employ professional lobbyists to work on their behalf and to seek to capture the attention first, and the support second, of Members of Parliament and Members of the House of Lords."
There is lobbying going on all the time and on almost every subject.
"Now this is fine, up to a point."
"We do have very strict rules of course about not being involved with any group where we are getting paid, or where we are getting some privileges and then trying to push that cause in Parliament, because obviously"
I think that would be seen to be corrupt and quite wrong.
"We have a book called the Register of Members Interests where every Member of Parliament must put down the people who either support them financially, or if they have got another job, to put down very clearly what that job is and how many hours they spend on that job and how much money they are paid."
"Parliaments history brings great prestige but there is constant pressure, both internal and external, to adapt and develop to changing circumstances."
"This can be to consider both major and minor changes, such as extending voting rights, or an amendment to Parliamentary procedure."
"While this pressure does not lead to a constant state of flux, the way Parliament is composed and functions is a continual work in progress."
Reform can be a slow but crucial aspect of the work of Parliament.
"And, at the same time, water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen, doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert."
So the question is:
How are we all going to respond to this?
"And we can do all sorts of things to fix it, but in the final analysis, the thing we really need to fix is ourselves."
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution; it's not about the climate change.
It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today.
So the question is:
Will we respond to this or not?
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Learning Laying-on of Hands Day 2 - The energies
"Continuing the course ""learning laying-on of hands"", today we'll talk about energy, the energy that exists in the universe and also the energy created by us, human beings."
"The primary energy is called immanent, which is the energy that permeates the universe and that is not codified by any intelligent consciousness."
"Then, for example, the energy of plants, is an energy that has no emotional encoding, that means, the emotional processes didn't affect the energetic composition, that's why it's so good for us be near of trees, be in woods, even where there are waterfalls, with plenty of wind."
"This kind of energy is a primary energy, or immanent energy that wasn't codified by anyone."
"This energy is what we should get through our chakras, for our vitalization, for our happiness, to maintain a material of good quality in our body."
"But actually, what happens is that when you live in big cities like São Paulo or any other city, any other capital where many people live, the production of energies that are exteriorized by people end up ""contaminating"", a term that is not very good, but ""contaminating"" the environment, witch results on emotional processes of such people, staying in the air, like an energetic cloud."
"So imagine, in one of these days, you go to the subway:"
"I think it's not much easy to find everyone happy in the subway, singing, happy, carefree."
"They go there with concerns, one is delayed, another one is looking for a job, another one is upset about something that happened."
"This all generates lagged energies, uncompensated and we'll be immersed in this energy."
"That's why when some people are in the middle of crowds, excited or not, the crowd don't need to be euphoric, but maybe a certain energy composite, we end up getting not so well."
"So, if you go to a place, for example, a psychiatric hospital, no one needs to be euphoric, but people emanate and exteriorize energies that are pathological, these are energies with dysfunctional contexts, disorganized, more dense, heavier."
"As result, we end up suffering due to the immersion in these energies. in the other way, if you go to a place where the energy is very subtle and it has not been modified by emotions, when I say emotion, I'm talking about everything, maybe emotion of anger, can be emotion of jealousy, maybe emotion of envy,"
"It can be the emotion of euphoria, which is just like anger."
That's good for you to know.
"If you are in a football stadium and everyone is screaming, jumping, yelling, the energy emanated by these people is the same energy that you will produce, for example, in a moment of anger, rage or even during sexual activity."
These are energies produced in the lower frequencies of our chakras.
"You may think so, ""but it's different, I feel better!"""
"When we are in a place of celebration, commemoration, we get euphoric, we don't get better."
It's the same euphoria you feel when you take a drug.
"But also in terms of the interface, in terms of the visual search that people are going to do."
So Gmail's actually a really good example of this.
"Let's look at your average Gmail inbox where the first thing, right off the bat, the first branch point is read versus unread."
"Now in this case, all the unread messages are grouped together, but even if they were kind of scattered, you can easily visually select on how dark it is, and just immediately at a glance, just kind of parsing it, you immediately know which ones are read versus unread, versus some little tiny glyph that was indicating it."
"So that's the first branch point, which is a good one, because it's one of the branch points that people often want to branch on, knowing if they're looking for something new that they thought might have come in versus something they know hasn't come in."
"The next branch point in the visual hierarchy is author versus message, and this is achieved not through contrast but through spacing."
"So because you have a lot of space here, it's really easy to look at the Author field versus the Message field, have another branch point there."
"Then the final branch point is the subject versus the body of the message, and here this is less obvious because it's less important, because we want to build that hierarchy."
"But you can also quickly differentiate the subject line versus the body, because of that visual difference in the hierarchy."
So here it's just spacing and contrast are being used to
literally create this tree in terms of the order in which you're going to be able to scan stuff and how easy you're going to be able to scan things.
"So if you know you're looking for an unread message from a particular person, you have two hops, and you can get to it really fast."
So that applies to the messages coming in.
"Also in terms of the interface itself, you have visual hierarchy."
"It's reasonably obvious looking at this what the most common control is, but just dropping the color and the contrast a little bit, let's overlay some user metrics."
"I should note, these are entirely fictional."
"I just made them up, but you can imagine user metrics look something like this."
"Where you see more common controls, like Compose, being interacted with a lot, and also their placement reflecting that."
"Then least common things, like More Labels, rarely being interacted with."
"And this type of user metric, you can almost sort of see it when it's not there, in terms of the spacing and the order, and the visual dominance of various controls."
"On mobile as well, you want to have in primary Ul, the controls that people are interacting with a lot, then in secondary Ul, the controls that they might occasionally interact with."
"So you can just pretty quickly look at the user metrics and create the visual hierarchy, but it's not just that."
"Also, from the visual hierarchy you create, you can actually kind of create the user metrics, because people are going to use stuff more if they find it."
"So it's really kind of circular, where you're both designing it and influencing them in their usage, and then their usage is influencing you as a designer in terms of how you want to expose stuff."
"So it's not purely like you could just have an algorithm that's just going to feed the data in and stuff gets bigger, because you can actually influence the data itself."
"So diving into a couple other things, Fitt's law."
"Basically, this is solving for time, given target size and distance."
It's pretty straightforward.
"You have your target time, you have your distance, device speed is like mouse speed, or if it's a touch interface,"
literally the speed of the person's arm.
Device lag is if there's any number of milliseconds to actually process the event.
"Based off of this, you can find out that larger things that are closer, you can click on faster, which is pretty obvious."
"You quote Mersinach, and she uses all caps to say"
"'HEAVY USE OF THE INTERNET HAS NERUORLOGlCAL CONSEQUENCES' and geez that sounds scary, but then you think about it and you say"
'well what's the neurological consequences?'
It's that you know stuff.
(Laughter)
And maybe that the neurological consequences that's not so bad.
And it seems that's what you're pointing out is that you're always being changed and we should think about which of the changes are positive and negative and how we're going to arrange it to push us in the right direction.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
I mean I completely agree with that.
"And the more we can push the technology and the way we can use it in the direction to encourage attentiveness, I am all in favor of."
I think there are differences.
I think it is absolutely true that all our experiences influence our brain.
"I mean at the very base line, we have to store memories or we lose memories or whatever."
But what I think neuroscientists have found is that when there are certain types of experiences that have particularly deep affects on a brain and those that are particularly highly
Repetitive are intensive and kind of involve a lot of stimuli and a lot of physical activity and mental activity and it's precisely what we do when we're sitting at our computers.
"We're constantly repeating physical actions, clicking or scrolling or you know using the touch screen on our iPod or iPad or whatever and we are constantly getting signals and alerts and messages that we respond to in particular ways."
So it's a very intensive way of training our minds in a particular way of thinking.
"I think what is happening is we are reinforcing those mental functions and even down to those mental circuits that make us good and skimming and scanning and there has been certainly studies that show our visual acuity and improves that as we use video games but there is no encouragement, there is no reward for the more attentive mode of thoughts, for contemplation, for reflection, for introspection, for deep reading and neuroscientologists tell us that when we don't practice different ways of thinking we lose those, even down to the point that the circuits begin to weaken in our brain, if not eventually dissolve."
PETER NORVlG:
So I agree with you that there is a temptation that you could easily spend your whole life playing farmville or looking at the pictures of kittens and never get anything useful done.
But that is your choice and you also have the option of doing this deep reading and I don't see how deep reading is in any way cut out by being online and if anything it's easier to get an entree.
One way to think about it is in game theory.
There's this notion of a multi-armed bandit.
"Now in Las Vegas of course we have the one-armed bandit; you go and you put your money in the slot, you pull it you either get a reward or you don't."
"In game theory multi-armed bandits means there is many slot machines and unlike Vegas some of them pay off positive results, rather than negative, and your task then is to decide is which slot am I going to put the money in."
"And so there's these two phases; exploration phase, when we say which slot machine is the good one and then the exploitation stage, when I say, you know, I found one that's pretty good."
I'm going to stick with this.
And I think that the trade-off of between those two which we always have according to the percepts of game theory is different on the web than it is in the library.
"You go to the library, you go to the shelf, there's four books on that shelf."
"It's pretty easy to say, you know what, this is the right book, I'm going to exploit that book and read it deeply."
"On the web, you go to the shelf, there's 40,000 results, you've got to spend more time in the exploration stage and then, after you've done more exploration now you say, now I'm going to start reading deeply."
So I think there's a shift and when that happens but i don't see any reason why the deep reading is recluded.
"However, I do know that patients suffer from infections that could be avoided, Medications are given to the wrong patients, and sometimes, surgical devices and instruments are forgotten in the body after a procedure."
This session is about quality.
There are two dimensions of quality.
There is performance quality which measures to what extent the product or services we're providing is meeting customer expectations.
Then there is conformance quality.
Conformance quality measures whether the process is carried out the way that we intend it to be carried out.
Our module focuses on conformance quality.
"When we deal with conformance quality, we will notice that variability, once again, is the root cause for all evil."
Just think about it.
"Without variability, we would either do everything right every time, and there would never be a defect or we would do things wrong all the time,"
"And then chances are, we would get out of business very quickly."
"In this first session, we'll introduce some basic probability tools to think about with what likelihood we're going to make a defect in the process."
Consider an assembly line that puts together laptop computers.
"The assembly line consists of nine stations, and let's say for sake of argument that each of these stations has a probability of one percent of producing a defect."
Let me introduce some rotation.
"Let's take this resource here, which is number six in the process."
We say that the yield of that resource is a percentage of units that this resource produces according to specification.
"In this case, this is simply one minus the probability of our defect, which is 99%."
"Moreover, we define the yield of the process, as a percentage of parts that are produced at the end of the process, according to specification."
"The yield of the process, of course, depends on the individual years and defect probabilities of the resources that make up for the process."
"In our case here, since we have a linear process slow diagram and a computer that comes out at the end has to be produced correctly at every one of the nine steps."
The year that separates a product of the individually yields.
"In other words,"
"It says one minus, or defect probability of one%, raised to the power of nine, which is about 91%., You notice here the power of the exponen, if I take just for the sake of illustration, if I take even the 99% probability of doing something correct and I have many, many steps, Say for the sake of argument, I have 50 steps in the process, my probability of producing something correct at the end of the process, my process yield, is about 60%."
That's even small defect probabilities in assembly lines or in processes with any operations can accumulate a lot of problems at the end.
"So those are the ideas of yield, process yield, and defect probabilities."
Not all processes require that every step is carried out according to specification.
Some processes have built-in redundancy and so they can afford that their step in the process is carried out with a defect and still the overall quality of the output is not affected.
Let me illustrate this concept of redundancy with the classic case study of the Duke Transplant Center.
This is the rather sad story of seventeen year old girl Jessica Santillan.
Jessica died following a heart-lung transplant in the Duke Transplant Center.
The reason for that was that there was a mismatch between Jessica's blood type and the blood type of the organ donor.
Let me actually draw that again.
"So that $7 investment is here, $7 capital, $7 from the Treasury."
"You have $86 from the Fed, and they use this to give the cash here, and then that goes back here, and you're holding toxic asset A."
"Now if toxic asset A ends up being worth a lot of money, then this is worth a lot, and this is worth nothing, And that's OK, because the hedge fund essentially paid nothing for it or paid next to nothing for it, in which case, everyone kind of works out well in that scenario."
"On the other hand, let's say that this thing is worth zero."
Let's say that this thing defaults.
"If that thing defaults, then this investment is worth zero."
But guess what?
"The hedge fund had an insurance policy, where this guy was a counterparty."
"So he says, hey, this thing here defaulted."
"I'm going to claim my insurance policy, so this guy's going to have to send him $7."
"So it's economically the exact same thing that I outlined in the Geithner Two video, but in this situation, these guys, it's almost an arms-length transaction."
"But this bank can make that behavior happen by essentially going into the market and selling credit default swaps for this exact asset for really, really cheap."
And this is just the first way I thought about it.
There's other ways you could do it.
"If you're just a separate hedge fund and you own enough of the shares in a bank, let's say you owned all of the shares of the bank or a good percentage of the shares of the bank, then you would also have an incentive to go out there and use the Geithner Plan and lever up and buy these assets."
"Another thing is-- I don't want to get too technical --if you kind of hold one of the fulcrum pieces of debt, the pieces of debt that are trading at a discount, because you're afraid that this bank is going to fail, if you hold a bunch of those assets, you still would want to participate in the Geithner Plan and funnel money and use the Government money to essentially buy this asset A."
"I mean, the general theme here is, if you have two people, if this is the private world and you have a scenario where person A, if a transaction can make $100 or he gets rid of $100 exposure, and person B essentially has a potential"
"loss of minus $7 of exposure, there's a net transfer of wealth here."
You went from $100 of exposure to $7 exposure for this guy.
"So someone is offloading the $93 of exposure to this stuff, and that's the Government."
The Government's only taking the down side.
"So this is a huge subsidy of exposure, and it depends what these are really worth, if this thing is really worth $30 and it's a $63 exposure, but any time you have this, the private sector is going to figure out a way to make this subsidy happen."
"And everything I've outlined so far is if A is the bank that has 100% exposure, all they have to do is, through whatever back-door scheme or financial product or insurance or whatever they want to do, or loans that have very little stipulations on it, they just have to give this guy essentially $7 of compensation somehow that gets around the"
"Government rules, and then this transaction will occur."
"And I hope it doesn't occur, and it's very possible it won't, because maybe I'm missing something here, but"
"I'm just saying that everything I understand about the Geithner Plan is that there's a huge incentive for this to occur, and this is frankly the only reason why the plan would work."
"Because, as I outlined in the other videos, for a private investor who's not incentivized in this way, the put option that the Government is giving them still is not enough of a rationale to go from paying $30 for an asset to going to pay $60 an asset."
So it won't work if this behavior doesn't occur.
The only way that the plan quote unquote will work and people will overpay for the assets is if you have this type of action going on.
A viewer of One Minute Medical School asks:
"""Dr. Rob, what is 'herd immunity?'"""
Dan has to outrun the existing proof of work chain.
"That means he has to solve not just typically one proof of work puzzle, but may need to solve several proof of work puzzles to create another chain that he hopes will be longer than the chain that's out there."
"If he can get the longest chain and he can get people to start using that chain instead,.. and that's the chain he might want people to use because it contains this fake transaction, but it removes the previous transaction where he gave money to Pete."
To solve a proof of work Dan has to take whatever computing power he has access to and he has to start working on solving the proof of work puzzle.
There are no known shortcuts for solving these puzzles.
"If you recall from any of the proof of work videos, to succeed in a proof of work is kind of like winning a lottery."
"There are ways to do it, but it depends of how much computing power you have."
"The more computing power you have access to, the more lottery tickets you have."
"If somebody has even one lottery ticket, they do have the chance to win the lottery, but they are far less likely to succeed compared to somebody ho has a lot of lottery tickets in hand."
"Even if you succeed once in winning the lottery with the small numer of tickets, the likelihood of repeating that feat over and over again, several times in a row becomes much smaller."
That's exactly what Dan has to do.
He has to win this lottery multiple times until he has a bigger chain.
The key thing you have to look for is how much computing power Dan has versus how much computing power all the honest nodes in the system have together.
If it's the case that all the honest nodes...
"Let's say we call this ""the honest computing power""."
"When I say ""honest computing power"" I mean the total computing power for all the bitcoin mining nodes who are honest in a network."
"If that total computing power that they have access to is greater than the power that Dan has access to, so Dan's computing power, the Bitcoin system will be safe because it will be hard for Dan to be able to create this fraudulent transaction chain, because he won't be able to outrun the honest people."
The honest people win the lottery more frequently and will create the longer chain and Dan's attempt is gonna be very much an uphill battle.
"It is still possible that Dan could have access to a lot of computing power, maybe he is very wealthy or he has a lot of resources, but he'll really need a lot to be able to do that."
More than everyone else who is legitimate combined.
"That's one aspect of why the transaction block chain is secure, because it's unlikely for anyone individual to have access to just that much computing power."
Here I should point out that there is also another aspect to the security of Bitcoin.
"If Dan has access to that kind of computing power to solve these proof of work puzzles, rather than trying to fight this uphill battle of forking the transaction block chain and creating fake transaction and so on,"
"Dan is probably much better off, just using that computing power he has for legitimate bitcoin mining himself."
"You might remember that bitcoin miners, who solve proof of work puzzles get both a reward..."
For succeeding they get some numer of bitcoins. ...and they also get a transaction fee for all the transactions in the block that they validated.
"So, there is this economic incentive for Dan to behave honestly."
"Maybe I should just recap in closing the video that the security of bitcoin transactions comes from, first of all, this mathematical barrier that makes it hard for Dan to fork the transaction block chain in a dishonest way, as well as an economic incentive for Dan to just act honestly and mine bitcoins for himself."
"[cheering, applause]"
Ok
Very excited
"Our first guest is a wife, a mother, a lawyer and quite possibly the most powerful woman in the world."
"United States, sought to examine more closely just how prevalent this condition is in the US."
"This study looked at data from the NHAN study, that's the National Health and Nutrition examination survey, it's supposed to represent the US population."
"And it's a very in-depth questionnaire, an interview process that researchers do from people all over the country."
"In this particular study, the researchers looked at and tested for serum samples for celiac disease antibodies."
"They tested almost 8,000 people aged 6 and over, and in all those people that they tested, they found 35 cases of celiac disease."
"And what's interesting, is that of those 35, 29 of those people did not know previously that they had the condition."
"And so, after doing the statistical analyses, the surveyors and the researchers found that the prevalence rate among non-Hispanic whites is 1.01%."
"You have a greater percentage, or greater likelihood, of having Celiac disease if you are Caucasian."
"Among all the US population, it was shown to be about 0.71% of the people had Celiac disease, that's roughly 1 in 141 which is similar to that of Europe."
"Another interesting secondary finding from this study,was that 55 people were identified as following a gluten-free diet, that corresponds to about 0.63% prevalence."
"But interestingly enough, most of those people who were following a gluten-free diet, didn't have celiac disease."
We'll talk about that in a moment.
What are the symptoms of celiac disease?
"Well, they're very, very variable."
"Some people, at just a crumb of wheat bread, can set off a whole chain of reactions and have a lot of symptoms, whereas other people can be entirely asymptomatic."
"Yet every time they're consuming gluten, they're damaging their intestinal villi."
"Some of the most commonly reported symptoms though, include things like, general irritable bowel, constipation, diarrhea, itchy skin, infertility."
"Again, many people may be asymptomatic."
"It's thought that the average time, between onset of symptoms, and diagnosis of celiac disease in the US, is 10 years."
"People often times don't know what's going on, they think they might be allergic to something, maybe I'm just a picky-eater, maybe I have a stomach flu."
"It takes a really long time for most people to pin point, and to get the diagnosis of celiac disease, but once they do, they adopt the gluten-free diet and their intestine actually starts to heal itself."
Up to 97% of Celiac disease might be undiagnosed.
"The gold standard for diagnosing Celiac disease, is to do a biopsy of the small intestines, but that is most always preceded by a number of blood tests that look for Celiac disease antibodies."
"If you suspect that you have celiac disease, one thing that you're advised not to do, is to adopt a gluten free diet, and then get tested."
"If you start following a gluten-free diet, your body is not going to produce the antibodies that would normally show up in response to the presence of glutens."
"And as such, when your blood tests come back, they will reveal a false negative."
"So you should continue to eat gluten containing foods, even if they hurt your stomach, for just the period of time leading up to the test, so that you can get the appropriate results and diagnosis, if that indeed is your situation."
"For individuals who have untreated Celiac disease, there's a number of micronutrient affects from this condition."
"We're concerned about the iron, calcium and folate levels of people with Celiac disease."
"Many people additionally, because of the intestinal damage, will also have lactose intolerance, whereby they lack that enzyme lactase to break down the milk sugar in milk containing foods."
"They may also be deficient in fat soluble vitamins, and because vitamin B12 is absorbed in the proximal intestine, there's some concern that they would maybe need to supplement with that as well."
Vitamin B-12 is found only in foods of animal origin.
Here's one.
Here is one.
And you even with a little bit of imagination can see that they are really not straight lines but they are hyperbolas.
"If you're very close to one tapper, the zero can never be exactly zero, because the amplitude of the wave from this one then will always be larger than the amplitude from that one, because as you go away from the source the amplitude must fall off on a two-dimensional surface as 1 / the square root of R."
In a three-dimensional wave must fall of as 1 / R.
"But if you're far enough away then the distance is approximately the same and so the amplitudes of the individual waves are very closely the same and you can then, like you see here, the water is absolutely standing still."
"And here are then the areas whereby you see traveling waves, they are traveling waves, they're not standing waves, that here you see if you were sitting here in space the water would be up and down, bobbing up and down, and the amplitude that you would have is twice the amplitude that you get from one, because the mountains add to the mountains and the valleys add to the valleys."
But if you were here in space you would be sitting still.
You would not be bobbing up and down at all.
And that is very characteristic for waves.
"If I were to tap them 180 degrees out of phase, which I didn't -- they were in phase -- then all nodal lines would become maxima and all maximum lines would become nodes, that goes without saying of course."
"It is essential that you -- that the frequencies are the same, that is an absolute must."
"They don't have to be in phase, the two tappers, if they're not in phase then the positions in space where you have maxima and minima will change but a must is that the frequency is the same."
Now I was hiking last year in
Utah when I noticed a butterfly in the water of a pond which was fighting for its life.
And you see that butterfly here.
"Tom, perhaps you can turn off that overhead."
"You see the butterfly here, and you see here projected on the bottom the beautiful rings dark and bright, because these rings on the water act like lenses, and what you see very dramatically is indeed what I said, that the amplitude of the wave must go down with distance, because energy must be conserved of course in the wave, and since the circumference grows linearly with R, the amplitude must go down as 1 / the square root of R because the energy in the wave is proportional to the amplitude squared."
"So when I saw this it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to catch another butterfly, put it next to it, and then photograph -- make a fantastic photograph of an interference pattern."
"But I realized of course immediately, having taken 8.02, that the frequencies of the two butterflies would have to be exactly the same and so I gave up the idea and I decided not to be cruel."
So no other butterfly was sacrificed.
"If we look at the directions where we expect the maxima as seen from the location of the sources, then I want to remind you of what a hyperbola looks like."
"If here are these two sources and here is the center, I can draw a line here, then a hyperbola would look like this."
"Let me re- remove the part on the left, doesn't look too good, but it's the same on the left of course."
"And what you remember from your high school math, that it approaches that line."
"And therefore you can define angle theta as seen from the center between these two, which are the directions where you have maxima and where you have minima."
And that's what I am going to work out for you now on this blackboard here.
"So here are now the two sources that oscillate, there's one here and there's one here and here is the center in between them, and let this separation be D. And I am looking very far away so that I'm approaching this line where the hyperbolas merge, so to speak, with the straight line."
"And so I look very far away without being -- committing myself how far, I'm looking in the direction theta away."
This is theta.
And so this is theta.
"And I want to know in which directions of theta I expect to see maxima, and in which direction I expect to see minima."
We call it moving on.
We call it just growth out of that sort-of dark part of the heart.
Things change.
"But when you fight those emotions, when you think they shouldn't be there, when you're not kind to them, when you try and get involved with it, you always mess up."
"So this is actually using this Law of Kamma, these things are because of the past, what am I doing about it now?"
And that way you can actually take these negative emotions and they start to disappear.
They don't last all that long.
"There's a story - a wonderful story - in my book and the reason I mentioned it this afternoon at the funeral, the reason I mentioned it because I got a letter from United States"
"last week and somebody had listened to the talks on the internet, they read my book ""Opening the Door of Your Heart"", and there's a story in there about the emperor's ring, ""this too will pass"", that story, if you haven't heard it before, it's a powerful story, about an emperor, a young man who took over the kingdom when he wasn't really mature enough to know how to lead."
And so whenever things were going well in his kingdom he'd always have celebrations and parties.
"And because he was spending too much resources and too much time celebrating, and not actually doing the running of the kingdom, the good times never lasted all that"
long.
"And when the terrible times, the bad times, bad economy, unrest, social disorder, whenever there was trouble in his kingdom he'd get so upset and depressed he'd stay in his room and sulk and cry, which meant he wasn't working during the difficult times."
"And the ministers they realised that their leader, their king, their emperor, wasn't really working properly, and that's the reason why there were too many bad times and not enough prosperous times."
You can't just tell these people what to do.
"Even these ministers in the Howard Government, they can't tell John Howard what to do."
"They've got to be sneaky, they've got to be wise, and so what these ministers did, instead of telling their emperor what to do, they just went to a goldsmith, asked for him to make a ring, the only difference between that ring and ordinary rings was what was engraved on the outside, which was the words ""this too will pass""."
"And they gave that ring with the engraved words ""this too will pass"" to the emperor, told him to wear it on all occasions, that's all, and the emperor did."
"Whenever there were bad times he would look upon the ring, ""this too will pass"", he knew by nature he didn't have to force those negative emotions and those bad times out of his kingdom, he knew they would pass naturally."
"And because he knew the bad times would pass, it gave him what's called hope, and when there's hope we can work, where it's hopeless we think the grief is going to last forever, the broken heart was always going to be there, you'll never find another partner ever in life."
"Or you'll never find that money again on the stock market, or whatever it is your chance to win the cup is gone forever."
When you think it's forever that just makes life hopeless and you don't work.
You don't make kamma anymore.
"But when actually you have hope, there's always something you can do."
It gives you that motivation to work even in difficult times of your life.
"And actually the reason I'm saying this was because the photograph someone sent me was actually from the graduation ceremony of Virginia Tech university, recently, and I think you all know what happened at Virginia Tech in April, I was in London at that time."
I think it was 39 young men and women were shot down by that murderer?
"You know, while they were on campus."
"And at the graduation ceremony one of the graduates, you know the funny hats they wear, they're called mortarboards, with the flat top, on the top of his mortarboard he'd actually painted the words ""this too will pass"", in memoriam of the pain that had happened in that university in the biggest serial killer murder in United States history."
"That's why he said ""I don't know whether this guy's read your book or what"", by he's obviously got the message."
"And it is a powerful message because it gives you hope, it allows you to"
let these things pass away.
"So sometimes a lecture in the university is not the best way to do that, have one person sitting in front of the class, you want something a little more interactive and I think we've seen that."
There's developments like Sollen Conn with Conn Academy.
It's fifteen hundred educational videos online and it gets twice as many students online as the
University of California as a single person.
There is great opportunities out here and I think we are a point to where there is a disruptive shift in how we are going to deliver education and it will be interesting to see how it plays out.
And I think there was a question for Nick in there as well.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"Yeah, I think you're absolutely right to point out the fact that any new technology has costs as well as benefits and when we did begin to parcel out time in little increments, we became more synchronized as a society."
"We were able to work together better, but we did lose some of our sense of a natural flow of time and we could live by that flow rather than by the clock, and similar with the map."
"I mean we almost certainly as we become more dependent on the map we lose some of our natural navagation sense and that almost is certainly being amplified by GPSs and stuff like that and that's not to say that those technologies are bad, but the benefits don't far out weigh the costs, but we do have to realized that whenever we adopt a technology we're adopting, we're amplifying some part of ourselves, but we're also reducing some of our old skills and handing them over to technology."
And so any technology has to be evaluated in that way I think.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay let's go over here and keep it to one brief question each.
MAN 4:
"Nick it seems like your book is focused very much on the personal choices and the personal affects, but I'm curious about the societal effects."
"So, when you we have 1.6 Billion people on the internet all behaving in this way, what is going to be the effect on human civilizations as a whole?"
"I mean Peter mentioned great companies are still being born and great books are still being written, but what do you see has the broader effects?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
That's a big question.
"You know, I think there is going to be a lot of effects and some of them honestly, particularly with the social sphere are very hard to figure out and I can't say that I've figured them out."
"I will say that if you look through the history of culture you see that many of the great monuments of culture come from people, whether we're talking about science, art, literature, come from people who were able to think attentively and think deeply and be contemplative, be meditative and be reflective, and if we devalue those things and practice those things less,"
"I think we not only become less interesting as individuals, we face a culture that is flatter and not as vibrant and again not has interesting as it used to be."
PETER NORVlG:
So I want to take my perogative to throw in my answer as well.
"And I want to quote Stuart Russell, who is the chairman at Berkley, he was one of my respondants and he said that 'students today are like prolog programs with ninety-nine percent of their clauses missing', for students in the past were like that."
Now what does that mean for you non-programmers out there?
"So prolog program is a means for doing logical inference by describing what you know and allowing the program to do very deep inference of combining all those clauses, and what Stuart was saying was in the past, his students could do that but only on one percent of their subject matters, they knew very deeply about one thing and they could reason deeply in that area, and usually get a thesis out of it."
"Now, he's saying that things have changed, that you can start and not know very much in that area and very quickly gather what you need to know and then start doing the deep thinking."
"That ability to do the deep thinking was always in the student, but if you didn't have information about the are, you couldn't go anywhere with it."
"So he said, 'Google encourages mental energy, persistence, and diligence, as well as learning about knew things.'"
MAN 5:
"My name is Peter Cilla, I'll try to be brief."
There are many freely available worksheets on the internet to help you calculate your net worth.
"In this week's reading list, you will find a link to the example shown here."
"Here, I recommend you download this worksheet or a similar one and begin piecing together your financial picture."
It's an important first step for taking stock of and taking control of your financial life.
"When calculating your net worth, it's best to use year-end figures, or end of year figures also called, or at"
least the single date's values for anything.
"If this seems too hard, try to get as close as to a single date as you possibly can."
"In reading a net worth statement, you should be able to use total and absolute value of the asset, even if the asset is being pledged or collateralized for a loan."
"For example, if your home is with $100,000."
"If the balance of your mortgage is $50,000, you would"
"list 100,000 in the asset column and then $50,000 in the liabilities column."
"Now, a cash flow statement tells you how much money you earn or just how much money you spend."
If you take today's net worth statement and compare it to the one from
"last year or next year, you should begin to get a picture of your cash flow."
"Examples of income are employment pay, whether it's hourly or, or salaried, rent from investment properties, interest in dividends from investments pension payments you may be receiving, as well as any sort of public or private benefits you're getting, like Social Security, unemployment, disability, and so on."
"Naturally, your expenses include things like your rent or mortgage , debt payments, taxes, utility bills, food, medication fees for service and anything else that costs you money."
"Examples can be broken down into three categories, such as fixed or variable."
"Likewise, some of your spending maybe required and some maybe discretionary."
"Discretionary means, things that you really don't need, but most of us spend money on anyway and we all have expenses that are at one time only, as well as ongoing expenses."
"When you're creating your cash flow statement, it's important to include everything."
"You don't want to leave out any income, but you also want to honestly account for everything you're really spending money on. don't forget to tally up expenses that occur less frequently, such as maybe property taxes that are split into maybe two payments every year or that occasional trip to the dry cleaner, birthday gifts throughout the year."
"It's pretty common to overlook these kinds of expenses, but as we all know, they add up quickly."
"If you truly have fewer expenses than income, good for you."
That means you have a surplus of money every month or even every year.
"If you feel like you don't have a surplus, then it's quite possible that you're not properly accounting for every expense."
"If you are running a deficit, then it is very likely that your debts are increasing."
Positive cash flow will generally lead to year over year positive increasingly positive network conversely negative cash flow will generally lead to year over year increasingly negative network.
"Now, the question you need to ask yourself is, are you prepared for an unforeseen emergency expense?"
"An emergency can be something immediate, like your car breaking down or your house needing repair or even something as unfortunate as a job loss."
An emergency fund is any money you can access quickly.
"You will commonly hear that you should have three to six months of expenses in an emergency fund, however, everyone's situation is different."
"Someone who has a very steady job with a high job security may be fine with only three months of expenses i n their emergency fund, however, someone with a more volatile job situation. for example, a commission-only salesperson or a small business owner may need to have six months or more in emergency funds."
"So, basically you kind of have a spine of head chains, and then everywhere you have something coming off that, that's a dependent."
"So we have a dependency from walked to Sue, and a dependency from walked into, this is another head chain, and then we've got another dependency from into store, head chain, and dependency, store the."
"So, we have the basis for a dependency representation inside a phrase structured tree if and only if, we have heads represented."
What about if we go in the opposite direction?
"If you try and go from dependencies to phrase structure, you can reconstruct a phrase structure tree by taking the closure of the dependencies of a word, and saying that those represent a constituent."
But it slightly changes the representation from what we normally see in phrase structure trees.
"In particular, in a situation like this, you can't have a VP node."
"Because actually, both"
"Sue and into are dependents of walked, and therefore all three of those must have a flat phrase structure representation, where you have the three, the head and its two dependents Sue and into."
How do people go about doing dependency parsing?
A whole variety of methods have been used for dependency parsing.
One method to do it is with a dynamic programming algorithm like the CKY algorithm that we saw for phrase structure parsing.
"Now if you do this naively by adding in heads, you end up with something similar to the lexicalized probabilistic context free grammars we saw earlier, and end up with a big O n to the fifth algorithm."
But there's a clever reformulation of what the parse items are due to Jason Eisner in 1996 which makes the complexity of doing dependency parsing also N cubed.
"Which is kind of what you'd hope it to be, just thinking about the nature of the operation."
But there are a whole bunch of other methods.
So people have directly used graph algorithms to do dependency parsing.
"So, one idea from the algorithm's literature is that you can construct a maximum spanning tree for a sentence."
"Because, since you want all words connected together, to be the dependent of something, that means you have to build a tree that spans all the words in the sentence."
And that's the idea that's used in the well known MST parser.
There are other ideas of constraint satisfaction where you start off with a dense set of edges between all words and then eliminate ones that don't satisfy hard constraints.
"But a final trained independency parsing and actually what we're going to focus on here, is a way of doing dependency parsing where you head left to right through the sentence and make greedy decisions based on machine learning classifiers as to which words to connect to other words as dependents."
And so the most well known example of this framework is
"MaltParser, and I'm going to concentrate on this just partly because it's very different from what we did for our approach to phrase structure parsing we looked at in depth, but also because it's been shown that this kind of method of doing dependency parsing actually works extremely well."
"It can work accurately, and exceedingly quickly."
So it's just a good thing to know about as a different point in the space.
"No matter how we do dependency parsing we need some sources of information to let us choose between possible analyses and which words to take as dependents of, of other words."
So here's a list of the main sources of information people use.
"So, the most obvious source of information is bilexical dependencies."
So if we have something like a dependency between issues and the.
"Well we can look at the word that's the head and look at the word of the, that's the dependent and say is that"
likely.
There are cardiovascular side effects.
They're very anticholinerigic drugs; they're very sedating; we see a lot of weight gain.
"The cardiovascular side effects are important, because these drugs are actually fatal in overdose."
"So, again, when we were using these as our sole option for the treatment of depression, we had to be very cautious with the quantity of pills we were giving patients, because of the toxicity of overdose."
"They're not any - it's not that they're any worse of a drug than the newer agents, or the newer agents are any better, it's just that the newer agents are better tolerated than the tricyclic antidepressants, but these are very effective drugs."
"Another option that we have for the treatment of depression, and again, these aren't your standard options for the treatment of depression, is the monoamine oxidase inhibitors."
"Again, these are very effective agents, often not used as first line, very often used in the refractory set of patient."
"Phenelzine is the primary agent we use, and these basically work by irreversible inhibition, that's the key component: irreversible, of monoamine oxidase a and b, resulting in increased levels of the neurotransmitters."
"So basically, monoamine oxidase is an enzyme in the brain that destroys serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine."
"So we inhibit this enzyme, so it can no longer destroy the neurotransmitters that we need increased."
"So, the reason we don't use these agents anymore as a first line, is because of some of the risks."
"In combination with other agents, we're at risk for a hypertensive crisis."
So we need to be very careful with some of the drug interactions that are there.
"There's also some food-drug interactions that occur with Tyramine, because Tyramine is a precursor to these neurotransmitters."
"So, there are some limitations for the patients there."
The drug interactions are very important.
"Stimulants, CNS, antihypertensives, and antidepressants - other antidepressants."
"So we have these rules that we have to follow, that if you're going to start another antidepressant after stopping a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, you need to wait fourteen days."
"And the reason you need to wait fourteen days is so that the brain can make more monoamine oxidase, that enzyme."
"It's irreversible inhibition, but the brain can regenerate this enzyme."
But it just takes two weeks for this to occur.
"And then you need to wait five half-lives of the previous antidepressant that the patient was on, they need to be off of the medication completely for five half-lives before starting the monoamine oxidase inhibitor."
"So, you can see, with a lot of these restrictions and issues, these drugs are not first line, they're often only handled by psychiatry, but it's important to be aware of them."
"I talked about some of the food-drug interactions in those tyramine containing foods, so this is just there for completeness, but if you can look at some of the absolute contraindications that patients have to follow, it can be some social and issues of quality of life, in terms of what they can and cannot have."
"So, of note, you know, tap beer is an absolute contraindication, some cheeses ... you can look down, and moderate, to be careful with is red and white wine, and then just bottled or canned beer."
"And then these were, the unnecessary, are things that they used to restrict patients on years ago, but then with further study they no longer restrict."
"So twenty years ago they were restricting all of these agents, but now we're a little more aware of the actual tyramine content."
"So, the newest MAO inhibitor is something called ""Emsam""."
"And it's Selegeline as a once-daily monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and it's a topical patch."
"So, this is once a day."
"It doesn't provide any sort of benefit in terms of compliance, where patches can sometimes with once a week."
But it's once a day they have to change their patch.
The second thing I would say about policy  is there are really two types in general.
"One is a policy that you have  because you have a law, for example, the Family Education  Rights Privacy Act Policy."
So you want to be clear and sure that you're going to have compliance on your campus.
There's another kind of policy  that I would call aspirational policy and maybe accessibility  fits a little bit in both but you most certainly  can err on the aspirational side.
"An aspirational policy is something  you establish for your institution as a path moving towards something,  moving forward."
It does not have to have one hundred percent compliance because it's really a direction  that you're setting strategically for your institution.
(Gerry Hanley) I'd say another critical  aspect around our strategy is a shared governance strategy.
"Because education is  a shared responsibility across faculty, staff, students,  vendors, all of us working together have to  share in that responsibility."
"Now, a shared governance process means if you are responsible in delivering the service, then you have an opportunity to share in governing how we're going to manage the implementation  of these services."
(Brady Deaton) The administrators of the university must reflect the values that demonstrate the importance  of this to the learning environment and it has to be built in then to every aspect of what we do.
(Michael Young) Right now we have  a number of projects and initiatives underway at the UW in which  we're testing new technologies.
Accessibility is an important  consideration in these evaluations.
Many of the vendors we work with have completed
"Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates or VPATs, which offer a checklist of accessibility criteria and vendors' self-assessment as to how well they meet those criteria."
"It's a good starting point, but we go beyond that to ask  a vendor specific questions and to test their products with  respect to accessibility."
"(Gerry Hanley) We begin with our vendors  saying ""hey this is not only important that this is required for working with the CSU."
"Every student who comes into  our institution, we have to provide equally effective access to those services and you are a partner in delivering those services to us."
"So we will tell you what we need and then we will help you inform your staff, educate your staff, provide them some consultation and guidance in partnership with us,  so you can deliver the successful service for us""."
(Pat Burns) So we work with our vendors to try to put pressure on them to make things accessible.
We actually have a purchasing process where we work through and ask the issues about accessibility for software and hardware that we buy as well.
(Bruce Maas) Individual efforts really  need to be able to scale well.
"If we go about things in an ad hoc  approach, one by one, we're not likely to get the same results as if we work together as a community in higher education, to work with vendors to improve  accessibility for everyone with regard to the products  that are offered."
That's a much more pragmatic approach rather than institution by institution.
(Gerry Hanley) Making accessibility  a priority in their development roadmap is going to be driven  by the market demand.
"And if an institution never says a word, the vendor isn't going to do anything about it."
"So if we begin to communicate our  demands collectively, then the vendor will recognize  the market value of accessibility."
"(Joel Hartman) As we acquire IT resources, we have to embed accessibility  in our contracts."
"As we develop resources, we have to employ universal design in our thinking about how to make these resources available and  we have to continue to monitor students to see if we're really delivering to them  the resources in a form that they can actually use."
"(Michael Young) Accessibility requires  effort on the part of everyone in the higher education community - faculty, staff, technology vendors."
"If we all do our part, our institutions can provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate."
And we all benefit from the perspectives of a diverse group.
"(Hernan Londonono) Having that peace of mind that we are doing all we can to provide an accessible campus is -- gives us a lot of pride and we feel very happy about what,  what we do."
We say that this situation here is what's called a Nash equilibrium; more formally put a Nash equilibrium is a situation where each player's action is the best response to the other player's actions.
In a situation where the players are all moving simultaneously this basically means that each player is reacting best to what they think the other person is going to do and they're actually right in their guess of what the other person is going to do.
[ Pause ]
Notice here that the equilibrium outcome actually...it doesn't
look as good as it could because here we're saying that any equilibrium when people are acting according to their own best interest each of them ends up with a payout of 5 where as if they only cooperated they would each get a payout of 10.
We can say here that there can be a perato improvement going from both parties confessing to both parties staying quiet in that both parties would be made better off and nobody would be made worse off.
"Unfortunately, due to the competitive nature of the this game that's not what's going to result because it's really hard when there's no contracting involved to guarantee regardless of what the other party says then when it comes down to it they're actually going to cooperate given that it's in their interest individually to not cooperate."
So one question that economists like to think about is then how can cooperation be sustained in the real world?
"Well, one thing that's important to remember here is that in the real world this game isn't played just once, when you have firms interacting with each other people making these decisions often times they have the chance to make the decisions over and over and over so when you have what's called a repeated game you might have a situation where people start testing out the waters to say well maybe if I cooperate the other guy's going to cooperate and then we can keep this going because to cooperate here and hope for the best outweighs, you know there's this threat of well if you try to screw me one time we're reverting back here actually gives in the long term an incentive to cooperate."
So like I said it seems a little bit artificial to be talking about this context of prisoners being interrogated because really we're talking about economics.
But it's very easy to see how this situation could be relevant in an economic context by just replacing the intuition behind some of the choices.
So what I did here is set up the identical game and have this model as still player 1 and player 2 but now they have the choice of whether or not to cooperate or to compete.
And you can see here they'd both do better off by cooperating but they also all have the private incentive to compete.
"And you can notice here that this situation is actually pretty realistic because at least in the United States firms are not allowed to contract on whether or not they're going to cooperate, that's called collusion, it's illegal."
"So they really are simultaneously making independent choices as to how much to cooperate with their "" competitors "" ."
"In the second Geithner video, I lay out a scenario where a bank could-- let me draw its balance sheet."
"Let's say-- oh, that's not how I wanted to do it."
Let's say this is a bank.
It's holding-- let me draw its assets and liabilities.
So it's holding some toxic asset A right here.
"And that could be the bank's equity, that's its"
"liabilities, And this is the other assets for the bank."
"So it could hold some toxic asset A, and we lay out a scenario where, what the bank could do, right now it has 100% exposure to A."
"What it could do is it could take a little bit of cash,"
lend it to another party.
"Let's say it could lend it to a hedge fund, so this becomes a loan to the hedge fund."
So now the hedge fund owes this money to our bank and it now has the cash on its balance sheet.
"So this would now, instead of being cash, it'll be called"
loan to hedge fund.
Now this is the hedge fund's balance sheet.
Its liability is loan from bank.
"So you think of that in terms of the resources that every tourist uses, and it's estimated that a tourist will consume 4 times the amount of an average local person."
"What's happening with all the rubbish they're producing? / There might be a dump nearby that's by a river that's going out, and you're wondering why there's all this garbage in the ocean."
"It might be coming from the places where you're staying, or eating at. / One of the main proponents against the illegal dumping was always saying,"
"""they make the money in Ubud, and we get the trash."""
"You know, maybe it's the location of it, and also the agreement and acceptance of the past decision makers to allow the trash to come in."
"So they said, ""oh great, we have a place, and there's an agreement, and look, our trash is actually helping you to build a road, that's going to connect it to land that was otherwise inaccessible."" So, I truly believe that they felt there was a mutual benefit exchange happening."
"It only was until recently that they realized maybe this deal isn't so good, and put a stop to it, and the kepala desa, the head of the village, was actually able to implement that, and endorse it and make it happen."
I think the Bali government has already made a road map:
"""Bali go Clean and Green""."
"It's like the big agenda in our government; how to make Bali more sustainable, more eco, more green, you know."
"Actually if we see the road map, it's already good."
"I mean, the short term planning, the medium term planning, the long term planning, it's already good."
"And then, the policy of this planning, is based on the 3 big main agenda."
"First, education, formal or informal."
And the second: involve the private sector.
"I mean,"
"like companies, or the corporations that make business in Bali, because tourism is the most main business, but also the garbage or the pollution is also made by this big industry."
And the third is involve the peoples' action.
"I mean, the community action. / There's actually a lot of people out there that are concerned about the problem, but they don't know what to do, and they're completely, you know, frustrated with it."
"And when you start setting these examples they see that and then they come to you, and that's what's happening."
"I believe there are lots of grassroots movements in Bali, made by NGOs or made by just social local organizations, already making a good movement about and making awareness to the locals on how to separate the garbage and how to make compost from the organic garbage, but right now, from my perspective, it's just a small movement."
"So, I think to make it effective, we should involve, or put social pressure on, the government to make a local law, like 'perdau' or 'awig awig' to make it more significant, to make a more significant change,"
"I mean, to make it more effective and efficient."
"We consulted with the community leaders, and we heard that they have big plans for their village to try and revitalize their economy here with a cultural and ecotourism program that just got launched about a year and a half ago."
"In addition to helping them to kind of formulate their tourism program, because they asked us for some advice from a foreigner perspective, we also gave advice on the waste management stuff, which the community had been working on, some members of the community had been working on for 15 years, because this illegal dump site started about 15 years ago, and there are people in the community that have protested against it since then."
"Coincidentally, about a year after we started the project in this community, the illegal dump site had been shut down after 15 years of operating, which, for us, felt like a monumental success for the village to achieve that."
It was really quite a big deal.
"Still, it's not perfect right now, because you know, the waste still has to be handled, but the decision to stop the incoming 14 trucks a day of waste from outside of this village that's not even theirs was a huge decision that we felt really proud of the people for being able to achieve that."
I definitely think it could be replicated in other villages.
Of course the joint shared vision and desire has to be there.
"Many times, people kind of throw their hands up in the air, and are like ""what am I going to do?"" but there are actually a lot of things you can do, and you have to start, maybe small in the beginning, but you have to start. / If you have a small organic farm in your house, even a small one, it will effectively decrease the garbage problem."
"For example,"
So we learned quite a bit about the current landscape of which agencies are using shared drives.
Next on the agenda for today is to look at the purpose of the bulletin.
We'll talk about what our definition of what shared drives are for the purpose of the bulletin.
We'll look at the records management responsibilities for those who have a role in managing files on shared drives.
I'll give you a hint.
Right now this is probably everyone who uses a shared drive.
We'll then go over some of the benefits that we've found for organizing shared drives.
"In order to do the organization process, we developed a list of strategies and best practices that can be used on a day-forward basis to manage shared drives."
We'll then go over any special considerations for federal agencies to transfer permanent records to NARA from shared drives.
"And as I mentioned, as an appendix to the bulletin we developed approaches for organizing shared drives that are based on our own research and experiences and those of the agencies we've spoken with."
I would like to note now that you can go ahead and ask any questions in the chat throughout the webinar and Paulette will moderate these and bring them up when appropriate.
The purpose of this bulletin is that it recognizes the reality that many agencies use shared drives to store records.
"With this bulletin, we're recognizing that vast amounts of"
legacy records reside on shared drives.
And we wanted to provide day-forward guidance for federal agencies on this topic.
What we found in interviews is that agencies have had varying degrees of success with using shared drives as record-keeping systems.
"This seems to be dependent on a number of factors, including the scale of the shared drive and the size of the team that uses them."
So what NARA bulletins do is provide fundamental guidance to federal agencies.
Then it is up to the agencies to determine the most appropriate ways to incorporate that guidance into their business processes.
And agencies can then also identify specific ways to address the record-keeping requirements that are specific to their agencies.
"In this bulletin we will cover the records management implications, agency responsibilities, and benefits of organizing shared drives."
We want to put an emphasis on organization for the potential migration of records from shared drives into a records management application.
That was one of our focuses as we were thinking about this bulletin.
"The shared drive may not be an ideal system at this time, but it can be used to move records into a records management application for eventual disposition and transfer to NARA or disposal."
Our working definition of a shared drive is that they are network drives used to store and share files.
"This could be sharing files such as word processor documents, scanned and photographic images, audio, video, spreadsheets, presentations, and databases."
"Agencies use shared drives for a variety of purposes, but most often they are used to store related content by work group, project, committee, or topic."
"The storage of content on shared drives that includes both federal records and non-record material posses record-keeping challenges, as it leads to the intermixing of the federal records and non-records material."
Which can make it difficult to meet record management responsibilities.
So we're going to try out the feedback box.
The question is - you should see it right now.
I will put up a new poll.
"I'll put the description of the transaction block chain right here. ...and this transaction block chain contains the history of every single transaction that ever occured within the Bitcoin system from the beginning of time, the time of the first block, which is known in Bitcoin as the genesis block."
Everybody can verify the details of any transaction if they wanted because that information is public.
"In particular, what these bitcoin miners will look at is whether or not Dan previously received 5 bitcoins from anybody else,..."
"In this particular case it was his cousin Carol. ...whether or not Dan has tried to spend those bitcoins previously, and so on and so forth."
These bitcoin miners are all collectively trying to take all these recent transactions that haven't yet been recorded.
"That includes not only the transactions between Dan and Pete, but there may be other transactions floating out there that took place around the same time."
The bitcoin miners will look at all these different transactions at once and they are going to try to figure out how to form a transaction block out of these transactions and they'll wanna add this transaction block to the end of the current transaction block chain.
"If you might recall from previous videos, that for a bitcoimn miner to add a transaction block to a transaction block chain they have to solve, what's known as the proof of work puzzle."
"The Bitcoin system is designed, or maybe calibrated is the better word, so that, on average, one miner will solve a puzzle in about ten minutes."
It's worth stressing here that it could take a long time for any one individual miner to solve the puzzle...
"It could even take maybe a year or even two years. ...but because there are so many of these miners working at the same time, one of them is bound to get lucky and solve the puzzle quickly."
Each of these proof of work puzzles that is associated with a transaction block happens to have a difficulty score associated with it.
This difficulty basically represents how hard it was to solve that proof of work puzzle.
Imagine that there are some numbers and we will call these numbers for the most recent difficulty score.
These are just numbers that somehow represent how hard it was to solve this proof of work.
"When you at overall chain, what the Bitcoin system is interested in, it is interested in how hard was it to construct that entire chain."
"The reason it's important for someone to understand how hard the entire chain was constructed is because this overall score for this chain, this difficulty score for the chain is what's used by Pete or by other people who are receiving bitcoins to figure out whether or not they trust the transaction."
"The more work that went into the overall chain, the more trust they will have in that transaction."
The reason for that is that the way Bitcoin works is that if there was ever more than one transaction block chain out there...
Let's say there was a bad user out there or maybe somebody didn't receive a particular message in time or whatever reason.
"If there is somehow more than one transaction block chain out there, according to the Bitcoin protocol, everyone is supposed to work off of the chain that had the most work put into it."
"So, we ignore chains that have a lot less work and only consider the chain that had the most work put into it."
"In the Bitcoin system, that particular chain is often referred to as tha longest chain."
This is actually kind of a confusing piece of terminology because by longest chain we don't mean that this chain is long in any physical sense.
We really just mean...
And I'm gonna put equal bars to kind of say what it means.
By the longest chain we mean tha chain that has the most work.
"The way that the work is defined is that you look at all these different difficulty scores, you add them up and that gives you a difficulty score for the entire chain."
Now we are gonna be interested in the chain that had the most work put into it and we call that the longest chain.
Let's imagine that Dan is dishonest and that after he eats the pizza...
"Let's say Pete is convinced, he gets this bitcoin from Dan, he waits a bit, he sees that there is a long chain out there that contains the transaction, he sends the pizza over to Dan,"
"Dan eats the pizza and then decides that he doesn't want to behave honestly, he wants to somehow cheat Pete or he wants to defraud the system."
The trick to understanding the basics of abrasion lies in this chart.
"The lower the numbers, the more abrasive it is."
"Likewise, the higher the numbers, the"
less abrasive it is.
"Although body shops commonly use heavier and more aggressive products, the sweet spot for detailing and paint correction is roughly 2,500 to 4,500 grit."
The detailing industry uses what's called a diminishing abrasive.
It's designed to break down during use or when you're buffing the paint and finishes off at a lighter abrasion than you started off with to help minimize the appearance of the dreaded holograms or swirls commonly found on dark-colored cars.
"There are three general categories of abrasives when discussing paint restoration-- compounds, polishes, and ultra-fine polishes, or what I"
like to call jeweler's polish.
"Now, over the years, there has literally been hundreds of derivations and unique blends to address different damages, paint depths, detailer skills and, of course, paint hardness."
"Now, combine that with hundreds of different pad selections, and you might see how choosing what pad and product to detail your car with might be confusing, but here is a more simplified approach."
"I stick with three core products, along with three core pads that work 99% of the time, except on those extremely rare and unique paint-damaged situations."
So here is how it works.
"The compound polish and jeweler's polish have their own respective pads, but sometimes the paint requires what I call half steps to be repaired perfectly."
"For example, if you're using a polish with a polishing pad and it seems like the paint needs a little bit more bite but doesn't require the use of a compound, simply switch to the more aggressive compounding pad with the polish to make this a half step instead of a full step."
"When working on a test panel, it's best to use the least amount of abrasives that are necessary to complete the job, because there is a finite amount of clear coat on your car."
"As you can see in this animation, there are a few small scratches and one deep gouge."
"Using the least abrasive product first, which is the jeweler's polish, does little to remove these particular scratches because of their depth."
"Although in some situations, this might be enough to bring the paint back to perfect, it doesn't work here, so we need to bump up to the next most abrasive and retest."
"Next, we tried polishing the test panel and got much better results, but still not good enough."
So we moved on to the compound.
Compound is the next jump up in abrasion while still being user friendly.
"This product should allow you to remove light, medium, and even some heavy scratches to your clear coat."
"Now that you've removed most if not all of the scratches, the trick is to back out the paint after you've compounded."
"This is when you use a less abrasive product than the previous one to create a flat, glass-like surface."
"Now that almost all the scratches are out, it's time to add paint sealant for increased UV protection and to fill in any super heavy scratches that couldn't be fully repaired."
"Once dried, the sealant will create a perfectly flat surface that will reflect light just like a mirror."
"Next, I add a thin layer of Carnauba wax on top of the cured sealant for insane depth and shine found on all amazing show cars."
"Now, that we figured out what products and pad combination work best to repair this paint, I love pulling up the test panel masking tape to get a better look at the before and after results just to be sure I'm happy with the finished product and because it's really exciting to see the perfect paint correction side by side with the thrashed paint."
"It really gives you a great perspective, and it's kind of cool."
"Based on the results of our test panel, we figured out how we're going to approach the rest of the car."
"But before we do that, we want to tape off all these little badges and emblems and lights an of course, these little guys right here so we don't catch it with our pad."
Well.
"Primarily, you know, even though this isn't a programming class per se, it should make you a better programmer."
"You'll get lots of practice describing and reasoning about algorithms, you'll learn algorithm design paradigms, so really high level problem-solving strategies that are relevant for many different problems across different domains, and tools for predicting the performance of such algorithms."
You'll learn several extremely fast subroutines for processing data and several useful data structures for organizing data that can be deployed directly in your own programs.
"Second, while this is not a math class per se, we'll wind up doing a fair amount of mathematical analysis."
And this in turn will sharpen your mathematical analytical skills.
"You might ask, why is mathematics relevant for a class in the design and analysis of algorithms, seemingly more of a programming class."
Well let me be clear.
I am totally uninterested in merely telling you facts or regurgitating code that you can already find on the web or in any number of good programming books.
"My goal here in this class, and the way I think I can best supplement the resources that you probably already have access to is to explain why things are the way they are."
"Why we analyze the algorithms in the way that we do, why various super fast algorithms are in fact super fast, and so on."
And it turns out that good algorithmic ideas usually require nontrivial mathematical analysis to understand properly.
You'll acquire fundamental insights into the specific algorithms and data structures that we discuss in the course.
"And hopefully, many of these insights will prove useful, more generally, in your other work."
"Third, and perhaps the most relevant for those of you who work in some other discipline: this course should help you learn how to think algorithmically."
"Indeed after studying algorithms it's hard enough not to see them pretty much everywhere, whether you are riding an elevator, watching a flock of birds, buying and selling stocks out of your portfolio, even watching an infant learn."
"As I said in the previous video algorithm thinking is becoming increasingly useful and prevalent if you are outside of computer science and technology like in biology, statistics and economics."
"Fourth, if you're interested in feeling like a card carrying computer scientist, in some sense, then you'll definitely want basic literacy in all of the topics that we'll be covering."
"Indeed, one of the things that makes studying algorithms so fun, is, it really feels like you're studying a lot of the greatest hits from the last 50 years of computer science."
"So, after this class, no longer will you feel excluded at that computer science cocktail party when someone cracks a joke about Dijkstra's Algorithm."
Now you'll know exactly what they mean.
"Finally, there's no question that studying this material is helpful for technical interview questions."
"To be clear, my sole goal here is to teach you algorithms, not to prepare you for interviews, per se."
"But over the years, countless students of mine have regaled me with stories about how mastering the concepts in this class enabled them to ace every technical question they were ever asked."
"I told you, this is fundamental stuff."
"So, what do I expect from you?"
"Well, honestly, the answer is nothing."
After all isn't the whole point of a free online class like this one that anyone can take it and devote as much effort to it as they like.
"So that said, as a teacher it's still useful to have one or more canonical students in mind."
And I thought I'd go ahead and be transparent with you about how I'm thinking about these lectures.
Who I have in mind that I'm teaching to.
"So again, please don't feel discouraged if you don't conform to this canonical student template."
You are watching a video of me talking.
You have several tools associated with these videos.
"Some of them are standard video buttons, like the play-pause button on the bottom left."
"Like most video players, you can see how far you are into this particular video segments and how long the entire video segment is."
Something that you might not be used to is the speed options.
"While you are going through the videos, you can speed up or slow down the video player with these buttons."
Go ahead and try it now.
Make me talk faster and slower.
"If you ever get frustrated by the pace of speech, you can adjust it this way."
Another awesome feature is the transcript on the side.
This will follow along with everything that I am saying as
I'm saying it.
So you can read along if you like.
You can click on any of the words and notice that the video jumps to that word.
The video slider at the bottom of the video will also let you navigate through the video quickly.
"Links to the relevant parts of the online textbook, as well as to clean and annotated lecture handouts, are provided at the bottom of the lecture sequence videos."
"Now that you know about the video player, I want to point out the sequence navigator."
"Right now, you are in the lecture sequence, which interweaves many videos and practice exercises."
You can see how far you are in a particular sequence by observing which tab you are on.
You can navigate directly to any video or exercise by clicking on the appropriate tab.
You can also progress to the next element by pressing the arrow button or by clicking on the next tab.
Try that now.
The tutorial will continue in the next video.

"I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement: to resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations, in the act of being with them."
"As a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance, that sense of the other that happens so quickly, in the blink of an eye."
We intuit other people's feelings; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.
We do that all the time.
We just can't shake it off.
For some of you it may seem strange to talk about soil in a conference about food.
And the reason for that is because food for most of us - we've created a food culture that essentially sees food as a commodity.
"For many of us, we don't even know why it has anything to do with food."
"And I want you to know, I'm not a soil scientist; as you've heard, I'm a farmer."
"But I have the privilege and the honor of having an association of colleagues and friends who have helped a lot with this, and so I want you to recognize the credits that I want to give for all the people that have helped in helping me talk about both soil and food."
"In this food culture in which food is essentially a commodity, most of us, I think, in our culture today, simply think about soil as dirt."
It's simply that black stuff that's out there.
"And even some of our soil scientists have occasionally talked about soil as simply a material to hold a plant in place, and the way we grow food is everything else that we do - all the synthetic fertilizers that we put in, the pesticides that we use, that's what we use to raise food, and soil is just sort of there."
"But in point of fact, soil is critical."
And what I want to do this afternoon is to help you understand some of that.
"And in the first place, the first thing to understand, is that soil is not dirt."
"Soil is, in fact, a very vibrant, living community."
"In fact, soil scientists, some of the things they tell us now, is there are more living organisms beneath the surface of the soil than there are above the surface of the soil."
"And it isn't just all of the things that we can see, the earthworms and the beetles and the ants, but it is those microorganisms which dominate all of our soil culture."
"In fact, as near as I can tell, soil scientists can't even come to an agreement about how many microorganisms there are in soil."
"I've seen some soil scientists refer to that as 50 million microorganisms in a single teaspoonful of soil, and others have said it could be as much as two and four billion."
"So this is a community of life, and if we're going to have not only good food but any food at all, we have to sustain that community of life in the soil."
"So this is one of the things that I want to help us understand today,"
"And so, if it wasn't for that community of life, we wouldn't have any food, we wouldn't have any water, we wouldn't have any of us."
"And so I love the way Wes Jackson puts this because not only are we so dependent on all of that life for our life, but as we all know, eventually, we return to soil, right?"
So the way Wes has put this is that we are simply stopovers between soil and soil.
(Laughter)
And I think it's important for us to try to appreciate that as we try to come to understand changing the way we eat because we're not going to change the way we eat unless we recognize what we have to do in supporting our soil.
"Now, there are a couple of problems with this, and one of those problems is that currently, in the way in which we are producing our food, we are losing our soil at unprecedented rates."
"Just in the last half century, we've lost about half of our topsoil in this country."
"And not only have we lost it, but we also have degraded it."
A recent study just came out by the United Nations which has indicated that 25% of the remaining soil on our planet is now degraded.
"In other words, it no longer has the vitality to produce the kind of food that we've all heard today that we need."
"The other thing is that soil is essentially not a renewable material, it's not a renewable resource, because it has taken the earth millions of years to accumulate this soil."
"So unless you want to hang around for a million years, it's going to be very difficult to see this soil that we've lost and are losing, restored."
"So I want to share with you just about a minute and a half from a wonderful documentary which Deborah Koons Garcia has spent the last four years putting together, and it's going to be released to the public in March of this year called ""Symphonies of Soil,"" and I hope all of you get a chance to see it when it comes out, but John Reganold who is a soil scientist at Washington State University, in the beginning of this film, tells us how nature developed and accumulated this soil in the various landscapes."
"Well, let's take just a moment and listen to John tell his story."
"I will also take up possible remedies in the form of government regulations, taxes, and pollution rights."
The classic case of an external cause is pollution.
"When people, either as consumers or producers, throw their waste in the form of fumes and trash into the airways or waterways."
They imposed costs on others who are not parties to market trades.
And who may not be compensated for the damage that they had to incur.
"Because of pollution bystanders to trade may have to incur a cost associated with For example, the worsening of peope's lung and heart problems, the repainting of the houses, dealing with a reduction in the value of their properties that can come with the stench in the air and the climate changes that give rise to for example."
Then innocent bystanders have to suffer the anguish associated with species.
"Polar bears for instance, going extinct because of global warming."
As you must know.
"During the past half century, environmental economics has grown in prominence within the economics discipline and public policy arenas."
Because of the growth in world population.
And because of the growth in production that increases demand on environmental resources worldwide.
"That, for many."
Are becoming increasingly scarce.
"Environmental scientists and activists have reached, for them, a growing consensus that humans have been doing irreparable damage to the planet, and that the continued global warming is very likely during the next century."
"Nevertheless, as there are almost always two sides to any scientific debate, many of the policy issues surrounding global warming remain highly contentious."
We will n ot seek to settle the scientific debate on global warming or any other environmental issue here.
"Rather I will seek, in this lecture, a more modest objective to describe how economists think about environmental problems and solutions for them."
And my guess is that you have already surmised that economists think about external costs in the form of pollution through supply and demand curve.
Which get us back to the same supply and demand curves we have used throughout a number of past lectures.
I have put on my document camera the same supply and demand curves that we've used for illustrative purposes all along.
"In this graph, in this competitive market graph."
We have heretofore assumed that all of the benefits.
"Achievable or captured by the demand curve, all the curves that are incurred are captured by the supply curve, as a result we come to an intersection of"
"P1 and Q1 because of forces of, that will come to bear, if the price is either above or the price is below.Notice that there is certain efficiency outcome from this but we have indicated that is the additional value of all of these units through Q1 is indicated by the demand curve is greater than the additional cost of producing those units."
"As a result we get, in this market where the benefits are captured by the demand and the cost are captured by the supply, we get a net gain in benefits equal to this triangular area. here."
"But let's consider another market condition, one in which all of the benefits of consumption of the good are captured by the demand curve."
But some of the costs that are incurred in the production the goods are emitted to the surrounding community. some of these costs can be pollution costs that are pushed off into the airways and the waterways.
Let's go to another situation and another a graph.
"This time the demand curve captures all of the benefits that consumers received from the purchase of the good, but the supply curve does not capture all of the costs."
There are some pollution costs that the suppliers Producers are able to emit on the surrounding community.
This means that this curve just covers the private costs.
"It turns out that the sweet spot for clear high level thinking about algorithm design, is to ignore constant factors and lower-order terms."
And to concentrate on how well algorithm performance scales with large input sizes.
Big O notation is the way to mathematize this sweet spot.
"Now, there's no one silver bullet in algorithm design."
No single problem solving method that's guaranteed to unlock all of the computational problems that you're likely to face.
"That said, there are a few general algorithm design techniques."
High level approaches to algorithm design that find successful application across a range of different domains.
These relatively widely applicable techniques are the backbone of a general algorithms course
like this one.
"In this course, we'll only have time to deeply explore one such algorithm design paradigm, namely that of the divide and conquer algorithms."
"In the sequel course as we'll discuss, there's two other major algorithms on paradigms to get covered."
"But for now, divide and conquer algorithm, the idea is to first break the problem into smaller problems which then gets solved recursively, and then to somehow quickly combine the solutions to the sub problems into one for the original problem that you actually care about."
"So for example, in the last video."
"We saw two algorithms of this sort, two divide and conquer algorithms from multiplying two large integers."
In later videos we will see a number of different applications.
We'll see how to design fast divide and conquer algorithms for problems ranging from sorting to matrix multiplication to nearest neighbor-type problems and computation of geometry.
"In addition, we'll cover some powerful methods for reasoning about the running time of recursive algorithms like these."
As for the third topic.
"A randomized algorithm is one that, in some sense, flips coins while it executes."
"That is, a randomized algorithm will actually have different executions if you run it over and over again on a fixed input."
"It turns out, and this is definitely not intuitive, that allowing randomization internal to an algorithm, often leads to simple, elegant, and practical solution to various computational problems."
"The canonical example is randomized quick sort, and that algorithm and analysis we will cover in detail in a few lectures."
Randomized primality testing is another killer application that we'll touch on.
And we'll also discuss a randomized approach to graph partitioning.
And finally we'll discuss how randomization is used to reason about hash functions and hash maps.
"One of the themes of this course, and one of the concrete skills that I hope you take away from the course, is, literacy with a number of computational primitives for operating on data, that are so fast, that they're, in some sense, essentially free."
"That is, the amount of time it take to invoke one of these computational primitives is barely more than the amount of time you're already spending just examining or reading the input."
"When you have a primitive which is so fast, that the running time is barely more than what it takes to read the input, you should be ready to apply it."
"For example, in a preprocessing step, whenever it seems like it might be helpful."
It should just be there on the shelf waiting to be applied at will.
"Sorting is one canonical example of a very fast, almost for-free primitive of this form."
But there are ones that operate on more complex data as well.
And it was simply just my own personal view of a ground up development where we have to start to see the world through the eyes of the poor and the suffering because it has always been top-down development.
"It's always been the rich, the powerful, the best educated, those who controlled wealth and money who made all the decisions in our country that just - who were disconnected from the suffering of the majority."
And I had to start with my own reconnection.
"Because if there's something wrong in any countries, it's not the fault of others, it's my fault."
So I worked with the criminals and gang members for three years in Bagong Silang.
"I introduced programs for sports, education, scholarship."
"But I discovered unless it is really holistic, unless you transform the physical environment, unless you restore human dignity, you address social justice, that it will be very difficult to sustain."
"And after bearing six of the gang leaders that we had rehabilitated, five of them were killed by their former enemies, by drinking bodies because transformation does not happen overnight."
And one of them committed suicide when our training center for livelihood was closed and that was his only hope.
So this whole journey had its own pain.
"And it was painful because when you start to consider the poor as family, and I also realized that my children have no future in this country or anywhere in the world if my country remains third world and my people remained second class."
"So the whole objective for me of development was to restore the dignity, my honour as a"
Filipino.
"And as long as majority of my people lived as squatters, in slums, I will continue to live with this honour."
And I will pass on that legacy to my children.
"So the first village we built, it was through volunteerism, it was through - it was not anchored on fund raising because I realize that if we just go for the money that it cannot be sustained."
"It cannot be sustained by charity, it cannot just - it had to be a passion for a transcendent cause."
"And very early, it was not just a project to ease human suffering."
"It was, for me, a journey towards ending poverty in our country."
"And it was about restoring human dignity, giving land to the landless, giving homes to the homeless and water for people who had no clean water."
"And it's simply amazing because we have discovered that we don't need to wait for foreign aid or to foreign charity that we have the - we have the brains, we have the heart, we have the resources to end poverty if we just rise above our politics, we rise above our rivalries, we rise above our parochialism and really have a shared vision to end poverty in our country and for us to be able to really have that as the highest, as the driving passion for us."
"So even the top universities, you know, should make it priorities not just to fuel personal ambition, for career, but really for their own graduates to have a vision for their country, for them to have pride in being Filipino."
"And I realize that foundational to all my - to this is for me to really show the world that God did not make a mistake when he made me Filipino, that there is so much wealth in this country, that there is so much opportunity that we can offer our people."
"So the task for me was to show that in this country, we should not just graduate jobseekers here or abroad."
We should graduate wealth creators and job generators.
"And that we should see that the greatest wealth of this country is our people including the poorest of the poor, including the rebels and the criminals."
And we should not look for opportunities in other parts of the world because we realize that people from other countries will have their own share of trouble.
"When I was in Davos, the Europeans were talking about Euro debt woes and the Americans were just battling it out with their own recession blues."
"And now, people are starting to realize that more and more solutions to the world problems in the West and in the North are in the emerging countries of the South and the East."
"And so, somehow, because of my background as an economist and also working for multinational company in marketing, I realized that what the Filipino need was positive branding."
"And so, we had Gawad Kalinga that embodied the best of the Filipino in his own country."
"And we wanted this to be the product of his love for his country, for his people."
"We'll come back over here and kind of see what good it does and what things it's not so hot at, right, is that it is easy to move the cursor wherever you want."
"You know, that moving it a long distance or a short distance, moving it is a little bit or to the beginning to the end, equally easy as by just resetting some variable."
"It's the enter and delete, right where this one actually really suffers, right, based on how many characters, right, follow that cursor, right you could potentially be moving the entire contents of the buffer."
Adding at the end is actually going to be relatively fast.
"So if you have to type in order, like you just type you theses out and never go back to edit anything, then it would be fine, adding those characters at the end."
"But at any point, if you move the cursor back into the mid of the body, somewhere in the front, somewhere in the middle, right, a lot of characters get shuffled as you change, makes edits in the middle there."
And so what this seems that it actually has good movement but bad editing as a buffer strategy.
"That's probably, you know, given that we have these six operations we'll all interested in, this is probably not the mix that seems to make the most sense for something that's called an editor, right."
"It is the editing operations are the ones that is weakest on, it has its most debilitating performance, it wouldn't make that good of an editor, right, if that was going to be your behavior."
"It has one advantage that we're going see, actually, we're going to have to kind of make compromises on it, which it actually uses very little extra space, though, but it's using the vector, which potentially might have excess capacity up to twice that."
So maybe it's about two bites per char in the very worse case.
But it actually has no per character overhead that's already imbedded in the data structure from this side.
"Now, I'm just going to go totally somewhere else."
Okay.
"So instead of thinking of it as vector, thinking of it as continuous block, is to kind of realize the editing operations, right, that comes back to the idea, like if I were working at the very end of my document that I can edit there efficiently."
"It kind of inspires me to think of, how do I think I can make it so the insertion point is somehow in the efficient place."
"Like the edits that are happening on the insertion point, can I somehow make it to where access to the insertion point is easy?"
"That rather than bearing that in the middle of my vector, if I can expose that to make it accessible easily in the way the code manipulates the internal of the buffer."
And so the idea here is to break up the text into two pieces.
"Things that are to the left of the cursor, things that are to the right, and I'm calling this the before and the after."
"And then organize those so they're actually averted from each other to where all the characters that lead up to the cursor are set up to where B is very close, assessable at the top of, in this case, a stack, and that the things that are farther away are buried further down in the stack in that inaccessible region."
"And similarly over here, but inverted, that C is the top of this stack and D and E, and things are further down, they are buried away from me, figuring the things I really need access to are right next to the cursor that I'm willing to kind of move those other things father away to gain that access."
"And so what this buffer does is it uses two stacks, a before stack, an after stack, and that the operations for moving the data around become transferring things from the before to the after stack."
Where's the cursor?
How does the cursor represent it?
Do I need some more data here?
Some integer some ?
"It's really kind of odd to think about but there is no explicit cursor, right, being stored here but the cursor is, in this case, right, like modeled by what's on the before stack or all the things to the left of the cursor."
What's on the after stack is following the cursor.
"So in fact, the cursor is represented as the empty space between these two where you have, you know, how many ever characters wrong before is actually the index of where the cursor is."
"So kind of a wacky way of thinking about it, but one that actually have some pretty neat properties in terms of making it run efficiently."
So let me show you the diagram of it happening.
"So in the last quiz, you have seen that it's not very likely that we can find a randomized algorithm for an NP complete problem that, in polynomial time, will deliver us the right answer with a fixed probability."
"To be honest, we currently don't know if such an algorithm is possible or impossible but many believe that it is highly unlikely, and so far, no such algorithm has been discovered."
"It seems that we can sometimes, however, if we either crossed this one here of our list or crossed this one here of our list, and you'll soon see that- actually it doesn't really matter what we crossed of our list."
"But if we kind of reduced the number of wishes that we have, it seems that sometimes we can use randomness to at least improve the running time of exponential time algorithms."
"So just as you've seen when we optimized such this, it sometimes also possible to improve the running time of exponential time algorithms or the base of the exponent using randomness."
"Now, the question of course is could we use randomness to help Alice solve vertex cover or help Bob solve this clique problem or Carol her independent set problem or Davis' shortest tour problem at least when we say that we don't have this requirement here."
And the answer unfortunately is we don't know.
We don't know if there are good randomized algorithms to solve vertex cover or clique or independent set or shortest tour at least not if we are demanding guarantees.
"So, of course, there are randomized algorithms that will look through a random number of solutions, and these are also used in practice, but again, they don't offer any guarantees."
"There is one problem, however, that is NP complete where I can give you a randomized algorithm that at least is better than the best known deterministic algorithm and that problem is 3-SAT."
"As I hope you will remember, the 3-SAT problem had as an input, a Boolean formula with n variables."
And the Boolean formula had a special property because it's 3-SAT.
Each clause in the Boolean formula has exactly three variables.
And the output that I'm looking for is again an answered to the question if this Boolean formula here has a satisfying assignment.
So how can you use randomness to solve this problem?
"Well, there is a very simple and, in my mind, very elegant algorithm that in 1999 was proposed by Uwe Schöning to solve a 3-SAT instance with n variables and this here is the algorithm so the algorithm will start out by picking a random zero, one assignment for the the variables."
Zero meaning false and one meaning true and then it will repeat 3*n the following loop.
"If all clauses are already satisfied that it has found a satisfying assignment then it would actually stop and then it will randomly flip one of the variables of that clause, and by randomly flipping, I mean the following."
"So it will take this clause, which has three variables, and the clause is not satisfied."
"It will pick one of the variables, and if that variable is true, then it will set it to false, and if it's false, it will set it to true."
"Now, notice that this will automatically satisfy this clause, because the clause is not satisfied."
So this variable here is a variable or the variable with a knot will evaluate to false.
This part here will evaluate to false and this one here.
So if I flipped any of those variables then the clause becomes satisfied.
"Now, if we run this algorithm here once, what are the chances that it will succeed and find a satisfying assignment provided that the initial Boolean formula does indeed have a satisfying assignment?"
"If it doesn't have one, the algorithm can't find but, but let's assume it has one."
Then the success of this algorithm depends on two things.
One is how far of this initial solution here is from a satisfying assignment.
"And the second one is, of course, are these random choices that we make down here flipping variable successful."
"So, if we are somewhere near a satisfying assignment, and of course, by chance the algorithm makes the right choices here then we would find a satisfying assignment provided that the original Boolean formula actually has such an assignment."
So let's look at these two success factors here a bit more closely.
The answer is it requires me to completely trust Coleen.
"The Campanile, and in the centre on the lower left the just low cornered baptistry and on the back the cathedral of Florence which Brunelleschi's dome at the top."
"- Well, the baptistry is a medieval building and from the tenth century probably and the cathedral that we all know they began building in the strand 1300 and the bell tower starts going up a little bit perhaps after that and then the dome is built from the early 1400 and finished in the 1470's."
"- So, what are we looking at with the bell tower? the bell tower now we are going to concentrate on is the lower part of it around 1340 even when the tower was not complete yet, they decided that the town and the guild of Florence, specifically the world guild that was in charge of decorating the cathedral decided that they want to decorate the bottom of the tower because even though it was completely embarassing, having business there on decorated surface where one is walking around as you can see, all the time and so the two very bottom layers are decorated with many reliefs designed in stone marble rather than the bronze that is on the bapistry. the reliefs cover a lot of subjects. there are typical scenes there are signs of the zodiac and there are also scenes of"
local art and industry.
"Some of these things may sound unusual of course the biblical scenes make sense on such buildings well those might have been a little bit unusual we'll see why they might want to include those we should also say that the zodiac signs are not unusual because the medieval christians were very able, and very comfortably blended their belief in christianity and christian devotion in with interest in horse gathering, we see that a lot in medieval trasures thats right.lets look at some of these relics her is one of these religious scenes.this is the creation of adam.the artist is andrew epizano who at rather the same time is working on the bronze relics just across the street on the side towards the bapistry. those secenes are about john the bapist and here is one of the typical scenes on the bell tower and again this is typical of the zious belif belief described at. it is very very simplified with mostly a blank background, just a few things to give you a sense of the setting.there are a few stylysed trees and we have god leaning over and creating adam verily out of the dust of the earth he takes form. exactly. this is another good exampleo fhow at aura combines a graphic stylistion with a sort of naturalist classicism. where do you see the graphic stylistion? well the figure of god the father some ways the robes went about with a sense of the body underneath with a kind of ritual folds. all this is pretty traditional so you ense of the body with not yet so attire sensive and atomically correct and real physical instead the figure adam is a nude athletic male you know it is calassicising as well as naturalistic he is in a contapastic stance even though he is lying down. this does not make any sense for contra posture is usually for standing up. but the fact that he has done that anyway shows that how interested he was in giving alassical piecec thats true of his ribs muscles riht thro. this is quite typical of his style. you are now looking at one of the scenes of local industry. it is lot like one of the god fearing adam. it is interesting that you say that because the industry that is represented here is sculpture and this is an interesting way for an artist tosuggest that the work of the sculpture is in some ways like the work of god. thos who are creative in fact we see here that the creator here the artist"
"leaning over with stylised robes leaning over a nude more naturalistic more classicising figure well, of course, he is not going to get on trouble because of modesty here because look again and compare this to the way God creates Adan"
God is innature and he uses a gesture of his hand and Adan is clearly sopposed to be a real living person
"When we look at the sculptor in the studio, he is in the studio, he is using tools."
The use of the tool is a really conspicuous.
Let's solve some quadratic equations by factoring.
So let's say I had x squared plus 4x is equal to 21.
Now your impulse might be to try to factor out an x and somehow set that equal to 21.
And that will not lead you to good solutions.
You'll probably end up doing something that's not justified.
What you need to do here is put the entire quadratic expression on one side of the equation.
We'll do it onto the left-hand side.
So let's subtract 21 from both sides of this equation.
The left-hand side then becomes x squared plus 4x minus 21.
And then the right-hand side will be equal to 0.
"And the way you want to solve this, this is a quadratic equation."
We have a quadratic expression being set equal to 0.
"The way you want to solve this is you want to factor them, and say, OK, each of those factors could then be equal to 0."
So how do we factor this?
"Well, we saw in the last video that we have to figure out two numbers whose product is equal to negative 21, and whose sum is equal to 4."
This would be a plus b would have to be equal to 4.
"Since their product is negative, they have to be of different signs."
"And so let's see, the number that jumps out at me is 7 and 3."
"If I have negative 7 and positive 3, I would get negative 4."
So let's do positive 7 and negative 3.
So the a and b are positive 7 and negative 3.
"When I take the product, I get negative 21."

Echizen forged knives
"Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Fukui prefecture, Japan. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in its creation. ""Nimai hiroge"" (double layering), and ""Mawashi hagane tsuke"" (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristic techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979."
History.
"The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-cho period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to ""Echizen no kuni"" (present Echizen city) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen city became an area famous for their production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen city became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets."
Two main processes.
"The two main important processes: ""nimai hiroge"" and ""mawashi hagane tsuke""."

Personal life.
University of London
"The University of London is a federal university made up of 31 affiliates: 19 separate university institutions, and 12 research institutes."
"Its headquarters, Senate House, is in Malet Street in the Bloomsbury area of Camden. This is near University College London and the British Museum."
"The University of London is the largest university in the UK by number of full-time students, with 135,090 campus-based students and over 45,000 in the University of London International Programmes."
"The constituent colleges are responsible for the teaching, the research or the individual students and staff of the constituent colleges; the university is not. The university is an administrative body responsible for standards, degree examinations and certification."
"The university was first established by a Royal Charter in 1836, which brought together in federation ""London University"" (now University College London) and ""King's College"" (now King's College London)."
"Graduates of the University of London may use the post-nominal letters 'Lond.' or 'Londin.' (both from ""Londiniensis"") after their degree abbreviations."
"The university's biggest colleges are Birkbeck, Goldsmiths, King's College London, the London Business School, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, SOAS, LSE and UCL."
History.
"Founded in 1836, the University at first comprised just two colleges. They were University College London (founded in 1826), which did not apply religious tests to its students, and King's College (founded in 1829), which admitted only members of the Church of England. Therefore, both University College and King's pre-date the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for the constituent colleges."
"In 1858 the University expanded its role by offering the University of London International Programmes to candidates outside the colleges, the first of its kind in the country. A new headquarters at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role."
"In 1878 the University became the first university in the UK to admit women on equal terms with men. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country."

King's College London
"King's College London (King's or KCL) is a large university in London, and a college of the federal University of London."
"University College London (1826) was founded before it. However, King's (1829) was the third oldest university in England to get its royal charter."
"In 1836 King's became, with University College, one of the two founding colleges of the University of London."
"King's is arranged into nine Schools of Study, spread across four Thames-side campuses in central London and one in Denmark Hill, South London."
"King's is one of the largest centres for graduate and post-graduate medical teaching and biomedical research in Europe. It is home to six Medical Research Council centres, the most of any British university."
"King's has around 18,600 full-time students and 5,030 staff and had a total income of £508 million in 2009/10, of which £144 million was from research grants and contracts."
"There are 12 Nobel Prize winners amongst King's alumni and former faculty. King's is ranked 5th nationally and 19th in the world in the 2015 ""QS World University Rankings,"" 7th nationally and 27th in the world in the 2015 ""The Times Higher Education World University Rankings ""and 7th nationally and 55th in the world in the 2015"" ""Academic Ranking of World Universities.

History.
Gameplay.
"The game is actually an open world, you can navigate by walking, driving a car, or taking a bus. Though much of the game consists of exploring and solving puzzles. During combat, if the players loses, they don't die, but rather end up infected, they have to rush to the hospital in order to cure their infection."
"The game has an unsettling mix of science-fiction, body-horror and surrealism, possibly taking influences from the films of ""David Cronenberg"", ""David Lynch"" and ""Shin'ya Tsukamoto"" as well as some of the 1950's and 1960's American science-fiction flicks for the setting and the story."

Icosane
"Icosane, also commonly spelled eicosane, is an alkane or a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula H20C42. It has 366,319 structural isomers. Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, ""n""-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature."
Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.
Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
"The compound is found in the highest concentrations in plants such as Mexican ageratum, licorice, and the Bayrum tree."

Division is repeated subtraction.
The symbol for division is / or a fraction.
Examples of divisions:
formula_42
formula_43
formula_44

The then current US president Barack Obama won the primary against Tennessee attorney and candidate who had a record of losing John Wolfe Jr, who got nearly 42% of the vote, which many people didn't think would happen. All 47 voters to decide the winner of the primary were given to, and said they would vote for Barack Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. While John Wolfe Jr. was allowed 19 delegates to the convention because of how he had done in Arkansas, state party officials said Wolfe missed two paperwork filing deadlines related to the voters for the convention process, therefore he was not allowed to be given them. Wolfe started legal proceedings to have voters in the primary in his name allowed. Eight other delegates who didn't announce who they'd vote for, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well."

Socialist republic ruled by the Romanian Communist Party replaced the monarchy after Joseph Stalin occupied Romania in 1945 ."
Treaty of Trianon
The Treaty of Trianon is the peace treaty signed in 1920 between the Allies and Hungary.
"Hungary lost World War I and so the treaty gave about two thirds of its land and one third of its population to neighboring countries, like Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The partition of Hungary brought irredentism, since many people in the lost lands were Hungarian and wanted to continue being part of Hungary."

W. Murnau (John Malkovich) was complicit in hiring the creature for the purpose of realism."
"Similarly, the short film 'La duodécima hora' by Rodrigo Plaza and film critic Juanma Ruiz, suggested a hidden plot orchestrated by Nosferatu director and producer, F. W. Murnau and Albin Grau, to hide an elixir of the eternal life. Shot as a mockumentary, the film starred horror icon Paul Naschy and Nosferatu film restorer Luciano Berriatúa."
"Viper Comics's 2010 graphic novel ""Nosferatu"" by Christopher Howard Wolf retold the original 1922 film's storyline with a modern setting and cast."

Both planes caught fire after the impact and 35 of their occupants died, and another 29 were injured, thirteen of them seriously."
Investigation.
"The conclusions of the accident investigation carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established several causes for the accident."
"The fact that the ground radar was out of service on the day of the incident was one such root cause, as it would otherwise have been able to detect the presence of the SkyWest aircraft on the runway in time to alert the incoming US Airways flight. Other decisive factors were the lack of synchronicity between the flight progress tabs available to the controllers and the actual position of the aircraft on the airport runways and taxiways, which made the flight aircraft 5569 received incorrect instructions due to its controller's incorrect perception of its location. The poor night lighting of the runways and the glare problems that this lighting caused in the operators of the airport control tower, reducing their ability to see small aircraft during their maneuvers on the taxiways, was another of the determining factors of the Sinister."
"The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the airport administration for not having enough staff to handle landings and takeoffs, especially during night operations."

"Two key problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the H-Block hunger strikers, two of Thomas McElwee's sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting; Mary said to the media outside that ""he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions"". FitzGerald then ordered Gardaí to remove the families from the meeting."
"In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months, in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a working majority."
Taoiseach 1982–87.
Constitutional reform.
"As Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society. His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws."
"A controversial Pro-Life Amendment (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the ""Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother"", was added to the Irish constitution—against FitzGerald's advice—in a 1983 national referendum."
Northern Ireland.
"FitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. It provided the incentive for the reopening of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985."
"While the Agreement was rejected and criticised by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the Irish and British governments which, in time, would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and, subsequently, the republican and loyalist cease-fires."
Infighting and declining support.
"In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election, and Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach."
Post-Taoiseach period.
"FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, and retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, died before him in 1999; after that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in ""The Irish Times"", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs."
"In 2009, FitzGerald had received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to have been bought by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008."
Death.
"On 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, sent his regards and called him an ""institution"". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May he died aged 85, from pneumonia, at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin."

"Students often use a mnemonic to remember this relationship. The ""sine"", ""cosine"", and ""tangent"" ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:"
Using trigonometry.
"With the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called ""solving"" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since ""every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles""."
"Trigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding."
"There is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation."

Domitian
"Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a Roman emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96."
Biography.
"Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father Vespasian (69–79), his elder brother Titus (79–81), and that of Domitian himself."
"When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius."
"As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome."
"Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus."
"Domitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate."
"Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant."
"Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century."

"Theriodonts fall into three main groups: Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia and Cynodontia. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic."
"Theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids."
"Eutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants – the mammals. The name means ""true beast tooth"". The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles."
"The theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Lower Triassic."
"The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as ""Cynognathus"", as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts. While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed."
"By the Upper Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent-like tritylodonts (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, trithelodonts, which evolved into the first mammals. The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous, but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth."
Laura Ingraham
"Laura Ingraham (born 19 June 1964) is an American conservative political commentator, author and radio host. Her nationally syndicated talk show ""The Laura Ingraham Show"" was broadcast for nine years on the Talk Radio Network. She has been known for her controversial statements against the left wing party."
Peptide bond
"A peptide bond is a special chemical bond that happens between two amino acids. In the reaction (called condensation), the two amino acids are combined into a ""dipeptide""."
Repenomamus
Repenomamus is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.
"There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether ""Repenomamus"" was a hunter or a scavenger."
Life style.
"""Repenomamus"" was carnivorous. A specimen of ""R. robustus"" has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile ""Psittacosaurus"" preserved in its stomach."
"This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this."
"The larger species, ""R. giganticus"", is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. ""R. giganticus"" was more than 1 metre (39 inches) long and weighed about 12–14 kg (26–31 lb). Its skull measures 16 cm (6.25 in) long, its body 52 cm (20.5 in), and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm (14 in)."
Discovery.
"The fossils were recovered from the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period."
"""Repenomamus"" is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives."
Frederick William III of Prussia
Frederick William III () (3 August 1770 – 7 June 1840) was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840.
Life.
"Frederick William was born in Potsdam in 1770 as the son of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy,"
"As a soldier he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his lieutenancy in 1784, became a colonel in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792-1794. On December 24, 1793, Frederick William married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They had ten children. In the ""Kronprinzenpalais"" (Crown Prince's palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797."
Reign.
He succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797 and took over personal power without giving responsibility to his ministers. Unfortunately he was not able to follow a consistent course for himself.
His sense of duty can be seen from this quote:
"born July 28, 1941)"
"is an American lawyer and former judge. He served as the 81st Attorney General of the United States. Mukasey was appointed following the resignation of Alberto Gonzales. Mukasey also served for 18 years as a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, appointed by Ronald Reagan, six of those years as Chief Judge."

Bush presidency from 1991 to 1993."
"On December 7, 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Barr to again serve as Attorney General of the United States. He was confirmed, for a second time, as Attorney General on February 14, 2019, and assumed office later the same day."
"On December 14, 2020, Trump announced that Barr would be resigning as attorney general, effective December 23."
Nicholas Katzenbach
"Nicholas deBelleville ""Nick"" Katzenbach (January 17, 1922 – May 8, 2012) was an American lawyer. He was the United States Attorney General during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. He was Attorney General from February 1965 through October 1966."
Elliot Richardson
"Elliot Lee Richardson (July 20, 1920 December 31, 1999) was an American lawyer and politician. He was a member of the cabinet of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. As U.S. Attorney General, he was a known figure in the Watergate Scandal, and resigned rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox."
"Richardson served as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973, Secretary of Defense from January to May 1973, Attorney General from May to October 1973, and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four Cabinet positions within the United States government (the other such individual being George Shultz)."
"On December 31, 1999, Richardson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79."
Frequency probability
"Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments."
"This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn."
Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory
Satellite navigation
A satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly.
"Satnav uses a system of satellites. The system gives exact positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to find their position (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). The position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line (line of sight) by radio from satellites. The signals also allow the receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Global Positioning System is the biggest and most used GNSS. GLONASS, owned by Russia, is the second biggest. China, India, and the European Union are working on similar systems of their own."
Bad Santa
Bad Santa is a 2003 American Christmas criminal black comedy movie.
Property law
"Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents."
History.
"The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called ""dominion""."
Edie Falco
"Edie Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American movie, television and stage actress. She plays Carmela in HBO's ""The Sopranos"". She starred in ""Nurse Jackie"" as the title character. She also acted in many movies."
Cymbeline
"The Tragedy of Cymbeline is a play by William Shakespeare. It is based on a story in a book called ""Holinshed's Chronicles"" by Raphael Holinshed. Shakespeare also used ""History of the Kings of Britain"" by Geoffrey of Monmouth about the real-life British king Cunobelinus. Shakespeare also used a story in a book by Giovanni Boccaccio called ""Decameron"" for some details. The first known performance was in April 1611. It was first printed in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays."
Systems engineering
"Systems engineering is a field of engineering that deals with complex engineering projects which should be designed and managed over the life cycle of the project. Therefore, issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become really complicated. Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to handle such projects. For this, it applies both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management."
Leigh Francis
"Leigh Francis (born 30 April 1973) is an English comedy performer best known for his portrayal of foreign celebrity-obsessed character Avid Merrion in Channel 4 comedy programme ""Bo' Selecta!"", as well as Northern businessman Keith Lemon in ""Keith Lemon's Very Brilliant World Tour"" and ""Celebrity Juice"". As Keith Lemon, he has also made many appearances on ""Big Brother's"" companion shows ""Big Brother's Little Brother"" and ""Big Brother's Big Mouth""."
Hurricane Flora
"Hurricane Flora was among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes. This hurricane happened in Autumn 1963. The storm hit southwestern Haiti at peak intensity (her winds peaked at 145 miles per hour). Flora then drifted over Cuba for almost four days before heading northeast into the Atlantic. Between seven thousand and eight thousand people died due to Flora. At that time, the death toll was the most from any storm since the Galveston Hurricane in September 1900. The name Flora was later retired."
Dance-pop
"Dance-pop is a genre of pop music that originated in the 1980s and is still popular nowadays. It incorporates elements of normal pop music, and it is (usually) fast-paced and upbeat.

Mechatronics engineering
"Mechatronics (or mechatronic engineering) is a combination of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, computer engineering, control engineering, and systems-design engineering in order to design and manufacture some useful products. Mechatronics is an engineering system design that combines several areas of study and avoids splitting engineering into separate disciplines."
Tree of life (biology)
The tree of life is a metaphor which expresses the idea that all life is related by common descent.
Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in modern biology. It had been used many times before for other purposes.
Groups.
"There are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa. The three best-known groups are the Mbenga, Mbuti, and Twa groups. Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language."
"The Mbenga people, sometimes called the ""Ba-Mbenga"", live in the western Congo basin. The Mbenga include the Aka people, who speak the Aka language. The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. The M-Benzélé people, or ""western Aka"", and the Ba-Sese people, ""eastern Aka"", are also related."
"Other Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. They speak three very similar languages: Baka language, Ganzi language, and Gundi language. Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people. The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language."
"The Mbuti people, sometimes called the ""Bambuti"", live in the Ituri rainforest in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They include the Efé people, Asua people, and the Kango people. The Efé speak the Efé language. The Asua speak the Asoa language. The Kango speak the Kango language."
"The Twa people, or ""Ba-Twa"", live in Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The Twa speak Kirundi and Kinyarwanda."
Itihasa
"In Sanskrit, Itihasa means history. For Hindus, an Itihasa is a story that tells about what happened in the past in the land of India. Itihasas are usually epic poems. The important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Modern excavations and archaeological evidences are slowly beginning to find evidences to prove these Indian epics as actual history."
"The original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History. The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean ‘thus indeed, in this tradition’ ."
"One of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyas’s Arthashastra. Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE. He defines Itihaasa, in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince, with the following words;"
पुराणमितिव्रुत्तमाख्यायिकोदाहरणं धर्मशास्त्रं चेतीतिहासः
"Puraana (the chronicles of the ancients), Itivrtta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaaharana (illustrative stories), Dharmashastra (the canon of Righteous conduct), and Arthashastra (the science of Government) are known by (comprise the corpus of Itihaasah, ) History"
"Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 1, Chapter 5"
"Thus, History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the sense of Historiography and is perhaps even more eclectic and appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today. We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History ( http://www.india-forum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2088), since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago."
"The quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini,12th century CE (1147 to 1149 CE) who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance"
धर्मार्थ काममोक्षाणामुपदेश समान्वितं ।
पुरावृत्तं कथायुत्तरूपमितिहासं प्रचक्षते ।।
“Dharmaartha-kaama-moskshanaam upadesa-samanvitam |
"Puraa-vrttam, kathaa-yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate ||”"
"History will be the narration of events as they happened, in the form of a story, which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life, to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool, by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation."
"Clearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History, embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa. The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that, in our usage, while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History, it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories"
Bhakti yoga
"Bhakti yoga is a Hindu spiritual practice. People constantly pray to, and think about, a form of a Hindu god, usually Vishnu."
"Bhakti is a Sanskrit term. It signifies an attitude of devotion to God. The relation between man and God is imagined as a beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master-servant. The Bhakta worships his chosen God by any of these mentalities."
The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine primary forms of bhakti. They are:
International Society for Krishna Consciousness
"The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is a newer religious movement based on the original Vedic culture of ancient India. It is also known as 'the Hare Krishna' movement. It was founded in 1966 in New York City by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The organization's core beliefs are based on three scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and the Caitanya-caritamrita."
Hare Krishna
"The notion of ""experience"" has been criticised."
"The term ""Religious empiricism"" is seen as highly problematic. Karl Barth saidf that the term was wrong altogether. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson."
"Robert Sharf points out that ""experience"" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of ""experience"" introduces a false idea of duality between ""experiencer"" and ""experienced"". In kensho there is no duality of observer and observed. ""Pure experience"" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a given tradition may even determine what ""experience"" someone has; this means that this ""experience"" is not the ""proof"" of the teaching, but a ""result"" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by ""cleansing the doors of perception"", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence."

European wars of religion
"In the Protestant Reformation, a number of people criticizes the Roman Catholic Church. People such as Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli or Jan Hus were reformers: In the end, each of them had followers which started their own church. Today, most of these Churches are known as Protestant. In the European wars of religion, countries, but also local leaders fought for influence. Most of the time one side of the warring fraction was Catholics, the other was Protestants."
Examples of these wars:

"In 2015, Atlassian made an initial public offering on the NASDAQ and its capitalization was estimated at $4.37 billion."
Two-party system
"There are several states in the world, where politics is dominated by two parties. This is known as two-party system. According to Giovanni Sartori, the following is true for such as system:"
"The Median voter theorem describes such a system: While at first the parties have programmes that are very different from each other, over time, they will get closer. Hotelling's law also describes this in game theory."
"Note that in such systems, there may also be other parties, bur these rarely have enough influence to win majorities in elections."
"Two Examples of countries that have a two party system are the United Kingdom, and the United States."
Median voter theorem
"The median voter theorem is a theorem from political economics: Suppose there are two parties: One is a left-wing party, the other is a right-wing party. Voters either vote for the left-wing party L, or the right-wing party R. In an election, L has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so that it can get voters from the other party R. Similarly, R has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so it can get voters from L."
California's 1st congressional district
"California's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. The district is represented by Republican Doug LaMalfa since 2013. Before LaMalfa has taken office, the district had not had a Republican congressman since 1998. The district is made up of the counties: Butte County, Lassen County, Modoc County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Sierra County, Siskiyou County, Tehama County, most of Nevada County, part of Glenn County and part of Placer County."
Paper Port (TV series)

"The disease is named after Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs who first described the disease in the late 19th century. After the discovery, he noticed a red spot on the retina of a one year old child. The child was experiencing the same symptoms of the disease. Bernard Sachs was a neurologist from the United States. He was the first person to describe the cellular changes from the disease. In 1969, researchers discovered that Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A."
Joseph Swan
"Sir Joseph Wilson Swan (31 October 1828–27 May 1914) was an English physicist and chemist who was well known because he created the incandescent light bulb, about a year before Thomas Edison. His house was the first in the world to be lit by electric light bulbs."
"In 1904, Swan was knighted, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. He had already received the highest award in France, the Légion d'honneur, when he visited an international exhibition in Paris in 1881. The exhibition included exhibits of his inventions, and the city was lit with electric light, thanks to Swan's invention."
Atom Egoyan
"Atom Egoyan, OC () (born July 19, 1960) is a Canadian-Armenian movie maker. His work often explores themes of alienation and isolation. Egoyan's movies often follow non-linear plot-structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding important information."
Standard asteroid physical characteristics
"The standard asteroid physical characteristics of an asteroid include, but can also include things other than: diameter, mass, density, surface gravity, escape velocity, rotation period, spectral class, absolute magnitude, albedo, and surface temperature, or what the temperature is on the asteroid."
Crowded House
"Crowded House are an Australian rock group. They formed in 1985 in Melbourne, led by New Zealand singer-songwriter Neil Finn. Finn is the main songwriter and creative director of the band. He has led it through several changes. The band has people from a few different countries: from New Zealand (Neil and his brother, Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner), Australia (Paul Hester, Nick Seymour, Peter Jones and Craig Hooper) and the United States (Mark Hart, and Matt Sherrod). Crowded House are referred to as ""The Crowdies"" by Australian fans."
"Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, ""Crowded House"", which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits, ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Something So Strong"". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, ""Woodface"" and ""Together Alone"" and the compilation album ""Recurring Dream"", which included the hits ""Fall at Your Feet"", ""Weather with You"", ""Distant Sun"", ""Locked Out"", ""Instinct"" and ""Not the Girl You Think You Are""."
"Founding drummer Hester left in May 1994, citing family reasons, but returned for their ""Farewell to the World"" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester committed suicide, aged 46."
"In 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod. They have since released two albums, which have both reached number one on Australia's Album Chart. The new albums are called ""Time on Earth"" (2007) and ""Intriguer"" (2010)."

"Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota. She is the daughter of Rose Katherine (née Heuberger) and James John ""Jim"" Klobuchar, a columnist for the ""Star Tribune""."
"Klobuchar was a valedictorian at Wayzata High School. She received her B.A. degree in political science in 1982 from Yale University. During her time at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for Senator Walter Mondale. Klobuchar received her law degree from the University of Chicago."
Law career.
"Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998, and reelected in 2002. In 2001 ""Minnesota Lawyer"" named her ""Attorney of the Year"". Klobuchar was President of the Minnesota County Attorneys Association from November 2002 to November 2003."
U.S. Senate.
"In early 2005, Senator Mark Dayton announced that he would not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate. She was seen as a favorite for the DFL nomination for the 2006 election. In the general election, Klobuchar faced Republican candidate Mark Kennedy."
"On March 30, 2008, Klobuchar announced her endorsement of Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primary, promising her unpledged superdelegate vote for him."
Klobuchar faced State Representative Kurt Bills and won a second term in the U.S. Senate in 2012.
"In late 2016, Klobuchar was known to have passed more legislation than any other senator. In February 2017, she called for an independent, bipartisan commission like the 9/11 Commission to investigate ties between Russia and U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration. She maintained high approval ratings throughout 2017, with the ""Star Tribune""'s Minnesota Poll announcing in April 2017 that her approval rating was 72%. In October 2017, Morning Consult listed Klobuchar in the Top 10 of their list of senators with the highest approval rating."

Fulfillment house
A fulfillment house or fulfillment centre are modern terms for a packing warehouse.
Types of fulfillment company services.
"Standard types of these services are as follows: storage and warehousing (company stores an item until and order for that item is received), inventory control (maintaining and publishing inventory counts), pick and pack services (preparing ordered items for shipping) and shipping (outsourcing to courier or delivery companies)."
Outsourcing to a fulfillment house or company.
"Advantages of outsourcing to such companies are: facilities (in early stages of business development you may have no place and money needed to store your items), shipping costs (because of special shipping rates when you ship thousands of items, which is not available for small companies), shipping materials costs (same reason as before), fulfillment costs (beneficial pricing when all fulfillment activities are bundled in one order), e-Commerce (fulfillment houses use advanced e-Commerce systems to help in management)."
On the other hand disadvantages of outsourcing are: indirect control (if there are any problems with services provided by the fulfillment company the blame and bad reputation will be on your company's shoulders) and product damage or shrinkage (fulfillment companies won't take full responsibility for any product damage or shrinkage until they're proven directly responsible).

Pinocchio (2022 live-action movie)
"Pinnochio is a 2022 American musical fantasy film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz. The film, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is a live-action adaptation of Walt Disney's 1940 animated film of the same name, which is itself based on the 1883 Italian book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"", by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Keegan-Michael Key in voice roles."
"""Pinocchio"" was released on September 8, 2022, by Disney+. The film received mixed reviews from critics."
Plot.
"A hobo cricket named Jiminy Cricket enters the home of an elderly woodcarver named Geppetto, accompanied by his pet kitten Figaro and pet fish Cleo, and finds that he has completed work on a marionette puppet he names Pinocchio. When Geppetto decides to retire for the night, he makes a wish on a star. A few hours later, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by the Blue Fairy, who tells Pinocchio that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy and she also appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong. When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed."
"After a few days, Geppetto decides that Pinocchio should attend school and sends him there. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by a con-artist fox and cat named ""Honest"" John and Gideon as they convince him that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when they really want to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for wealth. Jiminy, who finds Pinocchio with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces Pinocchio to continue going to school. Unfortunately Pinocchio is thrown out of school on account of being a puppet, so he decides to go to Stromboli's after all and Jiminy can't stop him when John places a glass jar over him."
"At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees Vitelli and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd as they throw their cash to him, but Stromboli locks Pinocchio in a bird cage to prevent him from ever leaving, wanting to exploit Pinocchio for all he's worth. Soon, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the keys to the lock on the cage by telling lies since that makes his nose grow. Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner."
"Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismatic Coachman, who is taking the kids to Pleasure Island, an isle where misbehavior is encouraged. When they reach the island, Pinocchio slowly gets disturbed by the amount of cruelty the kids commit, much to the bemusement of an unruly boy named Lampwick. When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the kids their get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a pool hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail."
"Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Vitelli and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and rendering Geppetto unconscious."
"Pinocchio thinks Geppetto has died, and despairs before Geppetto comes to and soon tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home as Pinocchio slowly transforms into a real boy. Jiminy then breaks the fourth wall before ending the film."

Itanium 9300 (Tukwila): 2010.
"The Itanium 9300 series processor, code-named ""Tukwila"", was released on February 8, 2010, with greater performance and memory amount."
"Tukwila uses a 65 nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24 MB CPU cache, Hyper-Threading technology and new memory controllers. It also has double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor bandwidth of 96 GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using QPI interfaces to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the ""Nehalem"" architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets."
"Tukwila incorporates four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 DIMMs via a separate memory controller,"
"similar to the Nehalem Xeon processor code-named ""Beckton""."
Itanium 9500 (Poulson): 2012.
"The Itanium 9500 series processor, code-named ""Poulson"", is the follow-on processor to Tukwila and was released on November 8, 2012."
"Intel says it skips the 45 nm process technology and uses the 32 nm process technology instead; it features 8 cores, has a 12-wide issue architecture, multi-threading additions, and new instructions for parallelism, including virtualization."
"The Poulson L3 cache size is 32 MB. L2 cache size is 6 MB, 512 I KB, 256 D KB per core. Poulson's size is 544 mm², less than Tukwila's size (698.75 mm²)."
"At ISSCC 2011, Intel presented a paper called, ""A 32nm 3.1 Billion Transistor 12-Wide-Issue Itanium Processor for Mission Critical Servers."""
"Given Intel's history of sharing details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson. Analyst David Kanter speculates that Poulson will use a new architecture, with a more advanced form of multi-threading that uses as many as two threads, to improve performance for single threaded and multi-threaded work."
New information was released at Hot Chips conference.
"The new information claims improvements in multithreading, reliability improvements (Instruction Replay RAS) and some new instructions (thread priority, integer instruction, cache pre-fetching, data access hints)."
"In Intel's Product Change Notification (PCN) 111456–01, it listed 4 models of Itanium 9500 series CPU, which were removed in a revised version of the document. The parts were later listed in Intel's Material Declaration Data Sheets (MDDS) database. Intel later posted Itanium 9500 reference manual."
The models are:
Market share.
"In comparison with its Xeon server processors, Itanium has never been a large product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007."
"According to Gartner Inc., the total number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% in the second quarter of 2008."
"According to an IDC analyst, in 2007, HP had about 80% of Itanium system revenue."
"According to Gartner, in 2008, HP had 95% of Itanium sales. HP's Itanium system sales were at $4.4 Billion at the end of 2008, and $3.5 Billion by the end of 2009,"
"compared to a 35% decline in UNIX system revenue for Sun and an 11% drop for IBM, with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14% during this period."
"In December 2012, IDC released a research report stating that Itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016, with annual shipment of 26,000 systems (a decline of over 50% compared to shipments in 2008)."
Hardware support.
Systems.
", only a few providers have Itanium systems, such as HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. Intel offers a chassis that can be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems."
"HP, the only one of the industry's top 4 server manufacturers to sell Itanium systems today, creating at least 80% of all Itanium systems. HP sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006."
"Most Itanium systems sold are enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about US $200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors."
Chipsets.
"The Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express."
"Currently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi."
"The ""Tukwila"" Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to ""evaluated for future implementation opportunities""."

"Fordtown, Tennessee"
"Fordtown is an unincorporated community in Sullivan County, Tennessee, United States, The community's name was adopted due to the number of people with the last name Ford, who lived in the area. It is accessed by the road named after it, Fordtown Road."
Orientalism
"Orientalism is an idea that the Eastern world and the Western world have opposite ways of thinking in terms of being and knowledge. It is often shown in the superiority of the West and the inferiority of the East. Edward Said was the first person to use the word this way in his 1978 book ""“Orientalism”"". He describes Orientalism as “a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and ‘the Occident’ ”. Before the term Orientalism was used by Said, it had a different meaning. In 1798, after Napoleon invaded Egypt, an era started. During this era, it was easier for European colonial powers to use their economic and political power over much of Asia and Africa. This allowed for more academic study of the East than before. This was called “the Oriental renaissance” in the 19th century. It had a large and broad effect on literature, art, and architecture in Europe."
"During the 19th and 20th centuries, the term Orientalism was used to describe the effects of the Orient’s influence on art, literature, and architecture fields. It was also used to label the academic study done by philologists (people who study the history of language) who were focused on the Oriental languages and the understanding of ancient Oriental texts. This knowledge was thought to be enough to understand Oriental civilizations. There was no interest to the day-to-day life of these Oriental communities and their heterogeneous customs and traditions."
"During the time of colonial power in the 19th and 20th centuries, the role of the Orientalist academic changed. The knowledge that was learned in this field of study was used to justify European colonialism over the Arab world."
"Orientalism in architecture, art, and literature."
"Beginning in the 19th century, the ""Oriental Renaissance"" influenced European culture in many ways. In the architectural field there are many different revivals in Europe. The Indo-Saracenic revival at the end of the 18th century, or the Egyptian revival, recreated buildings with motifs taken from the Indian subcontinent and Egypt."
"The “Oriental Renaissance” affected also the Romantic movement. In fact, romantic writers and artists showed a great interest in this Oriental rediscovery. A great example can be found in Flaubert’s (one of the most important French writer of the 19th century) novel Salammbò in 1862, where the Orient is depicted as something opposite of the Occident, eroticized and exoticized. Travelers’ accounts were very popular and contributed to form an imaginary vision of the Orient in the Western societies. Lord Byron, Victor Hugo, Nerval, Chateaubriand are some of the famous writers of the time that evoked exotic scenes and wild adventures by their accounts."
"During the 19th century, Orientalist painting movement also developed. The drawings of the French painters Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugene Delacroix, or the English painter William Holman Hunt are important examples of this movement. They depicted the East as something different, dangerous, wild, sexual, often because of their imagination and not because of the reality. For example, the French painter Ingres drew images of nude Oriental women using ancient Greek and Roman sculptures rather than real models. It would have been very difficult to persuade a woman in the Arab and Indian world to pose naked."
"No appointments have been made since the Partition of India in 1947. The last living knight, The Maharaja of Alwar, died in 2009 and the order became dormant."
"The motto of the Order is ""Heaven's light our guide"". The ""Star of India"", the emblem of the Order, also appeared on the flag of the Viceroy of India."
"The Order is the senior order of chivalry of the Empire of India; the junior order is The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, and there was also, for women only the Imperial Order of the Crown of India. It is the fifth-most-senior British order of chivalry, following The Most Noble Order of the Garter, The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, and The Most Honourable Order of the Bath."
History.
"After the Indian Mutiny the British government created a new order of knighthood to honour Indian Princes and Chiefs, as well as British officers and administrators who served in India. On 25 June 1861, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation creating ""The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India"" to ""reward conspicuous merit and loyalty"""
The first appointees were:
"The Order of the Indian Empire, founded in 1877, was intended to be a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India; consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"Appointments to the Orders relating to the British Empire in India ceased after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished and Elizabeth II succeeded her father George VI as Sovereign of the Orders when she ascended the throne in 1952. She remains Sovereign of the Order to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order:"
Composition.
"The British Sovereign was, and still is, Sovereign of the Order. The next-most senior member was the Grand Master; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. When the Order was established in 1861, there was only one class of Knights Companions, who bore the postnominals KSI. In 1866, however, it was expanded to three classes. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"", rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"", so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order. All those surviving members who had already been made Knights Companions of the Order were made Knights Grand Commanders."
"Former Viceroys and other high officials, as well as those who served in the Department of the Secretary of State for India for at least thirty years were eligible for appointment. Rulers of Indian Princely States were also eligible for appointment to the Order. Some states were of such importance that their rulers were almost always appointed Knights Grand Commanders; such rulers included the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, the Maharaja of Baroda, the Maharajas of Gwalior, the Nawab of Bhopal, the Maharaja of Indore, the Maharana of Udaipur, the Maharaja of Travancore, the Maharana of Jodhpur and the Maharao of Cutch."
"Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh of Benares was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1892, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) in 1898, and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) for his services in the First World War in the 1921 New Year Honours."
"Rulers of other nations in Asia and the Middle East, including the Emir of Kuwait, the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty, the Khedive of Egypt, the King of Bhutan and the rulers of Zanzibar, Bahrain and Oman were also appointed to the Order. Like some rulers of princely states, some rulers of particular prestige, for example the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty or the Sultans of Oman, were usually appointed Knights Grand Commanders."
"Women, who were not princely rulers, could not be members of the Order. They were, admitted as ""Knights"", rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies"". The first woman to be admitted to the Order was HH Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal; she was created a Knight Companion at the Order's foundation in 1861. The Order's statutes were specially amended to permit the admission of Queen Mary as a Knight Grand Commander in 1911."
Josh Hamilton
"Joshua Holt Hamilton (born May 21, 1981, in Raleigh, North Carolina) is an American professional baseball player who is currently a free agent. He has played for the Cincinnati Reds, Texas Rangers, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball (MLB). In the 2010 season he was named American League MVP. He chose to play for the Angels after they offered him a 5-year contract, worth $125 million."
"On April 27, 2015, the Angels traded Hamilton back to the Rangers."
Run batted in
"Runs batted in or RBI is a statistic used in baseball and softball to credit a batter when the outcome of his at bat results in a run being scored, except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play."
Major League Baseball Rules.
The official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 10.04:
Base on balls
"A base on balls (BB) is given to a batter and against a pitcher in baseball statistics when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls ""balls"". It is also known as a walk."
Intentional base on balls.
"Another version of base on balls is called intentional base on balls (IBB) or intentional walk. This is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls. As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without being able to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, usually done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a home run, sacrifice fly, or RBI base hit), or to set up a double play or force out situation for the next batter. They do carry an inherent risk, however, as they give the offensive team another runner on base, without any effort on their part, who could potentially score a run."
Martin St. Louis
"Martin St. Louis (; born June 18, 1975) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Tampa Bay Lightning and the New York Rangers as well as the HC Lausanne of the National League A (NLA)."
St. Louis played college hockey at the University of Vermont for the Catamounts where he also played on the same team as former Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas and former NHL player Éric Perrin. He has also played 2 seasons with the Calgary Flames and 13 seasons with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
"Though Belmont lobbied hard for it, Buchanan denied him the ambassadorship to Spain after his election in 1856, thanks to the Ostend Manifesto. As a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, Belmont supported Stephen A. Douglas, who subsequently named Belmont chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Belmont energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a War Democrat, helping Missouri congressman Francis P. Blair raise and equip the Union army's first mainly German-American regiment. Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the American civil war, stopping the Rothschilds and other bankers from lending to the Confederacy and meeting personally with the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, and members of Napoleon III’s government."
Postwar political career.
"Belmont stayed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the war, but he thought it was the worst ever time for the party. As early as 1862, Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the ""New York World"" in order to make it publish stories supporting the Democrats, with the help of Manton M. Marble, its editor-in-chief."
"The Republican party was divided at the war’s end, so Belmont organized new party gatherings and tried to get Salmon Chase elected president in 1868. He thought Chase was least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the party during the Republican Lincoln-Johnson administrations."
"Horatio Seymour’s became the democratic candidate instead, and lost to Ulysses S. Grant by a lot of Electoral College votes, although the popular vote was much closer. In 1872 the Democrats supported liberal Republican Horace Greeley's disastrous presidential campaign. The election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but he stayed interested in politics as a champion of US Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware for the presidency, and as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in 1877, and as an advocate of “hard money.”"
Death.
"Belmont died in New York in 1890. The ""Letters, Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont"" was published at New York in 1890. Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars. He is buried in Newport, Rhode Island."
"Belmont's sons were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, Perry Belmont, and August Belmont, Jr.."
August Belmont in culture.
"August Belmont threw lavish balls and dinner parties, receiving from New York's high society mixed reviews."
"He was an avid sportsman, and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honour. It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack, owned by Belmont's friend, Leonard Jerome. Today The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Racetrack in New York."
"Also named in Belmont's honor is the town of Belmont, New Hampshire, an honor Mr. Belmont never acknowledged. Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in ""The Age of Innocence"" on Belmont."
Ham mousseline à la Belmont was created in his honour by Charles Ranhofer at Delmonico's.
Parmigiana
"Parmigiana is a Southern Italian dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling, with cheese and tomato sauce on top, then baked. Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version. Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken parmigiana, are popular in other countries, usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants."
History.
"The dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily. While ""parmigiana"" means ""from Parma"" (in Northern Italy), the dish is not part of Parma food. It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana (alt. parmigiana di melanzane) or eggplant parmigiana (or eggplant Parmesan), a classic Southern Italian dish."
"Along with the many Italian versions, different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world, most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated. Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal (Veal Parmigiana) or chicken breast (Chicken Parmigiana) dipped in beaten eggs, breaded, shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce (red Sicilian tomato sauce) and mozzarella. It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown. The veal dish is known in Italian as ""Cotolette alla Bolognese""."
"""Parmigiana"" is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food, such as ""Trippa alla Parmigiana"" (Parma-style tripe)."
Cooking.
"The dish consists of a sliced filling pan fried in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese, and baked in an oven. In some kinds, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying. Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo, or a combination of these."
International variations.
"In the United States and Canada, veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich. It is also popular with a side of or on top of pasta. Diced onions or green bell peppers, sautéed or raw, are sometimes added."
"Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish, often served with chips and salad. It may also contain a lot of toppings, including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices. This dish is often referred to as a ""parma"" or ""parmi"", a simple shortening of the name. However, as Italian pronunciations are phonetic and do not use long vowel sounds, ""parma"" is incorrect."
"A similar dish, the Parmo, which uses either pork or chicken, has been made within the country of England."
Name.
"There are several theories for the origin of the name ""parmigiana""."
One common theory says the name is from Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese).
"Another theory says the name is an alteration of the Sicilian word ""parmiciana"":"
"This is an ancient Sicilian dish which, in all cookbooks, is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese, which is one of the ingredients. Nothing could be further from the truth. The name ""parmigiana"" does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word ""parmiciana"", which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish."""
"As with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, the word ""Parmigiana"" is often rendered as ""Parmesan"" in English-speaking countries, from the French word for ""from Parma."""
Absinthe spoon
"An absinthe spoon is simply a special spoon, placed over a glass of absinthe. There are holes in the spoon, over which a sugar cube is placed. Then, cold water is poured over the sugar to dilute and sweeten the absinthe."
Domain name
"A domain name is a human-readable web address (e.g. ""google.com"") that points to an IP address and helps users to access websites or other resources in a convenient way."
Extensions.
"""See main article: URL"""
"Domain names have extensions (called ""top-level domains"") at the end of the URL. For example "".com"", "".net"" and "".org"" are the most commonly used domain name extensions. The most popular domain extension is .com with more than 100 million domains registered. The .com extension stands for ""commercial"", .org for organization and .net for network."
"There are also country-specific domain name extensions. For example, the United Kingdom has the "".uk"" domain extension and Japan has "".jp""."
Edinburgh International Festival
"The Edinburgh International Festival is a festival of music, theatre, opera, dance, visual arts and literature that takes place every year in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Each year it is held for about three weeks in late August and early September."
"The festival started in 1947. A key person was Rudolf Bing, who was then the manager of the Glyndbourne Opera Festival. Bing was later General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1950 to 1972. He was naturalized as a British subject in 1946 and knighted in 1971. His idea was to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. Since 2014 the director of the festival has been Fergus Linehan."
"At first the Festival concentrated on classical music. Its later events were based on the traditional arts: classical music, ballet, sculpture and fine art. Since 1999 the permanent home of the festival is at The Hub, near Edinburgh Castle. Several large theatres, concert halls and churches in Edinburgh are used for the events, e.g. Usher Hall, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh Playhouse, The Queen's Hall and The Hub."
"About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at the same time as the Edinburgh Festival. The result is festivals with more than 2,500 performances and events per day in Edinburgh in August, many times bigger than the next biggest arts festivals anywhere in the world."
2020 is the only year the Festival has not been held. The reason was the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.
Edinburgh Festival Fringe
"The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the world’s largest arts festival. It started in 1947. It takes place every year at the same time as the Edinburgh International Festival: late August and early September. There are hundreds of different events. There are concerts, theatre, opera, and dance and many informal events."
"The organisers are the Festival Fringe Society: they publish a programme every year, sell tickets and give advice to performers from the Fringe office on the Royal Mile."
"The Edinburgh Festival itself is recognised to offer high-quality events. However, the Fringe events are variable, and entry has no real quality barriers. It is largely an open event where almost any theatrical or show event can be performed. Its lack of supervision means the shows are of unpredictable standard. All events have an entrance charge, which is reasonable because theatres do charge performers."
Ante Pavelić
"Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 ; Bradina,Austria-Hungary– 28 December 1959 ; Madrid,Spain) was the founding member of the Croatian national socialist/fascist Ustaše movement and terrorist organization in the 1930s. Later, during World War II, he will be the leader (""Poglavnik"" - Head) of the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany."
Early life.
"Ante Pavelić was born in Bradina, a small village roughly 15 kilometres south west of Hadžići in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then Austria-Hungary, although he draws his roots from southern Lika, in the small town of Krivi Put on the central part of the Velebit plain. His parents moved to Bosnia. As an adult, Ante Pavelić decided to move to Zagreb to study the law. An extremist even in his youth, he became a member of the organization known as the ""Frankovci"" whose founder, Dr. Josip Frank, was the father-in-law of Slavko Kvaternik, an Austro-Hungarian army officer. In 1919 he was the interim secretary of the Pure Party of Rights. In 1921 he was arrested along with several other members of the party but was released; he defended them at the trial and lost. Kvaternik had long been a strong advocate of Croat separatism and the German ideas on a separate Croat state found in him a ready tool."
"Pavelić's quarrelsome nature became more and more apparent in the years immediately after the first war when he became involved in one dispute after another with the Centralist Party and the Croat Peasant Party of Radić. He was the sole representative of his Party in the ""Skupština"" (Yugoslav Parliament) but rarely attended sessions and, when he did, he sulked in his seat and only occasionally indulged in a long harangue in protest against some measure which he did not approve."
1920s and 1930s.
"In the early 1920s, Pavelić began to establish his contacts with Croat émigrées in Vienna and Budapest and later entered into close accord with the Macedonian terrorist society IMRO. In 1927 he acted as counsel for the defense of the Macedonian terrorists at the Skopje trials."
"In 1927 he was elected to the Zagreb city council. He held the position of the party secretary in the Party of Rights until 1929 and the beginning of royal government in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Shortly after the proclamation of the establishment of the government Alexander I of Yugoslavia in January 1929, Pavelić fled abroad and was subsequently sentenced to death in absentia at Belgrade for his part in anti-Serb demonstrations organized at Sofia by Bulgarian and Macedonian terrorists. He then co-founded the Ustaše terrorist organization and went underground."
"Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy and Hungary, chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro in Italy and Janka Puszta in Hungary and an armed insurrection was attempted in 1933 when the Ustaše, armed by the Italians, attempted to invade the country by crossing the Adriatic sea in motorboats. This was unsuccessful but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Two attempts were made, the last one successful and Aleksandar was slain at Marseilles 9 October 1934 along with the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou."
"In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice."
"Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce."
"In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
"In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021."
Hydroxychloroquine.
"Some people think hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients."
"United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In early April, the ""New York Times"" reported that President Trump has ""a small personal financial interest"" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth."
"In early April, Fauci said, ""The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect."" Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems. Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis. Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk."
Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine. They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment. Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects. Both studies were published in May 2020.
Remdesivir.
"Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against some viruses. Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away."
"In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works."
"The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies."
"In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive."
Clayton Christensen
"Clayton Magleby Christensen (April 6, 1952January 23, 2020) was an American academic, businessman, and religious leader. He was the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School of Harvard University. He was best known for his theory of ""disruptive innovation"". His best known work is the 1997 book ""The Innovator's Dilemma""."
Christensen was also a co-founder of Rose Park Advisors.
"Christensen died on January 23, 2020 from leukemia treatment-related problems in Boston at the age of 67."

Wouter Bos
"Wouter Jacob Bos (born July 14, 1963) was a Dutch minister of finance, deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Dutch Labour Party. He won the election of Dutch Labour Party leader, defeating Jouke de Vries. He led the party until March 12, 2010, the day he left. His successor is Job Cohen, who used to be the mayor of Amsterdam. He left because he wanted to spend more time with his family."
"He left as minister of finance and deputy Prime Minister because the government felt over the decision of Uruzgan. The Dutch Labour Party was in the coalition, together with Christen Democraten Appèl and the ChristenUnie, both Christian parties. The Dutch Labour Party did not agree and stepped out of the coalition."
Hughes Medal
The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London for original discoveries in electricity and magnetism or their applications.
"The medal was first given to J.J. Thomson in 1902 ""for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases"". It has been awarded over a hundred times. At first it was awarded annually, now it is every two years."
"Unlike some other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same person more than once. Only one woman has won it: Michele Dougherty in 2008, who was awarded the medal ""for innovative use of magnetic field data that led to discovery of an atmosphere around one of Saturn's moons and the way it revolutionised our view of the role of planetary moons in the Solar System""."
"The medal has been awarded to more than one person at once; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton ""for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles"", in 1981 by Peter Higgs, Thomas Walter and Tom W. B. Kibble ""for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory"", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine for explaining the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which then led to the plate tectonic hypothesis, and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.J. Whelan for their work on the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy, and its use in the study of lattice defects in crystals."
J. J. Thomson
"Sir Joseph John ""J.J."" Thomson, OM, FRS (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel laureate. He discovered the electron and isotopes, and invented the mass spectrometer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. John Joseph Thomson in 1893 said: ""There is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity."""
"In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle of very small mass compared to its electric charge. It was later called the electron and was the first subatomic particle to be found. Thomson also found the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, while studying anode rays (positive cations)."
"In atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge, where an individual negatively charged electron resided. He later concluded there was more than one negatively charged particle in an atom."
Many of the young men who studied and worked with him at University of Cambridge also became famous physicists.
Johann Wilhelm Hittorf
"Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (March 27, 1824 – November 28, 1914) was a German physicist who was born in Bonn and died in Münster, Germany. He was the first to compute the electric capacity of charged atoms and molecules (ions)."

Gulf Air
Gulf Air is an airline based in the Middle East. They operate scheduled flights in the Middle East and international flights.
Terraforming
"Terraforming is changing a planet or large natural satellite that we cannot live on at present without spacesuits and similar technology. The idea is to change it so some life from Earth could exist there. It would need a suitable atmosphere (air), heat, and water. ""Paraterraforming"" or ""worldhousing"" is a variant of terraforming that would involve building domes over the majority of a planet or moon."
"Some think it is possible to terraform Mercury, Venus, Mars, Ceres, Pluto, our Moon, Titan, Callisto."
"It is arguable that we have already succeeded in terraforming right here on Earth. Thanks to modern technology, humans can now thrive in places that should be impossible to live in such as deserts and the Arctic."
"A related concept is paraterraforming or worldhousing which would involve constructing greenhouse-style geodesic domes and similar structures to cover most of, if not the entire surface of the planet or moon."
Reproduction.
"Most oomycetes produce two types of spores. The main dispersing spores are asexual, self-mobile spores called zoospores. These do chemotaxis toward a food source in surface water. A few oomycetes produce asexual spores that are distributed by wind. Oomycetes also produce sexual spores, called ""oospores"". These are translucent, double-walled, spherical structures which can survive harsh conditions."
Hurricane Helene (1958)
Hurricane Helene was one of the most powerful Atlantic storms of 1958. The storm's peak winds were 135 miles per hour. This hurricane moved north of the West Indies and brushed the United States' east coast. Helene was the only hurricane to affect the United States in 1958.
Garter snake
"The garter snake (""Thamnophis sirtalis"") is a Colubrid snake."
"It is common across North America between Alaska/Canada and Central America. It is the single most widely distributed genus of reptiles in North America. It is famous for its resistance to the poison produced by the rough-skinned newt. Garter snakes are actually venomous, just not to humans, since the amount of toxin in their saliva is too weak to really cause damage to a human. The worst they could do to you is musk on you or bite you and leave a harmless rash. In fact, cat bites are probably more serious than garter snake bites. They prey on rodents, small fish, small birds, salamanders, earthworms (not red wigglers, as they are bad for them) insects, and insect larva. They are attracted to water sources and hiding spots. You can identify a garter snake because almost every species has a stripe running down its back, the color varying and depending on the species, as there are many different species of garter snakes. They are incredibly common animals, settling in backyards and local woods. As you read this, there is probably at least one garter slithering in the nature-filled area behind you, whatever that may be. All snakes like to hide, and garters are no exception, even if they are incredibly common and small. They hide under leaves, trees, bricks and rocks stacked up, plants, sticks, and anything they can find. If you are trying to ""catch"" a garter, look for them under these places, and you just might find them. Like most snakes, female garters tend to be longer than the males, so that's one form of sexing them."

Danube Swabians
"The Danube Swabians are German settlers of the former Austria-Hungary Empire. They founded villages, and worked as farmers. Their ancestors were once settled from 1686 - 1829 by the order of the House of Habsburg in Hungary, and parts of former Yugoslavia and Romania who belonged to the Habsburger Monarchy, from different parts from Austria and Germany like Hesse, Bavaria, the Palatinate, Hunsrück, Baden-Württemberg, Swabian Jura Fulda (district), Rhön, Franconia, Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis, Swabia (Government Region), but also Alsace, Lorraine, Southern Netherlands and Luxembourg etc. The city Ulm at Alb-Donau-Kreis, in Swabian Jura, was the startpoint, where this German emigrants went with the ""Ulmer Schachtel"" (a small boat), along the Danube River, this is why they got the name ""Danube Swabians"". They speak different German dialects. They believed in Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism and hold much of the old Norse mythology. After World War II, most of the Danube Swabians were expelled by the order of the Potsdam Conference, to Allied-occupied Austria and Allied-occupied Germany. Only a few Danube Swabians live today in this country who once belongend to the Habsburger Monarchy. Most Danube Swabian descendants live in Austria and Germany, but also some in USA, Canada and Australia."
Stiffoller.
"The Germans from the Hochstift Fulda settled at 25 villages in the Baranya and in the city Pécs arround 1717 - 1804, this subgroup is named ""Stifolder"" or Stiffoller. An example of the ""Stifullerisch"" Danube Swabian German-dialect of Baranya: ""Mer rede noch die schwowisch Muddersprooch"","
DNA testing shows that Danube Swabians from Hungary are real descendants of Germans
Name.
"The first German settlers came via the Danube River 1686 - 1713, and was Swabians mostly from Black Forest in Wurttemberg and called by the Hungarian, Serbian, Croatian, and Romanian population as Svábok, Švabo, Şvabii. The German itself have said Donauschwowe"
The term Danube Swabians was ofically given in 1922.

"It is Disney's sixtieth animated movie. It was released through Disney+ on December 24, 2022 to strong positive reviews. It won a Golden Globe Award for best animated movie."
Plot.
"Forced by the Thousand Days War to flee her village in Colombia, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplets, which is to say her three twin children: Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. A miracle happens and her candle becomes magic, gets rid of the people chasing them, and creates a living house, the Casita, for them to live in, along with a magical village bordered by tall surrounding mountains— ""an ""encanto""."" The candle's magic gives ""Gifts"" to each Madrigal descendant, which they are to use to help the villagers. However, Bruno, who had the power of telling the future, disappeared aftee Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, did not get a gift, and ten years later Mirabel is still sad about not having one. Mirabel explains this with the song “The Family Madrigal”"
"On his fifth birthday, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, gets the ability to talk with animals, and the family takes a picture with him but leaves out Mirabel. Mirabel then sings a song wishing she were also special. (""Waiting on a Miracle""). Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering, but is ignored when the Casita seems fine to the others. After overhearing Alma praying, Mirabel decides to save the miracle's magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister, Luisa, who admits that she has a hard time dealing with all the work she has to do (""Surface Pressure"") then suggests that Bruno's room may hold clues to the mystery. There, Mirabel finds a cave and gets pieces of a slab of emerald. After Mirabel gets out, Luisa realizes that her gift is weakening. After her family reminds her of the reasons that Bruno is not to be talked about (""We Don't Talk About Bruno""), Mirabel rebuilds the slab and discovers it is an image of Mirabel standing in front of a broken Casita. Mirabel takes this to mean that she will destroy the family."
"Later that evening, Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela, who can make plants and flowers grow at whenever she wants, is supposed to become engaged to their neighbour Mariano Guzmán. But then, Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores, who has superhearing, lets everyone know that she overheard Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. The Casita begins to crack again, causing everyone's powers to go out of control, ruining the night and Mariano's proposal when Pepa accidentally starts a rainstorm. As everyone runs, Mirabel follows a group of rats and finds a secret passage behind a portrait. There she meets Bruno, who tells that his vision of Mirabel would have gotten her in trouble with the family so he broke the vision and went into hiding to protect her, hiding himself inside the house's walls so he could still be near them. Bruno tells her that the vision could change, meaning that Mirabel would either destroy the Madrigal family or fix it. At Mirabel's urging, he reluctantly conjures another vision. At first, it goes the same way as the last one, with Mirabel still standing in front of a broken Casita. But a golden butterfly appears, and the vision changes into an image of Mirabel hugging a young woman, who seems to be Isabela."
"Mirabel apologizes to Isabela but accidentally gets her to admit that she does not want to marry Mariano and actually hates having to be perfect. Then Isabella creates a cactus and wonders if she should grow whatever plants she feels like growing. (""What Else Can I Do?""). After the song, they hug, fixing the candle and the cracks. But, Alma sees the two of them, with Isabela growing whatever she wants, and accuses Mirabel of causing the family's problems out of jealousy for not having a Gift. Mirabel blames Alma for the immense pressure she puts on the family. Their rising argument weakens the candle again and creates a wikt:fissure that splits a nearby mountain and destroys the Casita. Despite Mirabel's trying to save it, the candle dies in her hands, leaving all the Madrigals powerless. While the family and several locals look at the damage, Mirabel feels guilty and leaves the town."
"After a few hours of fruitless search, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel back at the river where Pedro died. She explains how, in her determination to preserve the magic, she ignored the toll it took on her family and finally takes responsibility for what happened (""Dos Oruguitas""). After hearing Alma's tragic backstory, Mirabel tells her that despite her flaws, she is the one who brought and protected the family together all these years. After a golden butterfly appears, they reconcile, and Bruno appears and confronts Alma to defend Mirabel, unexpectedly cheering her up with his return. They reunite with the Madrigals, and the townspeople arrive to help them rebuild the Casita (""All of You""). When the house is rebuilt, the Madrigals give Mirabel a gleaming doorknob with an M on it. When she places it in the front door, the magic springs back to life, restoring the Casita and all the family's Gifts and spreading through the village. The Madrigals pose for another family picture, this time with Mirabel and Bruno included."

"These stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as a ""vital antislavery tool."" This change in the way people looked at ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in an essay by James Baldwin. This essay was titled ""Everybody’s Protest Novel."" In the essay, Baldwin called ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" a ""very bad novel"". He said it was not well-written."
"In the 1960s and '70s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements strongly criticized the book. They said that the character of Uncle Tom was a part of ""race betrayal"". They said that Tom made slaves look worse than slave owners. Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time."
"However, people such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have begun studying ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" again. He says that the book is a ""central document in American race relations and a significant (important) moral and political exploration of the character of those relations."""

National Autonomous University of Mexico
"The National Autonomous University of México (UNAM) a university in Mexico City. It is one of the biggest universities in Mexico and Latin America. UNAM was started on 22 September 1910 by Justo Sierra.UNAM's main campus in Mexico City, known as ""Ciudad Universitaria"" (University City), is a UNESCO World Heritage site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the 20th century. Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. In 2016, it had an acceptance rate of only 8%. UNAM generates a number of strong research publications and patents in diverse areas, such as robotics, computer science, mathematics, physics, human-computer interaction, history, philosophy, among others. All Mexican Nobel laureates are either alumni or faculty of UNAM."

Health care
"Health care or healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illnesses through services offered by the health profession and its staff. Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments, medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security."
Primary care.
"A primary care doctor (PCD) or primary care physician (PCP) is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered."
Culture of health.
"In 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term ″Culture of Health″, which has become widespread. The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health. Holism is the idea that natural systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts."
"According to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts—the concept of ″culture″ and the concept of ″health″. This is their synthesis, which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science, that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life. Thus, Skumin argues that the culture of health is a separate science, that creates new content. The main challenge of culture of health is the development of spiritual, mental and physical capabilities of man."
"In 1994, Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) — International social movement ""To Health via Culture""."

Kwanzaa
"Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture. People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles) and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is ""Joyous Kwanzaa""."
History and name of the holiday.
Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.
"The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase ""matunda ya kwanza"", meaning first fruits of the harvest."
"During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 ""Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture"", ""Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."""
Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.
Principles and symbols.
"Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ""Nguzo Saba"" (originally ""Nguzu Saba""—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this ""is a communitarian African philosophy,"" . It consists of what Karenga called ""the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world."" These seven principles comprise ""Kawaida"", a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:"
"Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles."
"During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (""a shared cup""), ""Kikombe cha Umoja"", passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is ""Habari Gani?"" which is Swahili for ""What's the News?"""
"Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry."
Interventional Radiology
"Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on."
"Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases."
Chess Olympiad
"Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams. They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation, FIDE. Since 1950, they have been run every two years. Earlier events were all-play-all. Then, as numbers grew, a system of qualifying sections were used. In recent times, the format has been a Swiss system. This, in chess terms, is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores. It has been widely used for individual tournaments."
Recognised sport.
Chess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee with FIDE being the recognized International Sports Federation for chess since June 1999.
"As a member of the International Olympic Committee, FIDE adheres to its rules, including controversially having doping tests. The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the ""Chess Olympiad"" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games."
The next Chess Olympiad will be held in 2014 in Norway.

Disneyland Resort
"Disneyland Resort is a recreational resort in Anaheim, California. The resort is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks and Resorts division and is home to two theme parks, three hotels and a shopping, dining, and entertainment area."
"The area now known as the Disneyland Resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s and for over 40 years was known simply as ""Disneyland"". When it opened to guests in 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its parking lot, and a hotel known as the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather."
"After doing well with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney decided to do the same thing in Anaheim and bought a lot of land next to Disneyland. This included buying the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather company as well as the Pan Pacific Hotel from its Japanese owners. Disney renamed the Pan Pacific Hotel to the ""Disneyland Pacific Hotel"". After its first publicly known proposal for a second theme park in Anaheim was scrapped, construction began in 1998 on a theme park called Disney's California Adventure Park; a hotel called Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, a renovation, renaming, and re-theming of the Disneyland Pacific Hotel; and an admission-free shopping and dining area called Downtown Disney. During the expansion, the name ""Disneyland Resort"" was coined to refer to the entire Disney complex, while ""Disneyland Park"" was coined to refer to the original theme park."
Location.
"The Disneyland Resort is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, near the border of neighboring Garden Grove. The resort is bordered by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north. Interstate 5 borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner."
"Not all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north-south route and provides access to the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney."
Special offramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit easy access into and out of the Mickey &amp; Friends parking garage during peak morning and evening traffic times. The official address of the resort is 1313 South Harbor Boulevard.
Tablet computer
"A tablet computer (sometimes called a tablet) is a type of computer that can be carried easily. Unlike a laptop it has no physical keyboard or trackpad, though users sometimes add those things. Users control a tablet mostly by using its touchscreen with multi-touch technology similar to a smartphone. The screen can be anywhere from (sometimes called a phablet) to in size, but many have a screen size of about diagonal."
"Almost all tablet computers can access the Internet using Wi-Fi, and many can use mobile phone networks like 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Like smartphones, many tablets have sensors such as a camera and a microphone. Other features tablets have are high definition, anti-glare (with less reflection) displays, a Bluetooth radio (to connect to printers and other devices), flash memory, and cloud storage services to back up information on the tablet and synchronize data."
"Science fiction started putting tablets in stories after the middle 20th century. Some companies started making real tablets late in the century. The release of the Apple iPad in 2010 got much attention, and other companies made and sold more."
Advantages and disadvantages.
"Compared to laptop computers, tablets are lighter, more portable, have longer battery life, make less heat, and do not need a mouse or keyboard to be connected. Typing is usually done on the touch screen with a ""virtual"" keyboard which appears on the screen. Many tablets let the user to get reminders even when the tablet is powered off or on standby"
"One bad thing is that the ""virtual"" keyboards are sometimes slow and easy to make typos on. Some tablets can connect to computer keyboards and computer mice to let the user use them in ways similar to a PC. Tablets often have limited storage compared to a laptop."
"The majority run a mobile operating system and may not support as many file formats and different types of software as laptops, but they may work with the same kinds of mobile apps that smartphones use. These weaknesses sometimes result in a tablet being used mainly to consume media made by someone else who used a full-service computer."
Spanish Data Protection Agency
"The Spanish Data Protection Agency (, AEPD) is the national data protection authority from the Kingdom of Spain. It is an agency dependant of the Spanish Ministry of Justice that was created in 1993. It is tasked with protecting Spanish people's privacy."
"This agency ensures compliance of the Organic Law 3/2018 as of December regarding the protection of personal data and digital rights () and the General Data Protection Regulation. It is located in Madrid and it has the power to act in all the Kingdom. Currently the director of the agency is ""Mar España Martín"", and previously ""José Luis Rodríguez Álvarez"" and ""Artemi Rallo Lombarte""."
The Spanish Data Protection Agency is a public law entity with legal personality. It has full public and private capacity to act independently of public administration in the exercise of their functions. It ensures that the titulars of the files that contains personal information strictly follows the data protection legislation.
Moe Howard
"Moe Howard (June 19, 1897 –- May 4, 1975) was an American actor and comedian."
Career.
"Born in New York, U.S., he began his acting career in theater with Ted Healy. The filmed his first short film with Ted Healy Soup to Nuts (1930). Ted Healy and his Stooges, was a comedy group featuring Ted and Moe more Moe's brother Shemp Howard, Larry Fine and Fred Sanborn. Shemp leaving the group was replaced by the younger brother of Moe Curly Howard. After shooting several shorts for MGM, the group disbanded in 1934."
"The beginning of The Three Stooges debut was in 1934 with the short film for Columbia Woman Haters (1934). The Three Stooges, 190 short films shot between 1934 and 1958"
"In the late 50's and early 60s, The Three Stooges began making films as Have Rocket — Will Travel (1959), The Three Stooges in Orbit 1962."
"Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar [under pseudonym L. von Südland] The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. This racist work was reprinted in 1990. In the preface to this reprint edition, Dr. Vladimir Veselica, a Zagreb University professor, expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given ""relevant answers"" at the highest intellectual level. What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs. It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book, which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs: "" it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition, how a bent for conspiracies, revolutions and coups is in their blood."""
Oligosaccharide
"An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars. Oligosacchardides are carbohydrates. When they are hydrolized, oligosaccharides give 3 to 10 monosaccharides."
"Oligosacharides are formed when 3 to 10 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 3 to 10 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides."
Think tank
"A think tank is a special organization which helps other organizations and groups with problems they do not know how to solve. They do this by providing data or knowledge, and by discussing the options in detail. They get their information by doing research, and by collecting ideas and data from a wide range of sources."
Origins.
"The first think tank was the British Royal United Services Institute (1831), though of course the term ""think tank"" is much later, post World War II. Non-government institutions in the United States started early in the 20th century. The Arthur D. Little consultancy, incorporated in 1909, pioneered the idea of contracted professional services. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was founded in 1910. The Institute for Government Research, which later merged into the Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution (1919), and Chatham House in London (1920). The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934) and the Committee for Economic Development (1943)."
The cold war era.
"Think tanks of the modern kind started after the Second World War, in the cold war era. The RAND Corporation was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company, and was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&amp;D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. The RAND used the same operations research (O.R.) methods which scientists had developed during the war. This was the application of knowledge, scientific methods and thinking to solve the new problems posed by the war. After the war, the RAND used very similar techniques, mostly based on the hard sciences like maths, physics and economics. It was and still is funded mainly by the American government."
"The cold war period raised the question of how the American government might handle nuclear weapons in bargaining and negotiating with the Soviet Union. This was the speciality of Herman Kahn, a RAND staff member who set up his own think tank in 1961, called the Hudson Institute. His publications on how to think about these issues, and those of Thomas Schelling, were landmarks in the post-war history of negotiating strategy."
Modern period.
"More recently, think tanks have specialised into particular areas of interest, such as foreign policy. Many have become advocates for political interests, doing research which can be used by public relations and lobbying groups."
Solar calendar
"A solar calendar shows the earth's position compared to the sun. There are tropical solar calendars, sidereal solar calendars, non-solar calendars (like lunar - moon - calendars), and lunisolar calendars."
Major League Baseball on FOX
"Fox Major League Baseball (shortened as Fox MLB and MLB on FS1) is FOX Sports's broadcast of Major League Baseball. It began on June 1, 1996 and continue through at least 2021."
Early Years: 1996-2000.
"Major League Baseball made a deal with FOX and NBC on November 7, 1995. FOX televised regular season games (about 16 weekly telecasts normally beginning on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons, selected Division Series games, and alternated the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series with NBC each year. To better state this, FOX aired the All-Star Game aired American League Championship Series in odd-numbered years while airing the National League Championship Series and World Series in even-numbered years."
Exclusivity: 2001-2006.
"In September 2000, Major League Baseball and FOX signed a 6-year contract to air Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games, and exclusive coverage of the League Championship Series and the World Series."
New Contract: 2007-2021.
"Rumors about the end of ""Major League Baseball on FOX"" were laid to rest on July 11, 2006 when the network announced they would still air the World Series through the 2013 season. It was announced on October 17, 2006 that FOX would retain the All-Star Game and World Series, except they would air the regular season beginning with the first Saturday of the regular season, and postseason coverage beyond the World Series was limited to one League Championship Series a year, alternating one for the other with TBS each year, airing the other LCS."
National League Championship Series
"In Major League Baseball, the National League Championship Series (NLCS), played in October, is a playoff round that decides the winner of the National League pennant. The winner of the series moves on to play the winner of the American League Championship Series in baseball's championship, the World Series."
History.
"In 1969, the LCS began play as the leagues were expanded to two divisions. Initially, it was a best-of-five series. In 1985, it became best-of-seven. Since 1995, the two winners from the National League Division Series advance to the NLCS."
"The term is also used when replying to a communication that contains a number of points, issues or questions to show that the responses are in the same order in which they were raised in the original document: ""To deal with your queries seriatim..."""
In the United States.
"During the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Marshall, 1801 to 1835, the practice of judicial opinions being delivered in seriatim was discontinued."
"In 2009, Title III, Rule 15(a)(1) of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding Amended and Supplemental Pleadings (part of pretrial procedure) was amended to allow three changes in the time previously allowed to make one change."
"This provision will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion... and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised ""seriatim""."
The right to make changes now ends 21 days after service of a motion.
Memorandum opinion
"In law, a memorandum opinion is usually an unpublished legal opinion that cannot be cited as precedent. It is formally defined as: ""[1] unanimous appellate opinion that succinctly states the decision of the court; an opinion that briefly reports the court's conclusion, usu. without elaboration because the decision follows a well-established legal principle or does not relate to any point of law."" There is no elaboration or explanation because the decision either follows a well-known legal principle or it does not relate to a point of law. A memorandum opinion is also not subject to appeal."
"Generally, memorandum opinions follow ordinary rules, including the application of precedent and the rule of ""stare decisis""."
Per curiam decision
"In law, a ""per curiam"" decision (or opinion) is a ruling issued by an appellate court in which the decision rendered is made by the court (or at least, a majority of the court) acting collectively and unanimously. In contrast to regular opinions, a ""per curiam"" does not list the individual judge responsible for authoring the decision, but minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed."
"""Per curiams"" are not the only type of decision that can reflect the opinion of the court. Other types of decisions can also reflect the opinion of the entire court, such as unanimous decisions, in which the opinion of the court is expressed with an author listed. The Latin term ""per curiam"" literally means ""by the court""."
United States.
Federal.
"The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are usually not ""per curiam"". Their decisions more commonly take the form of one or more opinions signed by individual justices which are then joined in by other justices. Unanimous and signed opinions are not considered ""per curiam"" decisions, as only the court can officially designate opinions as ""per curiam"". ""Per curiam"" decisions tend to be brief in length. The designation is stated at the beginning of the opinion."
"The notable exception to the usual characteristics for a ""per curiam"" decision is the case of ""Bush v. Gore"". Although it was per curiam, there were multiple concurrences and dissents."
State.
"The Supreme Court of California occasionally releases decisions in the name of ""The Court"". But these are not necessarily unanimous. Sometimes an opinion in the name of the Court may be accompanied by extensive concurring and dissenting opinions."
Canada.
"The Supreme Court of Canada also attributes some decisions to ""The Court"" but does not use the phrase ""per curiam"". In the U.S. the term is used primarily for uncontroversial cases. In Canada, however, it has been used for important and controversial cases to emphasize that the entire Court is speaking with a single voice."
Anita Brookner
"Anita Brookner, CBE (16 July 1928 – 10 March 2016) was a British award-winning novelist and art historian. She was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge from 1967 to 1968. She was the first woman to hold this visiting professorship. She was awarded the 1984 Man Booker Prize for her novel ""Hotel du Lac""."
John W. Cahn
"John Werner Cahn (January 9, 1928 – March 14, 2016) was an American scientist and recipient of the 1998 National Medal of Science."
"He was a professor in the department of Materials Science at MIT from 1964 to 1978. Since 1977, he has held a position at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly the National Bureau of Standards, NBS).Cahn has applied the basic laws of thermodynamics to describe and predict a wide range of physical phenomena."
Tamara Grigsby
"Tamara D. Grigsby (November 19, 1974 – March 15, 2016) was an American social worker. She was a university professor from Wisconsin. She served as a Democratic Party member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 18th Assembly District, from 2005 until 2013."
formula_3
"Where formula_4 is the operator of formula_5 and formula_6. This law also gives rise to an uncertainty between energy and time, which can be expressed in the same way as the relation between momentum and position."
Probability waves.
"Another important fact of quantum mechanics is that the electron behaves in a very weird way. At first, no one really knew what the wavefunction meant physically. Max Born, a theoretical physicist, explained that the wavefunction is a ""probability wave."" In other words, wherever the wave is denser, that is where the particle is most likely found, but it won't necessarily be found there. The way to find the probability"
(formula_7) of the position of the particle in the region formula_8
"For example, if formula_7 is equal to .5, then there is a 50% chance of finding the particle within that region. This shows us that the location of a particle is probabilistic; one can never say that the particle will ""definitely"" be found at a certain point in space, but rather, one can only give the probability of finding the particle within that region."
Copenhagen interpretation.
"The most well-accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics and the most boring one is the idea called Copenhagen interpretation. This interpretation builds upon the probability-wave notion, but brings in a radical new idea called the superposition principle. The best way to explain this principle is by showing it mathematically. If the functions formula_10 are solutions of the Schrödinger equation, then the superposition of those wavefunctions is also a solution. i.e.,"
formula_11
"Where formula_12 is the superposition of the various wavefunctions. This idea implies that a particle occupies every possible wavefunction it can. This implies that a particle occupies more than one position ""at the same time."" In other words, a particle exists in at least two different positions simultaneously. When an observer comes and actually measures the position of the particle, something called the wavefunction collapse occurs. So when someone observes the particle, the following happens:"
formula_13→formula_14
"In simple terms: when there is no observation or observer, then a particle occupies many positions simultaneously; when an observation takes place, the wavefunction collapses and the particle exists only in one position."
Many-worlds interpretation.
"The many-worlds interpretation is by far the most fantastic interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation says that rather than the wavefunction collapsing, each possibility actually occurs, but in separate universes. This means that the universes branch off for each possibility. Also it says that you can live forever according to quantum suicide."
Quantum determinism.
"The interpretation presented by Albert Einstein himself, states that the outcome of some random event is predetermined. So, rather than a particle existing as a probability wave, this interpretation says that the particle exists only in one position, but we just perceive it to be a probability. This idea is much less popular, but nonetheless mentionable."
Which one is right?
"So, of the three main interpretations of quantum mechanics, which one is correct? Physicists seem to think that the Copenhagen interpretation is the most likely, but no one is for sure."
Planck's law
"Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature ""T"". The law is named after Max Planck, who proposed it in 1900. It is a pioneering result of modern physics and quantum theory."
"Kure, Hiroshima"
is a Japanese city in Hiroshima Prefecture on the island of Honshu.
History.
"In 1894, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi transfered the Imperial Headquarters (""Daihon'ei"") to Kure."
The modern city of Kure was founded in 1902.

History.
"Léon Walras (16 December 1834-5 January 1910) was a French economist. He started what is known as Lausanne school, or Marginalism today. He looked at market equlibrium. He started general equilibrium theory. For this, he looked at marginal utility: This is the added benefit of consuming another unit of an economic good. His thoughts are very important for Neoclassical econmics. In general equilibrium theory, he looked at a scenario, where there are (an unspecified, large) number of households and companies, who act on several markets: He postulated that what is true in one market, in equilibrium must be true for all of them: There is a system of price determination that has the property that supply and demand match on all markets. Abraham Wald could prove this hhypothesis only much later. Today, it is part of the Arrow–Debreu model."
Hawaiian Kingdom
"The Hawaiian Kingdom, or Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, was a sovereign state located in the Hawaiian Islands."
Establishment.
"The country was formed in 1795, when the warrior chief Kamehameha the Great, of the independent island of Hawaiʻi, conquered the independent islands of Oʻahu, Maui, Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi and unified them under one government. In 1810, the whole Hawaiian archipelago became unified when Kauaʻi and Niʻihau joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the House of Kamehameha and the House of Kalākaua."
Recognition.
"Major European powers recognised the country. The United States became its chief trading partner and watched over it to prevent some other power (such as Britain or Japan) from threatening to seize control. Hawaiʻi was forced to adopt a new constitution in 1887. King Kalākaua signed it, because the Honolulu Rifles, an anti-monarchist militia, thratened him. Queen Liliʻuokalani, who succeeded Kalākaua in 1891, tried to replace the 1887 constitution with a new one. She was but was overthrown in 1893, largely at the hands of the Committee of Safety, a group of residents consisting of Hawaiian subjects and foreign nationals of American, British and German descent, many of whom had been educated in the US, had lived there for a time. Hawaiʻi was an independent republic until the U.S. annexed it through the Newlands Resolution, on July 4, 1898. This created the Territory of Hawaii. United States Public Law 103-150 adopted in 1993 (informally known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that ""the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States"" and also ""that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum."""

Religious experience
"Sometimes people make experiences which they see in the context of a belief system. They call these experiences religious experiences, spiritual experiences, sacred experiences, or mystical experiences. William James made the concept popular, in the 19th century. He did this to fight the growing rationalism of Western society."
"In many religions, such experieces are called revelations. This also applies to the knowledge that comes from them. These religions say that a god or gods caused these revelations, and that they are not a result of a natural cause. They are considered real encounters with God or gods, or real contact with higher-order realities of which humans are not ordinarily aware."
"Skeptics say that these religious experiences are a normal feature of the human brain. As such, they can be studied in the same way other features of the brain are studied. To better be able to study them, scholars have classified such experiences in different ways."
Definitions.
"Psychologist and philosopher William James described four characteristics of mystical experience in ""The Varieties of Religious Experience."" According to James, such an experience is:"
History.
Origins.
"The notion of ""religious experience"" can be traced back to William James. He used the term ""religious experience"" in his book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"". It is considered to be the classic work in the field. At professional conferences, people often cite this book. James makes a difference between institutional religion and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization, and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has mystical experience, can be experienced regardless of the culture."
"The term has been used before James, though. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures said that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. Many of these views had a lot of influence. Kant said that moral experience justified religious beliefs. John Wesley also thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were a basis to religious commitment as a way of life."
Criticism.

Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)
"The Symphony No. 94 in G major is a symphony by Joseph Haydn. It was first performed in London on 23 March 1792 under Haydn's direction. It is nicknamed the Surprise Symphony. The symphony's nickname is derived from the sudden loud chord played by the entire orchestra in the second movement. This movement is a set of variations on a sweet, gentle theme. The chord was Haydn's afterthought; it does not appear in the manuscript. One theory suggests Haydn inserted this loud chord saying, ""That will make the ladies jump!"". Another theory suggests he inserted it to wake up the music lovers who had dozed off after their dinners and drinks. Another theory suggests he inserted it to make the symphony memorable in light of the competition he faced from a series of London concerts directed by Ignaz Pleyel."

"The modern history of Bahrain begins with Great Britain exploring the area, trying to keep Iran from taking more land. The British gave support to the Al-Khalifa family, who made a power base in the island and allied with the British to keep the island from Iran. The British got free passage to the Persian Gulf through this agreement. In November of 1957, the Iranian parliament declared that Bahrain was the Fourteenth Province of Iran. Later the British would become involved in the politics of Bahrain by choosing an Emir of the island. Iran and Britain later agreed that the United Nations Secretary General would judge the political situation in Bahrain. In a Plebiscite to decide the country's future, the majority of the people of Bahrain chose to reject Iran's claims, and to define their country and their culture to be Arabic, and not Persian."
"Oil was found in the early 20th century and brought modern improvements to the country. Relations with the United Kingdom also became closer, and the British brought more military bases to the nation. British influence grew, until Charles Belgrave became an advisor; Belgrave brought modern education to Bahrain."
"After World War II, anti-British feeling spread through the Arab world and led to riots in Bahrain. The British left Bahrain in 1971, making it an independent country. The sales of more oil in the 1980s brought money to Bahrain, but even when the sales of oil decreased in later years, it did not cause as many problems in Bahrain as in other oil countries, because the economy of Bahrain had grown into other areas."
In 1973 the election of first parliament was done but the government stopped &amp; dissociate the parliament in 1975 which result in strong protests by the Bahraini opposition (Moderate Islamic &amp; non-Islamist opposition).
"In 1994, many highly educated Bahraini people signed a letter to Prince of Bahrain at that time Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa"
to re-establish the parliament life which is strongly refused &amp; the leader of the opposition at that time Sheikh Abdulamir Aljamri was jailed then a huge protest &amp; conflicts occurs between Bahraini nation &amp; the armed forces.
"In 1999, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa followed his father as head of state and called for elections for parliament to resolve the congestion that occurred over that last period. The women were given the right to vote and the new ruler released all political prisoners in 2001."
In 2002 the King released a new constitution without any voting from the nation &amp; canceled 1973 constitution which caused strong refuse from the most of nation parties &amp; opposition.
"The situations became worse later &amp; some of political activists were jailed like Abdulhadi Al-Khuwajah, Hasan Mushaima."
Many political websites that refused these changes were blocked like Bahrain online forum (the most popular website in Bahrain): www.bahrainonline.org Until 2009 there were many riots &amp; conflicts especially from Shia group which faces a huge organized discrimination according to Human Rights Watch &amp; US Congress.
Politics.
"Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the King, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The head of government is the Prime Minister, which is currently held by Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa was the country's first prime minister from 1971 until his death in 2020. The prime minister has a cabinet of 15 members."
"Bahrain has a bicameral legislature with a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, elected by all of the people and the upper house, the Shura Council, appointed by the King. Both houses have forty members. The first elections were held in 2002, with Members of Parliament serving four year terms."
"Women were given the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in 2002's election, but no women were elected to office that year, and Shia and Sunni Islamists won a majority of seats. Because no women were elected, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes members of the Kingdom’s Jewish and Christian people."
The King recently created the Supreme Judicial Council to organise the country's courts and the government offices.
Governorates.
"Bahrain is split into five governorates. Until July 3 2003, it was divided into twelve municipalities."
"For further information, see: Decree-Law establishing governorates from the Bahrain official website."
Cities.
The largest cities in Bahrain are:
"Other towns include: Awali, Diraz, Hidd, Sar, Bani Jamrah."
Economy.
"In Bahrain, petroleum (oil product) producing and processing is about 60% of the money from export, 60% of government money, and 30% of Gross Domestic Product. The economy has changed as the sales of oil have changed since 1985, for example, during and after the Persian Gulf War of 1990 - 1991. Bahrain has high quality communications and transport, and so the country is home to many international companies with business in the Persian Gulf. A large part of the country's income comes from petroleum products made from imported crude oil. There are several major industrial projects being built. Unemployment, especially among young people, and the decrease of both oil and water resources are major economic problems."
Geography.
"Bahrain is a flat and dry archipelago, with a low desert plain rising gently to a low central hill, in the Arabian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia. The highest point is the 122 meter Jabal ad Dukhan (""Mountain of Smoke"")."
"Bahrain has a total area of 620 km², which is a few square kilometres larger than the Isle of Man. As an archipelago of 33 islands, Bahrain does not share a land border with any other country, but it does have a 161 km coast line and claims a further 12 nm of territorial sea and a 24 nm contiguous zone. Bahrain enjoys mild winters and has very hot, humid summers."
"Bahrain's natural resources include large amounts of oil natural gas as well as fish. Only 1% of the country includes land where crops can be grown. 92% of Bahrain is desert, and droughts and dust storms are the main natural dangers."
"Environmental problems in Bahrain include desertification, which is causing the land where crops can be grown to decrease, and damage to coast lines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation caused by oil spills from large tankers and oil refineries."
About the people.
"The official religion of Bahrain is Islam; most of the people are Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, but there are also small Jewish and Christian minorities. Most Bahrainis are Arabs, although some tribes came from Persia. Today, many of the people in Bahrain are guest workers who come from Iran, South Asia and Southeast Asia. A ""Financial Times"" article from 31 May 1983 found that ""Bahrain is a polyglot (speaking many languages) state, both religiously and racially. Leaving aside the temporary immigrants of the past 10 years, there are at least eight or nine communities (groups of people) on the island""."
"The present communities may be classified as Al-Khalifa, Arab tribes allied to Al-Khalifa, the Baharnah (Shia Arabs), the Howilla (Sunni Arabs from Persia), Sunni Arabs (from the mainland), Ajam (Persian Shia), Indians who traded with Bahrain and settled before the age of oil (used to be called Banyan), a tiny Jewish community, and a group which contains everyone else."
Culture.
Japanese Karayuki san prostitutes spearheaded Japan's economic advance into Southeast Asian regions ilke Singapore in the late 19th century.
Japanese karayuki san prostitutes were sent to Australia.
The Japanese Murata rifle was based on the French Gras rifle.
"Many Japanese buildings, products and planes were copies of western ones like the Tokyo dome of 1988 which copied the 1981 Metrodome, the Japanese DSK A 25 in 1954 which copied the BMW's R 25 of 1951, the Japanese zero fighter of 1939 which copied the Gloster F.5/34 of 1937 and the Toshiba vacuum cleaner of 1931 which copied GE's electric cleaner of 1928 and Seiki's Nippon camera of 1941 which copied Leica Illa's camera of 1935 and Shigeru Mizuki's rocketman in 1958 which copied DC Comics superman of 1938. The ""Japanese"" military planes Kawasaki Ki-5, Kawasaki Army Type 92 and Kawasaki Army Type 88 were designed by aircraft engineer Richard Vogt, a German."
"Indigenously designed military aircraft in China during the war against Japan included the Kwangsi type 3, Chu XP-0 and Zhong 28-Qia while Russian American Zakharchenko designed Zhong 28-B and FuHsing AP-1 (Fuxing AP-1)."
"The Japanese let volunteers from Okinawa into their army since 1890 and in 1898 Okinawa was given universal military conscription and were parts of all arms of the Japanese military, unlike Koreans where there was no conscription until the very last year of World War II since the Japanese did not trust Koreans unlike Okinawans. Taiwanese were also distrusted by the Japanese, with volunteers from Taiwan only allowed in 1942 and conscription only implemented in 1945."
Wars with China and Russia.
"At the end of the 19th century, many Japanese believed that Japan needed to expand in order to face Western foreign powers. This resulted in wars with its neighboring counties. In 1894-1895, Japan and China had a war. Another war took place with Russia in 1904-1905. Japan became a world power after these wars. Russian influence continued to grow inside China."
Anglo-Japanese Alliance.
"By the beginning of the 20th century, Russian influence was increasing in China. Japan and the United Kingdom used to get economic and other benefits from their relationship with China. Japan and the United Kingdom did not like Russia’s growing influence in China. Japan and the United Kingdom formed a military alliance, called the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, on January 30th 1902. Russia was not happy at this type of agreement between Japan and the United Kingdom. Russia tried to form a similar military alliance with Germany and France. On March 6th 1902, Russia formed a military alliance with France but not Germany."
"The Russo-Japanese War began between Japan and Russia. Japan won the Russo-Japanese War. The United States mediated the peace negotiations between Japan and Russia. Japan got a number of concessions. In 1910, Japan invaded and annexed Korea."
Chinese bandits called Honghuzi fought against Japan or Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.
World War I to End of World War II.
"In 1914, the First World War broke out. Japan also entered the war. It attacked several places (of East Asia), which were colonies of Germany. After the war ended in 1919, Japan developed very fast. It became one of the major powers of Asia."
The US brought Japanese settlers to Mindanao in the Philippines where they sided with the invading Japanese in World War II.
A huge proportion of Japanese Brazilians were pro Axis and some engaged in terrorist activities to sabotage Allied war efforts. Many Japanese even suffered mass delusion when the war ended and believed that Japan had won the war and that the Allied fleet was wiped out.
Japanese Americans were funding the Japanese military before the Pearl Harbor attack.
World War II.
"Before the beginning of the Second World War, Japan was fighting with China. This is called Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). According to the United States government's own Department of State's Office of the Historian, the US did nothing to help China against the Japanese from 1937 to 1940 when Japan and China were engaged in total war. US officials and policymakers did not want to help. Meanwhile, Japan's military obtained the majority of its iron, steel and oil from the United States between 1937 and 1940. The treaty of commerce between the United States and Japan was not abrogated until January 1940 and even then the United States did not embargo Japan right away. The United States only began giving aid to China after 1940 when Japan and China already fought for three years. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Japan went to the side of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The fighting continued for years. When the USA dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan accepted defeat and surrendered in 1945."
World War II and Japanese occupation of the Philippines
"Japan launched a surprise attack on the Clark Air Base in Pampanga on December 8, 1941, just ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops on Luzon. The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula and to the island of Corregidor at the entrance to Manila Bay."
"On January 2, 1942, General MacArthur declared the capital city, Manila, an open city to prevent its destruction. The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at Bataan were forced to undertake the infamous Bataan Death March to a prison camp 105 kilometers to the north. It is estimated that about 10,000 Filipinos and 1,200 Americans died before reaching their destination."
"President Quezon and Osmeña had accompanied the troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States, where they set up a government in exile. MacArthur was ordered to Australia, where he started to plan for a return to the Philippines."
"The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be unpopular."
"Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East, continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war and was considered an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon."
"The occupation of the Philippines by Japan ended at the war's conclusion. The American army had been fighting the Philippines Campaign since October 1944, when MacArthur's Sixth United States Army landed on Leyte. Landings in other parts of the country had followed, and the Allies, with the Philippine Commonwealth troops, pushed toward Manila. However, fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on September 2, 1945. The Philippines suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical destruction, especially during the Battle of Manila. An estimated 1 million Filipinos had been killed, a large portion during the final months of the war, and Manila had been extensively damaged."
Occupied Japan.
"After the end of the Second World War, Japan came under international control. Japan became an important friend of the US when it entered into the Cold war with Korea. Over next few years, many political, economic and social changes took place. Japanese Diet (legislature) came into being. In 1951, USA and 45 other countries signed an agreement with Japan, and Japan again became an independent nation with full power (a country with full sovereignty) on 28th April 1952."
"Japan experienced dramatic political and social transformation under the Allied occupation in 1945–1952. US General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers, served as Japan's de facto leader and played a central role in implementing reforms"
"As the new de facto ruler of Japan, Douglas MacArthur ordered the drafting of a new constitution for Japan in February 1946.[15]"
So great was his influence in Japan that he has been dubbed the Gaijin Shōgun
The Shinto Directive was an order issued in 1945[1] to the Japanese government by Occupation authorities to abolish state support for the Shinto religion.
Role in the Indian National Movement.
"In 1917, Sardar Vallabhbhai was elected as the Secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, the Gujarat wing of the Indian National Congress. In 1918, he led a massive ""No Tax Campaign"" that urged the farmers not to pay taxes after the British insisted on tax after the floods in Kaira. The peaceful movement forced the British authorities to return the land taken away from the farmers. His effort to bring together the farmers of his area brought him the title of 'Sardar'. He actively supported the non-cooperation Movement launched by Gandhi. Patel toured the nation with him, recruited 300,000 members and helped collect over Rs.1.5 million."
"In 1928, the farmers of Bardoli again faced a problem of ""tax-hike"". After prolonged summons, when the farmers refused to pay the extra tax, the government seized their lands in retaliation. The agitation took on for more than six months. After several rounds of negotiations by Patel, the lands were returned to farmers after a deal was struck between the government and farmers’ representatives."
"In 1930, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the leaders who were imprisoned for participating in the famous Salt Satyagraha movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. His inspiring speeches during the ""Salt Movement"" transformed the outlook of numerous people, who later played a major role in making the movement successful. He led the Satyagraha movement across Gujarat when Gandhi was under imprisonment, upon request from the congress members."
"Sardar Patel was freed in 1931, following an agreement signed between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. The treaty was popularly known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The same year, Patel was elected as the President of Indian National Congress in its Karachi session where the party deliberated its future path. Congress committed itself towards the defense of fundamental and human rights. It was in this session that the dream of a secular nation was conceived."
"During the legislative elections of 1934, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel campaigned for the Indian National Congress. Though he did not contest, Sardar Patel helped his fellow party mates during the election."
"In the 1942 Quit India Movement, Patel continued his unwavering support to Gandhi when several contemporary leaders criticized the latter’s decision. He continued travelling throughout the country propagating the agenda of the movement in a series of heart-felt speeches. He was arrested again in 1942 and was imprisoned in the Ahmednagar fort till 1945 along with other Congress leaders."
"Sardar Patel’s journey often saw a number of confrontations with other important leaders of the congress. He voiced his annoyance at Jawaharlal Nehru openly when the latter adopted socialism in 1936. Patel was also wary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and considered him to be ""keen on more power within the party”."
Sardar Patel &amp; the Partition of India.
"The separatist movement lead by Muslim League leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to a series of violent Hindu-Muslim riots across the country just before the independence. In Sardar Patel’s opinion, the open communal conflicts incited by the riots had the potential to establish a weak Government at the centre post-independence which will be disastrous for consolidating a democratic nation. Patel went on to work on a solution with V.P. Menon, a civil servant during December 1946 and accepted his suggestion of creating a separate dominion based on religious inclination of states. He represented India in the Partition Council."
Contributions to Post-independence India.
"After India achieved independence, Patel became the first Home Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister. Patel played a very crucial role in post-independence India by successfully integrating around 565 princely states under the Indian Dominion. The British Government had presented these rulers with two alternatives - they could join India or Pakistan; or they could stay independent. This clause magnified the difficulty of process to mammoth proportions. Congress entrusted this intimidating task to Sardar Patel who started lobbying for integration on August 6, 1947. He was successful in integrating all of them barring Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad. He eventually dealt with the situation with his sharp political acumen and secured their accession. The India that we see today was a result of the efforts put in by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel."
"Patel was a leading member of the Constituent Assembly of India and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed on his recommendation. He was the key force in establishing the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. He took personal interest in initiating a restoration endeavor of the Somnath Temple in Saurashtra, Gujarat. Patel dealt ruthlessly with the Pakistan’s efforts to invade Kashmir in September 1947. He oversaw immediate expansion of the army and marked improvement of other infrastructural aspects. He often disagreed with Nehru’s policies, especially about his dealings with Pakistan regarding the refugee issues. He organized multiple refugee camps in Punjab and Delhi, and later in West Bengal."
Influence of Gandhi.
"Gandhi had profound effect on Patel’s politics and thoughts. He pledged unwavering support to the Mahatma and stood by his principles allowed by night at museum and art is the most beautiful woman and through his life. While leaders including Chakravarthy Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad criticized Mahatma Gandhi's idea that the civil disobedience movement would compel the British to leave the nation, Patel extended his support to Gandhi. Despite the unwillingness of the Congress High Command, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strongly forced the All India Congress Committee to ratify the civil disobedience movement and launch it without delaying further. Upon Gandhi’s request he gave up his candidacy for the post of the Prime Minister of India. He suffered a major heart attack after Gandhiji’s death.  Although he recovered, he attributed it to having lamented silently for the loss of his mentor."
Death of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's health started declining in 1950. He relized that he was not going to live much longer. On November 2, 1950, his health became even worse and he had to stay in bed. He died because of a heart attack on December 15, 1950."

"Union County is a county located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,399. Its county seat is Elk Point. Originally named Cole County, the named was changed to Union because of Civil War sentiment. It was founded on April 10, 1862."
"Union County is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area."
"""Progressive Farmer"" rated Union County second in the 2006 ""Best Place to Live"" in the U.S., because ""its schools are good, its towns neat and its people friendly."""
"Miner County, South Dakota"
"Miner County is a county located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2010 census, 2,389 people lived there. Its county seat is Howard. It was created in 1873."
"Sparassodonts shared the ecological niches for large predators with fearsome flightless ""terror birds"" (phorusrhacids), whose closest extant (living) relatives are the seriemas. Terrestrial ziphodont crocodilians were also present at least through the middle Miocene. Some of South America's aquatic crocodilians reached monstrous sizes, with lengths up to 12 m."
"Through the skies over late Miocene South America (6 Ma ago) soared the largest flying bird known, the teratorn ""Argentavis"", with a wingspan of 6 m or more, which may have lived in part on the leftovers of ""Thylacosmilus"" kills."
Later herbivores.
Xenarthrans are a curious group of mammals that developed morphological adaptations for specialized diets very early in their history.
"In addition to those extant today (armadillos, anteaters and tree sloths), a great diversity of larger types were present, including pampatheres, the ankylosaur-like glyptodonts, various ground sloths, some of which reached the size of elephants (e.g. ""Megatherium""), and even semiaquatic sloths."
"The notoungulates and litopterns had many strange forms, some examples of convergent evolution."
"Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene, possibly from condylarth stock, diversified, dwindled before the great interchange, and went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier, well before the interchange."
The North American fauna was typical northern eutheria (supplemented with Afrotherian proboscids).
Invasions.
"Once the continents were joined, invasions from the north to the south were numerous and significant in their effect. Invasions from south to north were much less significant. This is most clearly seen in the mammals."
Reasons.
"Reasons for this have been suggested. Wetland tropical species going north encountered desert or, at any rate, dry conditions in Mexico, where the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, also known as the Sierra Nevada (Mexico) or the Snowy Mountain Range, extends 900  km from west to east across central-southern Mexico."
"However, by far the most common theory is that North American fauna were 'topped up' from time to time whenever Eurasian species could get over the Bering Strait."
Mammals a special case.
"This applies with force to mammals, because the eutherian mammals originated in Asia and had undergone a great deal of evolution before they got to South America. Marsupials originally in Eurasia had long before been out-competed and gone extinct. It is not surprising the eutherians did well in South America."
"Marsupials in both South America and Australasia were weak in predators. The borhyaenids and ""Thylacosmilus"" (the 'marsupial' sabretooth) were not marsupials; they were the related group, the sparassodonts. Instead, in South America, the terror birds (""Phorusrhacos"" were for a long time the top predators."
"All these native forms were wiped out as short-faced bears, wolves, nine species of small cats, cougars, jaguars, lions, sabretooths (""Smilodon"" and ""Homotherium"") established themselves."
"The successes in the opposite direction are interesting. Opossums, as the Virginia Opossum, are well established over a wide range. They are the only surviving marsupial in North America, though there were others before mankind arrived in the Americas."
"The top native South American mammal success for a long time was the superorder Xenarthra, which had two different groups with large representatives in North America. One group was the giant ground sloths, such as the megalonychid ""Megalonyx"". This group lived in North America for over 10 million years, well before the Great Interchange. How they got there is not known. They got as far north as Alaska and the Yukon."
"The other group was the glyptodonts, such such as ""Glyptotherium texanum"". They were large, heavily armoured relatives of the armadillo."
"The ability of South America's xenarthrans to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case. The explanation for their success lies in part in their defence against predation. This was based on body armour and/or formidable claws. The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet-footed or quick-witted to survive. Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low metabolic rate (the lowest among the therians). Their low metabolic rate in turn allowed them to subsist on less abundant and/or less nutritious food sources. Unfortunately, the defensive adaptations of the large xenarthrans would have been useless against humans armed with spears and other projectiles."
Eomaia
Eomaia ('dawn mother') is an early fossil eutherian mammal. It is exceptionally well-preserved for a 125 million-year-old specimen.
"It was discovered in rocks of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning Province, China. These strata date to the Lower Cretaceous about 125 million years ago (mya)."
"The fossil is in length and virtually complete. It weighed between . Although the fossil's skull is squashed flat, its teeth, tiny foot bones, cartilages and even its fur are visible."
"""Eomaia"" is a eutherian. The eutherians are the placental mammals plus some extinct mammals which had not developed a placenta."
"What distinguishes the Eutheria from metatherians, a group that includes modern marsupials, are various features of the feet, jaws and teeth."
"However ""Eomaia"" is not a true placental mammal as it lacks some features that are specific to placentals."
"""Eomaia"" has:"
"Its discoverers sampled 268 characters from all major Mesozoic mammal clades and principal eutherian families of the Cretaceous period. As a result, they claimed ""Eomaia"" is at the root of the eutherian ""family tree"" with a few other fossils."
"The ""Eomaia"" fossil shows clear traces of hair. However this is not the earliest clear evidence of hair in the mammalian lineage, as fossils of the docodont ""Castorocauda"", discovered in rocks dated to about 164 mya, also have traces of fur."
"Echo Lake is the park's small oval-shaped lagoon, which was designed to form one of the ears in the big Hidden Mickey from the park's original layout. Around it are many attractions and services, some in buildings designed to look like the ""California Crazy"" form of architecture from Hollywood's Golden Age."
"At The American Idol Experience, park guests can audition and sing for live audiences, and win a special front-of-the-line pass for the popular TV series' real tryouts. Next door, ""Sounds Dangerous!"" features a 3-D audio presentation starring comedian Drew Carey. In between them is the A.T.A.S. Hall of Fame Plaza, a display of busts of past and present icons of the television era, such as Oprah Winfrey and Walt Disney."
"Echo Lake has three attractions based on characters and movies produced by George Lucas' Lucasfilm studio. """" is an upcoming motion simulator ride set in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and is a duplicate of the yet-to-be opened attraction at Disneyland. Jedi Training Academy, a live-action stage show, invites children to become ""padawan learners"" and receive ""lightsaber training"" from a Jedi master. Lastly, the live-action ""Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!"" re-enacts various scenes from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" while illustrating how movie stunts are performed."
Streets of America.
"Originally the New York Street backlot set that was part of the park's original Backlot Studio Tour, the section was later opened to pedestrian traffic. Recently, some of it was changed to look like San Francisco and New York. The current version of the Studio Backlot Tour features the American Film Institute Showcase, a rotating exhibit of movie props and memorabilia, and a tram ride through the backlot areas and through ""Catastrophe Canyon"", an effects-laden ""movie set."" Kids can play on giant plants and toys at the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set Adventure, based on the 1989 Disney movie. Added in 2005, the ""Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show"" is a behind-the-scenes look at how car action sequences are made for movies, and is based on a similar show at Walt Disney Studios Park."
Animation Courtyard.
"This section of the park was originally the starting point for the tours of the park's active production studios. Its entrance is marked by a square ""studio arch,"" much like a real Hollywood studio lot entrance might be marked. The Animation Courtyard is home to a number of attractions based on Disney characters of yesterday, today and tomorrow. The Magic of Disney Animation is an attraction that shows how to animate a character. It also has games and exhibits, along with meet-and-greet areas for Disney and Pixar characters."
"Mickey Avenue, a section inside the Animation Courtyard, has two walk-through exhibits. is about the life and legacy of Walt Disney. It has photos, models, rare artifacts and a short biographical movie narrated by Julie Andrews. At ""Journey into Narnia,"" guests can see props and set pieces from the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movie series (originally distributed by Disney; now handled by 20th Century Fox), as well as meet Prince Caspian from """"."
"The Courtyard section also has two live shows. ""Playhouse Disney Live on Stage!"" has puppet characters from ""Playhouse Disney"" shows on The Disney Channel, including Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Handy Manny, and Little Einsteins. Across the plaza, ""Voyage of the Little Mermaid"" uses glow-in-the-dark puppets, lasers, music, projectors, human actors and water effects to re-create favorite scenes and songs from the animated ""Little Mermaid"" movie."
Toy Story Land.
"The park's newest section has many of the original soundstages used when the park still made TV shows. Today, Toy Story Land looks like the Emeryville, California campus of Pixar Animation Studios with attractions including Toy Story Midway Mania!, an interactive 3D attraction based on classic carnival midway games, each hosted by characters from the ""Toy Story"" movie series. Toy Story Land is also the home of Luxo Jr., a six-foot-tall audio-animatronic version of Pixar's desk-lamp mascot. The moving character performs periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania."
Sunset Boulevard.
"Sunset Boulevard was the first expansion to Disney's Hollywood Studios, opening in July 1994. The main attraction on Sunset Boulevard is The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a thrill ride based on the classic television series. Located nearby is Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, an indoor roller coaster in the dark with three inversions that starts moving at a high speed."
"Sunset Boulevard has two outdoor amphitheaters for live stage shows. The covered Theater of the Stars has ""Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage"", a stage show with scenes from the movie. The open-air Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is the home of ""Fantasmic!"", a nighttime show with Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters in a story filled with fireworks, lasers and water effects."
Therocephalia
"Therocephalia ('beast-heads') are an extinct group of theriodonts. They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 265—245 million years ago, about 20 million years."
"The therocephalians are named after their large skulls. Their skulls, with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were successful carnivores."
"Like other non-mammalian therapsids, therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles. In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals."
"This relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features, possibly including whiskers and hair. There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny, anatomy, and physiology of therocephalians."
"The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa, but have also been found in Russia, China, and Antarctica."
"Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group, which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world. Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, a few representatives of the subgroup (called Eutherocephalia) survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify."
"However, the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic. The reasons for their extinction are not known."
Matrix mechanics
Matrix mechanics is the first way that physicists found to express quantum physics in mathematical form. Werner Heisenberg initially developed this form of expression of the laws of physics just as an equation that he could use to predict the intensities of the photons in the various bands of the hydrogen spectrum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"Heisenberg's teacher and colleague, Max Born, saw that his equation was essentially the plan for creating and multiplying matrices."
"The matrix form of quantum physics is still used since it is useful and convenient for some purposes. Other mathematical ways, particularly Erwin Schrödinger's equation using a wave function, are mathematically equivalent but are easier to use for other purposes."
One of the early successes of this theory was announced shortly thereafter and is now called the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Space Shuttle Discovery
Don't Make Me Over
"""Don't Make Me Over"" is a 1962 popular ballad. It was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Dionne Warwick sang this song."
"The song reached #5 on the ""Billboard"" R&amp;B charts."
"The song was later recorded by other artists, such as Jennifer Warnes and Julia Holter."
Julia Holter
"Julia Holter (born December 18, 1984) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, composer and artist. Her first studio album, ""Tragedy"", was released in 2011. She released a second album, ""Ekstasis"", in March 2012. This album was compared to works by such artists as Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush, Joanna Newsom and several others. ""Ekstasis"" received many positive reviews."
"Holter joined Domino Recording Company. She then released her 3rd album ""Loud City Song"". The album was a critical success."
"She released ""Have You in My Wilderness"" in 2015. The album was very successful."
Article One of the United States Constitution
"Article One of the United States Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government, the United States Congress. The Congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate"
Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress
"Section 1 gives federal legislative power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles II and III. The former gives executive power to the President. The latter grants judicial power to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government. The separation of powers was intended to limit Congress to making law, the President to enforcing the law and the courts as interpreting the law in different cases."
"There is no provision in the Constitution that gives Congress the power to investigate. However, before the adoption of the Constitution, assemblies| in the American colonies exercised that power. Before them, the British Parliament had investigative powers. Congress has always considered it an implicit power in the Constitution. In ""McGrain v. Daugherty"" (1927), the Supreme Court held that Congress did have the power to investigate."
Section 2: House of Representatives.
Clause 1: Composition and election of Members.
"Section Two provides for the election every two years of members of the House of Representatives by the people of the respective states. The ""electors"" (voters) in the state are those who the state decides are eligible to vote for ""the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature"" are eligible to vote for members of the House of Representatives from that state."
Clause 2: Qualifications of Members.
The Constitution provides three requirements for Representatives. A Representative must be at least 25 years old. He or she must live in the state in which he or she is elected. A Representative must also have been a citizen of the United States for the previous seven years.
Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes.
"After much debate, the framers of the Constitution compromised and made population the basis of determining the number of seats (called apportionment) in the House of Representatives. It also used apportionment to determine the tax liability among the states. To accomplish this, the Constitution requires that a census be conducted every ten years. This is to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole. It also establishes a rule for who should and who should not be included in the count. Because the Constitution would go into effect before the completion of a national census, it provides for a temporary apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives."
"Originally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was determined by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other persons (slaves), but excluding non-taxed Native Americans. This Constitutional rule was known as the three-fifths compromise. It was used to determine the number of Representatives in the House. Larger states contributed more money and would have more seats in the House of Representatives."
The Fourteenth Amendment removed the three-fifths rule and ordered the census to count everyone regardless of skin color. It stipulated that males over the age of twenty-one could vote. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the connection between apportionment and direct taxes. The 19th Amendment removed the restriction by sex allowing women to vote. The 26th Amendment reduced the voting age requirement to those 18 years of age and older. But none of these amendments changed congressional apportionment.
"Since enactment of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, Congress set the number of House seats at 435, except in 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as states. Then the number became 437 temporarily."
Clause 4: Vacancies.
"Section two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement. It is the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling. In addition, the Constitution does not authorize a State Governor to appoint a temporary replacement. He is to arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy. The original qualifications and procedures for holding that election are still valid."
Clause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment.
Section Two also provides that the House of Representatives may choose its Speaker and its other officers. The Constitution does not require it but every Speaker has been a member of the House of Representatives. The Speaker rarely presides over routine House sessions. Instead he chooses to deputize a junior member to accomplish the task.
"Finally, Section Two grants to the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Although the Supreme Court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision, the Court has suggested that the grant to the House of the ""sole"" power of impeachment makes the House the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an impeachable offense."
"This power, which is analogous to the bringing of criminal charges by a grand jury, has been used only rarely. The House of Representatives has initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789, and nineteen federal officials have been formally impeached as a result, including: three Presidents (Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump), one Cabinet Secretary (William W. Belknap), one Senator (William Blount), one Supreme Court Associate Justice (Samuel Chase), and fourteen federal judges."
"The Constitution does not specify how impeachment proceedings are to be initiated. Until the early 20th century, a House member could rise and propose an impeachment, which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation. Presently, it is the House Judiciary Committee that initiates the process. It does this only after investigating the allegations, prepares recommendations for the whole House's consideration. If the House votes to adopt an impeachment resolution, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee recommends a slate of ""managers,"" whom the House subsequently approves by resolution. These Representatives then become the prosecution team in the impeachment trial in the Senate (see Section 3, Clause 6 below)."
"The small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation, which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur. Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat.p124"
"Brain size is another factor. It is certain that early mammals did have enlarged brains relative to their size. Reconstructions of the brain size has shown this. Apparently, brain size in Mesozoic mammals lay within the lower range of brain size for living mammals. This is an overall increase of four or more times the volume of basal amniote brains. Very likely this involved the development of the neocortex, ""one of the most striking of all mammalian characteristics"".p120"
Is it a mammal?
There has been a long controversy about whether or not to classify it as a mammal. Some prefer to include it in a broader clade called Mammaliaformes.
"""Morganucodon"" is regarded as very basal (= primitive). Its lower jaw has some of the bones found in its synapsid ancestors in a very reduced form. Mammals have a jawbone composed solely of the dentary."
"The primitive jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones is still found in ""Morganucodon"".p107/112 In modern mammals these bones moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus, ""Morganucodon"" is unusual because, apart from still having the primitive hinge, it has also evolved the derived mammalian one and so has a double jaw joint."
"Its tooth replacement and determinate growth, are mammalian features.p324/346 Earlier synapsids replace their teeth throughout life, as sauropsids also do. This is known as ""polyphyodonty"", while mammals grow only two sets of teeth, in ""diphyodonty""."
Castle Vale Estate
"Castle Vale is a housing estate near Erdington, northeast of Birmingham city centre, in England. The area has about 10,000 people. It has modern homes because a lot of new houses were built after World War II. It is known as a postwar overspill estate."
"The area was originally known as Berwood, from the Saxon 'Bearu' meaning 'the woods'. Historically the area was a boggy and wooded area, and development only started when Edward Darcy began cutting down the trees in the 17th century and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was built in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the land became the site for the first aeroplane take-off in Birmingham which led to a long aviation history being associated with the area. Castle Bromwich Aerodrome was established on the site and operated from 1914 to 1960, being a major airfield in both World Wars and also having industrial importance as the testing facility for locally manufactured airplanes and the location for the British Industries Fair."
"Castle Vale became infamous from the 1970s onwards as a large scale example of a failed postwar overspill estate, which suffered from poor construction and maintenance, social deprivation and high levels of crime. The area became the focus of a targeted regeneration initiative, led by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (CVHAT) from 1993 to 2005, where the estate witnessed the demolition of many of its houses and facilities, the repair of remaining properties, and the construction of new housing and facilities along with the remodelling of the estate, funded both privately and publicly. It is now hailed as an example of a successful community-led regeneration scheme."
Mahayana
"Mahayana (, ""mahāyāna"", literally the ""Great Vehicle"") is one of the two main branches of Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism is from India. Zen is a kind of Mahayana that is influenced by Confucianism."
Tritylodont
Tritylodonts were small to medium-sized mammal-like cynodonts. They varied in size from a rabbit to a beaver.
"They were the last family of the non-mammalian synapsids. One of the last cynodont lines to appear, the family Tritylodontidae descended from a ""Cynognathus""-like cynodont. Their teeth had three cusps (bumps) which gave them their name."
"The tritylodonts were herbivorous, chewing through vegetation, such as stems, leaves, and roots. Tritylodonts have no canine teeth, just incisors and cheek teeth. The jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards, shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth."
"They were the longest surviving of all the non-mammalian therapsids. They appeared in the latest Triassic period, and persisted through the Jurassic until the middle of the Cretaceous. This shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids, even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaurs' feet, so to speak."
"It is very clear that the tritylodonts were warm-blooded. The tritylodont fossils were found in the Americas, South Africa, and Eurasia. They may have managed to live worldwide, including Antarctica."
"There are quite a few parallels between these tritylodonts (which are outside the mammal line) and multituberculates, which are mammals. The tritylodonts had no competition in the Jurassic, because all the other mammal-like types were either carnivores or insectivores. Kermack's conclusion is that when the multituberculates appeared (middle Jurssic) they were in direct competition, and eventually they out-competed the earlier group, and replaced it."
August Belmont
"August Belmont, Sr. (8 December 1813–24 November 1890) was born in Alzey, Hesse, to a Jewish family. He emigrated to New York City in 1837 when he became the American representative of the Rothschild family's banking house in Frankfurt. Later he became an American citizen, and married Caroline Slidell Perry, daughter of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry."
Early life.
"August Belmont was born on December 8, 1813—some sources say 1816—to Simon and Frederika Elsass Schönberg. His mother died when he was seven, and he went live with his uncle and grandmother in Frankfurt. He attended the Jewish Junior and Senior High School until he began his first job as an apprentice to the Rothschilds. He would sweep floors, polish furniture, and run errands while studying English, arithmetic, and writing. He was then given a confidential clerkship in 1832 and promoted to private secretary before travelling to Naples, Paris, and Rome. In 1837, Belmont travelled to Havana to manage the Rothschild's Cuban interests. On his way to Havana, however, Belmont stopped in New York. He arrived there during the Panic of 1837 and stayed to look afte Rothschild's interests there instead of continuing on to Havana. After he emigrated to the United States, he changed his surname, Schönberg (German for ""beautiful mountain""), to Belmont (French for ""beautiful mountain"")."
August Belmont and Company.
"In the Panic of 1837, hundreds of American businesses, including the Rothschild's American agents, went bankrupt. As a result, Belmont postponed his departure to Havana and began August Belmont &amp; Company, believing that he could supplant the recently bankrupt firm, the American Agency. August Belmont and Company was an instant success, and Belmont restored health to the Rothschild's US interests over the next five years. In 1844, Belmont was named the Consul-General of Austria at New York City. He resigned in 1850 because he thought Austria was cruel in the way it treated Hungary."
Entrance into politics.
"Belmont married Caroline Slidell Perry, the daughter of Matthew Calbraith Perry, on 7 November 1849. Soon, John Slidell, his wife's uncle, starting helping Belmont. Belmont's first task was to campaign for James Buchanan in New York. In June, 1851, Belmont wrote letters to the ""New York Herald"" and the ""New York National-Democrat"", insisting that they do justice to Buchanan's presidential run. But Franklin Pierce won the nomination instead, and Belmont made large contributions to the Democratic Party. After his victory, Pierce in 1853 appointed Belmont ""chargé d'affaires"" and minister to The Hague. While in Holland, Belmont urged American annexation of Cuba as a new slave state in what became known as the Ostend Manifesto."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (') or Nongda Lairel Pakhangba (') was officially the first Meitei king of the Ningthouja dynasty. He was coronated in the Kangla of Kangleipak ("" realm"") in 33 AD. He rose to power after defeating the Khabas."
"According to Paratt, before the times of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the ""salai""s () were already in existence."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba started unifying the warring ethnic groups and principality groups positively. It led to the formation of Manipur realm, under the political supremacy of the Ningthouja dynasty (Mangang clan) in the first century AD. Despite the historical context, with the usage of the title ""Pakhangba"", he was often deified with various mythological tales, revolving around his identity as a human incarnation of God Pakhangba (frequently mentioned in the alias ""Konjil Tuthokpa"")."
"According to Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD (""21 years of reign""). The Cheitharol Kumbaba also recorded the list of Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. The record has several versions. However, the most authentic record is the one that is preserved in the Royal Palace of Manipur. The information on the Cheitharol Kumbaba is supplemented by that in the , which also records the details of the Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, regarding their parentage and important events in their reigns."
"According to Prof. P. Gunindra Singh, coins were issued by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, which served as one of the significant evidences relevant to the study of the subject."
"One of the most remarkable historical events occurred during the times of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was the organising of a match of polo () sports, played by his friends, in the (), the oldest Polo Ground in the world."
Name.
"The name ""Pakhangpa"" () was mentioned in the ancient Meitei text, named the ""Thanglon Thangchat"". However, due to the given name ""Pakhangba"", being possessed by multiple historical personalities in ancient times, the identity of the ""Pakhangba"" mentioned in the text is questionable. Notably, there were four notable people named ""Pakhangba"", who are (1) ""Leinung Lonja Ariba Pakhangba"", (2) ""Tangja Leela Pakhangba"", (3) ""Lolang Pakhangba"", and (4) ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" himself. They lived in different times in the history of Manipur."
"The title ""Pakhangba"" is used by the historical kings who are considered to be ""enlightened"". King Nongta Lailen (""Nongda Lairen"") was one among the historical personalities to use the title ""Pakhangba"". Many scholars compared the usage of the title ""Pakhangba"" by Meitei kings with that of the title ""Buddha"", used by the people who are considered to be ""The Awakened One"" or ""The Enlightened One""."
King Pakhangba inherited the political powers as he followed the traditional practices of his forefathers and paid respect for his ancestral rituals.
Rise to power.
"According to Hareshwar Goshwami's ""History of the People of Manipur"" as well as the ancient Meitei text , Nongda Lairen Pakhangba subjugated the powers of ""Sorarel Ariba Ahum"", who were the chiefs of three clans, viz. Chengleis, Luwangs and Nganbas."
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was challenged by Poireiton, for the throne of the Kangla. In the conflict, the former defeated the latter. With the accession of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba to the throne of the Kangla, other clans including the Chengleis and Khaba Nganbas lost their sovereignty. The Angoms and the Luwangs, though independent, shared their political powers with Nongda Lairen Pakhangba."
"Some scholars opined that under the administration of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, his capital was divided into 4 ""pana""s (). The 4 panas include Ahallup Pana, Naharup Pana, Laipham Pana and Khabam Pana. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the ""Pana"" system is a later interpolation, by stating that ""Pana"" came into existence during Meitei King Khagemba's era."
Family.
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba's queen consort, Leima Leisana (also called ""Laisna""), was a maibi (). Leisana and her brother ""Poireiton"" had their origin from a distant place in the east. When she and her brother came to the realm of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, they were accompanied by the Poirei people. She brought two hundred varieties of fruits and vegetables. Legend says that one hundred of the varieties were meant to be cooked and the rest of the hundred were meant to be eaten raw."
Administration.
"During the reign of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the ""Kuchu"" (, /kū.chū/) was established in his kingdom. It was the highest level court (supreme court), having legal jurisdictions over both criminal cases as well as civil cases. The king was the president of the court, and his nobles as well as ministers served as its members."
"The ""Kuchu"" court also used to perform trials of women's cases. The concept of the liberation of women (feminist movement) was already prevalent in that era. The roles of women in their families' decision making processes were considerably significant."
"The ""Cheirap"" (""derived from the word ""Cheirak"""") was established during the reign of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. In Meitei language, ""Cheirap"" (, /cə́i.rap/) means ""court"". In Meitei language, ""Cheirak"" (, /cə́i.rak/) means ""punishment"" or ""said of strict control to enforce obedience""."
"Starting from the era of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, ""Pacha Loishang"" (also spelled as ""Patcha"")() was established in Kangleipak. The court protected the women's rights, privileges, rights against immoral trafficks. During his time, his queen consort ""Laisna"" presided over the court, dealing all women related crimes."
"The Lallup system was established during the reign of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. The ""Lallup"" (also spelled as ""Lalup"") was a practice of forced labor and free labour in services to the sovereign or to the state."
Development of art and culture.
"When Nongda Lairen Pakhangba and his queen consort ""Laishna"" were coronated in 33 AD, the ritual song ""Ougri"" was sung. ""Ougri"" ritual song can bring either prosperity or ruination to the civilization. Since then, it became customary to recite ""Ougri"" during the coronations of every Meitei kings. These recitations of the verses, during the royal coronation of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in 33 AD, were recorded in the ancient text, ""Laisrapham""."
"During the era of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"", a court singer named ""Leinung Tharuk Asheiba"" initiated the performance of the traditional musical instrument Pena."
"According to Dr. Yumlembam Gopi, the Ancient Meiteis used to play ""khung"", a playing instrument, prior to the era of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" in 33 AD. The ""khung"" (, /kʰuŋ/) is a cone-shaped toy, similar to the top."
The Hiyang Tannaba () festival had been celebrated since the time of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom.
"The Mera Hou Chongba (also spelled as ""Mera Hao Chonba"") was believed to be introduced by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. It is a festival in which dignitaries from all the ethnic groups assembled together in the Kangla. It is annually celebrated on the 10th day of the Meitei lunar month of ""Mera"" (October-November interface month)."
Official groups of medical care.
"During the reigns of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, his younger sister named ""Panthoibi"", established the ""Ametpa Loishang"" (). The Loishang () used to perform the treatment and the diagnosis of diseases and sicknesses, including boils, abscesses, ulcers, etc. ""Laibi"", a post in that office, supervised the procedures. ""Metpi""s used to perform delivery and child birth. ""Metpi Laibi""s were responsible for the treatment of diseases for the Queen and other imperial consorts. ""Metpi Laibi""s always used to accompany the king wherever he went, by bringing medical tools and medicines. The text ""Loishangi Thouram Thougal"" mentioned about the duties of the Loishang and the ""Laibi"". The text ""Masil"" (also spelled as ""Masin"", ) mentioned about the ""Metpi""s and the ""Metpi Laibi""s."
Death or dethronement.
"Though almost all the scholars have a consensus on the year of the coronation of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as AD 33, regarding the year of the end of his reign, which maybe either due to his death or due to being abdicated, is still disputed."
"Conserved sequences are similar or identical sequences which occur in DNA, and cause sequences in RNA, proteins and carbohydrates."
"These sequences occur across species. This shows that the sequences has been maintained in evolution despite speciation. The further back up the phylogenetic tree a particular conserved sequence occurs, the more highly conserved it is. Since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny by genes, a conserved sequence implies that there is a conserved gene."
"Conservation of a sequence happens when mutations in a highly conserved region lead to non-viable life forms, that is, a form which is eliminated through natural selection. In other words, the product of the gene is vital to life, and its function is destroyed by almost all changes (mutations) to the sequence."
Conserved nucleic acid sequences.
"The basic theory, widely agreed, is that highly conserved DNA sequences must have functional value, though the role for many of these highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences is not known. One recent study that eliminated four highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences in mice yielded viable mice with no significant phenotypic differences; the authors described their findings as ""unexpected"". So there is clearly something here which is not understood."
"Many regions of the DNA, including highly conserved DNA sequences, consist of repeated sequence elements. If only one of a set of a repeated sequences was removed, and the repetitions were not needed, then no difference would be seen in the mice. The paper did not report whether the eliminated sequences were repeated sequences."
Conserved protein sequences and structures.
"Highly conserved proteins are often required for cells to work or divide. Conservation of protein sequences is shown by the presence of identical amino acid residues at analogous parts of proteins. Conservation of protein structures is indicated by the presence of functionally equivalent, though not necessarily identical, amino acid residues and structures between analogous parts of proteins."
"Shown below is an amino acid sequence alignment between two human zinc finger proteins. Conserved amino acid sequences are marked by strings of formula_1 on the third line of the sequence alignment. As can be seen from this alignment, these two proteins contain a number of conserved amino acid sequences (represented by identical letters aligned between the two sequences)."
Comparative genomics.
The research field which studies the evolution and function of multigene families is called comparative genomics.
FAMAS
"The FAMAS (Fusil d'Assaut de la Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne, in English ""Assault Rifle from the Saint-Étienne Weapon Factory"") is a bullpup-styled assault rifle designed and manufactured in France. It's the main assault rifle of the French Army, French Air Force, and French Navy since 1980. It was also sold for export."
Designed in 1973 FAMAS uses a 5.56mm NATO (.223) caliber cartridge. Muzzle velocity is between 925m/s and 960m/s following variants.

Substitution reaction
"In chemistry, a substitution reaction happens when an atom or a group of atoms is replaced by a different one. Substitution reactions can be of many different types."
"In organic chemistry, the main ones are nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution. These take their names from electrophiles and nucleophiles. However, substitution reactions can also happen under other conditions. For example, photochemical reactions (reactions that use light instead of heat) are used to put halogens in a molecule. Another example is using free radicals. Choosing the correct solvent and temperature conditions is very important to make sure that the reaction happens. Sometimes an elimination reaction can happen instead."
"The product of a substitution reaction is often called a substituted molecule. For example, phenol can be called a substituted benzene."

Mehmed Orhan
"Mehmed Orhan (11 July 1909 5/12 March 1994) was the 42nd head of the Ottoman dynasty. He succeeded as head of the dynasty on 9 December 1983, after the death of Ali Vâsib. If reigning, he would be Sultan Orhan VII."
Life.
"He was born at Serencebey Palace or at Kisil Toprak, Turkey. He was the son of HIH Prince Şehzade Mehmed Abdul Kadir Efendi, Captain of the Ottoman Army, by second wife HH Mihriban Hanımefendi. The marriage was not recognised by the Imperial House. On his 13 birthday he was ceremoniously circumcised in the Dolmabahce Palace."
He died in Nice and was buried there.
Marriages and issue.
"In January 1933, Prince Mehmed Orhan married the Egyptian Princess HH Nafiye Yeghen Hanım Efendi. This marriage was annulled in 1947. In Paris in 1944, he got a Morganatic marriage with the French American Marguerite Irma Fournier. He had a daughter with his first wife and a stepson with his second wife."
"""Eligibility note: A male person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants."""
"Mehmed Selim Orhan de Turquie was born before his parents married in 1944. At the time of his birth, his stepfather was not divorced by his first wife."

"A total synthesis is the complete chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simple, commercially available (petrochemical) or natural precursors. In a ""linear"" synthesis—often used for simple structures—several steps are performed one after another until the molecule is complete. The chemical compounds made in each step are usually called ""synthetic intermediates"". For more complex molecules, a different approach may be preferable: convergent synthesis involves the individual preparation of several ""pieces"" (key intermediates), which are then combined to form the goal product."
"Robert Burns Woodward, who received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for several total syntheses (for example, his 1954 synthesis of strychnine), is regarded as the father of modern organic synthesis. Some latter-day examples of total synthesis include Wender's, Holton's, Nicolaou's and Danishefsky's synthesis of Taxol."
Methodology and applications.
"Each step of a synthesis involves a chemical reaction, and reagents and conditions for each of these reactions need to be designed to give a good yield and a pure product, with as little work as possible. A method may already exist in the literature for making one of the early synthetic intermediates, and this method will usually be used rather than ""trying to reinvent the wheel"". However most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before. These will normally be made using general methods developed by methodology researchers. To be useful, these methods need to give high yields. They must also be reliable for a broad range of substrates. For practical applications, additional requirements include industrial standards of safety and purity. Methodology research usually involves three main stages: ""discovery"", ""optimization"", and studies of ""scope and limitations"". The ""discovery"" requires extensive knowledge of and experience with chemical reactivities of appropriate reagents. ""Optimization"" is where one or two starting compounds are tested in the reaction under a wide variety of conditions of temperature, solvent, reaction time, etc. Researchers try different conditions until they find the best conditions for product yield and purity. Finally, researchers try to extend the synthesis method to a broad range of different starting materials, to find its scope and limitations. Total synthesis (see above) are sometimes used to highlight the new method and demonstrate its value in a real-world application. Major industries focused especially on polymers (and plastics) and on pharmaceuticals have used this research."
Asymmetric synthesis.
"Most complex natural products are chiral. Each enantiomer can have a different bioactivity. Traditional total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures, i.e., as an equal mixture of both possible enantiomers. The racemic mixture might then be separated via chiral resolution."
"In the latter half of the twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of asymmetric catalysis and kinetic resolution. These reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include Sharpless epoxidation (K. Barry Sharpless) and asymmetric hydrogenation (William S. Knowles and Ryōji Noyori). For their achievement, these workers went on to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start an organic synthesis. Previously only natural enantiomer starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert Burns Woodward and other new synthetic methods, chemists became more able to make complex molecules without unwanted racemisation. This is called stereocontrol. This allowed the final target molecule to be synthesised as one pure enantiomer without any resolution being necessary. Such techniques are referred to as asymmetric synthesis."
Synthesis design.
"Elias James Corey brought a more formal approach to synthesis design, based on retrosynthetic analysis, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1990. In this approach, the research is planned backwards from the product, using standard rules. The steps are shown using retrosynthetic arrows (drawn as: =&gt;), which in effect means ""is made from"". Computer programs have been written for designing a synthesis based on sequences of generic ""half-reactions""."
Alexander Morozevich
"Alexander Morozevich (born Moscow, 18 July 1977) is a Russian chess Grandmaster. He was ranked second, in the July 2008 FIDE rating list, but is now ranked ninth."
"Morozevich has been one of the best chess players in the world for nearly a decade. He is famous for employing unusual openings, for example the Chigorin Defense (1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6), and more recently the Albin Countergambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5); both systems are hardly ever seen at the top level. He is also well known for preferring complicated rather than clear positions. Perhaps because of his style, which produces relatively few draws, Morozevich is popular among chess fans."
"Among his most notable results are 7.5/10 at the 2000 Chess Olympiad (winning Bronze Medal for board 2) and 7/11 at the 2002 Chess Olympiad. He took first place in the overall standings at the Amber tournament in 2002, 2004 (shared with Kramnik) and 2006 (shared with Anand); first place in Biel tournament three times: 2003, 2004 and 2006; and twice winning the Russian championship (1998 and 2007)."
Peter Leko
"During this period, in 1542, a Portuguese ship reached Japan and made the first direct contact between both cultures, including the knowledge of firearms. In the next few years, merchants and also some Christian missionaries from several European countries, mainly Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and Spain, reached the shores of Japan."
Azuchi-Momoyama Period.
"Azuchi-Momoyama period covers the years from 1568 to 1600. During these years, different parts of Japan became united again. Japan's military power grew. In 1592, Japan wanted to conquer China. At that time China was ruled by the Ming dynasty. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was one of the main leaders of Japan. He sent an army of 160,000 samurai to Korea. The Japanese could not win and retreated back to Japan. In 1597, Japan again sent an army to Korea. In 1598, Toyotomi Hideyoshi died. After his death, the Japanese dropped the idea of conquering Korea and China."
"During this period, the Japanese brought many Koreans to Japan. These Koreans were very good at making pottery and at other arts. Some of them were very educated. Japan gained new information and knowledge from these Koreans."
"Yaita Kinbee Kiyosada, the Japanese blacksmith who was ordered to copy and reverse engineer Portuguese matchlock muskets could not make the screw properly himself and had to give a his 16 year old daughter Wakasa in marriage to a Portuguese in exchange for the Portuguese teaching him to build the muskets. Today Japanese in Tageshima regard Wakasa as a heroine for giving herself to a Portuguese man in exchange for teaching how to screw the end of the musket barrel and a statue was built in her honour as well as candy, restaurants and boast named after her."
Japanese prostitutes were required to prove they were not Christian in order to work in prostitution by the Tokugawa government.
Edo Period.
"During the Edo period, Japan had many small rulers. There were about 200 of them. They were called daimyo, and they were all ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate which was leaded by the Tokugawa clan. The shoguate's capital was relocated to Edo. This place was at modern-day Tokyo. Fifteen shoguns controlled the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo Period."
"Tôjin-yashiki, the Chinese merchant colony on a square island was south of Dejima where the Dutch merchants were. Japanese prostitutes from the Maruyama red light district of Nagasaki visited both the Dutch and Chinese men to have sex with them. Japanese artists drew erotic paintings of the foreign men having seen with Japanese women."
"Japanese peasant men were not required to kill wives who committed adultery but samurai were. The majority of the Japanese people in this period were townspeople, fisher people or peasant commoners and they did not take adultery, virginity or paternity of their children as serious issues unlike the samurai families, who were a minority of the Japanese population. Japanese commoner women and men mixed with each other and had out of wedlock or bastard children through adultery and they made up the majority of prostitutes. Japanese commoners did not have surnames until the Meiji restoration in the 19th century."
The Edo period is also a very important period in the history of Japan. The main developments include:
"In 1867, the Tokugawa Shogunate returned its political power to the emperor. Although, the emperor did not know how to rule the country because the last time the emperor had power was 500 years ago. So, the shogunate still remained in authority."
"In 1868, the Boshin War occurred between the Japanese emperor and the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan again came under the actual rule of an emperor as the Tokugawa shogunate was defeated."
Seclusion.
"Beginning from the early 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate followed a policy of seclusion, known as sakoku in Japanese language. They suspected that traders, merchants, and missionaries from Europe wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. All traders and missionaries from other countries were forced to leave Japan, except for the Dutch, the Koreans, and the Chinese."
"Even during the period of seclusion, the Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world."
End of seclusion.
"This policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years until it ended under American military force. On July 8th 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy reached Edo with four warships. The ships were heavily armed and their guns pointed towards the city. After this display of American military power, Japan was forced to agree to trade with other countries. The Japanese called these ships the ""kurofune"" or the Black Ships."
"Next year, on March 31st 1854, Perry came with seven ships and the Japanese signed a treaty (known as the Convention of Kanagawa) that established a diplomatic relationship with the United States. Another treaty (known as the Harris Treaty) was signed with the United States on July 29th 1858. This treaty gave more facilities to foreigners coming to Japan and expanded trade with Japan. Many Japanese were not happy with reopening diplomatic relations and trade with other countries."
"""For years several countries have applied for trade, but you have opposed them on account of a national law. You have thus acted against divine principles and your sin cannot be greater than it is. What we say does not necessarily mean, as has already been communicated by the Dutch boat, that we expect mutual trade by all means. If you are still to disagree we would then take up arms and inquire into the sin against the divine principles, and you would also make sure of your law and fight in defence. When one considers such an occasion, however, one will realize the victory will naturally be ours and you shall by no means overcome us. If in such a situation you seek for a reconciliation, you should put up the white flag that we have recently presented to you, and we would accordingly stop firing and conclude peace with you, turning our battleships aside."""
-Commodore Perry
"After Commodore Perry's visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the Meiji era. Many Japanese politicians have since also encouraged the Westernization of Japan using the term Datsu-A Ron, which means the argument for ""leaving Asia"" or ""Good-bye Asia"". In Datsu-A Ron, ""Westernization"" was described as an ""unavoidable"" but ""fruitful"" change. After Japan's surrender to the United States and its allies ended World War II, the Westernization process of Japanese culture was further intensified and today, Japan is notably among the most Westernized countries in Asia."
Meiji Restoration.
The Meiji Restoration is an important period of history of Japan. Emperor Meiji ruled Japan and regained power from the shogunate. The Meiji Restoration began with the Boshin War of 1868. Emperor Meiji wanted Japan to become Westernized. Many changes occurred in Japan’s government and culture.
"The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy (岩倉使節団, Iwakura Shisetsudan) was a Japanese diplomatic voyage to the United States and Europe conducted between 1871 and 1873 by leading statesmen and scholars of the Meiji period. Although it was not the only such mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck."
"Cong Liangbi was the owner of the Zhenye match producing company in Qinghai and Jinan and his sales for 1927-1928 were recorded in a survey by the Chinese Match Union. A Chinese businessman named Cong Liangbi in the match industry from Qingdao, Shandong who led the local Red Swastika Society branch had multiple concubines besides his Chinese first wife, Cong Jingshu (Xuannan) née Chi, he had a Japanese concubine from the time he stayed in Japan for business and another Chinese concubine, Cong Wanying (Shijian). The name of the Japanese wife transliterated into pinyin was Gaoqiao Xingzi. She was a temporary wife and they married for a period of 10 years agreed to in a written contract which said daughters would belong to the Japanese mother and sons to the Chinese father. She bore 2 sons, in 1906, Liumen, and in 1902, Zhengmen. Cong's Chinese wife back home in 1904 bore a son, Tongmen."
"A Xiangshan (Zhongshan), Guangdong born Chinese compradore named Su Jiesheng had a Chinese wife in Guangdong, but he also went to Japan and took a Japanese concubine and had a child by a Japanese maid who gave birth to his son Su Manshu (1884-1918), who was raised by the concubine but then also raised by the Guangdong based wife. The Japanese maid left when he was 3 months old so the Japanese concubine was called Kawai-sen and the boy grew up in Yokohama until he was 6 when he was sent to Guangdong in China.. He arrived in Guangdong in 1889. He went back to Japan in 1898 to Yokohama and to Tokyo in 1902."
Modern feminist ideas about letting women out of the house and participating in public life were taught to Chinese students studying in Japan by Japanese women.
Japanese peasant commoners did not care about the paternal identity of their children since they didn't have surname before the Meiji restoration and the maternal families accepted out of wedlock children born to yobai (night crawling) when Japanese men snuck into women's homes they were not married to and impregnated them without marrying them.
Han Chinese viewed the Uyghur women's practice of temporary marriage as morally corrupt.
Japanese girls prostituted to the Dutch were called Oranda yuki san while Japanese girls prostituted to the Chinese were called Karayuki-san. Japanese women were prostituted around the world as Karayuki san and Korean women were also taken into prostitution by the Japanese.
"Japanese sex tourists in the 1970s to 1990s often went to South Korea for sex with South Korean women and a connection was drawn by feminists to Japanese exploitation of Korean comfort women during World War II as well as Japanese women's prostitution as Karayuki-san in Singapore and other countries in Southeast Asia. There were 200,000 South Korean women servicing Japanese men as prostitutes by 1973."
"However, with steric hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer."
"Grignard reactions will not work if water is present; water causes the reagent to rapidly decompose. So, most Grignard reactions occur in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF), because the oxygen in these solvents stabilizes the magnesium reagent. The reagent may also react with oxygen present in the atmosphere. This will insert an oxygen atom between the carbon base and the magnesium halide group. Usually, this side-reaction may be limited by the volatile solvent vapors displacing air above the reaction mixture. However, chemists may perform the reactions in nitrogen or argon atmospheres. In small scale reactions, the solvent vapors do not have enough space to protect the magnesium from oxygen."
Making a Grignard reagent.
"Grignard reagents are formed by the action of an alkyl or aryl halide on magnesium metal. The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Typical solvents are diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Oxygen and protic solvents such as water or alcohols are not compatible with Grignard reagents. The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer."
"Grignard reactions often start slowly. First, there is an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. Alkyl and aryl bromides and iodides are common substrates. Chlorides are also used, but fluorides are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium."
"Many Grignard reagents, such as methylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium bromide, and allylmagnesium bromide are available commercially in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether solutions."
"Using the Schlenk equilibrium, Grignard reagents form varying amounts of diorganomagnesium compounds (R = organic group, X = halide):"
Initiation.
Many methods have been developed to initiate Grignard reactions that are slow to start. These methods weaken the layer of MgO that covers the magnesium. They expose the magnesium to the organic halide to start the reaction that makes the Grignard reagent.
"Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces ""in situ"", rapid stirring, or using ultrasound (sonication) of the suspension. Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are commonly employed activating agents. Chemists use 1,2-dibromoethane because its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Also, the side-products are innocuous:"
The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant.
"The addition of a small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal, allowing it to react."
Industrial production.
"Grignard reagents are produced in industry for use in place, or for sale. As with at bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation. A portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic; this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant."
Reactions of Grignard reagents.
Reactions with carbonyl compounds.
Grignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives.
"The most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, as in this example:"
Note that the acetal function (a masked carbonyl) does not react.
"Such reactions usually involve a water-based (aqueous) acidic workup, though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes. In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will form."
Reactions with other electrophiles.
"In addition, Grignard reagents will react with electrophiles."
"Another example is making salicylaldehyde (not shown above). First, bromoethane reacts with Mg in ether. Second, phenol in THF converts the phenol into Ar-OMgBr. Third, benzene is added in the presence of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine. Fourth, the mixture is distilled to remove the solvents. Next, 10% HCl is added. Salicylaldehyde will be the major product as long as everything is very dry and under inert conditions. The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane."
"Formation of bonds to B, Si, P, Sn."
The Grignard reagent is very useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds.
Carbon–carbon coupling reactions.
"A Grignard reagent can also be involved in coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl ""p""-chlorobenzoate to give ""p""-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III), often symbolized as Fe(acac)3, after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac)3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide."
"For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li2CuCl4), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to [substituted] styrenes."
Oxidation.
The oxidation of a Grignard reagent with oxygen takes place through a radical intermediate to a magnesium hydroperoxide. Hydrolysis of this complex yields hydroperoxides and reduction with an additional equivalent of Grignard reagent gives an alcohol.
formula_1
"A reaction of Grignards with oxygen in presence of an alkene makes an ethylene extended alcohol. These are useful in synthesizing larger compounds. This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignard reagents. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction, showing that the presence of oxygen is essential. The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard reagent in the reaction. This can addressed by using a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard reagent such as n-butylmagnesium bromide."
Milk pasteurization.
"Pasteurization is usually done to milk, which was first suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886. There are two popular ways to pasteurize milk. First, high temperature/short time (HTST), and second, ultra-high temperature (UHT). HTST is the most common method. Milk only labeled ""pasteurized"" (or ""past"") is usually treated with the HTST method, whereas milk labelled ""ultra-pasteurized"" or ""UHT"" must be treated with the UHT method. HTST is when the milk is at a temperature of 72 degrees Celsius (or 161.5 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 15 seconds. UHT is when the milk is at a temperature of 138 °C or 280 °F for at least two seconds."
"Pasteurization rules are usually set by national food safety agencies (like the USDA in the United States and the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom). These agencies say milk has to be HTST pasteurized to have the ""pasteurized"" label. There are different rules for different dairy products, depending on the fat content and what they will be used for. For example, the pasteurization rules for cream are different than the rules for fluid milk, and the standards for pasteurizing cheese are designed to keep the phosphatase enzyme fresh, which helps in making the cheese."
"HTST pasteurized milk normally has a refrigerated shelf life of two or three weeks, but ultra pasteurized milk can last much longer when refrigerated, sometimes two or three months. When UHT pasteurization is mixed with safe handling and container technology, it can even be stored unrefrigerated for even longer periods of time."
Alternative pasteurization standards and raw milk.
"In addition to the standard HTST and UHT pasteurization standards, there are other lesser-known pasteurization techniques. The first technique, called ""batch pasteurization"", involves heating large batches of milk to a lower temperature, typically . The other technique is called higher-heat/shorter time (HHST), and it lies somewhere between HTST and UHT in terms of time and temperature. Pasteurization causes some irreversible and some temporary denaturization of the proteins in milk."
"In most legislations, double pasteurization is not allowed. A heat treatment at a lower temperature or for a shorter time is sometimes performed. Possibly, such milk could be called ""raw milk"" or, confusingly, ""unpasteurized milk"". It cannot be called ""pasteurized"", even though a significant number of pathogens are destroyed during the process."
"In recent years, there has been some consumer interest in raw milk products, due to perceived health benefits. Advocates of raw milk maintain, correctly, that some components survive in milk that has not been pasteurized. Specifically, raw milk contains immunoglobulins and the enzymes lipase and phosphatase, which are inactivated by heat. Raw milk also contains vitamin B6 of which up to 20% may be lost on heat treatment. It is also claimed to contain beneficial bacteria which aid digestion and boost immunity."
Commercial distribution of packaged raw milk is not allowed in most US states.
"Some doctors (and some raw milk advocates) acknowledge that certain people should not drink raw milk, including pregnant or breast-feeding mothers, those undergoing immunosuppression treatment for cancer, organ transplant, or autoimmune diseases; and those who are immunocompromised due to medical conditions such as AIDS."
"In fact, some doctors suggest that babies and breast-feeding mothers avoid all but UHT pasteurized dairy products."
"In Africa, it is common to boil milk whenever it is harvested. This intense heating greatly changes the flavor of milk, which the people in Africa are accustomed to."
Unpasteurized milk.
"Milk pasteurization standards have been subject to increasing scrutiny in recent years, due to the discovery of pathogens that are both widespread and heat resistant (able to survive pasteurization in significant numbers). Researchers have developed more sensitive diagnostics, such as real-time PCR and improved culture methods, that have enabled them to identify pathogens in pasteurized milk."
"One bacterium in particular, the organism ""Mycobacterium avium"" subspecies ""paratuberculosis"" (MAP), which causes Johne's disease in cattle and is suspected of causing at least some Crohn's disease in humans, has been found to survive pasteurization in retail milk in the U.S., the U.K., Greece, and the Czech Republic. The food safety authorities in the U.K. have decided to re-evaluate pasteurization standards in light of the MAP results and other evidence of harmful, pasteurization-resistant pathogens."
"The USDA (which is responsible for setting pasteurization standards in the U.S.) has not re-evaluated their position on pasteurization adequacy. They do not dispute the studies, which are at this point accepted by the scientific community, but maintain that the presence of MAP in retail pasteurized milk must be due to post-pasteurization contamination. However, some researchers within the FDA, which is responsible for food safety in the U.S., have begun pushing for a re-evaluation of these results. There is a small but growing body of criticism directed at these agencies by Crohn's disease sufferers, scientists, and doctors. Some have suggested that the U.S. dairy industry has been successful in suppressing the agencies' response to a potential health crisis, for fear of consumer panic which would lead to a decrease in milk consumption. It is worth noting that while MAP has not been definitely proven to be harmful in humans, all other mycobacteria are pathogenic, and it has been definitively shown to cause disease in cattle and other ruminants."
"A newer method called flash pasteurization involves shorter exposure to higher temperatures, and is claimed to be better for preserving color and taste in some products."
"The term cold pasteurization is used sometimes for the use of ionizing radiation (see food irradiation) or other means (e.g. chemical) to kill bacteria in food. Food irradiation is also sometimes called ""electronic pasteurization""."
Soft cheese
"Soft cheese (in French: ""Fromage à pate molle"") is any kind of cheese that does not get heated during production."
An example of soft cheese would be Brie.
Cult
"A cult is a group of people who have a religion or a set of beliefs. In modern times the term ""cult"" usually does not mean a mainstream religion, but a group set up ""in opposition to a centre of established authority"". New Age religions were often called cults because they were thought to be deviant social movements."
"The word cult originally meant a system of ritual practices. It was first used in the early 17th century to mean homage paid to a divinity. It came from an ancient Latin word ""cultus"" meaning ""worship""."
"A cult is often a small, newly started religious movement. Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd, or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice. More than that, cults have often been led by people who are not elected, and control the group according to their own wishes. Some cult leaders have been dangerous criminals (Charles Manson; Peoples Temple) or even lunatics. Killings and mass suicides have occurred in cults (Order of the Solar Temple; Heaven's Gate). Of course, a ""suicide"" enforced by armed guards carrying sub-machine guns (Peoples Temple; Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God) is not a simple suicide as generally understood. It is at least an assisted and coerced suicide."
Whether a religious group is or is not a cult can be a hard question to answer. What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion and what at one point of time is considered an accepted religion may later become a cult.
Treatment of cult members.
Mind control.
"Some form of persuasion or mind control can be used to recruit and maintain members. The objective is to prevent the faithful from thinking critically, and making choices in their own best interest."
The following methods have been used in some or all cults studied:
"Finally they worked out a compromise between all three plans. The new government would have an upper house, having an equal number of delegates from each state, and a lower house with representation based on population. The executive branch would have most of the responsibilities of foreign affairs while other important powers, like ratifying treaties, would be the responsibility of the legislative branch. After the new Constitution was ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789."
Article Four of the United States Constitution
"Article Four of the United States Constitution outlines the relationship between the various states, as well as the connection between the states and the federal government."
Section 1: Full faith and credit.
"The first section requires states to recognize the ""full faith and credit"" of the public acts, records and court proceedings of other states."
"This clause makes certain that any judicial decisions made in courts of one state are recognized and honored in all other states. This eliminates the practice of ""forum shopping"", the practice of having a legal case heard in the court thought most likely to provide a favorable judgment. It also prevents someone moving from one state to another to escape a judgment."
"In ""Mills v. Duryee"" (1813), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the merits of a case, as settled by courts of one state, must be recognized by the courts of other states. state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. Later, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other states' courts as final. However, in ""McElmoyle v. Cohen"" (1839), the court heard a case where one party obtained a judgment in South Carolina and sought to enforce it in Georgia, which had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after a certain amount of time had passed. The court upheld Georgia's refusal to enforce the South Carolina judgment. The court found that out-of-state judgments are subject to the procedural law of the states where they are enforced, notwithstanding any priority it may be given in the state in which they it was issued."
Section 2: Rights of state citizens; rights of extradition.
Clause 1: Privileges and Immunities.
"Clause One of Section 2 requires interstate protection of ""privileges and immunities"". The apparent ambiguity of the clause has given rise to a number of different interpretations. Some contend that the clause requires Congress to treat all citizens equally. Others suggest that citizens of states carry the rights accorded by their home states while traveling in other states."
Neither of these theories has been endorsed by the Supreme Court. A state may not discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of its own citizens. But certain exceptions are allowed. For example a state may give their own citizens the right to buy a hunting or fishing license at a lower cost than to nonresidents.
Clause 2: Extradition of fugitives.
"Clause Two requires that fugitives from justice may be extradited on the demand of executive authority of the state from which they flee. The Supreme Court has held that it is not compulsory for the fugitive to have fled after an indictment was issued, but only that the fugitive fled after having committed the crime. The Constitution provides for the extradition of fugitives who have committed treason, felony or other crime. That phrase incorporates all acts prohibited by the laws of a state, including misdemeanors and small, or petty, offenses."
"In ""Kentucky v. Dennison"" (1860), the Supreme Court held that the federal courts may not compel state governors to surrender fugitives through the issue of writs of mandamus. The ""Dennison"" decision was overruled by ""Puerto Rico v. Branstad"" (1987). Now, the federal courts may require the extradition of fugitives. Alleged fugitives generally may not challenge extradition proceedings."
Clause 3: Fugitive Slave Clause.
"Pierce Butler and Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, submitted this clause to the Constitutional Convention. James Wilson and Roger Sherman both objected and Butler withdrew the clause. However, on the next day the clause was reinstated and adopted by the Convention without objection. At the last moment the language was changed from ""Person legally held to Service or Labour in one state"" to read ""Person held to Service or Labour in one state, under the Laws thereof""."
"In 1865, the Fugitive Slave Clause was repealed by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery."
Section 3: New states and federal property.
Clause 1: New states.
"The First Clause of Section Three grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This latter provision was designed to gave Eastern states that still had claims to Western lands (e.g., Virginia and North Carolina) to have a veto over whether their western counties (which eventually became Kentucky and Tennessee) could become states. It would later be applied with regard to the formation of Maine (from Massachusetts) and West Virginia (from Virginia)."
Clause 2: Property Clause.
"This clause, commonly known as the ""Property"" or ""Territorial"" Clause, grants Congress the constitutional authority for the management and control of all territories or other property owned by United States. Additionally, the clause also proclaims that nothing contained within the Constitution may be interpreted to harm (prejudice) any claim of the United States, or of any particular State. The exact scope of this clause has long been a matter of debate."
"The federal government owns or controls about thirty percent of the land in the United States. These holdings include national parks, national forests, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, vast tracts of range and public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, reservations held in trust for Native American tribes, military bases, and ordinary federal buildings and installations. Although federal property can be found in every state, the largest concentrations are in the west, where, for example, the federal government owns over eighty percent of the land within Nevada."
Section 4: Obligations of the United States.
Clause 1: Republican government.
"This clause, sometimes referred to as the Guarantee Clause, has long been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens compared to those of the government. The Guarantee Clause mandates that all U.S. states must be grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed. By ensuring that all states must have the same type of government (a republic), the Guarantee Clause is one of several portions of the Constitution which mandates symmetric federalism between the states."
Clause 2: Protection from invasion and domestic violence.
"Section Four requires the United States to protect each state from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot, but was not invoked."
Norma Cruz
"Norma Angélica Cruz Córdoba (Norma Cruz) is a Guatemalan human rights activist who works to stop violence against women. Cruz is the head of the ""Fundación Sobrevivientes"" (Survivors' Foundation), a women's rights organization in Guatemala City. In 2009, the US Department of State gave Cruz an International Women of Courage Award."
"Institutions and towns may hold firework displays and bonfire parties, and the same is done on a smaller scale in back gardens throughout the country. In some areas, particularly in Sussex, there are extensive processions, large bonfires and firework displays organised by local bonfire societies; the most extensive of which takes place in Lewes."
"The Houses of Parliament are still searched by the Yeomen of the Guard before the State Opening of Parliament, however, this is done as a traditional custom rather than a serious anti-terrorist precaution."
A commemorative British two pound coin was issued in 2005 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the plot.
"The cellar in which Fawkes watched over his gunpowder was demolished in 1822. The area was further damaged in the 1834 fire and destroyed in the subsequent rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster. The lantern which Guy Fawkes carried in 1605 is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. A key supposedly taken from him is in Speaker's House, Palace of Westminster. These two items were shown in a major exhibition held in Westminster Hall from July to November 2005."
"According to Esther Forbes (a biographer), the Guy Fawkes Day celebration in the pre-revolutionary American Colonies was a very popular holiday. In Boston, the celebration took on anti-authoritarian overtones, and often became so dangerous that many would not venture out of their homes."
"In November 1930, taking advantage of the bonfires used on the holiday, Alfred Arthur Rouse murdered an unknown man and planted his body as a substitute for Rouse's in his Morris Minor (1928) automobile (which was then set alight). The scheme did not work out, and Rouse was arrested, tried and executed for the crime."
Accusations of state conspiracy.
"Many at the time felt that Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the king and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation. Such theories alleged that Cecil had either actually invented the plot or allowed it to continue when his agents had already infiltrated it, for the purposes of propaganda. These rumours were the start of a long-lasting conspiracy theory about the plot. Yet while there was no ""golden time"" of ""toleration"" of Catholics which Father Garnet had hoped for at the start of James' reign, the legislative backlash had nothing to do with the plot: it had already happened by 1605, as recusancy fines were re-imposed and some priests expelled. There was no purge of Catholics from power and influence in the kingdom after the Gunpowder Plot, despite Puritan complaints. The reign of James I was, in fact, a time of relative leniency for Catholics, few being subject to prosecution."
"This did not dissuade some from continuing to claim Cecil's involvement in the plot. In 1897 Father John Gerard of Stonyhurst College, namesake of a Jesuit priest who had performed Mass to some of the plotters, wrote an account called ""What was the Gunpowder Plot?"", alleging Cecil's culpability. This prompted a refutation later that year by Samuel Gardiner, who argued that Gerard had gone too far in trying to ""wipe away the reproach"" which the plot had exacted on generations of English Catholics. Gardiner portrayed Cecil as guilty of nothing more than opportunism. Subsequent attempts to prove Cecil's responsibility, such as Francis Edwards's 1969 work ""Guy Fawkes: the real story of the gunpowder plot?"", have similarly foundered on the lack of positive proof of any government involvement in setting up the plot. There has been little support by historians for the conspiracy theory since this time, other than to acknowledge that Cecil may have known about the plot some days before it was uncovered."
Modern plot analysis.
"According to the historian Lady Antonia Fraser, the gunpowder was taken to the Tower of London magazine. It would have been reissued or sold for recycling if in good condition. Ordnance records for the Tower state that 18 hundredweight (equivalent to about 816 kg) of it was ""decayed"", which could imply that it was rendered harmless due to having separated into its component chemical parts, as happens with gunpowder when left to sit for too long—if Fawkes had ignited the gunpowder during the opening, it would only have resulted in a weak splutter. Alternatively, ""decayed"" may refer to the powder being damp and sticking together, making it unfit for use in firearms — in which case the explosive capabilities of the barrels would not have been significantly affected."
""""", an ITV programme presented by Richard Hammond and broadcast on 1 November 2005, re-enacted the plot by blowing up an exact replica of the 17th-century House of Lords filled with test dummies, using the exact amount of gunpowder in the underground of the building. The dramatic experiment, conducted on the Advantica Spadeadam test site, proved unambiguously that the explosion would have killed all those attending the State Opening of Parliament in the Lords chamber."
"The power of the explosion, which surprised even gunpowder experts, was such that seven-foot deep solid concrete walls (made deliberately to replicate how archives suggest the walls in the old House of Lords were constructed) were reduced to rubble. Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were themselves destroyed by the blast, while the skull of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found a large distance away from the site. According to the findings of the programme, no-one within 100 metres of the blast could have survived, while all the stained glass windows in Westminster Abbey would have been shattered, as would all windows within a large distance of the Palace. The power of the explosion would have been seen from miles away, and heard from further still. Even if only half the gunpowder had gone off, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly."
"The programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, at such a low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by the impact of its compression in wooden barrels, with the compression overcoming any deterioration in the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. In addition, mathematical calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had used double the amount of gunpowder needed."
"A sample of the gunpowder may have survived: in March 2002, workers investigating archives of John Evelyn at the British Library found a box containing various samples of gunpowder and several notes suggesting a relation to the Gunpowder Plot:"
John Knox
John Knox (c. 1510 – 24 November 1572) was the man who brought the Protestant Reformation to Scotland. He was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church. Knox joined the movement to change the Roman Catholic church in Scotland. He married twice and had five children. Knox preached until he died.
"A fight between Catholic France and Protestant England for Scotland began again because of the Reformation. Sometimes France had more power. Other times England had it. Knox spent many months as a galley slave. He also spent time in exile because of his Protestant beliefs. During a trip to Scotland, Knox's preaching helped the Protestant movement. Several Protestant noblemen came together and made a group called the Lords of the Congregation. When the group had more power, they invited Knox back to Scotland to stay."
"During 1500 and 1561, the Scottish Parliament accepted the Reformed confession of faith made by Knox and other people. Knox argued many times with Mary, Queen of Scots. In his book ""History of the Reformation in Scotland"" he writes about his five ""conversations"" with the Roman Catholic queen. In one of these conversations, Mary asked Knox what right he had to rebuke the queen so directly and openly. Knox replied, ""...I am a worm of this earth, and yet a subject...but I am a watchman, both over the realm (land) and the Kirk [Church] of God...For that reason I am bound in conscience (it is my duty) to blow the trumpet publicly (openly)"". Mary's violent life finally made even her Catholic helpers lose their support. She gave up the throne. So, Knox was able to make the Protestant church in Scotland. Because of him, the Presbyterian church was made."
List of Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine
"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is one of the Nobel Prizes which were created by Alfred Nobel. This award is decided by the Karolinska Institutet, a major medical center in Sweden. The Prize is given every year to a person or persons who have done excellent work in the area of medicine (treating or stopping disease) or physiology (the way the body works)."
List of Nobel Prize winners in Literature
"The Nobel Prize in Literature is one of many Nobel Prizes given in honor of Alfred Nobel. Every year, a writer is chosen by the Swedish Academy to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. They choose someone who they think has written something that has great value. The prize was awarded the first time in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France."

Timelines of COVID-19.
"On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province."
"On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, including in every province-level division of China. A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. but another source reported:"
"""The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan""."
"There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, some of whom are healthcare workers."
"Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States (Everett, Washington and Chicago), Singapore, Vietnam, France and Nepal."
"The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020."
"Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures, travel restrictions, and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak."
"As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."
"On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories."
Food and hunger.
"The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat."
"In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems."
This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home.
"All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down."
"Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said one in seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns."
Old people.
"In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,"
"40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients."
"Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this."
Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients.
Environment.
"Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work."
"The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less."
"Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs."
"The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins. With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one."
"Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed."
Stopping the next pandemic.
"Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people."
Prevention and treatment.
"Avoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoid touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%.Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. Staying home for the holidays, having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate, grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor’s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. Smoking marijuana and tobacco can further damage your lungs. Getting vaccinated can prevent new virus strains."
"In 1600, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei proved that all objects fall with the same acceleration. Therefore, the longer an object moves with constant acceleration the faster its final velocity is. Also, if different objects each having a different mass are dropped from rest (initial velocity is zero) at the same height in a vacuum, they will all hit the ground at the same velocity regardless of their mass. The experimental discoveries of Galileo and the Laws of Motion developed mathematically by Newton gave birth to modern science."
"Galileo's principle of relativity states ""It is impossible by mechanical means to say whether we are moving or staying at rest"". If two trains are moving at the same speed in the same direction, then a passenger in either train will not be able to notice that either train is moving. However, if the passenger takes a fixed frame of reference, a fixed point, like the earth, he will then be able to notice the motion of either train. Another thing, if one stands on the earth one will not be able to see that it is moving."
"This principle is just taken from observation. For example, if we are travelling by airplane at a constant speed, we can walk through the inside of the airplane without noticing anything special."
"From a practical point of view, this means that Newton's laws of motion are valid in all inertial systems, which means those at rest or those moving with constant speed relative to one considered at rest. This is the law of inertia: a body at rest continues at rest and a body in motion continues in motion in a straight line unless influenced by an external force. A Galilean coordinate system is one where the law of inertia is valid. The laws of mechanics of Galileo and Newton are valid in a Galilean coordinate system. If K is a Galilean coordinate system, then every other system K' is a Galilean coordinate system if it lies at rest or moves according to the law of inertia relative to K. Relative to K', the mechanical laws of Galileo and Newton are as valid as they are relative to K."
"If, relative to K, K' is a coordinate"
system moving according to the law of
"inertia and is devoid of rotation, then"
the laws of nature obey the same general
principles in K' as they do in K. This
"statement is known as the ""Principle of"""
"""Relativity""."
"In other words, if a mass m is at rest or is moving with constant acceleration (the constant acceleration could be equal to zero in which case the velocity would remain constant) in a straight line relative to a Galilean coordinate system K, then it will also be at rest or moving with constant acceleration in a straight line relative to a second coordinate system K' provided the law of inertia is valid in system K' (in other words, provided it is a Galilean coordinate system)."
"Therefore, if we want to observe an effect in a moving system at constant speed, we can apply the Newton laws directly. If the moving system speeds up (or we speed up relative to it, like looking at the stars from the earth) then we will have to introduce imaginary forces to compensate this effect."
These fictitious forces are called centrifugal force and coriolis force.
"Newton's Laws of Motion are mechanically accurate for speeds that are slow compared with the velocity of light. For speeds that approach the speed of light, it is necessary to apply the discoveries of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity."
"In order to describe what happens mechanically in the universe, physicists use mass, length and time. In the physics of Galileo and Newton, these quantities remain the same throughout the universe."
"With Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, these quantities can change."
Special relativity
"Special relativity (or the special theory of relativity) is a theory in physics that was developed and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. It applies to all physical phenomena, so long as gravitation is not significant. Special relativity applies to Minkowski space, or ""flat spacetime"" (phenomena which are not influenced by gravitation)."
"Einstein knew that some weaknesses had been discovered in older physics. For example, older physics thought light moved in luminiferous aether. Various tiny effects were expected if this theory were true. Gradually it seemed these predictions were not going to work out."
"Eventually, Einstein (1905) drew the conclusion that the concepts of space and time needed a fundamental revision. The result was special relativity theory, which brought together a new principle ""the constancy of the speed of light"" and the previously established ""principle of relativity""."
"Galileo had already established the principle of relativity, which said that physical events must look the same to all observers, and no observer has the ""right"" way to look at the things studied by physics. For example, the Earth is moving very fast around the Sun, but we do not notice it because we are moving with the Earth at the same speed; therefore, from our point of view, the Earth is at rest. However, Galileo's math could not explain some things, such as the speed of light. According to him, the measured speed of light should be different for different speeds of the observer in comparison with its source. However, the Michelson-Morley experiment showed that this is not true, at least not for all cases. Einstein's theory of special relativity explained this among other things."
Basics of special relativity.
"Suppose that you are moving toward something that is moving toward you. If you measure its speed, it will seem to be moving faster than if you were not moving. Now suppose you are moving away from something that is moving toward you. If you measure its speed again, it will seem to be moving more slowly. This is the idea of ""relative speed""—the speed of the object relative to you."
"Before Albert Einstein, scientists were trying to measure the ""relative speed"" of light. They were doing this by measuring the speed of star light reaching the Earth. They expected that if the Earth was moving toward a star, the light from that star should seem faster than if the Earth was moving away from that star. However, they noticed that no matter who performed the experiments, where the experiments were performed, or what star light was used, the measured speed of light in a vacuum was always the same."
"Einstein said this happens because there is something unexpected about length and duration, or how long something lasts. He thought that as Earth moves through space, all measurable durations change very slightly. Any clock used to measure a duration will be wrong by exactly the right amount so that the speed of light remains the same. Imagining a ""light clock"" allows us to better understand this remarkable fact for the case of a single light wave."
"Also, Einstein said that as Earth moves through space, all measurable lengths change (ever so slightly). Any device measuring length will give a length off by exactly the right amount so that the speed of light remains the same."
"The most difficult thing to understand is that events that appear to be simultaneous in one frame may not be simultaneous in another. This has many effects that are not easy to perceive or understand. Since the length of an object is the distance from head to tail at one simultaneous moment, it follows that if two observers disagree about what events are simultaneous then this will affect (sometimes dramatically) their measurements of the length of objects. Furthermore, if a line of clocks appear synchronized to a stationary observer and appear to be out of sync to that same observer after accelerating to a certain velocity then it follows that during the acceleration the clocks ran at different speeds. Some may even run backwards. This line of reasoning leads to general relativity."
"Other scientists before Einstein had written about light seeming to go the same speed no matter how it was observed. What made Einstein's theory so revolutionary is that it considers the measurement of the speed of light to be constant by definition, in other words it is a law of nature. This has the remarkable implications that speed-related measurements, length and duration, change in order to accommodate this."
The Lorentz transformations.
"The mathematical bases of special relativity are the Lorentz transformations, which mathematically describe the views of space and time for two observers who are moving relative to each other but are not experiencing acceleration."
"When biologists look at living things, they see that animals and plants belong to groups which have something in common. Charles Darwin explained that this followed naturally if ""we admit the common parentage of allied forms, together with their modification through variation and natural selection"".p402p456"
"For example, all insects are related. They share a basic body plan, whose development is controlled by master regulatory genes. They have six legs; they have hard parts on the outside of the body (an exoskeleton); they have eyes formed of many separate chambers, and so on. Biologists explain this with evolution. All insects are the descendants of a group of animals who lived a long time ago. They still keep the basic plan (six legs and so on) but the details change. They look different now because they changed in different ways: this is evolution."
"It was Darwin who first suggested that all life on Earth had a single origin, and from that beginning ""endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved"".p490 Evidence from molecular biology in recent years has supported the idea that all life is related by common descent."
Vestigial structures.
Strong evidence for common descent comes from vestigial structures.p397 The useless wings of flightless beetles are sealed under fused wing covers. This can be simply explained by their descent from ancestral beetles which had wings that worked.p49
"Rudimentary body parts, those that are smaller and simpler in structure than corresponding parts in ancestral species, are called vestigial organs. Those organs are functional in the ancestral species but are now either nonfunctional or re-adapted to a new function. Examples are the pelvic girdles of whales, halteres (hind wings) of flies, wings of flightless birds, and the leaves of some xerophytes (""e.g."" cactus) and parasitic plants (""e.g."" dodder)."
"However, vestigial structures may have their original function replaced with another. For example, the halteres in flies help balance the insect while in flight, and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals, and in aggressive display. The ear ossicles in mammals are former bones of the lower jaw."
"In 1893, Robert Wiedersheim published a book on human anatomy and its relevance to man's evolutionary history. This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial. This list included examples such as the appendix and the 3rd molar teeth (wisdom teeth)."
"The strong grip of a baby is another example. It is a vestigial reflex, a remnant of the past when pre-human babies clung to their mothers' hair as the mothers swung through the trees. This is borne out by the babies' feet, which curl up when it is sitting down (primate babies grip with the feet as well). All primates except modern man have thick body hair to which an infant can cling, unlike modern humans. The grasp reflex allows the mother to escape danger by climbing a tree using both hands and feet."
"Vestigial organs often have some selection against them. The original organs took resources, sometimes huge resources. If they no longer have a function, reducing their size improves fitness. And there is direct evidence of selection. Some cave crustacea reproduce more successfully with smaller eyes than do those with larger eyes. This may be because the nervous tissue dealing with sight now becomes available to handle other sensory input.p310"
Embryology.
"From the eighteenth century it was known that embryos of different species were much more similar than the adults. In particular, some parts of embryos reflect their evolutionary past. For example, the embryos of land vertebrates develop gill slits like fish embryos. Of course, this is only a temporary stage, which gives rise to many structures in the neck of reptiles, birds and mammals. The proto-gill slits are part of a complicated system of development: that is why they persisted."
"Another example are the embryonic teeth of baleen whales. They are later lost. The baleen filter is developed from different tissue, called keratin. Early fossil baleen whales did actually have teeth as well as the baleen."
"A good example is the barnacle. It took many centuries before natural historians discovered that barnacles were crustacea. Their adults look so unlike other crustacea, but their larvae are very similar to those of other crustacea."
Artificial selection.
"Charles Darwin lived in a world where animal husbandry and domesticated crops were vitally important. In both cases farmers selected for breeding individuals with special properties, and prevented the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics. The eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw a growth in scientific agriculture, and artificial breeding was part of this."
"Darwin discussed artificial selection as a model for natural selection in the 1859 first edition of his work ""On the Origin of Species"", in Chapter IV: Natural selection:"
"Nikolai Vavilov showed that rye, originally a weed, came to be a crop plant by unintentional selection. Rye is a tougher plant than wheat: it survives in harsher conditions. Having become a crop like the wheat, rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas, such as hills and mountains."
"There is no real difference in the genetic processes underlying artificial and natural selection, and the concept of artificial selection was used by Charles Darwin as an illustration of the wider process of natural selection. There are practical differences. Experimental studies of artificial selection show that ""the rate of evolution in selection experiments is at least two orders of magnitude (that is 100 times) greater than any rate seen in nature or the fossil record"".p157"
Artificial new species.
Some have thought that artificial selection could not produce new species. It now seems that it can.
"New species have been created by domesticated animal husbandry, but the details are not known or not clear. For example, domestic sheep were created by hybridisation, and no longer produce viable offspring with ""Ovis orientalis"", one species from which they are descended. Domestic cattle, on the other hand, can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox, gaur, yak, etc., as they readily produce fertile offspring with them."
"The best-documented new species came from laboratory experiments in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, ""Drosophila melanogaster,"" using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was put into the maze, and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups."
"After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas."
"Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in ""Drosophila pseudoobscura"" fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types, starch and maltose."
Dodd's experiment has been easy for others to repeat. It has also been done with other fruit flies and foods.
Observable changes.
Some biologists say that evolution has happened when a trait that is caused by genetics becomes more or less common in a group of organisms. Others call it evolution when new species appear.
"Changes can happen quickly in the smaller, simpler organisms. For example, many bacteria that cause disease can no longer be killed with some of the antibiotic medicines. These medicines have only been in use about eighty years, and at first worked extremely well. The bacteria have evolved so that they are no longer affected by antibiotics anymore. The drugs killed off all the bacteria except a few which had some resistance. These few resistant bacteria produced the next generation."
"The Colorado beetle is famous for its ability to resist pesticides. Over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides, including cyanide. This is natural selection speeded up by the artificial conditions. However, not every population is resistant to every chemical. The populations only become resistant to chemicals used in their area."
History.
"Although there were a number of natural historians in the 18th century who had some idea of evolution, the first well-formed ideas came in the 19th century. Three biologists are most important."
"Impeachment is a power that only Congress has. In ""Nixon v. United States"" (1993), the Supreme Court ruled that even they cannot review or change the Senate's decision in an impeachment trial. Its impeachment powers give Congress a way to make sure that no executive officials or judges are getting corrupt."
"""High crimes and misdemeanors""."
"The Constitution says clearly that officials can be impeached for treason or bribery. But it does not say exactly what ""High crimes and Misdemeanors"" includes or does not include. ""High crimes"" is a phrase from old British law that means crimes committed by people with political power. However, in British history, ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" could include many different things (even losing a ship by not tying it up). After the Constitution was written, Alexander Hamilton explained in ""The Federalist Papers"" what kind of causes for impeachment the Founders had in mind: ""offences which [come] from the abuse or violation of some public trust. [They cause] injuries done immediately to the society itself."""
"Congress has made the meaning of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" clearer by who they have chosen to impeach, and why. Since the Constitution was ratified, the House of Representatives has impeached 18 people - mostly judges, but also two Presidents. All but three of these 18 were impeached for crimes other than treason or bribery. For example:"
Dissenting opinion
"A dissenting opinion (or dissent) is an opinion in a legal case. It is written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court. In some cases, they simply declare a disagreement with the majority opinion. In other cases they may be used to instruct, prod, or otherwise try to convince other justices of the point of view expressed by the minority."
"When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report."
"Dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions. They are also delivered and published at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. However, they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law. A later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular rule of law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often highlight the precise holding of the majority opinion. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes stated in 1936: ""A dissent in a Court of last resort is an appeal""."
"The dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the existing case law, the application of different principles, or a different interpretation of the facts."
Legal opinion
"In law, a legal opinion is usually a written explanation by a judge or group of judges that accompanies an order or ruling in a case. Legal opinions may also be written by legal experts. A legal opinion is used to lay out the rationale (reasons for) and legal principles for the ruling."
"Opinions are usually published at the direction of the court. They may be used to reinforce, explain, change, establish, or overturn legal precedent. If a court decides that an opinion should be published, the opinion is included in a volume from a series of books called law reports or case reports. Published opinions of courts are also collectively referred to as case law, which is one of the major sources of law in common law legal systems."
Judicial opinion
"A judicial opinion is a form of legal opinion written by a judge or a panel of judges explaining how they resolved a legal dispute. It cites the decision reached to resolve the dispute. A judicial opinion usually includes the reasons behind the decision. Where there are three or more judges, it may take the form of a majority opinion, minority opinion or a concurring opinion."
Concurring opinion
"In law, a concurring opinion is a written opinion by one or more judges of a court which agrees with the decision made by the majority of the court, but states different (or additional) reasons for the decision. It may also be used to add comments. When no absolute majority of the court can agree on the basis for deciding the case, the decision of the court may be contained in a number of concurring opinions. The concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is called the plurality opinion."
"Having failed to receive a majority of the court's votes, concurring opinions are not binding precedent (common law) and cannot be cited as such. But concurring opinions can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive precedent (assuming there is no binding precedent already in effect). The conflict in views between a majority opinion and a concurring opinion can assist a lawyer in understanding the points of law in the majority opinion. Occasionally, a judge will use a concurring opinion to signal that he or she is open to certain types of ""test cases"" that would allow the development of a new legal rule. In turn, such a concurring opinion may become more famous than the majority opinion in the same case. A well-known example of this phenomenon is ""Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co."" (1944)."
Concurring opinions by region.
"In some courts, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered parts. Concurring justices may state that they join some parts of the majority opinion, but not others, for the reasons given in their concurring opinion. In other courts, such as the Supreme Court of California, the same justice may write a majority opinion ""and"" a separate concurring opinion to express additional reasons in support of the judgment"
Seriatim
"In law, seriatim (Latin for ""in series"") indicates that a court is addressing multiple issues in a certain order, such as the order that the issues were originally presented to the court."
Legal usage.
"A seriatim opinion describes an opinion delivered by a court with multiple judges, in which each judge reads his or her own opinion rather than a single judge writing an opinion on behalf of the entire court. This is a practice generally used when a legal case does not have a majority opinion."
"Use of the word, and other Latin phrases, has become less frequent in legal communications as a result of, among other factors, efforts by groups such as the Plain Language Movement to promote the use of ""plain English"" in legal discourse."
In the United Kingdom.
"In modern use pleadings is used for ""one by one in sequence"". For example, in English civil cases, defence statements generally used to conclude with the phrase ""save as expressly admitted herein, each allegation of the plaintiffs is denied as if set out in full and traversed herein ""seriatim""."" This formulation is now discouraged under the English Civil Procedure Rules, especially rule 16.5 (3)-(5)."
"It is sometimes seen in older deeds and contracts as a more traditional way of using terms of reference. For example ""the railway by-laws shall apply to the contract as if set out herein ""seriatim""."" It is sometimes found as part of the longer phrase ""brevatim et seriatim"", meaning ""briefly and in series""."
Ante Starčević
Ante Starčević (23 May 1823 – 28 February 1896) was a Croatian politician and publisher.
Life.
"Starčević was born in Žitnik near Gospić, a small town of the Military Frontiers, in what was then part of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of a Serb Orthodox mother and Catholic father. In 1845, he graduated from secondary school in Zagreb. He started his studies at the seminary (school where people can learn how to become a priest or minister) in Senj, but moved to Pest in the year of 1845 so he could go to a Roman Catholic theological (of the study of God or gods) seminary - which he finished in 1848. After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes, he earned a honoris causa degree in the year of 1846. Starčević quickly returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj. Instead of becoming a priest, he chose to get involved in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav Šram in Zagreb."
"He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb. As he was unsuccessful, he stayed in Šram's office until 1861 even though he was no longer allowed to practice law since 1857. He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska, a Croatian cultural society, in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of ""Neven"", a literary magazine."
"In 1861, he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume county. That same year, he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and started the Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik. Starčević would be reelected to the parliament in 1865, 1871, and from 1878 to his death."
"In 1862, when Fiume was the scene of protests against Austrian Empire, he had to stay in prison for one month because he was thought to be enemy of the government. When he was released, Starčević returned to Šram's office, where he stayed until 11 October 1871, when he was arrested again, this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt. The rebellion was started by Kvaternik, who was not a Serb hater as his political ally Starčević. Kvaternik had become convinced that a political solution, as Starčević called for, was not possible. While several hundred men were rebelling against the government, both Croats and Serbs, it was soon defeated by Imperial Austrian troops. The Croatian Party of Rights didn't exist anymore. Starčević was released after two months in prison."
"In the last decade of the 19th century, he moved to Starčević House (""Starčevićev dom""), built for him by the Party of Rights in 1895. He died in his house a year later, when he was 73. According to his wish, he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of Šestine. His statue was made by Ivan Rendić. At his deathbed, he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor, but his statue was put up in front of Starčević House in 1998."
Political activity.
"After being banned from practicing law in 1857, Starčević travelled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from the empire's eastern rival. When this failed, he travelled to France, pinning his hopes on French emperor Napoleon III. While in Paris, he published his work ""La Croatie et la confédération italienne"", considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights' political program. In 1859, the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence, during which time Starčević returned to Croatia. Austria lost control over Italy, and Austria's weakening status in the world paved the way for Starčević's career."
"As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861, Starčević wrote ""the four petitions of the Rijeka county"", which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights. He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements. He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands, ""the large kingdom of Croatia of old"" (the Middle Age's Kingdom of Croatia), the homeland of one people, ""with the same blood, language, past and (God willing) future""."
"On that ideological basis, he founded the Croatian Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861. The Party of Rights was clerical, conservative, and pro-Habsburg. Its only concession to nationalism was hostility to the Serbs who, since the incorporation of the ""military frontiers"" into Croatia in 1868, made up a quarter of the population. Starčević was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaternik's draft constitution of 26 June 1861. He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria."
"He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility. Starčević believed that Bosniaks were the ""the best Croats"", and claimed that ""Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood""."
Literary and publishing work.
"Starčević wrote literary criticism, short stories, newspaper articles, philosophical essays, plays and political satire. He was also a translator."
"His travelogue ""From Lika"" was published in Kušlan's magazine ""Slavenski Jug"" on 22 October 1848. He wrote four plays in the period 1851-52, but only the ""Village Prophet"" has been preserved. His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in ""Danica"" in 1853. His critical review (1855) of Đurđević's ""Pjesni razlike"" was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as ""our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature"". His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy, which he calls ""the science of life"". As Josip Horvat said: ""His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante Starčević the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko Bogović."""
"In 1850, incited by Ljudevit Gaj, Starčević started working on the manuscript of ""Istarski razvod"", a crucial Croatian document from 1325. He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet, analyzed it and published it in 1852. In the foreword, young Starčević elaborated his linguistic ideas, pointing out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects (Shtokavian, Chakavian) and Kajkavian) and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language, which Starčević considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history. Starčević accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life, considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian. His language is a ""synthetic"" form of Croatian, never used before or after him, most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski, whom he probably never read."
"In that period, in the ""Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar"" (8 December, 1851) he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. He continued his dispute with the followers of Karadžić in a series of articles published in 1852. His opposition to the Vuk's work he 'supported' by utter denial of the Serbs as the nation, their language, their culture and history. In his vain and racistic effors to oppose and derail Karadžić's work, he was loner and loser - mainstream of the Croatian educated men, headed by Strossmayer and Gaj, highly appreciated and supported Karadžić. It was demonstrated publicly immediately after Karadžić's death - when Croatian Parliament (Sabor) collected a considerable amount of money in order to erect a monument to honor Karadžić in Croatia and the Court chanchellor Ivan Mažuranić got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support the Karadžić' widow."
"When ""Srbski dnevnik"" from Novi Sad published an article saying that ""Croatians write in Serbian"", Starčević wrote a fierce reply: ""(...) Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language, those writers who consider themselves Serbs (or whatever they like) would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language, like some of them are already doing, and they can call their language Coptic for all I care. (...)"" He published the reply as an unsigned article in ""Narodne novine"", the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj, so the Serbian side attacked Gaj, wrongly attributing the article to him. Starčević subsequently proclaimed he was the author, but Gaj, who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia, distanced himself from his friend."
"For his political activity and literary work, Starčević is commonly called Father of the Nation (""Otac domovine"") in Croatia. His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 Croatian kuna banknote, issued in 1993."
Racism and antisemitism.
"Starčević was a racist and an anti-Semite. His understanding of the basic human rights and the way he linked them to the civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective. For example, Starčević criticized the socialism as """"unshaped"" and he was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that ""Algeria should be densely populated by a few million of happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs""""."
"Starčević had based his ideological views on writings of those ancient Greek writers who thought that some people, by their very nature, are slaves, for they had """"just half of the human mind"" and, for that reason, they ""shall be governed by people of the human nature"""". About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races - he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the ""breed"" word to mark them."
"He wrote a whole tract about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sentences: ""Jews ... are the breed, except a few, without any morality and without any homeland, the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain, or to its relatives' gain. To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous: throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water - then all the water will be puddled. That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much""."
"But, for Starčević, there was a race worse than the Jews. For him, the """"Slavoserb"" notion was firstly of a political nature: the ""Slavoserbs"" are his political opponents who ""sold themselves to a foreign rule"""". Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them (the South Slavs) as the Croats."
"Later, and with years, Starčević more and more marked the """"Slavoserbs"" as a separate ethnic group, or - as he used to say the ""breed"", ranked, as humans, lower than the Jews: ""The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs. For the Jews care for themselves and their people ... but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil: if they cannot gain a benefit, then they tend to harm the good or just affair, or to harm those who are for the affair."""" - he wrote once."
"Further, he claimed that the injustice was done to different """"cursed breeds"" what spoiled those breeds even more and made them ""to be vengeful against their oppressors"". As a convinced racist, he stresses that to the ""cursed breeds"""", i.e. to the lower races should not be given any role in the public life."
"As an aged man, he makes the Serbs identical to the """"Slavoserb breed"" and mocks them for their defeats they suffered long ago - which provoked negative reactions even in his ""Party of Rights"". On that occasion, the Party member Erazmo Barčić (1894.) described Starčević's mockery and racism as ""throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives""""."
"However, when once face with negative reactions to his open racism, he temporarily retreated. That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda, issue of 23 March, 1883: ""The main thing is this: everybody should work for the people and the homeland, and let them call themselves as they wish... We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside... We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same... Therefore, everybody can assume the name of Hottentots, every person can choose their own name, as long as we are all free and happy!..."""
Starčević's racism and its followers.
The British historian A.P.J.Taylor wrote (pages 188-189):
"The seeds are planted in spring and the seedlings planted out 40–50 cm apart. Hyssop can also be propagated from cuttings or root division in spring or autumn. Hyssop should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil, and will benefit from occasional clipping. It does not live long, and the plants need to be replaced every few years. It is good for use as a low hedge or border within an herb garden."
Hyssop in a garden.
"Hyssop also has uses in the garden. It is said to be a good companion plant to cabbage because it will deter the cabbage white butterfly. It has also ""been found to improve the yield from grapevines if planted along the rows, particularly if the terrain is rocky or sandy, and the soil is not as easy to work as it might be."" Hyssop is said to be bad for radishes, and they should not be grown nearby. Hyssop also attracts bees, hoverflies and butterflies, and so has a place in the wild garden as well as being useful in controlling pests and encouraging pollination without the use of unnatural methods."
Leaves.
Hyssop leaves can be preserved by drying. Hyssop is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth.
Usage.
"Hyssop is used as an ingredient in eau de Cologne and the liqueur Chartreuse. It is also used to color the alcohol Absinthe, along with the Melissa plant and Roman wormwood. Hyssop is also used, usually in combination with other herbs such as liquorice, in herbal remedies, especially for lung conditions. Hyssop also kills bacteria, makes capillaries stronger, and reduces inflammation. It can help with about 81 different illnesses including cancer, bronchitis, insomnia, edema, colds, etc. When eaten in extract or tea form it gets rid of mucus in the respiratory tract, which relieves congestion, can regulate blood pressure, and can dispel gas. It also helps with circulatory problems, epilepsy, fever, gout, and weight problems. Poultices can be made from fresh hyssop to help heal wounds. It should not be used during pregnancy."
Ritual use.
"Hyssop is a sacred plant used in Judaism. It appears a lot in the Hebrew Bible as Ezov. In Exodus 12:22 the Jews in Egypt are instructed to ""Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning."" It is used by the priests in the Temple of Solomon for purification rites of various kinds in Leviticus 14:4-7, 14:49-52, 19:6, 18. Hyssop is also often used to fill the Catholic ceremonial Aspergillum, which the priest dips into a bowl of holy water, and sprinkles onto the congregation to bless them. However, researchers say that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop. It might actually be one of a number of different herbs."
The Talmud calls the hyssop אברתא and considers it to be an herbal remedy for indigestion.
In foods.
"Hyssop leaves have a slightly bitter minty flavor and can be added to soups, salads or meats, but it should be used sparingly as the flavour is very strong."
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is one of the most important results of twentieth century physics. It relates to measurements of sub-atomic particles. Certain pairs of measurements such as (a) where a particle is and (b) where it is going (its position and momentum) cannot be precisely pinned down.p96
"Albert Einstein thought that such a quantum theory could give us only a partial description of nature.p99 He thought that Heisenberg's discovery showed that human knowledge is limited, but he also thought that nature is absolute. That is, he thought that there is no ""uncertainty"" in nature, and that the uncertainty exists only in our knowledge about it. However, many other scientists disagree with Einstein."
"Heisenberg's idea is that if something like an electron were shot into a big box with a certain speed and in a certain direction, then it would be possible to calculate a fairly accurate idea of what its path would be like in the future. However, if the box were made smaller then we would have a more certain idea of where it was located, and because of that we would have to have a less certain idea of how it was traveling. American physicist Brian Greene gave the analogy of a moth which flies placidly around in a large closet but who flies frantically back and forth and up and down when placed in a glass jar.p114 Another interesting uncertainty phenomenon, which makes possible many electronic devices, is called quantum tunneling. In our everyday life, people cannot move through walls. However, electrons can move through solid walls.p115 In the animation to the right, you can see a faint white puff on the right side of the wall after a big puff hits the wall from the left. That dim spot of light represents the photon or other atomic particle which tunnels through the wall."
Confusion with observer effect.
"Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect. This says that measurements of some systems cannot be made without affecting the systems. Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level as a physical ""explanation"" of quantum uncertainty."
"However, it is now clear that the uncertainty principle is a property of all wave-like systems. It arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, ""the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology"". ""Measurement"" does not mean just a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer&lt;/u/l&gt;."
The idea of indeterminacy.
"The uncertainty principle came from Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. Max Planck already knew that the energy of a unit of light is proportional to the frequency of that unit of light (formula_2), and that its amount of energy can be expressed in familiar terms such as the joule by using a proportionality constant. The constant he gave the world is now called the Planck constant and is represented by the letter h. When matrices are used to express quantum mechanics, frequently two matrices have to be multiplied to get a third matrix that gives the answer the physicist is trying to find. But multiplying a matrix such as P (for momentum) by a matrix such as X (for position) gives a different answer matrix from the one you get when you multiply X by P. The result of multiplying P by X and X by P and then comparing them always involves the Planck constant as a factor. The number used to write the Planck constant will always depend on the system of measurement in use. (With a certain system of measurement, its numerical value is one.) The slope of the line in the diagram to the right that shows the ratio of frequency to energy will also depend on the system of measurement chosen."
The following diagrams show what happens when we try to measure both location and momentum.
"The practical result of this mathematical discovery is that when a physicist makes position more clear then momentum becomes less clear, and that when the physicist makes momentum more clear then position becomes less clear. Heisenberg said that things are ""indeterminate,"" and other people liked to say that they were ""uncertain."" But the mathematics shows that it is the things in the world that are indeterminate or ""fuzzy,"" and not that it is just that humans are uncertain about what is going on."
Putting indeterminacy into mathematical form.
Here we will show the first equation that gave the basic idea later shown in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
"Heisenberg's groundbreaking paper of 1925 does not use and does not even mention matrices. Heisenberg's great success was the ""scheme which was capable in principle of determining uniquely the relevant physical qualities (transition frequencies and amplitudes)"" of hydrogen radiation."
"After Heisenberg wrote his breakthrough paper, he gave it to one of his teachers to fix up and went on a vacation. Max Born was puzzled by the equations and the non-commuting equations that even Heisenberg thought were a problem. After several days Born realized that these equations were directions for writing out matrices. Matrices were new and strange, even for mathematicians of that time, but how to do math with them was already clearly known. He and a few others worked everything out in matrix form before Heisenberg came back from his time off, and within a few months the new quantum mechanics in matrix form gave them the basis for another paper."
"Max Born saw that when the matrices that represent pq and qp were calculated they would not be equal. Heisenberg had already seen the same thing in terms of his original way of writing things out, and Heisenberg may have guessed what was almost immediately obvious to Born—that the difference between the answer matrices for pq and for qp would always involve two factors that came out of Heisenberg's original math: Planck's constant h and i, which is the square root of negative one. So the very idea of what Heisenberg preferred to call the ""indeterminacy principle"" (usually known as the uncertainty principle) was hiding in Heisenberg's original equations."
"Heisenberg had been looking at changes that happen in an atom when an electron changes its energy level and so gets closer to the center of its atom or gets farther from its center, and, especially, situations in which an electron falls to a lower energy state in two steps. Max Born explained how he took Heisenberg's strange ""recipe"" for finding the product, C, of some change in an atom from energy level n to energy level n-b, which involved taking the sum of multiplying one change in something called A (which could be, for instance, the frequency of some photon) produced by a change of energy of an electron in the atom between energy state n and energy state n-a) by a succeeding change in something called B (which could be, for instance, the amplitude of a change) produced by another change in energy state from n-a to n-b):"
and discovered something ground breaking:
By consideration of ...examples...[Heisenberg] found this rule... This was in the summer of 1925. Heisenberg...took leave of absence...and handed over his paper to me for publication...
"This was because the main goal was to capture the imagination of the European people. The harem was at the center of European sexual fantasies. Naked and half-naked women in the harem were the subject of many Orientalist paintings, but painters rarely ever got to see an actual harem. Other popular images used by Orientalist painters included mainly concubines and exotic landscapes. The Orient was often eroticized, the Muslim was presented as a violent and sexually perverted person, and the Muslim woman was viewed as oppressed and enslaved by the Muslim male. Travel stories, literary works, and artistic works contributed strongly to create the image of a strange, different, exotic, and dangerous Orient."
Scholarly Orientalism.
Philology as a career.
"Starting from the 19th century, the term Orientalism was used to indicate also a scholarly field specialized in Oriental languages and sacred ancient texts. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, studies about Sanskrit, Persian, and Egyptian hieroglyphs started to become very popular. New institutions were established during this period to help developing these studies. In 1795 was established the School of Living Oriental Languages in Paris in 1795, in 1821 the Societe Asiatique, the Royal Asiatic society in London in 1834, the American Oriental society in 1842."
"Philology was considered to be the only necessary thing to understand Oriental civilizations. Orient was a wide and vague term. However, it was clear that the Orientalists studied mostly the Islam and Muslims rather than India and China. Over the time the Oriental studies were divided into more specific labels such as “Near Eastern” and “East Asian” departments. Finally, at the beginning of the 20th century the term “Middle East” was invented by the US army."
Orientalist assumptions.
"Every Orientalist assumption about the East starts with the premise that the Europeans were the modern colonizers, and the Orientals were the backward subjects. “Belonging to a country with definite interests in the Orient” has surely influenced the point of view of these scholars about the East. According to the Orientalist vision, the Orient and Orientals were objects of study, and the Europeans were the subjects. Orientalism was based upon the belief in a basic difference between the East and the West, and deeply influenced by the Essentialism. According to this current of thought, human history is divided into civilizations with their own unique and unchangeable essences. The people and their characteristics could be understood by studying these unchanging cultural essences in the ancient and authoritative texts of the classical period (the Golden age in Islam is a period that goes from the 8th to the 14th century). The interest in the present conditions of the Muslims and their current thoughts were not important for a good comprehension. That is why the Oriental scholar was typically a philologist. From this ideology originated the abstract concept of the homo Islamicus, or Arabicus. This homo Islamicus was a specific type of human being, had a fixed mindset, and was clearly opposed to the Western mindset. In fact, the Islamic civilization was considered, in these essentialist terms, a coherent civilization that remained the same in all times and places, from the rise of Islam until today. Islam was considered the opposite of Western civilization, rigid, inflexible, tyrannical, in decline, hostile to outside influences, inferior, and these characteristics were considered part of the essence of the Islamic civilization. Instead, the Western civilization was considered modern, rational, liberal, advanced, and the top of the human hierarchy. “The West”, by defining “the Orient”, was defining itself. Orientalists believed that Islamic civilization reached its prime under the Abbasid dynasty during the 8th/10th century, and then gradually lost its energy and vigor. A clear example of this way of thinking can be found in the lecture “Islam and science” that Ernest Renan (France’s most important philologist and scholar of religion) gave at University of Sorbonne of Paris in 1883. Islam was considered inferior, not rational, opposed to the science, and the Muslim was fanatical. Renan affirmed that the period of splendor during the Abbasid dynasty was due only to the scientific tradition of Greek antiquity that was been preserved until that moment. This kind of discourse supported the idea of Western superiority and legitimized European colonialism."
Persistence of Orientalist assumptions through the 20th century.
"Similar views were still present in the 20th century and can be traced in many important academic works such as ""The Decline of the West"" (1918) by Oswald Spengler, or ""A study of history"" by Arnold Toynbee (1934-61); both works present Orientalist concepts. Another important book, ""The government of the Ottoman Empire in the time of Suleiman the Magnificient"" was written by Albert Howe Lybyer in 1913. Lybyer was not able to read the Turkish Ottoman language, but several generations of scholars accepted his argumentations until the 50s and 60s. He argued that the period of maximum splendor of the Ottoman empire, in the 15th/16th century under the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, occurred because Christian subjects from the Balkans and Caucasus ruled the institutions of the Empire. Once the Islam played a central role in the government, the Ottoman empire became ineffective and decadent."
"Hamilton Gibb and Harold Bowen published ""Islamic society and the West"" in 1950-57. Gibb was one of the most famous Orientalist of his day. In this book, they affirm that until the 19th century the Islamic society was not influenced by the Western civilization. Islam was an expression of a fixed and unchangeable set of beliefs valid to every place and time. Problems that Muslims were facing during the 20th century could be understood through the medieval Islamic thought. Bowen and Gibbs portrayed an Islamic civilization that remained the same during the centuries, characterized by of despotism and lack of cohesion. They ignored the different forms of Islam practiced in the world. From Morocco to Indonesia, all was considered the same static and rigid Islamic society."
Orientalist knowledge and colonial power.
"The Orientalist scholarship was in part used by colonial powers to justify colonialism. Silvestre de Sacy, the most important Orientalist scholar of his period, advised the French government during the invasion of Algeria in 1830. In the early 20th century, the Orientalist scholar Snouck Hurgonje helped the Dutch government in the formulation of the policies during the colonization of Indonesia. Thomas Edward Lawrence, famous for his nickname “Lawrence of Arabia”, was an Orientalist scholar and student of the Oxford Orientalist and archeologist D.G. Hogarth. Lawrence was sent by the British government to Arabia to join the Arab rebel forces in the “Arab revolt” during the First World War. Lord Cromer is a great example to see how colonial power and Orientalist knowledge were connected. Cromer was general counsel of the British protectorate of Egypt from 1883 to 1907, and was considered an authoritative figure on Egypt and the Orient. In 1908 published ‘""Modern Egypt’"". He gave an account of his permanence in Egypt. In his narrative, we find all the characteristic elements of Orientalism. In fact, he placed a clear distinction between the rational and advanced West, and the irrational and submissive East. Muslim women were seen as enslaved, and Islam as an unchanging, backward, and oppressive religion. He affirms that the Egyptians are incapable of governing themselves, highlighting instead the civilizing mission of the British colonists."
Orientalism by Edward Said.
"Orientalism is a theory put forward by Edward Said in his book, ""Orientalism"" (1978)."
"Edward Said was born in Jerusalem in 1935, but he mostly grew up in Cairo, Egypt. Said completed his education in the United States. He graduated from Princeton university, and earned his doctorate at Harvard university in English literature. He then became a famous professor at Columbia university. Edward Said wrote about the situation between Israel and Palestine. His statements were shared by the PLO, (the Palestine Liberation Organization is the most important Palestinian political organization, founded in the 1964). In 1977, Edward Said was elected as an independent to the PLO's parliament, the Palestine National Council. Said started to criticize the way in which Arabs and Muslims were portrayed as different and inferior by the West. In 1978 his book ""'Orientalism""' was published. The book had a huge impact, it quickly gained popularity, and was translated in more than 35 languages. The book explores how the West depicts the East. The West depicted the East as 'Other' and essentially inferior. This 'Otherness' helped the West to justify the colonisation of the East. Edward Said defines Orientalism as: """"a way of coming to terms with the Orient that is based on the Orient's special place in European Western experience."""" Said also states that the West has portrayed itself as the contrary of the Orient. He shows this with an example, a quote from Sir Alfred Lyall (English philosopher, editor, clergyman and traveller) to illustrate the way of thinking of 17th-century Europeans: """"On the one hand there are Westerners, and on the other there are Arab-Orientals; the former are (in no particular order) rational, peaceful, liberal, logical, capable of holding real values, without natural suspicion; the latter are none of these things."""" The relationship between the Orient and Occident goes way back, European powers like France and Britain have a long history in the Orient, influencing it, imperialising and colonising it. This domination was imposed especially as of 1798, after Napoleon's expedition in Egypt. Said states that the relationship between the Orient and Occident is one of power. The Orient, seen as a place of sensuality, immorality, exoticism. and authoritarianism, is compared to the West, defined as being rational, liberal, moral, diametrically the opposite. In this way, the Orient has been made oriental by the West. Said states that we should not think that Orientalism was only an idea, but something more pervasive, that has been influencing our ideas, culture, clothing, and so on. These ideas keep Orientalism alive still today."
"To define the concept of Orientalism, Said was deeply influenced by the French thinker Michel Foucault and his theory of power and knowledge. A second important figure for Edward Said was the Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci, known for his theories about the cultural hegemony. Gramsci states that rulers do not obtain their power by being violent; instead, through the ideology, they induce the people to accept their power. Using a similar logic, Said stated that the West had legitimated its hegemony over the Orient by promoting certain ways of thinking."
Orientalism today.
Films.
Examples of Orientalism can be found even nowadays in the media culture.
"The Disney Company was criticized for only producing movies featuring white characters. In response to this, from the 1980s, Disney started producing movies such as Pocahontas, Mulan and Aladdin, featuring non-white characters. Aladdin was Disney's first movie taking place in the Middle East, with a non-white princess. Nevertheless, the movie received a lot of criticism because of how the Middle Eastern people, places, and cultures were shown. Many people protested to change the lyric of the song at the beginning of the film: “""""Where they cut off your ear If they don’t like your face. It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home., since it described the Middle East as a violent, scary, and barbaric place. The women were portrayed as integrally veiled, dressed in belly dancing-outfits, playing with Bengal tigers. They were exoticized, and not in line with the reality. Jasmine and Aladdin, the main characters, speak with an American accent and have lighter skins than the villain Jafar, who has an Anglo-Arab accent."
Edward Said
"Edward Wadie Said (1935-2003) was a Palestinian academic. He came up with the theory of Orientalism (1978) and wrote the book ""Culture and Imperialism"" (1993)""."""
Early Life.
"Edward Wadie Said was born on 1 November 1935, son of Hilda Said and Wadie Said. He was born during the time the British ruled over Palestine. He was raised as a Christian Palestinian, though he would later become agnostic. He was trained as a pianist, though this was not the main focus of his career."
Education.
"Said attended St George's School, which is a British boys' school in East Jersualem. He would later study in Victoria College, Alexandria, before moving to the US. He graduated from Princeton University in 1957. He completed his Masters and PhD at Harvard University."
Career.
"Said published Orientalism in 1978, and ""Culture and Imperialism"" in 1993. He was a leading founder of a field of academic study known as Postcolonial Studies."
Death.
Said died on 24 September 2003. The cause of his death was leukaemia.
History.
"The important material of a given era is often its defining point. Examples are the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age."
"Materials science originally studied ceramics and metallurgy. These ancient crafts make materials science one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs showed that the physical properties of a material were related to its atomic structure. As the phases changed, so did the physical properties of the material."
"Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in the construction of space exploration vehicles."
"Materials science is now linked to the development of plastics, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, magnetic materials, medical implant materials and biological materials."
"The material scientist/engineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms. So, ingot casting, foundry techniques, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a metallurgist/engineer. Often the presence, absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced, for instance, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact of the quality of steel that may be produced."
Cause of failures.
"The study of disasters in the 19th and 20th century led to some important discoveries. A.A. Griffith (1893–1963) discovered that real materials never get near their theoretical strength. This was a groundbreaking discovery which led to changes in many industries. As an example, steel gets almost 1/10th of its theoretical strength, but most solids are 100 to 1000 times weaker than expected."
"Griffith's insights were developed further by J.E. Gordon (1913–1998). Gordon said that all simple solids are by their nature brittle. Toughness – resistance to fracture – has to be designed into materials. The usual way is to add other material to the pure substance. This makes its structure more complex, and that makes it less likely to fail. A good example is bulletproof glass, where a plastic layer stuck to glass make it many times stronger than either material would be separately. The personal armour based on Kevlar is another example. Biological materials have this feature naturally. Bones do bend a little before they reach breaking point, and tree trunks also have some ""give""."
Metal alloys.
"The industrial study of metal alloys is a large part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present. Increasing carbon levels leads to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however. Cast Iron is defined as an Iron-Carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium. Nickel and molybdenum are also found in stainless steels."
"Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications."
Polymers.
"Polymers are also an important part of materials science. They are the raw materials used to make what we commonly call plastics. Plastics are really the final product. They are made when polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing. The mixture is then shaped into a final form. Common polymers are, include polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates."
"PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to an incredible array of uses, from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling, packaging and containers. It is simple to make. It accepts a wide range of plasticisers and other additives, which give it differing properties."
Ceramics and glasses.
"Another application of the material sciences is the structures of glass and ceramics, typically associated with the most brittle materials. Ceramics and glasses use covalent bonds and ionic-covalent bonds with SiO2, silica or sand, as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay and as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. Glass forms into an amorphous structure when it is cooled. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics."
"Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness, high temperature, and stability under compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silica carbide, and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties."
Composite materials.
"Another application of material science in industry is the making of composite materials. Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), The light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1510 °C (2750 °F) and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide."
"Other examples can be seen in the ""plastic"" casings of television sets, cell-phones and similar objects. These plastic casings are usually a composite material. It is a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose."
New magnetic material.
A new magnetic material has been discovered. It could transform computer hard drives and energy storage devices.
"A highly sensitive metal bilayer needs only a small shift in temperature to dramatically alter its magnetism. This is a very useful property in electronic engineering. ""No other material known to man can do this. It's a huge effect. And we can engineer it"", said Ivan Schuller, of the University of California, San Diego."
"The material combines thin layers of nickel and vanadium oxide. This is a structure which is surprisingly responsive to heat. ""We can control the magnetism in just a narrow range of temperature without applying a magnetic field. And in principle we could also control it with voltage or current"", said Prof Schuller."
Classes of materials.
"Materials science encompasses various classes of materials, each of which may constitute a separate field. Materials are sometimes classified by the type of bonding present between the atoms:"
Catwalk
"A catwalk is a raised walkway. The term is most often used for fashion shows, where models walk along showing off the clothes. A catwalk on a ship is a passageway above decks. A similar term is runway, but it need not be off the ground."
Movie.
"""Catwalk"", a documentary on life on the fashion runways, was filmed in 1993 by director Robert Leacock. The movie followed models Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon, Kate Moss, and Carla Bruni as they jetted around London, Milan, Paris, and New York during Spring Fashion Week, including behind-the-scenes footage. The movie was shot in black and white and colour, and featured many top designers at work, like a young John Galliano, Justin Thomas, Karl Lagerfeld, and Gianni Versace four years before his death."
Uh-huh.
Does San Antonio
"you said San Antonio, right?"
Uh-huh.
"Do you have just one paper,"
or do you have several?
No.
"There are two,"
and they're pretty close.
"Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
I grew up near Houston
Uh-huh.
"and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
"and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff."
Uh-huh.
"It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
"and I enjoy,"
the comics are better in this newspaper.
This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
"So,"
"I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends."
Do you?
"I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,"
and I can afford that.
Yeah.
"I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,"
"but I sort of have a liberal political slant,"
"and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook."
"And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers."
I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
"He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers,"
"I'm, I'm a free-lance writer right now."
Oh.
"And then, um, what I'm doing is working at, um, a an electronics company,  for their company newspaper,  right now on the side,"
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"and then I'm also,"
"actually, I'm excited, tomorrow I have a, uh, luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do,  uh, marketing communications for them."
Huh.
"Huh, okay,"
"I'm a, I'm a news reporter, now,"
Oh you are?
"and what I'm looking for is something in, I really don't want to stay in news,"
"but I would like to stay in journalism,"
and I've been looking for something exactly like that
Here's what you
"this is off the topic,"
"Yeah,"
"well, you know,"
"That's, that's the part that,"
"t-, whether my dentist or"
"That's the part that scares me, you know."
"I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,"
"well no,"
"it's for homosexuals and gays,"
"well no,"
"actually, it's,"
"I mean, you know."
Did they know that all along?
"and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes."
"And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not."
Can't get it from mosquitoes.
"And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,"
"Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, we were talking about child care"
and he asked me if I had any kids.
He was about forty or fifty years old
"and I said no, I'm just twenty,"
"He was ancient,"
yeah.
"and I said no, I'm just twenty-three,  you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children"
Uh-huh.
"but the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your life."
"And I just,"
"I,"
"my, my mind just went,"
You didn't know what you're going to be missing.
"I went, what. You know,"
"because it it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children,"
I don't have any either
"and I've been a married for eleven years,"
so.
"Yeah,"
"and I, it just, you know,"
"I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like,  just because, I'm not sure if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my career."
"Yeah,"
"when it's time,"
uh-huh.
"I'm trying to go somewhere, and,  and get there quick and then worry about, you know, because right now, in my career I'm, I'm really starting out,"
"Yeah,"
"you want to establish,"
and it's going to take me a while to move up.
"Uh-huh,"
"And I don't need anything kind of holding me back, um."
"I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean."
Yeah.
"I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,"
"but I, I, uh, you know,"
"Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,"
"but, you know, up here we have Kodak"
Right.
and that's the worst polluter.
"They put, uh, uh,"
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
I guess so.
"Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras"
"and they, they make film here"
and they're the worst offender
"but it's, you know, it's under so much control."
"You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them"
but that's really getting under control now.
Right.
"I, you know, I don't know in air what they do."
"Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about."
"Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,"
"my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas"
"and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there"
"and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air."
"I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,"
"there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad."
"Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,"
so I guess we better get off.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
It was good talking to you.
Alright.
Bye-bye now.
Bye.
"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all."
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something"
"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything."
"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something"
"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,"
"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else."
"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,"
and he'll do it.
"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,"
"but he has changed, um, the brakes"
and he has done all of the tune-ups
and the like that
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.
I was really impressed with that
"We had to have it to get the car inspected,"
it wouldn't pass inspection
"and, and so, he priced around"
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did"
"and then, he did it"
"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,"
"what, uh, what's your experience been like?"
"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars."
"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette"
"I'm not with you so far,"
"Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up."
I'll remember the name.
"But, uh, anyway, that was a French movie"
Uh-huh.
"it was, um, that was the last one I saw downtown,"
"but I live in D C well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown"
"Oh, yeah."
"but, uh, so this, uh, French I guess are into the"
"I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too."
"They have, they have a"
Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated of sophisticated American everywhere.
Right.
"But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy,"
"and there's something about it that's so innovative, you know,"
"he'll have trouble picking up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something,"
"but there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,"
there's something about the human character in it
"Oh, uh-huh."
"and that's what I find lacking in a lot of, you know, like HOME ALONE."
There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying
Right.
"and there was a lot of human character there,"
"but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature"
Uh-huh.
Right.
does that make since to you?
"Yeah,"
"uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And they
"usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home"
Uh-huh.
"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time."
"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,"
and this is what I found with Emily.
"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area."
Uh-huh.
And I kept finding neighbors and friends
and they'd move.
Oh.
She ended up being in a different home every year.
Too transit.
Uh-huh.
And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
And her surroundings.
"So this year I, I tried Kinder-Care"
"and, then she's old enough to"
Okay.
"Well, let's see,"
"well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics"
"and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full."
I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
"Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?"
"No,"
"no,"
I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
"Well, maybe they don't."
"I, I know that was supposed to be in May"
"and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were."
uh-huh
"And, uh, it, if, uh, no matter what they do in the, the classroom, if they go home at night and, you know, it's all totally undone, uh."
Uh-huh.
"The, the thing that, uh, uh, that Karen, my wife, has, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,"
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"these people somehow manage to, uh, you know, push on through and are successful."
"Progress,"
uh-huh.
"It's, uh, unfortunately probably what, maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that."
"Yeah,"
"not, not even that much probably."
"Well, that would be, be at the absolute most."
Yeah
uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know, those, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are, are real trouble,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I wonder whether that's just a, uh, uh, a part of the system, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"if, you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, uh, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there, there's an inefficiency there,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and you've got to let those, you know, those,"
"And speaking, speaking of doing what you want, uh, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one, um, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even, even something as simple as staying up late, um, watching television late, um, going out late, start dating,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Uh-huh.
"you start dating too early, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"just little things like that, that do start in the home,"
Yeah.
"Well,"
"and, yeah,"
"and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person"
"and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know."
"But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there."
"It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get"
"so,"
"Well, that's for sure."
"Which is the same,"
"but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,"
"that's,"
"Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, just in this size of organization,"
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.
Where do you live?
I live in San Antonio.
San Antonio!
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, I live in Garland"
"and we're just beginning to,"
"we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable"
Uh-huh.
"but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're really not full, full force into it,"
"but they're trying,"
"so we're attempting it,"
but I wish we could do more.
"Yeah,"
"there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio."
I used to work for the power company here
Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?
My grandmother doesn't
"She, she wants to to tell you about her story over again"
so
Right.
"which is fine, you know,"
"so,"
"Well, that is good because we,"
"Um, so what do you think?"
"Um,"
"I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years."
Uh-huh.
And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.
And so I saw some of the good
and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care."
Right.
"So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,"
"I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life."
Right.
"Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me"
"because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see."
"One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden."
"Oh, really?"
Because it's treated as a disease.
"Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,"
"but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability"
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.
Huh.
"Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,"
"I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,"
and they wrote that it's kind of weird
"they have bats in their roof,"
but the bats eat the bad spiders
"so they leave the bats, you know."
So.
Yeah.
"It's a whole, whole different culture"
"or, It, it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there,"
Uh-huh.
"they just, they take it for granted"
"and it's like we go down there on vacation,"
"it's like oh, how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house?"
Yeah.
"I think their policy with them that though, is, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"I think,"
"I wish we would have just,"
I'm not that up on the policy of ways.
"I know that's kind of old,"
"but I don't know,"
"I just, I'm glad that the Sandanistas aren't in power anymore because I think that they were very wicked. And, uh, probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen,"
"and I feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably,"
"you would be safe to say that they were just very very, you know, big into drugs."
"Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians are, were very corrupt."
Right.
"The thing about it though is the Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down there."
"A lot of, a lot of American servicemen are involved,"
Uh-huh.
"because I guess there was a big, big, uh, scam that, that all these guys up."
"Thousands of servicemen, got caught for running a drug ring."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"And, uh, when was it,"
"a couple weeks ago I was asked to go to, uh, jury duty"
"I, I wasn't selected"
"but, um, for some of our cases in particular we have, um, very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such."
Sure.
"And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just, you know happen to be selected in our jury, to understand what we're talking about."
"Well, I do think that the cases like the, uh, oh, say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil,"
Uh-huh.
"or, or the Texaco Pennzoil problem, uh, is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand, and, really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved, should handle cases like that."
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Yeah,"
"you know, some I don't,"
"you always have the option,"
"now in criminal I guess you always have a jury,"
but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not.
"Oh, is that right?"
"Yeah,"
"and in some incidences I think they ought to, ought not to have a jury,"
Yeah.
um
"Okay,"
boy.
"Or, uh, or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury."
"Uh, I was only on one jury ever, so far in my life,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it really was a pretty trivial, case"
"and it seemed to me all the time I was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved, oh, a couple thousand dollars I think, it was, it was really just, uh, uh, terrific waste of everybody's time and money."
Uh-huh.
Um.
"And it finally ended up that, uh, even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it, they settled the case."
Oh.
Right.
Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter
I know I don't.
Yeah.
"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,"
it takes a lot of time
"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long."
"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars"
"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something"
and he hasn't given it to someone else.
Yeah.
"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate,"
there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.
There's a lot of people
and he just isn't one of them.
Yeah.
"I, uh, I don't mind it,"
"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette,"
"I mean, of course, I loved it, um,"
"but if, you know,"
I've got other interests now
"and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time."
"And I have the same problem,"
"I mean, you can tell him from me"
"but it doesn't matter,"
"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years"
"And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,"
Yeah.
"so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,"
Uh-huh.
"and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,"
"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things,"
"and,"
but I happen to know his background
"and I know that he would have sold out his mother for, uh, uh, shorter sentence."
Jeez.
"And, you know, it's, it's really annoying when the,"
I asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in.
"He said that, that was barred, uh, by the court."
"Um,"
"So, we do have some problems"
"and it seems to me that, uh, maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over. And then make a legal system that carefully protects people"
"but, uh, where you,"
"Yeah,"
"I'd even go for, for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable, uh, um, lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that would be wrongful .
"Yeah, you know."
Sure would.
"Yeah,"
"I witnessed one trial many years ago when I was first, um, studying to be a paralegal"
"and, uh, uh, they barred priors on this, uh, person"
"and they never then told us, I guess, because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other."
Um.
And they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other
"and the crime was, uh, uh, attempt to commit murder, you know,"
Um.
but they never told us why these people were mad at each other
"and gee, you know,"
"that's,"
And you think that would be relevant.
"Yeah,"
"you know, because they, they told us in school that, you know, crime has to be an intent, you know, has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it"
Right.
That sounds really good.
"I read a thing,"
"I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you,"
"and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea."
"You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation"
but that's really not enough
"and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year"
"and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,"
"and they're deducting it all along,"
"so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,"
"you're really not being paid for them,"
"the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,"
"but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know."
"So, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in"
and T I said that they were looking into something like that
"so,"
"Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that."
"Well,"
true.
True.
"Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one"
"or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. Uh, as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate uh, that's running in each department."
Uh-huh.
"Otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else."
Uh-huh.
"Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. That, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line"
"Uh, I guess you can, I guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end."
"But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order to, uh, call the bully out and beat him."
And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war.
"They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward."
"And, uh  we were wrong"
"But I, uh, you know,"
"the, like I said, the more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable."
"But the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where,"
"and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I, I think we did, I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for,"
I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war.
Yeah
"Uh, I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean  they seemed like a valiant thing."
Yeah.
"You knew, you knew who was good."
You knew who was bad.
Yeah.
"And it was a, it was a traditional the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know  whichever way it is."
"Well you're not,"
"But in, in the Vietnam war it seems like it was,"
"a, a, the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad"
"and and, uh, you know, the,"
"It's ambivalent,"
yeah.
"even,"
"it seems like even the people, you know,"
"had the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and, of course, the Laotians"
and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved.
"You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use,"
"and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever."
Right.
"And so they, they, they don't,"
"no,"
it's not firing first.
"It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate."
"In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first,"
and they won't say anything about it.
Right.
I think that's really good.
Oh sure.
I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something.
"Oh yeah,"
"no,"
that's not right.
"It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is."
"You know, it's a weakness and all,"
"and who, all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another."
"And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it,"
"I have children,"
"I always worry about the, the classical thing that you see on T V, where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, you know, and get them sucked in,"
and then they sell it to them.
You know the classical thing is to give it away.
Right.
I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party
and they slip it to them.
"I don't know,"
"I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not, you know."
That's a real worry.
"Yeah,"
"some of the stories you read about cocaine, that's like people try it one time and they're addicted."
"there's a lot of, you know,"
"the morale among employees tends to go down and that, in turn, like, you know,"
"Well, the question was talking about the juries"
"and, uh, one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,"
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again.
"Uh, so that, uh, a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person to, uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. Right. *slash error should be 'aa'"
Right.
"I, I kind of agree with that, because I think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed."
"Uh, I, I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case"
Right
"so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there"
Uh-huh.
"and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing."
Yeah.
See I agree with you.
"Uh, one thing I heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court."
"I mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything."
"Uh, you go"
"and you present your case,"
the other side presents their case
and you're done with it.
It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,"
"it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that are, uh, all ready pending."
"Uh, so I,"
that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way.
"In other words, not, not,"
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?
Yes.
"Now,"
"I, I, I don't,"
Uh-huh.
"I do belong to a, a large corporation"
"or my, that where I'm currently employed"
"and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance."
"I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation"
Right.
"and that got to be somewhat expensive,"
"so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount."
Yeah.
"Right,"
and especially if you have a family.
Yes.
Then I think it makes a big difference.
"Yes,"
"and that's, that's one thing I do have."
Yeah.
"If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life,"
"I don't think I would have insurance, uh, other,"
Right.
I don't think I would go through that expense.
One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours
"and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours"
"Oh, yeah."
"or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case."
Right.
Could you change that as you felt like it
or did you have to do it the same every week?
"Well, basically, yeah"
"I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year."
"I mean uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel,"
Uh-huh.
"so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed"
That's not a formula for a better society.
"No,"
it is not.
"It's lopsided, very much"
so.
And the government really plays a role in this.
"Uh-huh,"
"that's right,"
they pull the strings.
"I mean, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful"
"Right,"
"the,"
yeah
"You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting."
But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't
"and they think it's unfair,"
"and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it."
"I I'll tell you one quick, uh, one thing very interesting."
"C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number"
and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.
Uh-huh.
"They expect, opening it for one hour, that they'll get three, hundred thousand telephone calls."
I'm sure they will.
"And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and, and vent their frustration with government. Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that. You know, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I think that's coming
"and I think once, once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change."
"Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful."
"So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth"
"and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved,"
"and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art."
Yeah.
"So, uh, yeah,"
"So, uh, you know, I look back at, at, uh, my childhood"
"and I'd say, you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now"
"and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, we're, uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies."
"Right,"
"right,"
"it would be nice, it would be nice to see it take a good turn here."
It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away
"so I hope that this time it, it stays."
"Just, To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, we, when we go dump, actually when we go dump our things, oh, we collect newspapers, too, and then take them,"
"seems like there's a pretty well, there's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics"
Uh-huh.
so that's kind of encouraging.
"I didn't know, you know, I didn't know if we started to do that."
I didn't know what to expect.
"Yeah,"
"well I'll have to say I'm, I'm, the only one I'm good at at this point is the newspaper. Uh, taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh, getting rid of those,"
Right.
"but on the plastic, I have, uh, I don't have any habits there yet"
"and I'm, guess I'm waiting for the city to, to push me in that direction"
"but, But, it just seems like on the larger scale that, you know, the, we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things"
"Well, I guess they will shortly."
"I, uh,"
"and I think if, uh, if we just start to put, you know, the nickel deposit on things, like, uh, was the case years ago that, uh, it would have more immediate effect, uh, than,"
because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money
"Oh, right."
and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
"and so outside my little town, we would, uh, go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something."
Yeah.
And I think it was tremendously down.
"As far as the number of drug users, you mean?"
Yeah
Huh.
as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users.
"But I think that on when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started."
Right.
And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.
"And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go"
and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.
"Yeah,"
and our numbers have been way down.
I don't know what they were.
"When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,"
"and so we had,"
"when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested."
Yeah.
"And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything,"
"and their test came back positive,"
and normally we didn't retest them.
But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth
"and we retested them like the next day,"
and they came back negative the second time.
"Oh, really."
"So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem."
"Oh, you're,"
"that's a good point,"
"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government."
"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything."
but I'm not sure I like that
I think I prefer the jury system myself.
You think you prefer the jury?
You think your chances are better?
"Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury"
"What, what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual."
"That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because, uh, anytime the government, uh, is the government against the individual you need you need the protection of ordinary citizens."
"Well, that's true."
"I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a, a well"
"I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time."
Uh-huh.
I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that
"or, uh,"
"Well, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair."
"I mean even if, well the jury, I guess they do decide that"
"but, but, I'm like you,"
"in a case like that, most of the time its,"
"I don't know,"
"maybe I'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that."
"the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know, uh,"
Yeah.
"Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent."
That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe.
Right.
"But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive."
Yeah.
"In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people."
Uh-huh
"Uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere"
Right.
"But in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way,"
"but I guess, I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it."
Okay.
You think you're getting your money's worth?
"Uh, never"
"Uh, the only thing I'm, I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in, in Texas."
"Well, that's probably the next year's agenda."
Yeah.
"Boy, I tell you what,"
I sure hope they don't pass something like that.
"Oh, yeah."
"They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around,"
"and I, I think one way or the other, we're going to pay for the bureaucracy, I guess."
"Uh, it's one area that is really, I, I think hurting the economy more than anything."
"I think the taxes have just, every time you turn around they, they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products,"
"and I, I, I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now."
"Well, I, I tell you, um,"
"I remember every time, it seems like, we turned around, they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline."
That's right.
That's right.
"And actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?"
"Yep,"
that's right.
"And every time you go to buy anything now, uh,"
"even, you know, they, they tax food."
That's the one that really kind of bothers me.
"Well, I think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability to pay, which allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards."
"But, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything they buy, and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going to be paying taxes on, you know."
"And, uh, that's the unfair equity, inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue,"
"but I don't think it is anymore, not in Texas anyway."
"Oh, I got you, because people that, uh, don't make very much money wind up spending it all."
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"In 1920, Sturt joined the Mid-Southern Football Association along with Blackwood and Brighton, winning the Premiership that season. The Mid-Southern Football Association became the Glenelg District Football Association in 1931, with Sturt once again winning the first premiership."
"During the Second World War, Sturt combined with the Brighton and Seacliff club from 1942 to 1945, winning two premierships as a combined entity."

= = = Yerrapalli Formation = = =
"The Yerrapalli Formation is a Triassic rock formation consisting primarily of mudstones that outcrops in the Pranhita–Godavari Basin in southeastern India. The Yerrapalli Formation preserves fossils of freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates as well as trace fossils of invertebrates. The tetrapod fauna includes temnospondyl amphibians, archosauromorph reptiles, and dicynodonts."
Most of the Yerrapalli Formation consists of red mudstones. The mudstones were deposited across a floodplain during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Smaller lenses of calcareous sandstone represent ephemeral streams that branched off from the larger channels that were the source of the floodplain sediments. The climate of the region during the time is thought to have been monsoonal with both wet and dry seasons.
"The Yerrapalli Formation overlies the Kamthi Formation, underlies the Bhimaram Formation, and is conformable with both formations. Two members of the Yerrapalli Formation have been recognized; a lower member consisting of layers of red and purple clay with lenses of pale green clay and an upper member consisting of alternating layers of clay and fine-grained sandstone."
"The paleobiota of the Yerrapalli Formation is similar to that of the overlying Maleri Formation, which also preserves fossils of temnospondyls and archosauromorphs. The main difference between the Yerrapalli and the Maleri faunae is the presence of dicynodonts in the former. The discovery of dicynodont fossils in the Pranhita-Godavari Basin in 1964 was one of the earliest indications that the Yerrapalli Formation represented a distinct paleofauna. Before this discovery, Yerrapalli strata were grouped within the Maleri Formation. The dicynodonts of the Yerrapalli Formation are similar to those of the Ntavere Formation in Zambia, which also dates back to the Anisian. During the Middle Triassic, what is now India and southern Africa formed one continuous landmass as part of the supercontinent Gondwana."

= = = Arthur Lyon Fremantle = = =
"General Sir Arthur James Lyon Fremantle (11 November 1835 – 25 September 1901) was a British Army officer and a notable British witness to the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Whilst holding the rank of ""Captain and Lieutenant Colonel"" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist."
"Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon. He was called ""Arthur"" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829."
"After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army."
"The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS ""Sumter"", pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the ""Sumter"" was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS ""Alabama"". Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas."
"Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface:"
"On 2 March 1863, Captain and Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer ""Atrato""."

"In the early 1930s, the Sisters of The Holy Family of Nazareth came to Tyler, Texas from the Sacred Heart Province in Chicago to open Mother Frances Hospital. The hospital was named in honor of Frances Siedliska, the founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. The hospital opened on March 18, 1937 – one day ahead of schedule – to care for victims of the New London School explosion."
"In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital."
"In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical & Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic. Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas."
"In 1995, Mother Frances Hospital and Trinity Clinic merged, creating Trinity Mother Frances Health System, one of the first integrated health care systems in the United States. In 2007, Trinity Mother Frances Health System changed its name to Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics."
"In May 2016, Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics merged with CHRISTUS Health to create CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic."

"John T. Shayne & Company, a Chicago-based hatter, haberdasher and furrier was founded on November 6, 1884, by John Thomas Shayne (born August 26, 1852) an importer/manufacturer, civic leader and Democratic politician. The firm was formally incorporated on May 23, 1899, and held the distinction of being ""the largest business of its kind outside of New York City."" The store was first located at 187-189 South State Street in the Chicago Loop (the city of Chicago's central business and shopping district) and later moved to the John Crerar Library building at 150 North Michigan Avenue where it remained until the department store ceased operations in 1979. At the time of its closing, Shayne's was a department store specializing in women's ready-to-wear, couture and furs."
"The achievements of the Shayne brothers in the manufacture of fine furs helped to bring a newfound respect for American manufactured furs which were primarily reserved only for the elite European manufacturing houses of Russia, France and Germany. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago's World Fair), ""The New York Times"" reported, ""The joint exhibit of C.C Shayne of New-York and John T. Shayne of this city has received awards which, by reason of their number and their language, leave no doubt that the Shayne fur products surpass those made in any part of the world."""
"On July 10, 1894, John T. Shayne commented to the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate that U.S. furriers were losing significant income from garments that were manufactured overseas and then brought back to this country duty-free by tourists. Shayne stated to the Committee of Finance, ""I could get up a petition that would almost reach from the Senate Chamber to the White House, but do not wish to encroach upon your valuable time."""
John T. Shayne & Company was one of the earliest Chicago retailers to join in America's burgeoning mail order business during the turn of the 20th century. Shayne's first mail order publication dates back to 1906 and is featured in the Chicago Public Library Trade Catalog Collection at the Harold Washington Library.
"Mail order merchandising played an important role in retail distribution during the 20th century. These catalogues provided rural communities access to an array of merchandise; items ranging from tooth paste to prefabricated houses were marketed to small towns and remote rural communities, transforming the way American's purchased goods."
"Chicago area retailers were among the nation's first companies to publish mail orders. The city was ideally suited for America's growing mail order business due to its central location, access to a national rail system and advances made in mail delivery. Chicago became a nationally recognized city through the many images that found their way into these mail order catalogs. These publications shaped the nation's perspective of Chicago and encouraged tourism to the city."
"On March 21, 1899, ""The New York Times"" reported, ""John T. Shayne, a wealthy furrier, and a prominent Democratic politician, brother of C.C. Shayne of New York, was shot, and probably fatally wounded, this afternoon by Harry H. Hammond, a tailor. The shooting occurred in the cafe of the Auditorium Annex, where Shayne was sitting at lunch with Mrs. Hammond, the divorced wife of Hammond, and two other ladies."" Shayne did miraculously recover from the shooting incident."
"Patrick Dennis, author of the bestselling novel ""Auntie Mame"" referenced John T. Shayne and Company in his subsequent novel ""Little Me"". The main character of the novel, Belle Poitrine, describes her shopping spree ""I went on a mad round of shopping -diamonds and pearls- from Peacock's, glossy furs from John T. Shayne, dresses of every description from Field's and Carson, Pirie, Scott with shoes to match from O'Connor and Goldberg."""
"Subsequent ownership included Tom Considine, Jr. who in turn sold the company to Martin Feldman. The Feldman family acquired the business in 1958 whereupon Martin and son Barry Feldman, along with Edwin Smith operated the business until it closed in 1979."

leads to the perturbation of both the linear dispersion relation of photons and constant dispersion of charge waves by the avoided crossing between the two dispersion lines of polaritons.
Similarly to the acoustic and the optical phonons and far from the resonance one branch is photon-like while the other charge wave-like.
Mathematically the Hopfield dielectric for the one mode of excitation is equivalent to the Trojan wave packet in the harmonic
approximation. The Hopfield model of the dielectric predicts the existence of eternal trapped frozen photons similar to
the Hawking radiation inside the matter with
the density proportional to the strength of the matter-field coupling.
The Hamiltonian of the quantized Lorentz dielectric consisting of formula_1 harmonic oscillators interacting with the
quantum electromagnetic field can be written in the dipole approximation as:
and defining projections of oscillator charge waves onto the electromagnetic field
polarization directions
after dropping the longitudinal contributions not interacting with the electromagnetic field one may obtain the Hopfield Hamiltonian
Because the interaction is not
mixing polarizations this can be transformed to the normal form with the eigen-frequencies of two polaritonic branches:

= = = Etihad Rail DB = = =
"Etihad Rail DB is a certified and integrated heavy-rail Operations & Maintenance (O&M) service provider in the UAE. The company was set up in 2013 as a joint venture between Etihad Rail (51%), the developer of the UAE's national railway network and Deutsche Bahn (DB) (49%), Europe's largest railway operator and infrastructure owner. Etihad Rail DB is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Stage One of the UAE's national railway network for Etihad Rail’s primary customer, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Etihad Rail DB concluded an Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Agreement with Etihad Rail in August 2013."
"Stage One is the first of three stages of the UAE's vision to build a mixed freight and passenger railway across the country. Stages Two and Three will extend the railway geographically to the other Emirates as well as connect with partner Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway systems in the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Not only will the UAE's railway provide a valuable boost to sustainable and diversified economic growth and bring communities together across the Emirates, it will also be a concrete step to the development of a safe, more efficient and integrated system movement of freight and people across the region."
"In Stage One of the UAE's national railway network, Etihad Rail DB operates and maintains 264 km of railway route across the Western Region of the Abu Dhabi Emirate and transports granulated sulphur from the sour gas fields of Shah (Al Hosn Gas) and Habshan (GASCO) to the port of Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, where the sulphur product is exported. The spine of the network is the double track line between Liwa and Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi. This section is designed to also operate passenger trains in the future."
"Etihad Rail DB is now set to provide 'Shadow Operator' services for stage two of the Etihad Rail project. The choice builds on the five years of expertise and Etihad Rail DB's outstanding success in managing Stage One operations and maintenance. In its 'Shadow Operator' role, Etihad Rail DB will aim to utilise its expertise and lessons learned from Stage One to provide consultancy services to Etihad Rail in preparation for stage two. Such services will include reviewing the design of stage two assets, developing Emiratization requirements, drawing up operational procedures and safety management plans and assisting to ensure the project is delivered with the optimum operations cost."
"Since officially commencing commercial operations in January 2016, Etihad Rail DB has been responsible for the transport of up to 22,000 tonnes of granulated sulphur every day in trains of up to 110 wagons. Trains are hauled by 4,300 horsepower EMD SD-70 locomotives. In February 2017, Etihad Rail DB announced that it had safely run its 1,000th train for ADNOC. As of 20 January 2017, Etihad Rail DB confirmed that it had transported more than 10 million tonnes of sulphur in over 1 million hours worked with zero lost time injury (LTI) in a relatively short time since inception, which reflects its internal culture."
"As of the first half of 2017, Etihad Rail DB had achieved its highest performance records against all international safety standards with no lost-time injuries. As railways are new to the region, a community safety campaign was undertaken in 2014 to educate the public on safety around rail tracks."
"One of the key purposes of the Etihad Rail DB joint-venture is to facilitate knowledge transfer, the sharing of best practices, as well as providing the UAE with a world-class, modern, integrated and efficient rail network that will drive economic growth and social development. In May 2016, Etihad Rail and Etihad Rail DB co-signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education & Training Institute (ADVETI) related to occupational training. Under the terms of this MoU, the stakeholders will collaborate to create opportunities for occupational training and share knowledge for Emirati students seeking qualifications in the UAE's rail industry, in line with the goals of the country's Emiratization policy. This means that UAE Nationals will have skills across many disciplines needed to operate and maintain the railway such as maintenance and mechanical technicians. Moreover, Etihad Rail DB has also established a human resources excellence programme which is enabling UAE nationals to gain on-the-job experience."

"Hermann Landois (19 April 1835, Münster – 29 January 1905) was a German zoologist. He was the brother of physiologist Leonard Landois (1837-1902)."
"He studied natural sciences and theology in Münster, where he was ordained as a priest in 1859. In 1863 he obtained his doctorate in zoology at the University of Greifswald, later becoming an associate professor of zoology at the Academy in Münster (1873)."
"In 1871 he founded the ""Westfälischen Vereins für Vogelschutz, Geflügel- und Singvögelzucht"" (Westphalian Association for bird protection, poultry and songbird breeding), and during the following year founded the ""Zoologischen sektion für Westfalen und Lippe"" (Zoological Division of Westphalia and Lippe)."
"In 1875, he founded the Westphalian zoo in Munster, a preserve with emphasis on European domestic mammals. It had a building for the display, cultivation and breeding of various fowl as well as avaries for songbirds. In 1876 a ""monkey house"" was constructed. Eventually, the zoo expanded to include native fauna in general. By the end of 1882, the site had ""niche displays"" (dioramas) representing fauna from Australia, the North Sea coast, German forests, the African landscape, as well as a section that contained fossils from prehistoric Westphalia."

"Schaefer is also an active Protestant Christian educator who regularly speaks to university audiences (over 500 to date), Christian groups and the public on science/faith issues. In 2003, he published ""Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?"", a collection of essays and talks on the subject. A second edition appeared in 2016. He is a member of the Christian Faculty Forum at the University of Georgia."
"On January 25. 2008, Schaefer was invited to present a lecture entitled 'The Big Bang, Stephen Hawking and God' at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, during TECHFEST, Asia's largest technology festival. This evoked a response from a group of six atheist students in the form of handbills. Schaefer was, however, invited to return to IIT Bombay to present an Institute Lecture in February 2014. In 2016, Schaefer was again invited to present a plenary lecture at TECHFEST. His lecture on December 17, ""The Life of a Scientist,"" was presented to a large audience without incident. On December 14, 2018, Schaefer gave another plenary lecture at TECHFEST."
"There has been some controversy concerning the designation of Schaefer as a ""five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize."" The original source of this estimate is a December 23, 1991 cover article from U.S. News & World Report."
"The names of nominees and other information about the Nobel nomination process cannot be revealed for 50 years following the nomination discussions, so such a designation is speculative."
= = = Cubbon Park = = =
"Cubbon Park, officially called Sri Chamarajendra Park is a landmark 'lung' area of Bengaluru city, located () within the heart of the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about . It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts."
"This public park was first named as Meade’s Park after Sir John Meade, the acting Commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in 1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence."
"The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment. Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'."
The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'.
"The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of the park are accessible through walking paths."
The Park is open to the public at all times but the roads around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh environment for morning walkers and exercisers.
Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a total of around 6000 plants/trees. Indigenous species found in the park are:
"artocarpus, cassia fistula, ficus, polyalthias etc., and exotic species such as araucaria, bamboo, castanospermum australe, grevillea robusta, millettia, peltophorum, schinus molle, swietenia mahagoni, tabebuia. sp etc."
"Amongst the ornamental and flowering exotic trees lining the roads in the park are the Grevillea robusta (silver oak)—the first oaks introduced to Bangalore from Australia—and the delonix or the gulmohar tree (bright red flowers with long petals) along the Cubbon road in the park, which is a widely cultivated tropical ornamental tree around the world."
"The avenue of araucarias along with canna beds on either sides of the road from the Central Public Library to Hudson circle, avenue of Swieteninas in the Northern side of the park, the Java fig avenue along the road leading to the Government Museum, polyalthia avenue along the road from Queen Victoria’s statue to King Edward VII's statue and the chestnut tree avenue from the Chamarajendra statue to Siddalingaiah circle are testimony to the botanical richness of the park. Other attractions at the Park are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook."
"The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices) now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to the Museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira Priyadarshini Children’s Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika — the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa Chatter."
"A bandstand, in an octagonal shape made with cast-iron, was built in the early part of the 1900s. Before India’s Independence, the British Royal Air Force used to play western band music at the band stand every Saturday evening."
"An attraction for children is the well planned children's amusement park as part of Jawahar Bal Bhavan, which has the toy train, Puttani Express that runs (0.75 miles or 1.2 km) within the Park, the Doll museum and a boating facility. A 20-million-year-old fossilized tree — a gift from the Geological Survey of India, is also reported at the park."
"Memorials in the form of marble statues in honour of Queen Victoria (installed in 1906), King Edward VII (installed in 1919), Major General Sir Mark Cubbon, Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (installed in 1927) and Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer (installed (in 1913) are seen located in front of the historical buildings within the park."

= = = Hypoblast = = =
The hypoblast is a tissue type that forms from the inner cell mass. It lies beneath the epiblast and consists of small cuboidal cells.
"Extraembryonic endoderm (including Yolk sac) is derived from hypoblast cells. The absence of hypoblast results in multiple primitive streaks in chicken embryos. The formation of the primitive streak, through which gastrulation occurs, is induced by Koller's sickle."
"In mouse embryo, the visceral endoderm develop from the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst during the implantation stage covering the epiblast cells and elongates to become an egg cylinder. A distinct morphological domain has been identified by Martin and colleagues, at the distal tip of the mouse egg cylinder, thus this domain was called distal visceral domain (DVE). The DVE cells will move unilaterally to the future anterior until reaching the embryonic/ extra embryonic boundary and at this point, the DVE cells are also named as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). This migration has been proved to be essential for establishing anteroposterior axis. Besides the AVE, another cell population appears to be separated at the posterior edge of the embryonic egg cylinder, referred to as posterior visceral endoderm (PVE). However, the function of this cell population was not as well studied as AVE."
"Although the hypoblast does not contribute to the embryo, it has great influences on the orientation of the embryonic axis. For example, the AVE in hypoblast plays an important role in positioning the primitive streak at the midland of the amniote embryos. In chick, people had observed that removal of the hypoblast caused multiple, ectopic primitive streaks formation. Similarly, in mice embryo, the AVE expresses secreted molecules, including two antagonists of nodal signaling, Cerberus-like (Cerl) and a TGFβ superfamily molecule, Lefty1. It was shown that Cerberus−/−;Lefty1−/− compound mutants mice developed a primitive streak ectopically in the embryo. There is also finding suggested that the hypoblast also inhibit primitive streak formation by depositing extracellular matrix components to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides the role of positioning the site of gastrulation, AVE also showed other function including continued protection against caudalization of the early nervous system. Also primitive endoderm derived yolk sac has major function in guaranteeing the proper organogenesis of the fetus and efficient exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes."
"In mammals, the existence of primitive endoderm had been observed as early as the end of the 19th century as first recognized by Duval and Sobotta. However, it took long time before people realized that the primitive endoderm will be replaced by definitive endoderm which will further develop into the gut tube. The first convincing experiment was conducted by Bellairs in chick embryo with the careful observation under electron and light microscopy. In his experiment, Bellairs demonstrated that there is a transitory endoderm cell layer in the chick embryo at its ventral surface before the formation of primitive streak. This layer of cell was replaced by definitive endoderm migration from the primitive streak through ingression and de-epithelialization. Later on, more insights on primitive endoderm and definitive endoderm origin and formation have been provided in different species including rat and mouse, rhesus monkey, baboon et al."

In 2012, Gabrielle Zilkha, a Toronto-based filmmaker, visited Sefwe Wiawso to do research for a documentary about the House of Israel she is making. According to Zilkha, about 200 people--mostly children--live in the community. She states that the lack of a historical record makes it difficult to verify the groups claims, but that there is an oral tradition dating back 200 years."

He has been granted a 40-acre plot of land to build a Jewish school for the community, but they have not yet been able to raise funds for construction. Children currently attend a local school, run by Christians. They built a synagogue in 1998 in New Adiembra, a Jewish neighborhood in Sefri Wiawso. Recently, they painted it blue and white, the colors of Israel. There are several family compounds nearby and about 200 people belong to the synagogue."

= = = Itsekiri people = = =
"The Itsekiri (also called the Isekiri, ""iJekri"", ""Itsekri"", ""Ishekiri"", or Itsekhiri) are an ethnic group of Nigeria's Niger Delta area, Delta State. The Itsekiri presently number just under 1 million people and live mainly in the Warri South, Warri North and Warri South West local government districts of Delta State on the Atlantic coast of Nigeria. Significant communities of Itsekiris can be found in parts of Edo and Ondo states and in various other Nigerian cities including Lagos, Sapele, Benin City, Port Harcourt and Abuja. Many people of Itsekiri descent also reside in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.The Itsekiris are closely related to the Yoruba of South Western Nigeria and more widely to the Urhobo (especially the Okpe) and Edo peoples."
The Itsekiris traditionally refer to their land as the Kingdom of Warri or 'Iwerre' as its proper name – which is geographically contiguous to the area covered by the three Warri local government districts. The area is a key centre of Nigeria's crude oil and natural gas production and petroleum refining and the main town Warri (a multi-ethnic metropolis) forms the industrial and commercial nucleus of the Delta State region.
"The Itsekiri are a people of very mixed ethnic origins who speak a language very closely related to the Yoruba of south western Nigeria and the Igala language of central Nigeria but which has also borrowed some cultural practice from the Edo people of Benin City, given the hegemony that the Benin Empire once exercised over the area, Portuguese in trade terminologies, as the Itsekiri were the first people in Nigeria to establish contact with the Portuguese who were exploring the West African coast, and also more recently, English. Although linguistically related to the Yoruba and Igala ethnic groups, however, through centuries of intermingling modern day Itsekiris are of mixed ethnic origins. They are most closely related to the South-Eastern Yorubaland sub-groups - Ijebu, Akure, Ikale, Ondo and Owo), but also Edo, Urhobo, Ijaw are today mainly Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic) by religion."
"Thus having had six centuries of direct cultural exposure to Western Christianity and other African influences, contemporary Itsekiri language and culture has successfully evolved into a hybrid of the many cultures that have influenced its development. Similarly owing to the complex genetic mix of most Itsekiris over the centuries, many individuals self-identifying as Itsekiri would usually be a complex mix of any of the aforementioned ethnic and racial groups. Thus modern day Itsekiris may be the only southern Nigerian ethnic group to be almost totally heterogeneous (mixed) in its genetic composition. The total absence of any dialectal variation in the Itsekiri language is also unique for the region and is most likely the result of the early coalescing of the Itsekiri people into a small and highly centralised nation state from the 15th century onward."
"In the 15th century, the early Itsekiris adopted a prince Ginuwa (also called ""Iginuwa"" in Bini Language) from the Kingdom of Benin as a monarch, and quickly coalesced into a kingdom under his rule. Traditionally fishermen and traders, the Itsekiri were among the first in the region to make contact with Portuguese traders. These interactions in the 16th century led the Itsekiri to become primarily Roman Catholic."
"The Itsekiri monarchy has continued to the present day, with the coronation of Ogiame Ikenwoli on 12 December in 2015. The Itsekiri's historical capital is Ode-Itsekiri (also called ""big warri"" or ""Ale iwerre""), though the monarch's main palace is in Warri town the largest city in the area and home to diverse other communities including the Urhobos, Ijaws, Isoko, and many other Nigerian and expatriate groups working in the oil and gas industry."
"The Itsekiri, though a minority group within Nigeria, are considered to be a highly educated and affluent ethnic group with a very high rate of literacy and a rich cultural heritage. The Itsekiris have one of the oldest histories of western education in West Africa, and are noted for producing one of its earliest university graduates – the Olu of Warri Kingdom, Olu Atuwatse I, Dom Domingo a 17th-century graduate of Coimbra University in Portugal. Today, many Itsekiris can be found working in the professions particularly medicine, law and the academic professions and in business, trade and industry and were among the pioneers that led the development of the professions in Nigeria during the early-to-mid 20th century ."
The Itsekiris traditionally lived in a society that was governed by a monarchy (the Olu) and council of chiefs who form the nobility or aristocracy. Itsekiri society itself was organised along the lines of an upper class made up of the royal family and the aristocracy – the 'Oloyes and Olareajas' these were mainly drawn from noble houses including the Royal Houses and the Houses of Olgbotsere (Prime Minister or king maker) and Iyatsere (defence minister). The middle class or Omajaja were free-born Itsekiris or burghers. As a result of the institution of slavery and the slave trade there was a third class 'Oton-Eru' or those descended from the slave class whose ancestors had come from elsewhere and settled in Itsekiriland as indentured or slave labourers. In modern-day Itsekiri society the slave class no longer exists as all are considered free-born.
"Traditionally, Itsekiri men wear a long sleeved shirt called a Kemeje, tie a George wrapper around their waist and wear a hat with a feather stuck to it. The women wear a blouse and also tie a George wrapper around their waist. They wear colourful head gears known as Nes (scarf) or coral beads. Itsekiris are also famed for their traditional fishing skills, melodious songs, gracefully fluid traditional dances and colourful masquerades and boat regattas."
"Before the introduction of Christianity in the 16th century, like many other African groups, the Itsekiris largely followed a traditional form of religion known as Ebura-tsitse (based on ancestral worship) which has become embedded in modern-day traditional Itsekiri culture. Once the dominant form of western Christianity in Itsekiriland for centuries, only a minority of Itsekiris are Roman Catholics today whilst the majority are Protestants notably Baptist and Anglican."
"Whilst genetically, the Itsekiris are a complex mixture of the many different ethnicities and races that have settled in their area, however, the Itsekiri language is very closely related to the Ilaje and other south-eastern Yoruba dialects and to the Igala. It has also been influenced significantly by the Bini, Portuguese and English languages due to centuries of interaction with people from those nations. However, it remains a key branch of the Yoruboid family of languages even retaining archaic or lost elements of the proto Yoruba language due to its relative isolation in the Niger-Delta where it developed away from the main cluster of Yoruba language dialects."
"Unlike nearly all key Nigerian Languages, the Itsekiri language does not have dialects and is uniformly spoken with little or no variance in pronunciation apart from the use of 'ch' for the regular 'ts' (sh) in the pronunciation of some individual Itsekiris, e.g. Chekiri instead of the standard Shekiri but these are individual pronunciation traits rather than dialectal differences. This may be a relic of past dialectal differences. The English language continues to exert a strong influence on the Itsekiri language both in influencing its development and in its widespread usage as a first language amongst the younger generation. Modern standard Yoruba (the variety spoken in Lagos) also appears to be influencing the Itsekiri language partly due to the similarity between both languages and the ease of absorbing colloquial Yoruba terms by the large Itsekiri population living in Western Nigerian cities. Itsekiri is now taught in local schools up to university degree level in Nigeria."
"There are a number of semi-autonomous Itsekiri communities such as Ugborodo, koko, Omadino and Obodo whose history predates the 15th-century establishment of the Warri Kingdom. The Ugborodo community claims direct descent from the Ijebu a major Yoruba sub-ethnic group"

= = = Hinduism in the Philippines = = =
"Recent archaeological and other evidence suggests Hinduism has had some cultural, economic, political and religious influence in the Philippines. Among these is the 9th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription found in 1989, deciphered in 1992 to be Kavi script (Pallava alphabet) with Sanskrit words; the golden Agusan statue (Golden Tara) discovered in another part of Philippines in 1917 has also been linked to Hinduism."
"There is some growth in the religion as of late, although most temples cater to the same communities. Actual adherents of Hinduism are mostly limited to communities that include indigenous and native peoples, expatriate communities, as well as new converts. There are various ISKCON groups and popular Hindu personalities and groups such as Sathya Sai Baba, and Paramahansa Yogananda (SRF), Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (Ananda Marga) that can be found. Hindu based practices like Yoga and meditation are also popular. The Personal Representative on Earth of the Supreme Divine Person, Swāmī Mahāprabhu, has been residing in Quezon City since September 2011. There are also notable archery ranges named after characters in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata called ""Kodanda Archery Range"" (named after Lord Rama's bow Kodanda) and ""Gandiva Archery"" (named after Arjuna's bow Gandiva)."
"One source estimated the size of the Indian community in the Philippines in 2008 at 150,000 persons.Most of whom are Hindus and Christians."
"At present, however, it is limited primarily to the immigrant Indian community, though traditional religious beliefs in most parts of the country have strong Hindu and Buddhist influences."
"Over the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, Asian Development Bank and the BPO sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila. Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are Hindu, Sikh or Muslims, but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are Catholic . The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation and the"
"Sathya Sai organization. Most Hindus congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late ""priest"" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001)."
There are two Hindu temples in Manila city-Hari Ram Temple (Paco) and Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco).
"The archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Odisha and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location. The statue now sits in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries."
"Juan Francisco suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess Sakti of the Siva-Buddha (Bhairava) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of Shiva is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and Sumatra. The Rajahnate of Butuan, in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the Rajahnate of Cebu was also recorded."
"Another gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities."
"In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, Lumban. This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma. The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese Medang Kingdom, the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when Islam was introduced by traders from Arabia which was then followed by Christianity from Spain. This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before."
"Many fables and stories in Filipino Culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of the monkey and the turtle, the race between deer and snail (slow and steady wins the race), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana."
"According to Indologists Juan R. Francisco and Josephine Acosta Pasricha, Hindu influences and folklore arrived in Philippines by about 9th to 10th century AD. The Maranao version is the ""Maharadia Lawana"" (King Rāvaṇa of Hindu Epic Ramayana)."
"With the advent of Spanish colonialism in the 16th century, the Philippines became a closed colony and cultural contacts with other Southeast Asian countries were limited, if not closed. In 1481, the Spanish Inquisition commenced with the permission of Pope Sixtus IV and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be ""put to the question"" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of Manila in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the King of Spain, and the Archbishop of New Galicia (Mexico) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed Archbishop of Manila became the Inquisitor-General of the Spanish East Indies (i.e.,the Philippines, Guam, and Micronesia), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death."
"Linguistic influence left lasting marks on every Philippine language. Below are some borrowed terms, which were often Buddhist and Hindu concepts, with the original Sanskrit; some of the words in many Philippine languages are loaned from Sanskrit and Tamil."
= = = Multiplication (music) = = =
"The mathematical operations of multiplication have several applications to music. Other than its application to the frequency ratios of intervals (for example, Just intonation, and the twelfth root of two in equal temperament), it has been used in other ways for twelve-tone technique, and musical set theory. Additionally ring modulation is an electrical audio process involving multiplication that has been used for musical effect."
"A multiplicative operation is a mapping in which the argument is multiplied . Multiplication originated intuitively in interval expansion, including tone row order number rotation, for example in the music of Béla Bartók and Alban Berg . Pitch number rotation, ""Fünferreihe"" or ""five-series"" and ""Siebenerreihe"" or ""seven-series"", was first described by Ernst Krenek in ""Über neue Musik"" (; ). Princeton-based theorists, including James K. , Godfrey , and Hubert S. ""were the first to discuss and adopt them, not only with regards to twelve-tone series"" ."
"When dealing with pitch-class sets, multiplication modulo 12 is a common operation. Dealing with all twelve tones, or a tone row, there are only a few numbers which one may multiply a row by and still end up with a set of twelve distinct tones. Taking the prime or unaltered form as P, multiplication is indicated by ""M"", ""x"" being the multiplicator:"
The following table lists all possible multiplications of a chromatic twelve-tone row:
"Note that only M, M, M, and M give a one-to-one mapping (a complete set of 12 unique tones). This is because each of these numbers is relatively prime to 12. Also interesting is that the chromatic scale is mapped to the circle of fourths with M, or fifths with M, and more generally under M all even numbers stay the same while odd numbers are transposed by a tritone. This kind of multiplication is frequently combined with a transposition operation. It was first described in print by Herbert Eimert, under the terms ""Quartverwandlung"" (fourth transformation) and ""Quintverwandlung"" (fifth transformation) , and has been used by the composers Milton Babbitt (; ), Robert , and Charles Wuorinen . This operation also accounts for certain harmonic transformations in jazz ."
"Thus multiplication by the two meaningful operations (5 & 7) may be designated with M(""a"") and M(""a"") or M and IM ."
"Pierre described an operation he called pitch multiplication, which is somewhat akin to the Cartesian product of pitch-class sets. Given two sets, the result of pitch multiplication will be the set of sums (modulo 12) of all possible pairings of elements between the original two sets. Its definition:"
"For example, if multiplying a C-major chord formula_2 with a dyad containing C,D formula_3, the result is:"
"In this example, a set of three pitches multiplied with a set of two pitches gives a new set of 3 × 2 pitches. Given the limited space of modulo 12 arithmetic, when using this procedure very often duplicate tones are produced, which are generally omitted. This technique was used most famously in Boulez's 1955 ""Le marteau sans maître"", as well as in his Third Piano Sonata, ""Structures II"", ""Don"" and ""Tombeau"" from ""Pli selon pli"", ""Eclat"" (and ""Eclat multiples""), ""Figures-Doubles-Prisms"", ""Domaines"", and ""Cummings ist der Dichter"", as well as the withdrawn choral work, ""Oubli signal lapidé"" (1952) (; ; ). This operation, unlike arithmetic multiplication and transpositional combination of set classes, is non-commutative ."
"Howard Hanson called this operation of commutative mathematical convolution ""superposition"" or ""@-projection"" and used the ""/"" notation interchangeably. Thus ""p@m"" or ""p/m"" means ""perfect fifth at major third"", e.g.: { C E G B }. He specifically noted that two triad forms could be so multiplied, or a triad multiplied by itself, to produce a resultant scale. The latter ""squaring"" of a triad produces a particular scale highly saturated in instances of the source triad . Thus ""pmn"", Hanson's name for common the major triad, when squared, is ""PMN"", e.g.: { C D E G G B }."

"Left communism, or the communist left, is a position held by the left wing of communism, which criticises the political ideas and practices espoused by Marxist–Leninists and social democrats. Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically Marxist than the views of Marxism–Leninism espoused by the Communist International after its Bolshevization by Joseph Stalin and during its second congress."
"In general, there are two currents of left communism, namely the Italian and Dutch-German left. The communist left in Italy was formed during World War I in organizations like the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Italy. The Italian left considers itself to be Leninist in nature, but denounces Marxism–Leninism as a form of bourgeois opportunism materialized in the Soviet Union under Stalin. The Italian left is currently embodied in organizations such as the Internationalist Communist Party (Battaglia Comunista) and the International Communist Party. The Dutch-German left split from Vladimir Lenin prior to Stalin's rule and supports a firmly council communist and libertarian Marxist viewpoint as opposed to the Italian left which emphasised the need for an international revolutionary party."
"Left communism differs from most other forms of Marxism in believing that communists should not participate in bourgeois parliaments, and some argue against participating in conservative trade unions. However, many left communists split over their criticism of the Bolsheviks. Council communists criticised the Bolsheviks for elitist party functions and emphasised a more autonomous organisation of the working class, without political parties."
"Although she was murdered in 1919 before the communist left appeared as a distinct current, Rosa Luxemburg has heavily influenced most left communists. Proponents of left communism have included Albert Camus, Amadeo Bordiga, Onorato Damen, Jacques Camatte, Herman Gorter, Antonie Pannekoek, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick."
"Two major traditions can be observed within left communism, namely the Dutch-German current and the Italian current. The political positions those traditions share are opposition to popular fronts, to many kinds of nationalism and national liberation movements and to parliamentarianism."
"The historical origins of left communism come from World War I. Most left communists are supportive of the October Revolution in Russia, but retain a critical view of its development. However, some in the Dutch-German current would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a proletarian or socialist nature, arguing that it had simply carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution by creating a state capitalist system."
"Left communism first came into focus as a distinct movement around 1918. Its essential features were a stress on the need to build a communist party or workers' council entirely separate from the reformist and centrist elements who ""betrayed the proletariat"", opposition to all but the most restricted participation in elections and an emphasis on militancy. Apart from this, there was little in common between the two wings. Only the Italians accepted the need for electoral work at all for a very short period of time which they later vehemently opposed, attracting the wrath of Vladimir Lenin in """"."
"Left Bolshevism emerged in 1907 as the Vpered group challenged Vladimir Lenin's perceived authoritarianism and parliamentarianism. The group included Alexander Bogdanov, Maxim Gorky, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Grigory Aleksinsky, Stanislav Volski and Martyn Liadov. The ""Otzovists"", or Recallists, advocated the recall of RSDLP representatives from the Third Duma. Bogdanov and his allies accused Lenin and his partisans of promoting liberal democracy through ""parliamentarism at any price""."
"In 1918, a faction emerged within the Russian Communist Party named the Left Communists which opposed the signing of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty with Imperial Germany. The Left Communists wanted international proletarian revolution across the world. In the beginning, the leader of this faction was Nikolai Bukharin. They stood for a revolutionary war against the Central Powers; opposed the right of nations to self-determination (specifically in the case of Poland since there were many Poles in this communist group and they did not want a Polish capitalist state to be established); and they generally took a voluntarist stance regarding the possibilities for social revolution at that time."
"They began to publish the newspaper ""Kommunist"" which offered a critique of the direction in which the Bolsheviks were heading. They argued against the over-bureaucratisation of the state and further argued that full state ownership of the means of production should proceed at a quicker pace than Lenin desired."
"The Left Communists faded as the world revolutionary wave died down in militancy as Lenin had proved too strong a figure. They also lost Bukharin as a leading figure since his position became more right-wing until he eventually came to agree with Lenin. Being defeated in internal debates, they then dissolved. A few very small left communist groups surfaced within the RSFSR in the next few years, but later fell victim to repression by the state. In many ways, the positions of the Left Communists were inherited by the Workers' Opposition faction and Gavril Myasnikov's Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party and to some extent by the Decists."
"The Italian left communists were named left communists at a later stage in their development, but when the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) was founded its members actually represented the majority of communists in that country. This was a result of the Abstentionist Communist Faction of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) being in advance of other sections of the PSI in their realisation that a separate communist party had to be formed which did not include reformists. This gave them a great advantage over the sections of the PSI who looked to figures such as Giacinto Menotti Serrati and Antonio Gramsci for leadership. It was a consequence of the revolutionary impatience common at a time when revolution, in the narrow sense of an insurrectionary attempt at the seizure of power, was expected to develop in the very near future."
"Under the leadership of Amadeo Bordiga, the left was to control the PCd'I until the Lyons Congress of 1926. In this period, the militants of the PCd'I would find themselves isolated from reformist workers and from other anti-fascist militants. At one stage, this isolation was deepened when communist militants were instructed to leave defence organisations that were not totally controlled by the party. These sectarian tactics produced concern in the leadership of the Communist International and led to a developing opposition within the PCd'I itself. Eventually, these two factors led to the displacement of Bordiga from his position as first secretary and his replacement by Gramsci. By then, Bordiga was in a fascist jail and was to remain outside organised politics until 1952. The development of the Left Communist Faction was not the development of the Bordigist current (as it is often portrayed)."
"The year 1925 was a turning point for the Italian left as it was the year that the so-called Bolshevisation took place in the sections of the Communist International. This plan was designed to eliminate all social democratic deviations from the Communist International and develop them on Bolshevik lines or at least along the lines of what Grigory Zinoviev, the secretary of the Communist International, considered Bolshevik lines. In practice, this meant top-down bureaucratic structures in which the members were controlled by a leadership approved of by the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). In Italy, this meant that the leadership which had formerly been in the hands of Bordiga was given to a body that came into being when the Serrati-Maffi minority of the PSI joined the PCd'I, although Bordiga's group were in a majority. The new leadership was supported by Bordiga, who accepted the will of the Communist International as a centralist."
"Nevertheless, Bordiga fought the ECCI from within only to have an article of his which was favourable to Leon Trotsky's positions on the disputed Russian questions suppressed. Meanwhile, sections of the left motivated by Onorato Damen formed the Entente Committee. This committee was ordered to dissolve itself by the incoming leadership led now by Gramsci, who only then opposed Bordiga's positions which had gained prestige after a successful recruitment campaign. With the party Congress of 1926 held in Lyons, crowned by Gramsci's famous Lyons Theses, the left majority was now defeated and on course to becoming a minority within the party. With the victory of fascism in Italy, Bordiga was jailed. When Bordiga opposed a vote against Trotsky in the prison PCd'I group, he was expelled from the party in 1930. He took a stance of non-involvement in politics for many years after this. The victory of Italian fascism also meant that the Italian left would enter into a new chapter in its development, but this time in exile."
"Left communism emerged in both countries together and was always very closely connected. Among the leading theoreticians of the more powerful German movement were Antonie Pannekoek and Herman Gorter and German activists found refuge in the Netherlands after the Nazis came to power in 1933. The critique of social democratic reformism can be traced back before World War I since in the Netherlands a revolutionary wing of social democracy had broken from the reformist party even before the war and had built links with German activists. By 1915, the Antinational Socialist Party was founded by Franz Pfemfert and was linked to ""Die Aktion"". After the beginning of the German Revolution in 1918, a leftist mood could be found among sections of the communist parties of both countries. In Germany, this led directly to the foundation of the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) after its leading figures were expelled from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) by Paul Levi. This development was mirrored in the Netherlands and on a smaller scale in Bulgaria, where the left communist movement was to mimic that of Germany."
"Very cheap variable capacitors are constructed from layered aluminium and plastic foils that are variably pressed together using a screw. These so-called ""squeezers"" cannot provide a stable and reproducible capacitance, however. A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and might be called a ""slider"". This has practical advantages for makeshift or home construction, and may be found in resonant-loop antennas or crystal radios."
"Small variable capacitors operated by screwdriver (for instance, to precisely set a resonant frequency at the factory and then never be adjusted again) are called trimmer capacitors. In addition to air and plastic, trimmers can also be made using a ceramic dielectric, such as mica."
"Very often, multiple stator/rotor sections are arranged behind one another on the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit. The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 × 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 × 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver. Capacitors with multiple sections often include trimmer capacitors in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency."
"A butterfly capacitor is a form of rotary variable capacitor with two independent sets of stator plates opposing each other, and a butterfly-shaped rotor arranged so that turning the rotor will vary the capacitances between the rotor and either stator equally."
"Butterfly capacitors are used in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. RF power amplifier stages in push-pull configuration or symmetrical antenna tuners where the rotor needs to be ""cold"", i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily DC) ground potential. Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in magnetic loop antennas."
"In a butterfly capacitor, the stators and each half of the rotor can only cover a maximum angle of 90° since there must be a position without rotor/stator overlap corresponding to minimum capacity, therefore a turn of only 90° covers the entire capacitance range."
"The closely related split stator variable capacitor does not have the limitation of 90° angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another. Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted on opposite sides of the rotor axis. While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180°, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the rotor axis instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane."
"Differential variable capacitors also have two independent stators, but unlike in the butterfly capacitor where capacities on both sides increase equally as the rotor is turned, in a differential variable capacitor one section's capacity will increase while the other section's decreases, keeping the stator-to-stator capacitance constant. Differential variable capacitors can therefore be used in capacitive potentiometric circuits."
The variable capacitor with air dielectric was invented by the Hungarian engineer Dezső Korda. He received a German patent for the invention on 13 December 1893.
"The thickness of the depletion layer of a reverse-biased semiconductor diode varies with the DC voltage applied across the diode. Any diode exhibits this effect (including p/n junctions in transistors), but devices specifically sold as variable capacitance diodes (also called varactors or varicaps) are designed with a large junction area and a doping profile specifically designed to maximize capacitance."
"Their use is limited to low signal amplitudes to avoid obvious distortions as the capacitance would be affected by the change of signal voltage, precluding their use in the input stages of high-quality RF communications receivers, where they would add unacceptable levels of intermodulation. At VHF/UHF frequencies, e.g. in FM Radio or TV tuners, dynamic range is limited by noise rather than large signal handling requirements, and varicaps are commonly used in the signal path."
"Varicaps are used for frequency modulation of oscillators, and to make high-frequency voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), the core component in phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers that are ubiquitous in modern communications equipment."
"BST device are based on Barium Strontium Titanate and vary the capacitance by applying high voltage to the device. They have a dedicated analogue control input and therefore introduce less non-linearities than varactor diodes, especially for higher signal voltages. The limitations for BST are stability over temperature and linearity in demanding applications."
"A digitally tuned capacitor is an IC variable capacitor based on several technologies. MEMS, BST and SOI/SOS devices are available from a number of suppliers and vary in capacitance range, quality factor and resolution for different RF tuning applications."
"MEMS devices have the highest quality factor and are highly linear, and therefore are suitable for antenna aperture tuning, dynamic impedance matching, power amplifier load matching and adjustable filters. RF tuning MEMS are still a relatively new technology and has not yet been accepted broadly."
SOI/SOS tuning devices are constructed as solid state FET switches built on insulated CMOS wafers and use MIM caps arranged in binary-weighted values to achieve different capacitance values. SOI/SOS switches have high linearity and are well suited to low power applications where high voltages are not present. High voltage endurance requires multiple FET devices in series which adds series resistance and lowers the quality factor.
"The capacitance values are designed for antenna impedance matching in multi-band LTE GSM/WCDMA cellular handsets and mobile TV receivers that operate over wide frequency ranges, such as the European DVB-H and Japanese ISDB-T mobile TV systems."
Variable capacitance is sometimes used to convert physical phenomena into electrical signals.

"Professor Johann Georg Bühler (July 19, 1837 – April 8, 1898) was a scholar of ancient Indian languages and law."
"Bühler was born to Rev. Johann G. Bühler in Borstel, Hanover, attended grammar school in Hanover, where he mastered Greek and Latin, then university as a student of theology and philosophy at Göttingen, where he studied classical philology, Sanskrit, Zend, Persian, Armenian, and Arabic. In 1858 he received his doctorate in eastern languages and archaeology; his thesis explored the suffix ""-tês"" in Greek grammar. That same year he went to Paris to study Sanskrit manuscripts, and in 1859 onwards to London, where he remained until October 1862. This time was used mainly for the study of the Vedic manuscripts at the India Office and the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. While in England, Bühler was first a private teacher and later (from May 1861) assistant to the Queen's librarian in Windsor Castle."
"In Fall 1862 Bühler was appointed assistant at the Göttingen library; he moved there in October. While settling in, he received an invitation via Prof. Max Müller to join the Benares Sanskrit College in India. Before this could be settled, he also received (again via Prof. Müller) an offer of Professor of Oriental Languages at the Elphinstone College, Bombay (now Mumbai). Bühler responded immediately and arrived on February 10, 1863 in Bombay. Noted Sanskrit and legal scholar Kashinath Trimbak Telang was then a student at the college. In the next year Bühler became a Fellow of Bombay University and member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was to remain in India until 1880. During this time he collected a remarkable number of texts for the Indian government and the libraries of Berlin, Cambridge University, and Oxford University."
"In the year 1878 he published his translations of the Paiyalachchhi, the oldest Prakrit dictionary, with glossary and translation. He also took responsibility for the translation of the Apastamba, Dharmasutra etc. in Professor Max Müller's monumental compilation and translation, the ""Sacred Books of the East"", vols. 2, 14, and 25."
"On 8 April 1898 Bühler drowned in Lake Constance, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Contemporary accounts mostly attributed it to an accident, but it has been speculated that it was a suicide motivated by Bühler's connections to a scandal involving his former student Alois Anton Führer."

= = = Cooking spray = = =
"Cooking spray is a spray form of an oil as a lubricant, lecithin as an emulsifier, and a propellant such as food-grade alcohol, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide or propane. Cooking spray is applied to frying pans and other cookware to prevent food from sticking. Traditionally, cooks used butter, shortening, or oils poured or rubbed on cookware. Most cooking sprays have less food energy per serving than an application of vegetable oil, because they are applied in a much thinner layer: US regulations allow many to be labelled ""zero-calorie""; in the UK sprays claim to supply ""less than 1 calorie per serving"". Popular US brands include Pam, Crisco, and Baker's Joy. Sprays are available with plain vegetable oil, butter and olive oil flavor."
Cooking spray has other culinary uses besides being applied to cookware. Sticky candies such as Mike and Ike that are often sold in bulk vending machines may be sprayed with cooking spray to keep them from sticking together in the machines. Coating the inside of a measuring cup with the spray allows sticky substances such as honey to pour out more easily. Vegetables may be sprayed before seasoning to make the seasonings stick better.
= = = Diocesan chancery = = =
A diocesan chancery is the branch of administration which handles all written documents used in the official government of a Catholic or Anglican diocese.
"It is in the diocesan chancery that, under the direction of the bishop or his representative, all documents which concern the diocese are drawn up, copied, forwarded, and a record kept of all official writings expedited or received."
The official charged with the execution of these duties is known as the diocesan chancellor.
"Diocesan chanceries may be universal, but there is nothing in the common ecclesiastical law concerning their creation and equipment. The explanation lies in the very nature of this law, which provides only for what is general and common, and takes no account of local means of administration, which it abandons to the proper authority in each diocese, the concrete circumstances offering always great variety and calling for all possible freedom of action."
"Although, as above described, the methods of diocesan administration exhibit no little variety, there exists on the other hand a certain uniformity. Each diocese, after all, is bound to observe the common law, has an identical range of freedom, and identical limits to its authority. Each diocese, therefore, is likely, ""a priori"", to develop its administration along similar lines, but does so regularly in harmony with others, particularly neighbouring dioceses. In this way the dioceses of a given country come to have similar official administration."
"In many dioceses, the chancellor exercises some of the faculties which in other dioceses are exclusively reserved to the vicar-general. This happens more frequently in smaller dioceses, administered directly by the bishop himself, and in which the vicar-general (often not resident in the episcopal city) is called on only when the bishop is absent or hindered."
"In such cases the chancellor is also the confidential secretary of the bishop. A similar system obtains even in many extensive dioceses which are administered by the bishop with the aid of one or more vicars-general and the diocesan chancery. There are, however, some large dioceses in which all matters personally reserved to the bishop are executed by him with the aid of a secretary or chancellor, usually a priest or deacon, while the greater part of the diocesan administration is handed over to a body of officials under the direction of the bishop or his vicar-general."
"For the correspondence, registration, and care of the archives, such administrative bureaus are provided with a secretariat or chancery. The chancery is a necessary element of administration in every diocese. Some provision for its duties must be made, even in missionary dioceses, apostolic prefectures, and apostolic vicariates. Unless the official correspondence were properly cared for, there would be no tradition in diocesan management, important documents would be lost, and the written evidence necessary in lawsuits and trials would be lacking."
"The famous Apostolic Chancery (""Cancellaria Apostolica"") developed in time from the chancery of the primitive Bishop of Rome. By reason of the latter's primacy in the Church, his chancery naturally had far wider relations than that of any other Christian diocese. The Apostolic See had never legislated concerning diocesan chanceries until the 1983 Code of Canon Law under its canons on the diocesan curia (cc. 469-494). The diocesan system was generally introduced in many countries whose churches had hitherto been under a more or less provisional government (e.g. United States, England, Scotland, India)."
"National and provincial synods laid much stress on the creation of diocesan chanceries. In the United States, the First Plenary Council of Baltimore (1852) expressed the wish that in every diocese there should be a chancery, to facilitate ecclesiastical administration and establish for its conduct a more or less identical system. In Ireland, the National Synod of Thurles (1850) made provision for the establishment and preservation of diocesan archives. Similarly for England the Provincial Synod of Westminster (1852)."
"In keeping with these recommendations, the diocesan chancery consists of a certain number of officials named by the bishop. In the United States, England, and Australia, there are usually, besides the vicar-general, a diocesan chancellor and a secretary. In European dioceses the chancery is organized variously, according to the extent of the diocese. There is generally in each diocese a chancellor or secretary with the necessary personnel."
"In the dioceses of Germany much of the administration is carried on by an official bureau (""Ordinariat"") as described above, i.e., the vicariate-general, to which are adjoined a secretariat, a registry office, and a chancery."
"In the Diocese of Breslau there existed an institution known as the ""Secret Chancery"" (""Geheimkanzlei""), which expedited only matters decided by the prince-bishop personally or with the advice of this body. The prince-bishop presided over its sessions with the help of the vicar-general. Its members were three priests and one lay counsellor to whom were added a secretary, a chief of the chancery, two private secretaries, a registrar, etc. The ordinary diocesan administration were carried on by two other bureaus, the vicariate-general and the diocesan consistory, mutually independent, but both acting in the name of the prince-bishop."
"For the office of diocesan chancellor in the United States, see ""Acta et Decreta"" of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, in index, p. 303, and of the Synod of Maynooth (1900), s. v. ""Archiva""."

"alpha Kappa Delta Phi (αΚΔΦ) (also known as aKDPhi) is an Asian-interest sorority founded at the University of California, Berkeley. alpha Kappa Delta Phi is part of the National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA), which it helped charter in 2006. alpha Kappa Delta Phi currently has 57 chapters in North America, and is the largest Asian-American interest sorority in the United States and Canada."
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1989 and recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. There were fourteen founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, and they dedicated themselves ""to establishing a sorority which would offer Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system while also establishing an organization which would last as a strong tradition. ""."
"During the fall of 2002, the National Alumnae Board was established under the guidance of the National Board Alumnae Chair, Sophia Yen, to oversee the expansion and growth of the sorority’s alumnae. The 2002-2003 National Alumnae Board strongly desired a working organization that would provide programs and services to all alumnae. This idea later blossomed into the formation of the National Alumnae Association. With a true grassroots beginning, the National Alumnae Board’s initial activity focused on creating a mentoring program that would drive rich learning and development for both mentees and mentors. The success of the mentorship initiative led to the addition of a scholarship program that would award financial aid to sisters looking to further their education. Over the years, the National Alumnae Board has proudly sponsored many programs to edify our alumnae in helping them pursue their dreams, passions, and legacies. To date, the National Alumnae Association is still holding fast to its purpose: to continue the sisterhood after graduation. As such, it remains the leading avenue for our alumnae to connect with one another and express their timeless affection and everlasting devotion to alpha Kappa Delta Phi."
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi promotes Asian Awareness, one of its founding principles, by encouraging its members to be constantly aware of and involved in Asian American issues in their communities. Chapters host events such as forums, presentations, and workshops. Many of these events take place during May, which is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month."
alpha Kappa Delta Phi's national philanthropy is breast cancer awareness.
"alpha Kappa Delta Phi's breast cancer awareness campaign began in 1998, and its exclusive partnership with Avon began in 2010 and ended in 2017. The sorority hosts breast cancer awareness banquets, information sessions, workshops, and discussion groups. In 2006, the sorority raised over $30,000 as a national organization for breast cancer awareness. In 2008, the sorority raised and donated over $35,000. In 2012, the sorority raised and donated over $62,000. In 2016, the sorority raised and donated over $102,000, hitting the half of a million mark in terms of the total dollar amount donated to the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade since the start of their partnership in 2010."

"Following the Confederate taking of Fort Sumter, which marked the beginning of the Civil War, President Lincoln called up 75,000 States' militiamen to retake the seized Federal property and found that the militia ""strength was far short of what the Congressional statute provided and required""."
"In the summer of 1861, military camps circled around Washington, D.C. composed of new three-year army volunteers and 90-day militia units. The generals in charge of this gathering had never handled large bodies of men before, and the men were simply inexperienced civilians with arms having little discipline and less understanding of the importance of discipline."
"In the West, Union state and territorial militias existed as active forces in defense of settlers there. California especially had many active militia companies at the beginning of the war that rose in number until the end of the war. It would also provide the most Volunteers from west of the Rocky Mountains: eight regiments and two battalions of infantry, two regiments and a battalion of cavalry. It also provided most of the men for the infantry regiment from Washington Territory. Oregon raised an infantry and a cavalry regiment. Colorado Territory militias were organized both to resist the Confederacy and any civil disorder caused by secessionists, Copperheads, Mormons, or most particularly the Native tribes. The Colorado Volunteers participated in the Battle of Glorieta Pass turning back a Confederate invasion of New Mexico Territory. Later they initiated the Colorado War with the Plains Indians and committed the Sand Creek massacre. The California Volunteers of the California Column were sent east across the southern deserts to drive the Confederates out of southern Arizona, New Mexico and west Texas around El Paso, then fought the Navajo and Apache until 1866. They also were sent to guard the Overland Trail, keep the Mormons under observation by the establishment of Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, and fought a campaign against the Shoshone culminating in the Battle of Bear River. In Nevada, Oregon and Idaho Territory, California, Oregon and Washington Territorial Volunteers tried to protect the settlers and pacified tribes from each other and they fought the Goshute, Paiute, Ute and hostile Snake Indians in the Snake War from 1864 until 1866. In California, volunteer forces fought the Bald Hills War in the northwestern forests until 1864 and also the Owens Valley Indian War in 1862–1863."
"With passage of federal reconstruction laws between 1866 and 1870 the U.S. Army took control of the former rebel states and ordered elections to be held. These elections were the first in which African Americans could vote. Each state (except Virginia) elected Republican governments, which organized militia units. The majority of militiamen were black. Racial tension and conflict, sometimes intense, existed between the Negro freedmen and the ex-Confederate whites."
"In parts of the South, white paramilitary groups and rifle clubs formed to counter this black militia, despite the laws prohibiting drilling, organizing, or parading except for duly authorized militia. These groups engaged in a prolonged series of retaliatory, vengeful, and hostile acts against this black militia."
"The activity of the official black militia, and the unofficial illegal white rifle clubs, typically peaked in the autumn surrounding elections. This was the case in the race riot of Clinton, Mississippi in September 1875, and the following month in Jackson, Mississippi. An eyewitness account:"
"I found the town in great excitement; un-uniformed militia were parading the streets, both white and colored. I found that the white people—democrats—were very much excited in consequence of the governor organizing the militia force of the state. ... I found that these people were determined to resist his marching the militia (to Clinton) with arms, and they threatened to kill his militiamen."
"Outright war between the state militia and the white rifle clubs was avoided only by the complete surrender of one of the belligerents, though tensions escalated in the following months leading to a December riot in Vicksburg, Mississippi resulting in the deaths of two whites and thirty-five black people. Reaction to this riot was mixed, with the local Democrats upset at the influx of federal troops that followed, and the Northern press expressing outrage: ""Once more, as always, it is the Negroes that are slaughtered while the whites escape."""
"Enacted in the wake of the Civil War, the Federal Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act intended to prohibit federal troops and militia from supervising elections. This act substantially limits the powers of the Federal government to use the military serving on active duty under Title 10 for law enforcement, but does not preclude governors from using the National Guard in a law enforcement role as long as the guardsmen are serving under Title 32 or on state active duty."
"Despite a lack of initial readiness, training, and supplies, the Militas of the United States fought and achieved victory in the Spanish–American War."
"In 1914, in Ludlow, Colorado, the militia was called out to calm the situation during a coal mine strike, but the sympathies of the militia leaders allied with company management and resulted in the deaths of roughly 19 to 25 people."
"The state National Guard was originally called out, but the company was allowed to organize an additional private militia consisting of Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (CF&I) guards in National Guard uniforms augmented by non-uniformed mine guards."
"The Ludlow massacre was an attack by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel & Iron Company camp guards on a tent colony of 1,200 striking coal miners and their families at Ludlow, Colorado on April 20, 1914."
"In retaliation for Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of mines over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg. The entire strike would cost between 69 and 199 lives. Thomas Franklin Andrews described it as the ""deadliest strike in the history of the United States""."
American organized and unorganized militias fought in the Mexican Revolution. Some campaigned in Mexico as insurgent forces and others fought in battles such as Ambos Nogales and Columbus in defense of the interests of United States.

"Each state has two mandatory forces, namely the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Many states also have state defense forces and a naval militia, which assist, support and augment National Guard forces."
"The National Guard (or National Guard of a State) differs from the National Guard of the United States; however, the two do go hand-in-hand."
"The National Guard is a militia force organized by each of the states and territories of the United States. Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, the state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States. The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and the U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government. The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes."
"The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States. Created by the 1933 amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The National Guard of the United States maintains two subcomponents: the Army National Guard of the United States for the Army and the Air Force's Air National Guard of the United States."
"The current United States Code, Title 10 (Armed forces), section 246 (Militia: Composition and Classes), paragraph (a) states: ""The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard."" Section 313 of Title 32 refers to persons with prior military experience. (""Sec. 313. Appointments and enlistments: age limitation"
"These persons remain members of the militia until age 64. Paragraph (b) further states, ""The classes of the militia are: (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia."""
"The National Guard of the United States is the largest of the organized federal reserve military forces in the United States. The National Guard of the United States is classified (under title 10, United States Code (see above)) as the organized federal reserve military force. Under federal control, the National Guard of the United States can be called up for active duty by the President of the United States. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many National Guard units have served overseas – under the Total Force Policy of 1973 which effectively combined the National Guard with the armed forces, making them regular troops. This can lead to problems for states that also face internal emergencies while the Guard is deployed overseas. To address such issues, many of the states, such as New York and Maryland also have organized state ""militia"" forces or state guards which are under the control of the governor of a state; however, many of these ""militia"" also act as a reserve for the National Guard and are thus a part of it (this varies from state to state depending on individual state statutory laws). New York and Ohio also have active naval militias, and a few other states have on-call or proposed ones. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of ""Perpich v. Department of Defense"" that the federal government has plenary power over the National Guard, greatly reducing (to the point of nonexistence) the state government's ability to withhold consent to federal deployments and training missions of the National Guard."
"Since the Militia Act of 1903, many states have created and maintained a reserve military force known as state defense forces (Some states refer to them as state military reserve, state guard, or foot guard). They were created to assist, support and augment National Guard forces during peacetime conditions. Also during the call up of National Guard forces for wartime deployments, state defense forces can be used to assume the full military responsibilities of the state. Their mission includes the defense of the state and the enforcement of military orders when ordered by their Governor."
"Throughout the 20th century, state defense forces were used in every major war. New York Guard Soldiers patrolled and secured the water aqueduct of New York, mass transit areas, and were even deployed to France to assist in logistical operations in World War I. The Texas State Guard's soldiers suppressed a riot and maintained peace and order in Texas throughout World War II."
"Today state defense forces continue to assist, support and augment the National Guard of the state. They provide logistical, administration, medical, transportation, security, and ceremonial assistance. Some states have provided additional support such as the New York State Defense Force (New York Guard) providing its Soldiers to help support and augment the National Guard CERFP Team. The California State Military Reserve provides the National Guard with Soldiers to assist with military police training and the Alaska State Defense Force constantly provides armed military police troops to assist with the security of Alaska. One of the major roles of the Mississippi State Guard is providing operational support during natural disasters such as hurricanes relief operations."
One militia in the United States has modeled themselves after the state defense forces on a national level. They are known as the United States National Defense Corps.
"All able bodied men, 17 to 45 of age, are ultimately eligible to be called up into military service and belong to the class known as the reserve militia, also known as the unorganized militia (10 USC). Able bodied men who are not eligible for inclusion in the reserve militia pool are those aliens not having declared their intent to become citizens of the United States (10 USC 246) and former regular component veterans of the armed forces who have reached the age of 64 (32 USC 313). All female citizens who are members of National Guard units are also included in the reserve militia pool ()."
Other persons who are exempt from call to duty () and are not therefore in the reserve militia pool include:
"Many individual states have additional statutes describing their residents as part of the state militia; for example Washington law specifies all able-bodied citizens or intended citizens over the age of eighteen as members of the state militia, as explicitly distinct from the National Guard and Washington State Guard."
"Within the United States, since approximately 1992, there have been a number of private organizations that call themselves militia or unorganized militia."
= = = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man = = =
"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is a partly autobiographical book written by John Perkins published in 2004. It provides Perkins' account of his career with engineering consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. According to Perkins, his job at Main was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects that would primarily help the richest families and local elites, rather than the poor, while making sure that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies. Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He characterizes his role as being an ""economic hit man."" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison)."
"The book heavily criticizes U.S. foreign policy and the widely accepted idea that ""all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits."", suggesting that in many cases only a small portion of the population benefits at the expense of the rest, with the example including increasing income inequality where large U.S. companies exploit cheap labor and oil companies destroy local environment. Perkins describes what he calls a system of corporatocracy and greed as the driving force behind establishing the United States as a global empire, in which he took a role as an ""economic hit man"" to expand its influence."
"According to his book, Perkins' function was to convince the political and financial leadership of underdeveloped countries to accept enormous development loans from institutions like the World Bank and USAID. Saddled with debts they could not hope to pay, those countries were forced to acquiesce to political pressure from the United States on a variety of issues. Perkins argues in his book that developing nations were effectively neutralized politically, had their wealth gaps driven wider and economies crippled in the long run. In this capacity, Perkins recounts his meetings with some prominent individuals, including Graham Greene and Omar Torrijos. Perkins describes the role of an economic hit man as follows:"
"According to Perkins, he began writing ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" in the 1980s, but ""threats or bribes always convinced [him] to stop."""
"In the book, Perkins repeatedly denies the existence of a ""conspiracy"".I was initially recruited while I was in business school back in the late sixties by the National Security Agency, the nation’s largest and least understood spy organization; but ultimately I worked for private corporations. The first real economic hit man was back in the early 1950s, Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of Teddy, who overthrew the government of Iran, a democratically elected government, Mossadegh’s government who was Time‘s magazine person of the year; and he was so successful at doing this without any bloodshed—well, there was a little bloodshed, but no military intervention, just spending millions of dollars and replaced Mossadegh with the Shah of Iran. At that point, we understood that this idea of economic hit man was an extremely good one. We didn’t have to worry about the threat of war with Russia when we did it this way. The problem with that was that Roosevelt was a C.I.A. agent. He was a government employee. Had he been caught, we would have been in a lot of trouble. It would have been very embarrassing. So, at that point, the decision was made to use organizations like the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. to recruit potential economic hit men like me and then send us to work for private consulting companies, engineering firms, construction companies, so that if we were caught, there would be no connection with the government.<br> — November 4, 2004 interview"
"Although the accuracy of the content has been questioned, the book did well in terms of sales, having a placement on both the New York Times' and Amazon.com's best-seller-lists."
"Columnist Sebastian Mallaby of ""The Washington Post"" reacted sharply to Perkins' book: ""This man is a frothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"", is a runaway bestseller."" This charge is brought against Perkins despite the fact that he denounces conspiracy-thinking at numerous places in the book itself. Mallaby, who spent 13 years writing for the London ""Economist"" and wrote a critically well-received biography of World Bank chief James Wolfensohn, holds that Perkins' conception of international finance is ""largely a dream"" and that his ""basic contentions are flat wrong"". For instance, he points out that Indonesia reduced its infant mortality and illiteracy rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970. (Data by the World Bank itself shows that the decline slowed somewhat in the 70s) He also disputes Perkins' claim that 51 of the top 100 world economies belong to companies. A value-added comparison done by the UN, he says, shows the number to be 29. In fact, this report can be quoted as saying ""The results, as seen in Table 1, are striking, with only 29 countries figuring in the list of the top 100 international entities in terms of revenue."" showing how both are wrong."
"Other sources, including articles in ""The New York Times"" and ""Boston Magazine"" as well as a press release issued by the United States Department of State, have referred to a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring to Chas T. Main. In addition, the author of the State Department release states that the NSA ""is a cryptological (codemaking and codebreaking) organization, not an economic organization"" and that its missions do not involve ""anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries"". Economic historian Niall Ferguson writes in his book ""The Ascent of Money"" that Perkins's contention that the leaders of Ecuador (President Jaime Roldós Aguilera) and Panama (General Omar Torrijos) were assassinated by US agents for opposing the interests of the owners of their countries' foreign debt ""seems a little odd"" in light of the fact that in the 1970s the amount of money that the US had lent to Ecuador and Panama accounted for less than 0.4% of the total US grants and loans, while in 1990 the exports from the US to those countries accounted for approximately 0.4% of the total US exports (approximately $8 billion). According to Ferguson, those ""do not seem like figures worth killing for"". However, Perkins maintains that the motives for such actions, rather than loans, would have been the securing of the Panama canal as a permanent United States asset and gaining access to Ecuadorian oil. Einar Greve, the former vice president at Chas. T. Main who first offered Perkins a job there, at first affirmed the overall validity of the book, saying ""basically his story is true... What John's book says is, there was a conspiracy to put all these countries on the hook, and that happened. Whether or not it was some sinister plot or not is up to interpretation, but many of these countries are still over the barrel and have never been able to repay the loans."" However, on being asked by another reporter about the book, Greve re-read the book and denied the validity of some of the claims, such as the claim that the NSA had any links to Main, or that Perkins was seduced by Claudine."
"President Nixon makes some cryptic remarks that some believe bolster claims by Perkins in the book. October 8, 1971 President Nixon is in his briefing room discussing operations done by previous administrations. He refers to the plan regarding the Bay of Pigs plan, then he states, ""I know what we did in Iran, I know what we did in Guatemala"". The discussion delves into the ""dirty tricks"" concocted by the US using the US Intelligence community."
"After publishing ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"" Perkins continued with writing three other books on the topic, focusing on other aspects. ""A Game as Old as Empire: the Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption"" (2007), ""The Secret History of the American Empire"" (2007) and ""Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded – and What We Need to Do to Remake Them"" (2009)."
"The epilogue to the 2006 edition provides a rebuttal to the current move by the G8 nations to forgive Third World debt. Perkins charges that the proposed conditions for this debt forgiveness require countries to privatise their health, education, electric, water and other public services. Those countries would also have to discontinue subsidies and trade restrictions that support local business, but accept the continued subsidization of certain G8 businesses by the US and other G8 countries, and the erection of trade barriers on imports that threaten G8 industries."
"In 2009, the documentary film ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" featuring interviews with Perkins, was shown at film festivals around the U.S. The film is a Greek–U.S. co-production directed by Stelios Kouloglou, and was filmed in 2007 and 2008. Numerous interview-style statements by John Perkins also appear in the 2008 Internet-based documentary, """", and in the 2012 documentary, ""Four Horsemen""."

"The University of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society, affiliated with the University's School of Music, Theatre, and Dance, has put on two fully staged performances of a Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy opera every year since 1947, once in fall semester and the other in winter semester. The society is student-run. Performances take place at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater."
"Ann Arbor has a number of performing-arts institutions that are not affiliated with the University of Michigan. They include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre (a nonprofit community theater group), Ann Arbor Ballet Theater, Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (the first chartered ballet company in Michigan when it was founded in 1954), Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, and Arbor Opera Theater."
Theaters in the city include:
Ann Arbor also has a number of concert halls and nightclubs serving up jazz and other live music:
"There are several religious sites in Ann Arbor, including:"
"The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Artrain, located on North Main Street, is a traveling art museum located on a train. A number of other art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Several buildings throughout the downtown area, like Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea and The Ark, showcase pieces of independent installation art in the form of small ""fairy doors"". Maps of their locations can be found at Sweetwaters, Peaceable Kingdom, or the Chamber of Commerce."
"Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor has a significant beer-brewing culture. The city is home to four brewpubs located in the downtown area: Arbor Brewing Company, Grizzly Peak Brewing Company, Blue Tractor, and the nationally acclaimed Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales brewpub. Ann Arbor's West Side is also home to Wolverine State Brewing Company. Breweries in the nearby town of Ypsilanti (e.g. Corner Brewery) also contribute to Ann Arbor's brew scene."
"Among U.S. cities, Ann Arbor ranks first in the number of antiquarian booksellers and books sold per capita (although the per capita calculations may not include the large student population). The Ann Arbor District Library maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building, with a fifth branch set to open in 2008. The city is also home to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library."
"Ann Arbor is also known within the performance poetry scene. The Neutral Zone, a local teen center, is home to the Volume Youth Poetry Project which holds a competition every year to send a team of six youth poets to the national youth competition Brave New Voices. The city hosted this competition in 2001 and 2002, and has sent a team each year across the U.S."
"Ann Arbor (or its surrounding region) is also the setting (or the presumed setting) for a number of novels and short story collections, including:"
"Ann Arbor is the setting for much of the film ""The Four Corners of Nowhere"" (1995). Parts of the film ""Jumper"" (2008) are set in Ann Arbor, using both footage shot locally and footage using Peterborough, Ontario as an Ann Arbor stand-in. Ann Arbor is also frequently mentioned in the television series Lost. Because of the Michigan Film Incentive, several major films have been shooting in and around Ann Arbor in the past two years including the Tony Goldwyn-directed film ""Conviction"" starring Hilary Swank, Sam Rockwell, and Minnie Driver. The film's offices and post-production were headquartered in Ann Arbor, using many area landmarks as backdrops. Shooting has been done around Ann Arbor as well as smaller towns like Pittsfield Township, Chelsea and Dexter. Several interior scenes were filmed on location in the neighboring town Ypsilanti at Sidetrack Bar & Grill in Depot Town. Several other films are being made with major stars including Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and Samuel L. Jackson, who have been seen in and around downtown Ann Arbor."
"The content of the videos included shots of animal genitalia, humans or animals humorously engaging in sexual intercourse, people who get accidentally and humorously disrobed, and other situations that often relied on ribald humour, including a child grabbing a kangaroo's testicles, a man lifting a barbell with his penis, a man getting his head squeezed between an erotic dancer's large breasts, an elderly woman removing an envelope from a stripper's undergarments with her dentures, two people running into water with flaming pieces of toilet paper hanging from their buttocks, and two people filmed having sex in the middle of a park."
"Kerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network at the time, was informed of the show's content by friends while having dinner. He tuned in to watch the show, which was being transmitted on TCN-9, and was so offended by its content that he phoned the studio operators and angrily shouted, ""Get that shit off the air!"""
"Within minutes, the series was pulled. After the break, the Nine Network announced that it failed to continue airing the show, purportedly due to technical difficulties, and aired reruns of the American sitcom ""Cheers"" immediately afterwards to fill in the remaining airtime. In 2008, Bert Newton justified the broadcast explanation: ""It's technically ""very"" difficult to keep a show on air with Mr. Packer on the phone, yelling at you."""
"Although the same bumper and announcement interrupted the show during every broadcast across Australia, it occurred in different parts of the programme depending on the area it was airing in, due to time differences: In the eastern states, the station simply started airing an episode of ""Cheers"" after a scheduled commercial break, but in other areas, the last part of the show broadcast was of Mulray giving a monologue about ""bosoms"" or the aforementioned clip of a child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum. The show was cancelled before it was scheduled to air in Perth, and thus its Nine Network affiliate showed a brief message mentioning that the special wouldn't be aired before beginning an episode of ""Cheers""."
"Despite Packer's objections to the series' content, it was popular among viewers. The special was recorded to a record studio audience. After the announcement, Nine reportedly received ""thousands"" of phone calls from viewers, with 65 percent of callers upset with the programme being pulled, in contrast to the 60 callers who called in during the show's broadcast, complaining about the show. Viewers were generally bewildered by the sudden interruption and the cut to ""Cheers"", not knowing about the show's cancellation until it was widely reported by the Australian media outlets the next day."
"The day after the special aired, a furious Packer showed up at Nine's headquarters and held meetings in which he loudly berated Nine's managers and censors, referring to the program as ""disgusting and offensive shit."" After these meetings, Mulray and many of the staff who were involved with the creation of the special were fired, with Mulray being banned for life from Channel Nine."
"On his radio show the next day, Mulray commented, ""I am the first man in Australian history to be pulled off by Kerry Packer."""
"Mulray returned to Nine to be a judge on the 2005 series ""StarStruck"" shortly after Packer's death on December 26 of that year."
"In 2008, a full copy of the show was located by Nine's head of factual television."
"It was aired in its entirety at 8:30 PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same time. Promoted as ""the show Kerry Packer didn't want you to see"", it featured commentary from Bert Newton; Packer had died in December 2005, and Mulray refused Nine's request to host the special."
"The special was interrupted by the Channel Nine bumper and ""technical difficulties"" announcement 36 minutes in, cutting to the ""Cheers"" opening credits before resuming to a monologue by Newton, and the latter part of the special that never aired. The re-airing was censored, with portions of Mulray's monologues (including jibes about ""fat kids"") being cut from the special as they were deemed to be ""no longer acceptable""."
= = = Sequence of tenses = = =
"Sequence of tenses (known in Latin as consecutio temporum, and also known as agreement of tenses, succession of tenses and tense harmony) is a set of grammatical rules of a particular language, governing the agreement between the tenses of verbs in related clauses or sentences."
"A typical context in which rules of sequence of tenses apply is that of indirect speech. If, at some past time, someone spoke a sentence in a particular tense (say the present tense), and that act of speaking is now being reported, the tense used in the clause that corresponds to the words spoken may or may not be the same as the tense that was used by the original speaker. In some languages the tense tends to be ""shifted back"", so that what was originally spoken in the present tense is reported using the past tense (since what was in the present at the time of the original sentence is in the past relative to the time of reporting). English is one of the languages in which this often occurs. For example, if someone said ""I need a drink"", this may be reported in the form ""She said she needed a drink"", with the tense of the verb ""need"" changed from present to past."
"The ""shifting back"" of tense as described in the previous paragraph may be called backshifting or an attracted sequence of tenses. In languages and contexts where such a shift does not occur, there may be said by contrast to be a natural sequence."
"In English, an ""attracted sequence"" of tenses (backshifting) is often used in indirect speech and similar contexts. The attracted sequence can be summarized as follows: If the main verb of a sentence is in the past tense, then other verbs must also express a past viewpoint, except when a general truth is being expressed."
"For example, if Batman spoke the following words:"
the speech act may be reported using the following words:
"with the present tense ""need"" replaced by the past tense ""needed"", since the main verb of saying (""said"") is in the past tense. Further examples can be found at ."
"In some cases, though, a ""natural sequence"" of tenses is more appropriate. Here the tense of a verb in a subordinate clause is not determined by the tense of the verb in the superordinate clause, but is determined simply according to the sense of the clause taken apart from the rest of the sentence. The rule for writers following the natural sequence of tenses can be expressed as follows: imagine yourself at the point in time denoted by the main verb, and use the tense for the subordinate verb that you would have used ""at that time"". Thus the tense used in the indirect speech remains the same as it was in the words as originally spoken. This is normal when the main verb is in the present or future tense (as opposed to past tense or conditional mood). For example:"
However it is also possible to use the natural sequence even if the main verb is past or conditional:
"This option is more likely to be used when the circumstance being expressed remains equally true now as it did when the speech act took place, and especially if the person reporting the words agrees that they are true or valid."
"Debate amongst grammarians over the appropriateness of the two types of sequence of tenses goes back as far as the 18th century. Use of the attracted sequence sometimes leads to additional problems when the grammatical construction of indirect speech includes an incorporated quotation – that is, when an attempt is made (though using indirect rather than direct speech) to report the words actually spoken. For example, if a minister spoke the words ""Such a policy is not without its drawbacks"", then a writer may attempt to report this as follows:"
"using quotation marks to denote that that portion of the sentence represents the minister's actual words. This, however, requires use of the natural sequence of tenses, which might not be felt appropriate in the given situation. There are various possible solutions to this problem:"
"Similar problems arise from the other changes that typically occur in indirect speech, such as changes of pronoun (depending on speaker), etc."
"For more details, see the article on indirect speech, and also the article on uses of English verb forms, particularly the sections on indirect speech and dependent clauses."
"Indirect speech in Russian and other Slavic languages generally uses the natural sequence of tenses (there is no backshifting). For examples, see ."
"In Latin, the sequence of tenses rule affects dependent verbs in the subjunctive mood, mainly in indirect questions, indirect commands, and purpose clauses. If the main verb is in one of the non-past tenses, the subordinate verb is usually in the present or perfect subjunctive (primary sequence); if the main verb is in one of the past tenses, the subordinate verb is usually in the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive (historic sequence). For example, when the subordinate verb refers to a time contemporaneous or later than the time of the main verb, the present or imperfect subjunctive is used:"
"When the subordinate verb refers to a time earlier than that of the main verb, the perfect or pluperfect subjunctive is used:"
"If the main verb is a historic present (i.e. a present tense with a past meaning), either primary or historic sequence may be used, or in a long sentence even a mixture of the two:"
The codice_25 data type represents a variable-length text string. For example:
"In addition to the static array used in design, SystemVerilog offers dynamic arrays, associative arrays and queues:"
"A dynamic array works much like an unpacked array, but offers the advantage of being dynamically allocated at runtime (as shown above.) Whereas a packed array's size must be known at compile time (from a constant or expression of constants), the dynamic array size can be initialized from another runtime variable, allowing the array to be sized and resize arbitrarily as needed."
"An associative array can be thought of as a binary search tree with a user-specified key type and data type. The key implies an ordering; the elements of an associative array can be read out in lexicographic order. Finally, a queue provides much of the functionality of the C++ STL deque type: elements can be added and removed from either end efficiently. These primitives allow the creation of complex data structures required for scoreboarding a large design."
SystemVerilog provides an object-oriented programming model.
"In SystemVerilog, classes support a single-inheritance model, but may implement functionality similar to multiple-inheritance through the use of so-called ""interface classes"" (identical in concept to the codice_26 feature of Java). Classes can be parameterized by type, providing the basic function of C++ templates. However, template specialization and function templates are not supported."
SystemVerilog's polymorphism features are similar to those of C++: the programmer may specifically write a codice_27 function to have a derived class gain control of the function. See virtual function for further info.
"Encapsulation and data hiding is accomplished using the codice_28 and codice_29 keywords, which must be applied to any item that is to be hidden. By default, all class properties are public."
"Class instances are dynamically created with the codice_30 keyword. A constructor denoted by codice_31 can be defined. SystemVerilog has automatic garbage collection, so there is no language facility to explicitly destroy instances created by the new operator."
Example:
"Integer quantities, defined either in a class definition or as stand-alone variables in some lexical scope, can be assigned random values based on a set of constraints. This feature is useful for creating randomized scenarios for verification."
"Within class definitions, the codice_32 and codice_33 modifiers signal variables that are to undergo randomization. codice_33 specifies permutation-based randomization, where a variable will take on all possible values once before any value is repeated. Variables without modifiers are not randomized."
"In this example, the codice_35 field is not randomized; in practice it will be computed with a CRC generator, and the codice_36 field used to corrupt it to inject FCS errors. The two constraints shown are applicable to conforming Ethernet frames. Constraints may be selectively enabled; this feature would be required in the example above to generate corrupt frames. Constraints may be arbitrarily complex, involving interrelationships among variables, implications, and iteration. The SystemVerilog constraint solver is required to find a solution if one exists, but makes no guarantees as to the time it will require to do so as this is in general an NP-hard problem (boolean satisfiability)."
"In each SystemVerilog class there are 3 predefined methods for randomization: pre_randomize, randomize and post_randomize. The randomize method is called by the user for randomization of the class variables. The pre_randomize method is called by the randomize method before the randomization and the post_randomize method is called by the randomize method after randomization."
The constraint_mode() and the random_mode() methods are used to control the randomization. constraint_mode() is used to turn a specific constraint on and off and the random_mode is used to turn a randomization of a specific variable on or off. The below code describes and procedurally tests an Ethernet frame:
"Assertions are useful for verifying properties of a design that manifest themselves after a specific condition or state is reached. SystemVerilog has its own assertion specification language, similar to Property Specification Language. The subset of SystemVerilog language constructs that serves assertion is commonly called SystemVerilog Assertion or SVA."
"SystemVerilog assertions are built from sequences and properties. Properties are a superset of sequences; any sequence may be used as if it were a property, although this is not typically useful."
Sequences consist of boolean expressions augmented with temporal operators. The simplest temporal operator is the codice_37 operator which performs a concatenation:
This sequence matches if the codice_38 signal goes high one clock cycle after codice_39 goes high. Note that all sequence operations are synchronous to a clock.
"Other sequential operators include repetition operators, as well as various conjunctions. These operators allow the designer to express complex relationships among design components."
An assertion works by continually attempting to evaluate a sequence or property. An assertion fails if the property fails. The sequence above will fail whenever codice_39 is low. To accurately express the requirement that codice_38 follow codice_39 a property is required:
"This example shows an implication operator codice_43. The clause to the left of the implication is called the antecedent and the clause to the right is called the consequent. Evaluation of an implication starts through repeated attempts to evaluate the antecedent. When the antecedent succeeds, the consequent is attempted, and the success of the assertion depends on the success of the consequent. In this example, the consequent won't be attempted until codice_39 goes high, after which the property will fail if codice_38 is not high on the following clock."
"In addition to assertions, SystemVerilog supports assumptions and coverage of properties. An assumption establishes a condition that a formal logic proving tool must assume to be true. An assertion specifies a property that must be proven true. In simulation, both assertions and assumptions are verified against test stimuli. Property coverage allows the verification engineer to verify that assertions are accurately monitoring the design."
Coverage as applied to hardware verification languages refers to the collection of statistics based on sampling events within the simulation. Coverage is used to determine when the device under test (DUT) has been exposed to a sufficient variety of stimuli that there is a high confidence that the DUT is functioning correctly. Note that this differs from code coverage which instruments the design code to ensure that all lines of code in the design have been executed. Functional coverage ensures that all desired corner and edge cases in the design space have been explored.
"A SystemVerilog coverage group creates a database of ""bins"" that store a histogram of values of an associated variable. Cross-coverage can also be defined, which creates a histogram representing the Cartesian product of multiple variables."
"A sampling event controls when a sample is taken. The sampling event can be a Verilog event, the entry or exit of a block of code, or a call to the codice_46 method of the coverage group. Care is required to ensure that data are sampled only when meaningful."
For example:
"In this example, the verification engineer is interested in the distribution of broadcast and unicast frames, the size/f_type field and the payload size. The ranges in the payload size coverpoint reflect the interesting corner cases, including minimum and maximum size frames."
"A complex test environment consists of reusable verification components that must communicate with one another. Verilog's 'event' primitive allowed different blocks of procedural statements to trigger each other, but enforcing thread synchronization was up to the programmer's (clever) usage. SystemVerilog offers two primitives specifically for interthread synchronization: ""mailbox"" and ""semaphore"". The mailbox is modeled as a FIFO message queue. Optionally, the FIFO can be type-parameterized so that only objects of the specified type may be passed through it. Typically, objects are class instances representing ""transactions"": elementary operations (for example, sending a frame) that are executed by the verification components. The semaphore is modeled as a counting semaphore."
"In addition to the new features above, SystemVerilog enhances the usability of Verilog's existing language features. The following are some of these enhancements:"
"Besides this, SystemVerilog allows convenient interface to foreign languages (like C/C++), by SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface)."
"In the design verification role, SystemVerilog is widely used in the chip-design industry. The three largest EDA vendors (Cadence Design Systems, Mentor Graphics, Synopsys) have incorporated SystemVerilog into their mixed-language HDL simulators. Although no simulator can yet claim support for the entire SystemVerilog , making testbench interoperability a challenge, efforts to promote cross-vendor compatibility are underway. In 2008, Cadence and Mentor released the Open Verification Methodology, an open-source class-library and usage-framework to facilitate the development of re-usable testbenches and canned verification-IP. Synopsys, which had been the first to publish a SystemVerilog class-library (VMM), subsequently responded by opening its proprietary VMM to the general public. Many third-party providers have announced or already released SystemVerilog verification IP."

= = = Provincial Training School = = =
"The Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (PTS) in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada operated as an institution for mentally disabled children and adults between 1923 and 1977, at which time it was renamed the Michener Centre. It aimed to provide care and training to facilitate the integration of individuals with intellectual disabilities into their communities. While today it houses a service for persons with developmental disabilities, the nearly one-century-old facility is preceded by a diverse, remarkable and even shocking history, marked by eugenic practices like involuntary sterilization."
"The three-storey building, which once housed the Provincial Training School, has undergone many administrative changes since its construction in 1913. Located on the Michener hill in the city of Red Deer, Alberta, it originally housed the Alberta Ladies' College of Red Deer as one of Western Canada's finest residential college buildings at the time. In 1916, the provincial government converted the college into a psychiatric hospital for shell-shocked soldiers. It was not until 1923 that the facility saw the inception of the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives, which would serve as a care facility for the mentally disabled until 1973. Today, it functions as Alberta Health Services Administration Building the rest of the buildings function as PDD Michener Services residential care facility for persons with developmental disabilities and currently has 123 residents."
"In 1923, the Provincial Training School (PTS) was conceived as a residential school, aiming to enable the ""academic, vocational and personal development of retarded children and young adults"". It allowed developmentally disabled children to live apart from psychiatrically diagnosed children, and provided the parents of these children respite of the daily struggles of raising children with special needs."
"Before the opening of the PTS, Alberta's mentally disabled children that were not living with their families were usually grouped with psychiatric patients in care facilities as far away as Brandon, Manitoba. At its founding, the PTS was viewed as a progressive step for Canadians because it focused on segregating the ""mentally retarded from the mentally ill,"" and was claimed to support the shift ""from incarceration to education"". In due time, the PTS expanded its function to include occupational therapy and vocational training, which was meant to serve as stepping-stones for the residents' integration into the larger community. In the 1950s, the PTS claimed to centre its efforts on ""increasing the trainee's independence,"" and in the 1960s, on ""resident training"". The view of the school as ""humane, well run, evolving as attitudes towards feeble-mindedness evolved,"" was upheld by Albertans throughout the span of its operation. However, rising population figures indicated that most residents of the PTS did not, in fact, return to their communities."
"To the greater Red Deer community, the PTS served as its chief employer and enriched the local community with its own farm and opulent gardens. The school featured state-of-the-art classrooms, a chain of dormitories, and even a separate hospital. This idealistic establishment appealed to even Alberta's most prestigious families, including ex-Premier of Alberta, Ernest Manning, who enrolled his eldest son, Keith, at the school."
"After the passing of the ""Sexual Sterilization Act"" of Alberta (SSAA) in 1928, the Provincial Training School (PTS) oversaw and performed the sterilizations of over 2,800 persons to improve society by preventing the genetic transmission of undesirable traits as well as to protect unfit individuals from the burdens of parenthood. Other Albertan facilities that also performed similar procedures were the Alberta Hospital in Ponoka and the Oliver Mental Hospital in Edmonton."
"To assess persons' eligibility for sterilization, the Alberta government created the Alberta Eugenics Board, headed by University of Alberta psychologist, John M. MacEachran, one year after the enactment of the SSAA. Board members persistently searched the province for prospective subjects, and thus frequently found themselves visiting the PTS. Whether or not an individual was suited for sterilization was decided by a panel of 4 people (2 medical professionals and 2 laypeople13), formed by the Alberta Eugenics Board, who presented patients with a single psychological test. Answers to this informal, interview-style test, including questions, such as, ""At what age does a child begin to walk?,"" and, ""How do you like it here?"", guided the Board's 10-minute review of each case. Patients rarely had knowledge of the true purpose of the meetings; even on the day of their surgery, they were often only told that their appendix would be removed. Most would not discover what had been done to them at the PTS until years after leaving the school and, for some, the news came after several unsuccessful attempts to conceive. Initially, the procedure required consent from the patient or from a parent or guardian, but this pre-requisite was repeatedly ignored after 1937. Sometimes, authorization forms, required for surgeries to be carried out, were signed by officials before any assessments had been conducted."
"The fact that only a handful of the nearly 900 cases presented to the Eugenics Board by Leonard Jan Le Vann, medical superintendent of the PTS, were rejected has raised questions about the integrity of the assessments and decision-makers alike. Because of the Board's enduring trust in the superintendent's judgement, many individuals who did not meet the formal criteria for sterilization were nonetheless rendered infertile. Among those targeted were children with both subpar IQs (<70) and IQs highly exceeding the upper limit of 703, those with physical or mental disorders and those ailed by heritable disease. Other traits targeted by the eugenic procedure were ethnic minority and poverty, as well as criminal behaviour, alcoholism and promiscuity. Women, eastern European immigrants, First Nations people, and Catholics represented a disproportionate number of those sterilized at the PTS. The Eugenics Board never stopped to question the individuals' backgrounds or why Le Vann fought for their sterilization. As far as policy -makers and -enforcers were concerned, all of these groups had one thing in common: they were ""a menace to society""."
"L. J. Le Vann presented an even more peculiar type of case to the Board, which ultimately approved it 30 times. In his private research, Le Vann studied spermatogenesis in the testicles of boys with Down's syndrome. To supply his research with tissue samples, the medical director ordered not only vasectomies but also orchidectomies of males with Down's syndrome. This practice was carried out although it was already known within the medical community at the time that males with Trisomy 21 are sterile. Also, the Board which consented the procedure included Margaret Thompson, one of the leading medical geneticist in Canada at the time."
"While the name of the facility implies a school for 'mental defectives', many of those admitted to the Provincial Training School (PTS) were orphaned or simply unwanted by their families. Consequently, many admitted students were socially awkward as a result of deficiencies in certain social skills. Often, high-functioning children stemming from abrasive families were admitted due to misdiagnosis. Furthermore, such unnecessary admissions were exacerbated by the school's non-standardized admissions procedures, including mandatory IQ tests that were insensitive to some patients’ abusive upbringing or other relevant socio-economic factors."
"In the school, residents were divided among different wards corresponding to 'hierarchies of disability'. The more capable children were quickly put to work by the school's superintendent, L. J. Le Vann. 'High-grade' teenage girls scrubbed floors, prepared meals, and dressed the severely disabled, while the boys tended to farmland and milked cows. A former resident, Donald Passey, personally recalled the physical disciplining by staff members at the school. He was once slapped and punched while held up against the wall; even severely impaired children sometimes suffered physical abuse. Glen Sinclair, also an ex-student at the PTS, described his role at the school as the subject of constant observation. He and his dorm-mates were denied all privacy and prohibited any outside access without consent - even the windows only opened six inches wide3. Any attempts at rebellion such as refusal to eat, sleep, wake or work, or even sexual expression, resulted in brutal punishment. This included corporeal beatings, incarceration in Time-Out Rooms, and even enrolment in drug experiments with potent tranquilizers, such as Phenobarbital, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol. L. J. Le Vann often threatened misbehaviour with sterilization, a procedure which soon became customary at the school's hospital. While children were punished for even slight expression of sexuality, the PTS nevertheless accommodated the hetero- and homosexual abuse of its students by its staff members."
"Leilani Muir was a resident at PTS and was sterilized, without her consent, in 1959. In 1996, she won a lawsuit against the province of Alberta for wrongfully admitting her and sterilizing her against her will, and that her life after PTS has proven her ability to live a normal functioning life in the larger society . The province's defence, Crown lawyer William Olthius, argued, however, that Muir's ability to ""make it"" since leaving the PTS is a sign of the school's ""appropriate and high-quality curriculum of academic schooling, vocational training and life skills."" Muir, however, claimed that she was poorly educated during her time at the PTS."
"As a means of controlling its residents, the Provincial Training School (PTS) utilized much dreaded Time-Out Rooms. Each of the dormitories at the PTS featured a room in the direct line of sight of staff and residents. Bare, concrete walls and heavy, locked doors, with only a tiny orifice for food delivery, enclosed the empty cellars. The Rooms contained one-way mirrors, through which the incarcerated individual could be monitored by both staff and residents, and sometimes a small window. Lacking access to a proper toilet, residents in time-out rooms were forced to relieve themselves on the floor where a drain was installed. Inmates were usually stripped naked during their time in the time-out rooms to avert their potential self-harm. Only at night would a mattress be laid on the ground for inmates to rest on. Some were debilitated with straitjackets."
"Most frequently, a resident would land in a Time-Out Room after an unsuccessful attempt to flee the school, at which time staff ensured public awareness through wailing sirens and intrusive ward searches. The dehumanizing effect of the Time-Out Rooms allowed staff to handle residents with derogatory and senseless conduct, ultimately depriving them of their human rights and dignity. Time-Out Rooms served as a powerful method of ""physical and psychological, reactive and proactive control""."
"From 1949 until 1974, American-born Leonard Jan Le Vann was the medical superintendent of the Provincial Training School (PTS). Upon arriving at the school, Le Vann took on positions both in surgery and psychiatry, which enabled him to assess students as well as perform operations when necessary. Past PTS staff recalled his meticulous attention to detail, especially in delegating their tasks. Le Vann ordered nurses to maintain extensive reports on everything from children's bowel movements to their sexual interests. He also commanded a very strict work environment in which no personnel spoke to their supervisors, unless spoken to. During the 1960s, Le Vann ""ran the institution almost...like a Gestapo,"" a former PTS psychologist remembers. It was later revealed that Le Vann had kept several significant secrets. In 1995, 8 years after his death, it was found that the medical director never actually obtained accreditation to practice psychiatry. His first wife also discovered that, in order to disguise his Jewish descent, the man had undergone a name-change at a young age."
"The PTS witnessed a drastic increase (500%) in the number of residents between its initiation in 1923 and 1959, at which time the school housed around 1,400 children. As oversight of the school became obscured, the PTS sought to expand its employee base. However, because most psychologists dreaded working in a mental institution, the PTS's efforts to recruit qualified staff faced numerous shortcomings. It did not help that the school was situated in Red Deer, a prairie town of around 30, 000, where the number of skilled applicants was minuscule. In these times of desperation, Le Vann once hired someone with no professional experience to fill the position of head psychologist. This person was responsible for the IQ tests that were part of the assessment protocol for admission to the school. The resulting, arbitrary procedure caused numerous able-minded children to be admitted to the school. An ex-employee of the PTS revealed, ""Your qualification was grade twelve and they hired just about anybody, as long as they didn't have a criminal record"". Le Vann even went so far as to endorse admitting high-functioning children in order to exploit their abilities as forced labour."
"In 2013 the Provincial Government announced the closing of the Michener Centre due to provincial budget constraints. The government intends to phase the Centre out by gradually moving residents into other private or not-for-profit facilities on up to its scheduled completion and final closing date in April 2014. Despite its history, the closing of Michener Centre has become very controversial in that current public perception of the Centre is quite positive due to its more recent history of providing quality care for residents with very severe psychological and developmental needs."

"The Tea Party fielded a number of anti-establishment candidates in the 2014 Republican primaries, but scored very few notable wins. However, they managed to unseat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his Virginia primary race. GOP attacks on Obama's unpopular administration resonated with voters and the party posted major gains around the country. They regained control of the Senate and increased their majorities in the House to the highest total since 1929. They took control of governorships, state legislatures and Senate seats in nearly all Southern states, except Florida and Virginia."
"Great divisions in the House GOP conference were apparent after the 2014 midterm elections, with conservative members, many of them from the right-leaning Freedom Caucus, expressing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership. John Boehner's surprise announcement in September 2015 that he would step down as Speaker sent shockwaves through the House. After Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy bowed out of the race to replace Boehner due to a lack of support, House Ways and Means Chair Paul Ryan announced he would run, with the Freedom Caucus' support. Ryan was elected Speaker on October 29."
"Businessman Donald Trump won the 2016 Republican primaries, representing a dramatic policy shift from traditional conservatism to an aggressively populist ideology with overtones of cultural identity politics. Numerous high-profile Republicans, including past presidential nominees like Mitt Romney, announced their opposition to Trump; some even did so after he received the GOP nomination. Much of the Republican opposition to Trump stemmed from concerns that his disdain for political correctness, his support from the ethno-nationalist alt-right, his virulent criticism of the mainstream news media, and his expressions of approval for political violence would result in the GOP losing the presidential election and lead to significant GOP losses in other races. In one of the largest upsets in American political history, Trump went on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election."
"In addition to electing Donald Trump as president, Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate, in the House, and amongst state governors in the 2016 elections. The Republican Party was slated to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017 (the most it had held in history) and at least 33 governorships (the most it had held since 1922). The party took total control of the government (legislative chambers and governorships) in 25 states following the 2016 elections; this was the most states it had controlled since 1952."
"Sources differ over the extent Trump dominated and ""remade"" the Republican Party. Some have called his control ""complete"", noting that the few dissenting ""Never Trump"" Republican elected officials retired or were defeated in primaries, that conservative media strongly supported him, and that his approval rating among self-identified Republican voters was extraordinarily high."
"According to Trump and others, his policies differed from those of his Republican predecessors (such as Reagan) in being more oriented towards the working class, more skeptical of free trade agreements, and more isolationist and confrontational with foreign allies."
"Others suggested that Trump's popularity among the Republican base did not translate into as much GOP candidate loyalty as expected. Still others opined that Republican legislation and policies during the Trump administration continued to reflect the traditional priorities of Republican donors, appointees and congressional leaders. Jeet Heer of ""New Republic"" suggested that Trump's ascendancy was the ""natural evolutionary product of Republican platforms and strategies that stretch back to the very origins of modern conservatism""; Heer and others have connected Trump to the party's use of the Southern strategy to increase support among Southern whites by appealing to racism."
"The Republican Party had a progressive element, typified in the early 20th century by Theodore Roosevelt in the 1907–1912 period (Roosevelt was more conservative at other points), Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and western leaders such as Senator Hiram Johnson in California, Senator George W. Norris in Nebraska, Senator Bronson M. Cutting in New Mexico, Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin in Montana and Senator William Borah in Idaho. They were generally progressive in domestic policy, supported unions and supported much of the New Deal, but were isolationist in foreign policy. This element died out by the 1940s. Outside Congress, of the leaders who supported Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, most opposed the New Deal."
"Starting in the 1930s, a number of Northeastern Republicans took liberal positions regarding labor unions, spending and New Deal policies. They included Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in New York City, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, Governor Earl Warren of California, Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota, Senator Clifford P. Case of New Jersey, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. of Massachusetts, Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut (father and grandfather of the two Bush Presidents), Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York, Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky, Senator George Aiken of Vermont, Governor and later Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania and Governor George W. Romney of Michigan. The most notable of them all was Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. They generally advocated a free-market, but with some level of regulation. Rockefeller required employable welfare recipients to take available jobs or job training."
"While the media sometimes called them ""Rockefeller Republicans"", the liberal Republicans never formed an organized movement or caucus and lacked a recognized leader. They promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation, with the provision they could administer it more efficiently. They opposed the Democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike. Religion was not high on their agenda, but they were strong believers in civil rights for African Americans and women's rights and most liberals were pro-choice. They were also strong environmentalists and supporters of higher education. In foreign policy they were internationalists, throwing their support to Dwight D. Eisenhower over the conservative leader Robert A. Taft in 1952. They were often called the ""Eastern Establishment"" by conservatives such as Barry Goldwater."
"The Goldwater conservatives fought this establishment from 1960, defeated it in 1964 and eventually retired most of its members, although some became Democrats like Senator Charles Goodell and Mayor John Lindsay in New York. President Richard Nixon adopted many of their positions, especially regarding health care, welfare spending, environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities. After Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois bolted the party in 1980 and ran as an independent against Reagan, the liberal GOP element faded away. Their old strongholds in the Northeast are now mostly held by Democrats."
"The term ""Rockefeller Republican"" was used 1960–1980 to designate a faction of the party holding ""moderate"" views similar to those of Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York from 1959 to 1974 and Vice President under President Gerald Ford in 1974–1977. Before Rockefeller, Thomas E. Dewey, governor of New York (1942–1954) and GOP presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 was the leader. Dwight Eisenhower and his aide Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. reflected many of their views."
"An important moderate leader in the 1950s was Connecticut Republican Senator Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively. After Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called ""moderate Republicans"", in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to Ronald Reagan."
"Historically, Rockefeller Republicans were moderate or liberal on domestic and social policies. They favored New Deal programs, including regulation and welfare. They were supporters of civil rights. They were supported by big business on Wall Street (New York City). In fiscal policy they favored balanced budgets and relatively high tax levels to keep the budget balanced. They sought long-term economic growth through entrepreneurship, not tax cuts."
"In state politics, they were strong supporters of state colleges and universities, low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements, such as highway projects. In foreign policy they were internationalists and anti-communists. They felt the best way to counter communism was sponsoring economic growth (through foreign aid), maintaining a strong military and keeping close ties to NATO. Geographically their base was the Northeast, from Maine to Pennsylvania, where they had the support of major corporations and banks and worked well with labor unions."
"The moderate Republicans were top-heavy, with a surplus of high visibility national leaders and a shortage of grass roots workers. Most of all they lacked the numbers, the enthusiasm and excitement the conservatives could mobilize—the moderates decided it must be an un-American level of fanaticism that drove their opponents. Doug Bailey, a senior Rockefeller aide recalled, ""there was a mentality in [Rockefeller's] campaign staff that, 'Look, we have got all this money. We should be able to buy the people necessary to get this done. And you buy from the top down'"". Bailey discovered that the Rockefeller team never understood that effective political organizations are empowered from the bottom up, not the top down."
"Barry Goldwater crusaded against the Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller narrowly in the California primary of 1964 giving the Arizona senator, all of the California delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention. The election was a disaster for the conservatives, but the Goldwater activists now controlled large swaths of the GOP and they had no intention of retreating. The stage was set for a conservative takeover, based in the South and West, in opposition to the Northeast. Ronald Reagan continued in the same theme. George H. W. Bush was more closely associated with the moderates, but his son George W. Bush was firmly allied with the conservatives."
"From its inception in 1854 to 1964, when Senate Republicans pushed hard for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against a filibuster by Senate Democrats, the GOP had a reputation for supporting blacks and minorities. In 1869, the Republican-controlled legislature in Wyoming Territory and its Republican governor John Allen Campbell made it the first jurisdiction to grant voting rights to women. In 1875, California swore in the first Hispanic governor, Republican Romualdo Pacheco. In 1916, Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman in Congress—and indeed the first woman in any high level government position. In 1928, New Mexico elected the first Hispanic U.S. Senator, Republican Octaviano Larrazolo. In 1898, the first Jewish U.S. Senator elected from outside of the former Confederacy was Republican Joseph Simon of Oregon. In 1924, the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives was Republican Florence Kahn of California. In 1928, the Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Charles Curtis of Kansas, who grew up on the Kaw Indian reservation, became the first person of significant non-European ancestry to be elected to national office, as Vice President of the United States for Herbert Hoover."
"Blacks generally identified with the GOP until the 1930s. Every African American who served in the U.S. House of Representatives before 1935 and all of the African Americans who served in the Senate before 1979, were Republicans. Frederick Douglass after the Civil War and Booker T. Washington in the early 20th century were prominent Republican spokesmen. In 1966, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts became the first African American popularly elected to the United States Senate."
"Some critics, most notably Dan Carter, have alleged that the rapid growth in Republican strength in the South came from a secretly coded message to Wallacites and segregationists that the GOP was a racist anti-black party seeking their votes. Political scientists and historians point out that the timing does not fit the Southern strategy model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy, but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Matthew Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle-class. Many had Northern antecedents and they wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern strategy was a ""failure"" for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party ""always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash"". Furthermore, ""realignment in the South quote came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt""."
"The South's transition to a Republican stronghold took decades and happened incrementally, with national politics gradually influencing state and local politics. First the states started voting Republican in presidential elections—the Democrats countered that by nominating Southerners who could carry some states in the region, such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. However, the strategy narrowly failed with Al Gore in 2000. The states began electing Republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides. Georgia was the last state to shift to the GOP, with Republican Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win."
"In addition to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical Christian community and from Southern pockets of traditionalist Roman Catholics in South Louisiana. The national Democratic Party's support for liberal social stances such as abortion drove many white Southerners into a Republican Party that was embracing the conservative views on these issues. Conversely, liberal voters in the northeast began to join the Democratic Party."
"In 1969, Kevin Phillips argued in ""The Emerging Republican Majority"" that support from Southern whites and growth in the South, among other factors, was driving an enduring Republican electoral realignment. In the early 21st century, the South was generally solidly Republican in state elections and mostly solidly Republican in presidential contests. In 2005, political scientists Nicholas A. Valentino and David O. Sears argued that partisanship at that time was driven by disagreements on the size of government, national security and moral issues, while racial issues played a smaller role."

"Euthanasia is a criminal offense in China. For example, in Shanghai a 67-year-old man was sentenced to 5 years in prison when he euthanized his 92-year-old mother when she emerged from a hospital procedure only able to move one finger and one toe. The sentence was considered lenient because he had displayed filial piety toward his mother."
"While active euthanasia remains illegal in China, it is gaining increasing acceptance among doctors and the general populace."
"In Hong Kong, support for euthanasia among the general public is higher among those who put less importance on religious belief, those who are non-Christian, those who have higher family incomes, those who have more experience in taking care of terminally ill family members, and those who are older."
"Since World War II, the debate over euthanasia in Western countries has centered on voluntary euthanasia within regulated health care systems. In some cases, judicial decisions, legislation, and regulations have made voluntary euthanasia an explicit option for patients and their guardians. Proponents and critics of such voluntary euthanasia policies offer the following reasons for and against official voluntary euthanasia policies:"
Proponents of voluntary euthanasia emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.
"The pain and suffering a person feels during a disease, even with pain relievers, can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. Even without considering the physical pain, it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence."
"Those who witness others die are ""particularly convinced"" that the law should be changed to allow assisted death."
"Today in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space. Medical personnel and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the lives of those who want to die, thus increasing the general quality of care and shortening hospital waiting lists. It is a burden to keep people alive past the point they can contribute to society, especially if the resources used could be spent on a curable ailment."
"Critics argue that voluntary euthanasia could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees, especially doctors. They point out that European physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the Hippocratic Oath, which in its ancient form excluded euthanasia: ""To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.."" However, since the 1970s, this oath has largely fallen out of use."
"Some people, including many Christians, consider euthanasia of some or all types to be morally unacceptable. This view usually treats euthanasia to be a type of murder and voluntary euthanasia as a type of suicide, the morality of which is the subject of active debate."
"If there is some reason to believe the cause of a patient's illness or suffering is or will soon be curable, the correct action is sometimes considered to attempt to bring about a cure or engage in palliative care."
"Feasibility of implementation: Euthanasia can only be considered ""voluntary"" if a patient is mentally competent to make the decision, i.e., has a rational understanding of options and consequences. Competence can be difficult to determine or even define."
"Consent under pressure: Given the economic grounds for voluntary euthanasia, critics of voluntary euthanasia are concerned that patients may experience psychological pressure to consent to voluntary euthanasia rather than be a financial burden on their families. Even where health costs are mostly covered by public money, as in most developed countries, voluntary euthanasia critics are concerned that hospital personnel would have an economic incentive to advise or pressure people toward euthanasia consent."
"Non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes cited as one of the possible outcomes of the slippery slope argument, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia."
The right to life movement opposes voluntary euthanasia.
Euthanasia brings about many ethical issues regarding a patient’s death. Some physicians say euthanasia is a rational choice for competent patients who wish to die to escape unbearable suffering.
"Physicians who are in favor of euthanasia state that to keep euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) illegal is a violation of patient freedoms. They believe that any competent terminally-ill patient should have the right to choose death or refuse life-saving treatment. Suicide and assistance from their physician is seen as the only option those patients have. With the suffering and the knowledge from the doctor, this may also suggest that PAS is a humane answer to the excruciating pain."
"An argument against PAS is the violation of the Hippocratic oath that some doctors take. The Hippocratic oath states ""I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan""."
"Another reason for prohibiting PAS and euthanasia is the option of abusing PAS if it were to become legal. Poor or uninsured patients may not have the money or no access to proper care will have limited options, and they could be pressured towards assisted death."
"During the 20th century, efforts to change government policies on euthanasia have met limited success in Western countries. Euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations."
"There are many different religious views on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure."
"Euthanasia can be accomplished either through an oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration of drugs, or by oxygen deprivation (anoxia), as in some euthanasia machines. In individuals who are incapable of swallowing lethal doses of medication, an intravenous route is preferred. The following is a Dutch protocol for parenteral (intravenous) administration to obtain euthanasia:"
"Intravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then a triple intravenous dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, in order to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) are there substantial indications that the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dosage of 40 mg."
"With regards to voluntary euthanasia, many people argue that 'equal access' should apply to access to suicide as well, so therefore disabled people who cannot kill themselves should have access to voluntary euthanasia."
"Apart from ""The Old Law"", a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger, one of the early books to deal with euthanasia in a fictional context is Anthony Trollope's 1882 dystopian novel, ""The Fixed Period"". Ricarda Huch's novel ""The Deruga Case"" (1917) is about a physician who is acquitted after performing euthanasia on his dying ex-wife."
"""Quality of Mercy"" in ""The Prosecution Rests"" is a fable exploring the facets of aging, Alzheimer's disease, and euthanasia. The story line makes no judgement but frees the reader to decide."
"The plot of Christopher Buckley's 2007 novel ""Boomsday"" involves the use of 'Voluntary euthanasia' of seniors as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of social security as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age."
"The films ""Children of Men"" and ""Soylent Green"" depict instances of government-sponsored euthanasia in order to strengthen their dystopian themes. The protagonist of the film ""Johnny Got His Gun"" is a brutally mutilated war veteran whose request for euthanasia furthers the work's anti-war message. The recent films ""Mar Adentro"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" argue more directly in favor of euthanasia by illustrating the suffering of their protagonists. These films have provoked debate and controversy in their home countries of Spain and the United States respectively."
"In March 2010, the PBS ""Frontline"" TV program in the United States showed a documentary called ""The Suicide Tourist"" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and the Swiss group Dignitas, and their decision to help him commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)."
"Thrash metal band Megadeth's 1994 album ""Youthanasia"" (the title is a pun on euthanasia) implies that society is euthanizing its youth."
"The documentary film ""How to Die in Oregon"" follows the lives of select terminally ill individuals who weigh the options of continuing to live and euthanasia. This film employs emotional appeal to the audience on the controversial topic of voluntary euthanasia."
"In the case of diving equipment, oxygen cleaning generally involves the stripping down of the equipment into individual components which are then thoroughly cleaned of hydrocarbon and other combustible contaminants using non-flammable, non-toxic cleaners. Once dry, the equipment is reasssembled under clean conditions. Lubricants are replaced by specifically oxygen- compatible substitutes during reassembly."
The standard and requirements for oxygen cleaning of diving apparatus varies depending on the application and applicable legislation and codes of practice.
"For scuba equipment, the industry standard is that breathing apparatus which will be exposed to concentrations in excess of 40% oxygen by volume should be oxygen cleaned before being put into such service. Surface supplied equipment may be subject to more stringent requirements, as the diver may not be able to remove the equipment in an accident. Oxygen cleaning may be required for concentrations as low as 23%"
"Cleaning agents used range from heavy-duty industrial solvents and detergents such as liquid freon, trichlorethylene and anhydrous trisodium phosphate, followed by rinsing in deionised water. These materials are now generally deprecated as being environmentally unsound and an unnecessary health hazard. Some strong all-purpose household detergents have been found to do the job adequately. They are diluted with water before use, and used hot for maximum efficacy. Ultrasonic agitation, shaking, pressure spraying and tumbling using glass or stainless steel beads or mild ceramic abrasives are effectively used to speed up the process where appropriate. Thorough rinsing and drying is necessary to ensure that the equipment is not contaminated by the cleaning agent. Rinsing should continue until the rinse water is clear and does not form a persistent foam when shaken. Drying using heated gas – usually hot air – is common and speeds up the process. Use of a low oxygen fraction drying gas can reduce flash-rusting of the interior of steel cylinders."
"After cleaning and drying, and before reassembly, the cleaned surfaces are inspected and where appropriate, tested for the presence of contaminants. Inspection under ultraviolet illumination can show the presence of fluorescent contaminants, but is not guaranteed to show all contaminants."
Design for oxygen service includes several aspects:
"As a general rule, oxygen compatibility is associated with a high ignition temperature, and a low rate of reaction once ignited."
"Organic materials generally have lower ignition temperatures than metals considered suitable for oxygen service. Therefore the use of organic materials in contact with oxygen should be avoided or minimised, particularly when the material is directly exposed to gas flow. When an organic material must be used for parts such as diaphragms, seals, packing or valve seats, the material with the highest ignition temperature for the required mechanical properties is usually chosen. Fluoroelastomers are preferred where large areas are in direct contact with oxygen flow. Other materials may be acceptable for static seals where the flow does not come into direct contact with the component."
"Only tested and certified oxygen compatible lubricants and sealants should be used, and in as small quantities as is reasonably practicable for effective function. Projection of excess sealant or contamination by lubricant into flow regions should be avoided."
"Commonly used engineering metals with a high resistance to ignition in oxygen include copper, copper alloys, and nickel-copper alloys, and these metals also do not normally propagate combustion, making them generally suitable for oxygen service. They are also available in free-cutting, castable or highly ductile alloys, and are reasonably strong, so are useful for a wide range of components for oxygen service."
"Aluminium alloys have a relatively low ignition temperature, and release a large amount of heat during combustion and are not considered suitable for oxygen service where they will be directly exposed to flow, but are acceptable for storage cylinders where the flow rate and temperatures are low."
"Hazards analyses are performed on materials, components, and systems; and failure analyses determine the cause of fires. Results are used in design and operation of safe oxygen systems."

= = = Mediated communication = = =
"Mediated communication or mediated interaction (less often, mediated discourse) refers to communication carried out by the use of information communication technology and can be contrasted to face-to-face communication. While nowadays the technology we use is often related to computers, giving rise to the popular term computer-mediated communication, mediated technology need not be computerized as writing a letter using a pen and a piece of paper is also using mediated communication. Thus, Davis defines mediated communication as the use of any technical medium for transmission across time and space."
"Historically, mediated communication was much rarer than the face-to-face method. Even though humans possessed the technology to communicate in space and time for millennia, the majority of the world's population lacked skills such as literacy to use them. This began to change in Europe with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy from the 15th century. Separately, the first print culture was Chinese in origin. Whatever the tradition, face-to-face interaction has begun to steadily lose ground to mediated communication."
"Compared to face-to-face communication, mediated communication engages fewer senses, transmits fewer symbolic cues (most mediated communication does not transmit facial expressions) and is seen as more private. Parties usually require some technical expertise to operate the mediating technologies. New computerized media, such as mobile telephones or instant messaging, allow mediated communication to transmit more oral and nonverbal symbols than the older generation of tools."
"The type of mediated technology used can also influence its meaning. This is most famously rendered in Marshall McLuhan's maxim ""the medium is the message""."
"Lundby (2009) distinguished between three forms of mediated communication: mediated interpersonal communication, interactive communication, and mass communication. Thompson (1995), however, treated mass communication not as a part of mediated communication, but on par with mediated and face-to-face communication, terming it ""mediated quasi-interaction""."
"There are only a few ways that mediated communication and face-to-face communication function similarly. One of them is that interpersonal coordination is present in both face-to-face and mediated communication. However, mediated communication has vast differences and limitations compared with face-to-face communication. Writing in communication media and speech in face-to-face communication are different in terms of their lexical density, range of grammatical structures, varied connectivity between sentences, syntax, permanence, etc. These differences in each type of communication can change the message. Texting and e-mail, for example, contain combined forms of writing and speech, which is evident by slang and shorthand. Verbal (or textual) cues are used instead of nonverbal ones to convey the same messages."
"Individuals send more information at a time through computer media than any other form of communication, including face-to-face communication. This increased rate of information transfer allows abusive forms of communication like cyberbullying and phishing to occur. The disassociation and disinhibition associated with mediated communication can cause people who are being deceived to have trouble interpreting the reactions of the deceiver since information sent through media instead of face-to-face can lose or have change the nonverbal cues within it, and, with that, signs of deception. The decreased availability of these nonverbal cues increases disassociation and anonymity. It is easier to trust someone else through mediated communication, but people with less trust can detect deception better online."
"Because of the limitations of mediated communication, Nardi and Whittaker (2002) note, ""Many theorists imply that face-to-face communication is the gold standard of communication."" Mediated communication has been, however, described as preferable in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue. For example, in maintaining long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after mediated communication tools of telephone, email and instant messaging."
"Individuals will use different types of media depending on their motivations, communication purpose, institutional factors, and situational factors. Also, people will be more inclined to use a particular medium of communication if others associated with them use that medium; this is called the network effect. Motivations for using certain media are divided into strong- and weak-tie communication. There are five communication purposes: coordination, knowledge-sharing, information gathering, relationship development, and conflict resolution. Institutional factors include the physical structure of work units, social structure, and incentives. Situational factors include task characteristics, message content, and urgency."
"Fremantle entered the Confederacy through the Mexican town of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on 2 April on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS ""Immortalité"" to avoid being in violation of the Union blockade, and crossed the Rio Grande into Brownsville, Texas. Within three hours of his arrival in the Confederacy, Fremantle encountered 'frontier justice' for the first time, finding the body of a renegade, known as Montgomery, half-buried and stripped of flesh at the roadside. Spending almost two weeks in Brownsville, with occasional visits across the border to Matamoros and the village of Bagdad, Fremantle became acquainted with General Hamilton P. Bee and several merchants and diplomats who were facilitating the trade of cotton across the border with Mexico. Part of the reasoning for Fremantle's tenure in Brownsville may have been that he wished to meet General John B. Magruder, for whom he had a letter of introduction. However, Magruder was delayed, and Fremantle left Brownsville on 13 April in a carriage in the company of some of his merchant friends. Their driver and his assistant, Mr Sargeant and Judge Hyde, are particularly memorable figures from Fremantle's diary, in no small part due to Fremantle's astonishment that a member of the justiciary should be working on a stagecoach. Later, General Longstreet would recall meeting the same two men during his own service in Texas."
"After finally meeting with General Magruder shortly after leaving Brownsville, Fremantle continued his journey across the Texan desert, dutifully recording in his diary his observations about the taste of polecat, the snuff habits of Texan women, and allusions to the coarse language of his drivers and travelling companions. He finally arrived in San Antonio, Texas, on 24 April, where he sold most of his luggage, and from there travelled to Houston, Texas, where he arrived on 30 April. Here, he dined with General William Read Scurry, and observed that those Confederate officers he encountered were extremely complimentary about Great Britain and the Queen, even proposing toasts to her health and to the Empire. Fremantle now proceeded with haste across the remaining Texan countryside, as rumours concerning the fate of Alexandria, Louisiana began to reach him. Furthermore, the continuing siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was another source of anxiety, as the capture of the city would make passage across the Mississippi River practically impossible."
"Setting off for Galveston, Texas, on 2 May, Fremantle found himself meeting Sam Houston, the father of Texan independence, though he found the elder statesman to be vain and egotistical, as well as bitter and uncouth in his mannerisms. This occurred less than three months before Houston's death, presumably making Fremantle one of the last foreign visitors to meet the general. The English observer finally left Texas on 8 May, arriving in Shreveport, Louisiana, and partaking of the hospitality of General Edmund Kirby Smith and his wife."
"On the advice of General Kirby Smith, Fremantle made his way to Monroe, Louisiana, to attempt to cross the river from there due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of Alexandria. By the morning of 10 May, the day Fremantle's stagecoach arrived at its destination, travellers began to report that the city had fallen. In Monroe itself, Fremantle learned of the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville, although the news was accepted by locals without excitement. The wounding of Stonewall Jackson, however, caused some distress. The high expectations of Southerners, and their contempt for their enemies, would be among the few major points of criticism made by Fremantle. After considerable anxiety on board a steamer on the Mississippi, Fremantle finally crossed the river and arrived in Natchez, Mississippi, on 15 May."
"From Natchez, Fremantle travelled to Jackson, which he reached on 18 May. As the city had been evacuated and attacked only a few days earlier, Fremantle was treated with some suspicion by soldiers and locals, who expressed scepticism that an English officer should be travelling alone through the South. One local, the gun-toting Mr Smythe, even went so far as to threaten the foreign visitor with execution should he be unable to prove his identity and credentials. Upon 'examination' by a mob in a hotel, Fremantle finally convinced a Confederate cavalry officer and an Irish doctor of his legitimacy, and was spirited away to meet General Joseph E. Johnston, who accepted the peculiar traveller into his company. Fremantle remained near Johnston for several days, learning of the death of General Jackson from his Chancellorsville wound."
"Fremantle's next stop was at Mobile, Alabama, which he reached on 25 May after an eventful journey by train, in which a railway engineer shot a passenger. After inspecting the defences of the city with General Dabney H. Maury, Fremantle briefly visited Montgomery, the former capital of the Confederate States, before arriving in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 28 May. Here, Fremantle met yet more prominent figures, including Generals William J. Hardee and Leonidas Polk, and Clement Vallandigham, the leader of the Copperheads. Later, Fremantle also encountered Braxton Bragg, who supplied the Englishman with letters of introduction and passes, allowing him to travel to Shelbyville, which he reached the following day. Fremantle remained here until 5 June, inspecting troops in the company of General Hardee, his fellow Englishman Colonel George St. Leger Grenfell and the Irish-born General Patrick Cleburne. He also witnessed the baptism of General Bragg, and a small skirmish between Federal and Confederate forces outside the town, before leaving for Charleston the following day."
"Increasingly, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle became possessed of a desire to get to the Confederate capital, Richmond, and from there attempt to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, with whom he intended to journey for a while. From Tennessee, he travelled through Augusta and Atlanta, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, the birthplace of the war, on 8 June. The English tourist was keen to inspect the defences of the city, and remained there until 15 June, inspecting Fort Sumter and visiting Morris Island in the company of General Roswell S. Ripley, commander of South Carolina's First Military District. During this stay, Fremantle also met General PGT Beauregard, and a member of Captain Raphael Semmes' crew from the CSS ""Sumter"", whom Fremantle had first met in Gibraltar in 1862."
"En route to Richmond, Fremantle passed through Wilmington, North Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, before arriving in the Confederate capital two days after leaving Charleston. On the day of his arrival, he was granted a meeting with Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. During the audience, Benjamin assured Fremantle that British diplomatic recognition of the C.S.A. would terminate the war without more bloodshed, though the British officer was concerned about a possible Union invasion of Canada. Benjamin also complained to his guest about revelations about his gambling habits made by the former correspondent of ""The Times"", William Howard Russell. Benjamin then took Fremantle to see President Jefferson Davis, with whom he spoke for an hour. From Fremantle's account, it is possible to conclude that the Confederate leaders may have been trying to impress their British visitor on the matter of diplomatic intervention, without real consideration of his lack of power to do so."
"Intent on finding Lee's army at the earliest opportunity, Fremantle visited the Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon on 18 June, where he was furnished with letters of introduction to Generals Lee and Longstreet. Leaving Richmond two days later, Fremantle came upon the division of General William Dorsey Pender on 21 June, and reached Lee's headquarters at Berryville a day later."
"Here, Fremantle met the individuals who would be his companions for the next two weeks. Among them were Francis Lawley, the ""Times"" correspondent who had replaced Russell, Captain Fitzgerald Ross, an Austrian cavalry officer, and Captain Justus Scheibert, a Prussian army engineer who had been sent to inspect Confederate fortifications by his government. The accounts of these four men present the most enlightening accounts written by foreigners of the Campaign and Battle of Gettysburg."
"Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle introduced himself to General Longstreet on 27 June, a crucial meeting since it allowed Fremantle to observe the advance through Maryland and Pennsylvania in close quarters to the General and his staff. As well as the other foreign observers, Fremantle also became well acquainted with some of Longstreet's staff officers, including Gilbert Moxley Sorrel, Thomas Goree, and the medical staff, Doctors Cullen and Maury. As a neutral observer, Fremantle was allowed to enter the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which was off-limits to most soldiers and officers on the orders of General Lee."
"On 30 June, Fremantle met the famous commander of the Army of Northern Virginia for the first time, and learned from Longstreet that General George Meade had replaced Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army of the Potomac. In the camp, Fremantle spoke to the staff officers about the likelihood of battle in the near future. The next day, the sound of artillery fire alerted the English visitor that the two armies had indeed met each other. According to Fremantle's diary, a spy, presumably Henry Thomas Harrison, informed the company that there was a significant concentration of Union troops around Gettysburg. Whilst talking to Union prisoners, Fremantle met General Ambrose Powell Hill, who complained of being ill. Later in the evening, when the Union forces had reformed on Cemetery Ridge, Fremantle climbed a tree to observe the last of the fighting, before consulting with Longstreet again about the following day's action."
"On 2 July, the four foreign observers returned to the battlefield at 5 am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree to see what was happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2 pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4 pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above the din of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale."
"On the morning of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an inspection of the town of Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle was just getting under way, Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask."
"Coming upon Lee, Fremantle found him rallying the defeated troops, reassuring them and trying to rally them ahead of an anticipated Union counterattack. The Union counterattack did not come, however, and Fremantle retreated along with the rest of the Confederate Army on the night of 4 July. As the army fell back into Maryland, Fremantle met Jeb Stuart, the cavalry commander whose absence during the preceding battle cost Lee valuable intelligence. On 7 July, Fremantle took his leave of Longstreet and his staff, intending to cross the Union lines and make his way to New York City. A parting remark made by Major Latrobe did little to reassure him: 'You may take your oath he'll be caught for a spy'. Longstreet was more confident of Fremantle's abilities, informing his aide that, since Fremantle had managed to travel across lawless areas of Texas, crossing the Union lines would cause him little difficulty."
"Two days later, in Hagerstown, Fremantle left Lawley and Ross, and made his way towards the Union Army. Despite initial suspicion, Fremantle convinced General Benjamin Franklin Kelley that he was no spy, even showing the officer a pass from General Lee verifying Fremantle's neutral status."
"His passage having been secured, Fremantle arrived by train in New York City on the night of 12 July, booking into the Fifth Avenue Hotel."
"The following day, Fremantle went out for a walk along Broadway. Upon his return to the hotel, he found that shopkeepers were closing their shutters early, and then noticed that several buildings were ablaze. Fire engines were present, but the crowd was not permitting them to be used. Increasingly alarmed, Fremantle saw a black youth pursued by the mob, eventually finding refuge with a company of soldiers, to the disgust of the massed protestors. Bewildered, the Englishman asked a bystander why the crowds were so vehement in their hatred of blacks. In response, he was told that they were 'the innocent cause of all these troubles'."
"In fact, the New York City draft riots ( 13–16 July 1863), the most violent insurrection in the history of the US had begun, and were eventually to evolve into an anti-black pogrom. A day later, Fremantle noted that the activities of the mob were worsening, with battles between police and rioters now taking place in the streets. An English captain reported that the mob had forced their way onto his ship and beaten his black crew members, forcing a French warship to threaten violence against any attacks against foreign vessels."
"On 15 July, amidst the violence and terror gripping large parts of the city, Fremantle boarded the SS ""China"", and began his voyage back to Britain."
"Upon returning to England, the young Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle found himself being questioned by friends and colleagues on the truth of the situation in the Confederate States, as only Union newspapers were readily available in England. Suitably encouraged, Fremantle wrote a book on his experiences in America, ""Three Months in the Southern States"", based on the diary which he kept throughout his sojourn in the South. Published in 1864, the book was well-received both in Great Britain and in the Union, and it was even printed in Mobile by S.H. Goetzel & Co., being eagerly read even by the beleaguered Southerners, who wanted to see how their struggle was being reported by a foreign visitor."
"Fremantle married shortly after his return to Great Britain, and served with his regiment until 1880, when he was placed on half pay after 28 years of service without seeing any active duty. The following year, however, he was promoted to the rank of major general and assigned as aide-de-camp to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, commander-in-chief of the British Army."
"The United Kingdom was upset by the disasters suffered by the Anglo-Egyptian forces contending with the Mahdist army in the Sudan (Battle of El Obeid; 1st Battle of El Teb). Fremantle was sent to the Sudan, temporarily serving as garrison commander at the port of Suakin."
Fremantle followed General Graham in his inland raid when he intended to crush the Mahdist Osman Digna. Fremantle was in command of the Brigade of Guards and as such took part in the harsh Battle of Tamai.
"After the fall of Khartoum and the departure of the British from the Sudan, Fremantle stayed for a brief time in Cairo, then returned to England in 1886, serving in the War Office as Deputy Adjutant-General for Militia, Yeomanry and volunteers. In February 1893 he became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland, a post he held for less than a year."
"He ended his career on a high note by being appointed to the office of Governor of Malta in January 1894. During his time on the island, Fremantle became a popular governor, presiding over political decisions such as the matter of mixed and non-Catholic marriages, and the issue of the payment of reparations to the Maltese ecclesiastical authorities from the Napoleonic Wars. In 1897, Fremantle renamed the line of fortifications that was under construction the Victoria Lines to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In November 1898, he hosted a visit to the island by the German Emperor, Kaiser William II, who arrived in Valletta on board his personal yacht, the ""Hohenzollern"", upon which Governor Fremantle joined the Kaiser for dinner."
"In 1899, after his term in office ended, Lieutenant-General Arthur Fremantle returned to England. Fremantle was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John on 7 March 1900."
"A member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, General Fremantle died at the age of 65 in the Squadron's headquarters in Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight from complications of asthma on 25 September 1901. On the centenary of his funeral, a ceremony marking the restoration of his grave in Woodvale Cemetery, near Brighton, was conducted by his descendants and by Civil War re-enactors from the United States."
"Although the book was a best-seller at the time, the ultimate failure of the Confederacy to win its independence led to a sharp decrease in Britain in the appetite for Civil War diaries after 1865, including Fremantle's diary. In 1952, however, historian Walter Lord published a revised edition of ""Three Months in the Southern States"", retitled ""The Fremantle Diary"", which featured an introduction by the editor and detailed references."
"Part of the reason for the enduring fame of Fremantle compared to his fellow observers may be his role in Civil War literature and film, thanks to the success of Michael Shaara's historical novel, ""The Killer Angels"". The novel, published in 1974, deals with the events of the Battle of Gettysburg and the effects of the engagement on some of the main protagonists, including Generals Longstreet and Lee, as well as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and General John Buford. Shaara's primary source material for researching the novel included the diaries, letters and correspondence of figures who were either involved in or present at the Battle."
"In the 1993 film adaptation of Shaara's novel, retitled ""Gettysburg"", Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle is portrayed by James Lancaster. His character changes little from the book, once again engaging in important discussions with General Longstreet and his officers on the Confederacy's relations with the United Kingdom. However his appearance is substantially different from reality: in the movie he is shown in a scarlet British uniform sipping tea from a china cup, whereas, being in an unofficial capacity, he was dressed in a ""gray shooting-jacket"" and had been living rough like many others in the country."
"Since 1993, Fremantle has been portrayed in historical re-enactments in the United States by Roger Hughes, who also led the efforts to have Fremantle's grave in Brighton restored in 2001. Hughes maintains a website providing considerable information on Fremantle, his family, his travels and Civil War re-enactments."

= = = Wright Model C = = =
"The Wright Model C ""Speed Scout"" was an early military aircraft produced in the United States and which first flew in 1912. It was a development of the Model B but was specifically designed to offer the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps a long-range scouting aircraft."
"It featured a more powerful engine over the Wright B, and an endurance of around four hours. Still a two-seater, it added a complete second set of controls, meaning that either crew member could operate the aircraft. On some, the lever controls were replaced with two wheels mounted on a single yoke. Aerodynamically, the small finlets (""blinkers"" in the Wrights' terminology) that had been used on the Model B's undercarriage were replaced by two vertical vanes attached to the forward end of the skids."
"The aircraft had a short service life, from 1912 to 1914, because of a series of fatal crashes that destroyed six of the eight aircraft manufactured for the Army."
"The increase in power was to meet Army specifications that the aircraft have a rate of climb of 200 feet per minute (1 m/s), a fuel capacity for a four-hour flight, and carry a weight of 450 pounds including crew. Its simplified twin-lever control system was confusing to operate and proved difficult for novice pilots to master, while the plane itself was tail heavy and unstable."
"Seven Model Cs were used by the Aeronautical Division: S.C. 10-14, S.C. 16, and S.C. 5, a Burgess Model F rebuilt to Wright C standards. Five new Wright Scouts were delivered to the Aviation School at College Park, Maryland; one to the provisional 1st Aero Squadron at Texas City, Texas; and the last shipped to the Philippines. An eighth Aircraft (S.C. 18), a Burgess Model J delivered in January 1913, was a Wright C built under license by the Burgess Company and Curtis."
"The aircraft were delivered between May 1912 and January 1913 and were subject to approval of ten flight tests by the Army before acceptance. The first delivered, to have been S.C. 10, crashed during its climbing test on June 11, 1912, killing Wright Company pilot Arthur L. Welsh and Lt. Leighton W. Hazlehurst, and was replaced in October by another Wright C, itself destroyed in the last fatal crash on February 8, 1914. The crash involving Welsh was found by the Army's board of inquiry to have been pilot error by Welsh, who had intentionally placed the aircraft 45 degrees nose down prior to the test to build momentum. Deliveries of the plane continued, although the statement of one eyewitness led to speculation that the elevator had not responded to inputs to pull out of the dive."
"The Model Cs quickly earned an unenviable reputation when six of the eight passing their acceptance flights crashed between July 8, 1913, and February 9, 1914, with all but one of the crashes involving fatalities. The fifth crash on November 24, 1913 killed the Army's chief instructor and a new pilot. As a result, the Wright Company factory manager, Grover Loening, concluded that the Wright C was flawed by a design defect. Orville Wright disagreed, maintaining that pilot error was to blame, specifically unfamiliarity with the more powerful engine. He theorized that pilots stalled the aircraft by applying full power that in level flight made angle of attack critical. He proposed that full power be used only to climb and invented an angle-of-incidence indicator sensitive enough to warn a pilot that his climb or dive was too steep. He also completed work on an autopilot which he patented in October 1913, and successfully demonstrated in December, but a gyroscope-operated autopilot patented by Lawrence Sperry proved more immediately practical and became standard."
"The final crash resulted in grounding of the two surviving Model C's on February 16, 1914. An Army board of investigation concluded that the elevator was ""too weak"" and that the Model C itself was ""dynamically unsuited for flying,"" despite testimony from Wright's chief instructor that poor maintenance played a key role in the fatalities. The Aeronautical Division hired Loening as an engineer to review the airworthiness of its airplanes, and use of S.C.s No. 16 (which had a less powerful Model B engine) and No. 5 (a Burgess F rebuilt to Model C configuration), permanently discontinued on February 24, 1914, when on Loening's recommendation the Army de-commissioned all seven of its remaining ""pusher"" airplanes as a matter of policy."
= = = François-Xavier Brunet = = =
"François-Xavier Brunet (November 27, 1868 – January 7, 1922) was a Canadian Roman Catholic priest and bishop of Mont-Laurier, Quebec."
"Baptized in the parish of Saint-André-d'Argenteuil, Quebec, he moved to Ottawa in 1873. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890 from the College of Ottawa. He then decided to become a priest and studied theology at the Grand Séminaire d'Ottawa."
"Brunet was consecrated by Archbishop Joseph-Thomas Duhamel of Ottawa in 1893. In 1913, he was appointed the first bishop of the new diocese of Mont-Laurier, which was created from parts of the Archdiocese of Montréal and the Archdiocese of Ottawa."
He died in Montreal in 1922.
= = = Sustainable fashion = = =
"Sustainable fashion is a movement and process of fostering change to fashion products and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. Sustainable fashion concerns more than addressing fashion textiles or products. It comprises addressing the whole system of fashion. This means dealing with interdependent social, cultural, ecological and financial systems. It also means considering fashion from the perspective of many stakeholders - users and producers, all living species, contemporary and future dwellers on earth. Sustainable fashion therefore belongs to, and is the responsibility of citizens, public sector and private sector. A key example of the need for systems thinking in fashion is that the benefits of product-level initiatives, such as replacing one fiber type for a less environmentally harmful option is eaten up by increasing volumes of fashion products. An adjacent term to sustainable fashion is eco fashion."
"The origins of the sustainable fashion movement are intertwined with those of the modern environmental movement, of which it is a part, and specifically the publication in 1962 of the book ""Silent Spring"" by American biologist Rachel Carson. Carson's book exposed the serious and widespread pollution associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, a theme that is still important in the debate around the environmental and social impact of fashion today. The decades which followed saw the impact of human actions on the environment to be more systematically investigated, including the effects of industrial activity, and to new concepts for mitigating these effects, notably sustainable development, a term coined in 1987 by the Brundtland Report."
"In the early 1990s and roughly coinciding with the United Nations conference on Environment and Development in 1992, popularly known as the Rio Earth Summit, 'green issues' (as they were called at the time) made their way into fashion and textiles publications. Typically these publications featured the work of well-known companies such as Patagonia and ESPRIT, who in the late 1980s brought environmental concerns into their businesses. The owners of those companies at that time, Yvon Chouinard and Doug Tompkins, were outdoorsmen and witnessed the environment being harmed by over production and over consumption of material goods. They commissioned research into the impacts of fibers used in their companies. For Patagonia, this resulted in a lifecycle assessment for four fibers, cotton, wool, nylon and polyester. For ESPRIT the focus was on cotton—and finding better alternatives to it—which represented 90% of their business at that time. Interestingly, a similar focus on materials impact and selection is still the norm in the sustainable fashion thirty years on."
"The principles of 'green' or 'eco' fashion, as put forward by these two companies, was based on the philosophy of the deep ecologists Arne Næss, Fritjof Capra, and Ernest Callenbach, and design theorist Victor Papanek. This imperative is also reliant on feminist understanding of human-nature relationships, interconnectedness and “ethics of care” as advocated by Carolyn Merchant, Suzi Gablik, Vandana Shiva, and Carol Gilligan. The legacy of the early work of Patagonia and ESPRIT continues to shape the fashion industry agenda around sustainability today. They co-funded the first organic cotton conference held in 1991 in Visalia, California. And in 1992, the ESPRIT ecollection, developed by head designer Lynda Grose, was launched at retail and it was based on the Eco Audit Guide, published by the Elmwood Institute. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the movement in sustainable fashion broadened to include many brands. Though the primary focus has remained on improving the impacts of products through fiber and fabric processing and material provenance, Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard were early to note the fundamental cause of unsustainability: exponential growth and consumption. ESPRIT placed an ad in ""Utne Reader"" in 1990 making a plea for responsible consumption. In 2011 the brand Patagonia ran an ad and a PR campaign ""Don't buy this jacket"" with a picture of Patagonia merchandise. This message was intended to encourage people to consider the effect that consumption has on the environment, and to purchase only what they need."
"In parallel with the industry agenda, a research agenda around sustainable fashion has been in development since the early 1990s, with the field now having its own history, dynamics, politics, practices, sub-movements and evolution of analytical and critical language. The field is broad in scope and includes technical projects that seek to improve the resource efficiency of existing operations, the work of brands and designers to work within current priorities as well as those which look to fundamentally reimagine the fashion system differently, including the growth logic. In 2019, a group of researchers formed the Union for Concerned Researchers in Fashion to advocate for radical and co-ordinated research activity commensurate with the challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change. In the fall of 2019, the UCRF received the North Star Award at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards, an organization focused on the promotion of sustainability in the fashion industry. As a non-profit organization focused on instigating debate and disseminating scholarly research, the UCRF believes that responses from the fashion industry regarding today's climate crisis has been oversimplified or obstructed by limited business models. According to one of the founders, the UCRF hopes that the award helps bring light to the issues that continually plague the fashion industry."
"The fashion industry has a clear opportunity to act differently, pursuing profit and growth while also creating new value and deeper wealth for society and therefore for the world economy. It comes with an urgent need to place environmental, social, and ethical improvements on management's agenda. The goal of sustainable fashion is to create flourishing ecosystems and communities through its activity. This may include: increasing the value of local production and products; prolonging the lifecycle of materials; increasing the value of timeless garments; reducing the amount of waste; and to reducing the harm to the environment created as a result of production and consumption. Another of its aims can sometimes be seen to educate people to practice environmentally friendly consumption by promoting the ""green consumer""."
"There is however a growing concern that ""green consumerism"" that takes profit and economic growth as objectives can deliver the sustainable agenda needed to mitigate and reverse the pollution, labor exploitation and inequalities fashion industry promotes and profits from. This became apparent in the discussions following the Burberry report of the brand burning unsold goods worth around £28.6m (about $37.8 million) in 2018, exposing not only overproduction and subsequent destruction of unsold stock as a normal business practice, but the behaviours amongst brands that actively undermine a sustainable fashion agenda."
"The challenge for making fashion more sustainable requires to rethink the whole system. The Union of Concerned Researchers in Fashion has argued that the industry is still discussing the same ideas as were originally mooted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When taking the long view and examining fashion and sustainability progress since the 1990s, there are few actual advances in ecological terms. As the Union observes, ""So far, the mission of sustainable fashion has been an utter failure and all small and incremental changes have been drowned by an explosive economy of extraction, consumption, waste and continuous labour abuse."""
"A frequently asked question of those working in the area of sustainable fashion is whether the field itself is an oxymoron. This reflects the seemingly irreconcilable possibility of bringing together fashion (understood as constant change, and tied to business models based on continuous replacement of goods) and sustainability (understood as continuity and resourcefulness). The apparent paradox dissolves if fashion is seen more broadly, not only as a process aligned to expansionist business models, and consumption of new clothing, but instead as mechanism that leads to more engaged ways of living on a precious and changing earth."
"Fashion is, per definition, a phenomenon related to time: a popular expression in a certain time and context. This also affects the perception of what is and should be made more sustainable - if fashion should be ""fast"" or ""slow"" - or if it should be more exclusive or inclusive. Like much other design, the objects of fashion exist in the interzone between desire and discard along a temporal axis, between the shimmering urge towards life and the thermodynamic fate of death. As noted by cultural theorist Brian Thill, ""waste is every object, plus time."""
Mora described his reaction to learning of the authorization for coercive interrogation techniques in these words:
"To my mind, there's no moral or practical distinction [between cruelty and torture]. If cruelty is no longer declared unlawful, but instead is applied as a matter of policy, it alters the fundamental relationship of man to government. It destroys the whole notion of individual rights. The Constitution recognizes that man has an inherent right, not bestowed by the state or laws, to personal dignity, including the right to be free of cruelty. It applies to all human beings, not just in America—even those designated as 'unlawful enemy combatants.' If you make this exception, the whole Constitution crumbles. It's a transformative issue...<br> Besides, my mother would have killed me if I hadn't spoken up. No Hungarian after Communism, or Cuban after Castro, is not aware that human rights are incompatible with cruelty. The debate here isn't only how to protect the country. It’s how to protect our values."""
"Mora and Brant met with Rear Admiral Michael Lohr, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, and Dr. Michael Gelles, the Chief Psychologist of the NCIS, and learned more about the Guantanamo interrogation practices, and determined that they were ""unlawful and unworthy of the military services"", and that they would investigate further."
"Mora obtained a copy of a request by the commander of JT-170, Major General Michael Dunlavey, to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for authorization to apply extraordinary interrogation techniques, including ""stress positions, hooding, isolation, 'deprivation of light and auditory stimuli', and use of 'detainee-individual phobias (such as fear of dogs) to induce stress; a legal brief accompanying the request that supported the legality of such techniques, by the Senior Judge Advocate to JT-170, Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver; and an approval of the request by Rumsfeld. The legal brief held that ""cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment could be inflicted on the Guantanamo detainees with near impunity""."
"Mora found the brief to be ""a wholly inadequate analysis of the law"" and that the approved request was ""fatally grounded on these serious failures of legal analysis"" because it provided no bright line standard for what techniques would be prohibited; the techniques it approved ""could produce effects reaching the level of torture""; and that ""even if the techniques as applied did not reach the level of torture, they almost certainly would constitute 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and either way would be unlawful."
"In the following weeks, Mora actively argued with a large number of the most senior lawyers and officials of the military and the Defense Department that the interrogation techniques that had been approved were unlawful. On January 15, 2003, he received word from William Haynes, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, that Rumsfeld would be suspending the authority for the extraordinary interrogation techniques later that day. Mora was ""delighted"" and ""reported the news widely""."
"Two days later, Rumsfeld directed Haynes to establish a Working Group to develop a new set of guidelines for interrogation techniques, headed by Mary L. Walker, General Counsel of the Air Force. Mora worked actively to establish interrogation guidelines prohibiting coercive interrogation techniques, citing scientific evidence that they were ineffective, as well as legal arguments that they were unlawful."
"However, early in the process, the Working Group was provided with a legal brief from the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), and told they should follow its guidance. This was the same brief that later became infamous as the ""Torture Memo"", largely written by OLC deputy director John Yoo."
"Mora regarded the OLC memo as lengthy and seemingly sophisticated, but otherwise identical to the Beaver brief he had already argued against. Mora argued against the conclusions of the OLC memo, arguing that the OLC memo was ""fundamentally in error"" and ""virtually useless as guidance... and dangerous."" With Walker's encouragement to share his views, he circulated an opposing draft memo, entitled ""Proposed Alternative Approach to Interrogations""."
"But, according to Mora, contributions from members of the Working Group began to be rejected if they did not conform to what was already in the OLC memo, and Walker, the head of the Working Group, said of his arguments, ""I disagree and moreover I believe [the General Counsel of the Defense Department] disagrees."" Mora evaluated the work being prepared by the Working Group as containing ""profound mistakes in its legal analysis"" and as ""unacceptable"". Mora met with DOD General Counsel Haynes who disagreed with Mora's arguments."
"Walker invited the author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and civilian at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so for the safety of the nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and ""never... see the light of day again."" The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis."
"After that, Mora never saw a final report of the Working Group, and assumed that it had been abandoned. He learned otherwise only in May 2004, when he heard it referenced in televised reports on the Abu Ghraib scandal, and received confirmation from the Deputy General Counsel of the Air Force that a final draft of the Working Group's report had been signed out and delivered to the Joint Task Force Guantanamo commander, Major General Geoffrey Miller, who had also been subsequently sent to Abu Ghraib to ""Gitmo-ize"" it. Mora is a Senior Fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University."
"For his efforts, Mora was honored with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2006, which is administered by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation."
= = = History of the United States Republican Party = = =
"The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (""Grand Old party""), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties. It is the second-oldest existing political party in the United States; its chief rival, the Democratic Party, is the oldest."
"The Republican Party emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery into American territories. The early Republican Party consisted of African-Americans, northern white Protestants, businessmen, professionals, factory workers, and farmers. The GOP was pro-business, and it supported banks, the gold standard, railroads and high tariffs; the party opposed the expansion of slavery. At its inception, Republican Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States; by 1858, however it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state."
"With the election of Abraham Lincoln (the first Republican President) in 1860, the Party's success in guiding the Union to victory in the American Civil War, and the Party's role in the abolition of slavery, the Republican Party largely dominated the national political scene until 1932. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt formed the Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party after being rejected by the GOP and ran unsuccessfully as a third-party presidential candidate calling for social reforms. After 1912, many Roosevelt supporters left the Party, and the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right. The GOP lost its congressional majorities during the Great Depression (1929–1940); under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democrats formed a winning New Deal coalition that was dominant from 1932 through 1964."
"After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. White voters increasingly identified with the Republican Party after the 1960s. Following the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in ""Roe v. Wade"", the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals. The Republican Party won five of the six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988. Two-term President Ronald Reagan, who held office from 1981 to 1989, was a transformative party leader whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes and a strong anti-Soviet Union foreign policy. Reagan's influence upon the party persisted into the next century."
"Since the 1990s, the Party's support has chiefly come from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North. The 21st century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism. The GOP supports lower taxes, free market capitalism, a strong national defense, gun rights, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions; it opposes abortion. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the Republican Party is socially conservative. There have been 19 Republican presidents, the most from any one political party. The most recent, Donald Trump, was elected President in 2016."
"The Republican Party grew out of opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which was signed into law by President Franklin Pierce in 1854. The Act opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to slavery and future admission as slave states, thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36° 30′ latitude that had been part of the Missouri Compromise. This change was viewed by anti-slavery Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South. Opponents of the Act were intensely motivated and began forming a new party. The Party began as a coalition of anti-slavery Conscience Whigs such as Zachariah Chandler and Free Soil Democrats such as Salmon P. Chase."
"The first anti-Nebraska local meeting where ""Republican"" was suggested as a name for a new anti-slavery party was held in a Ripon, Wisconsin schoolhouse on March 20, 1854. The first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the Republican name was held near Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. At that convention, the party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates. The Midwest took the lead in forming state Republican Party tickets; apart from St. Louis and a few areas adjacent to free states, there were no efforts to organize the Party in the southern states."
"New England Yankees, who dominated that region and much of upstate New York and the upper Midwest, were the strongest supporters of the new party. This was especially true for the pietistic Congregationalists and Presbyterians among them and, during the war, many Methodists and Scandinavian Lutherans. The Quakers were a small, tight-knit group that was heavily Republican. By contrast, the liturgical churches (Roman Catholic, Episcopal and German Lutheran) largely rejected the moralism of the Republican Party; most of their adherents voted Democratic."
"The new Republican Party envisioned modernizing the United States, emphasizing expanded banking, more railroads and factories, and giving free western land to farmers (""free soil"") as opposed to letting slave owners buy up the best properties. It vigorously argued that free market labor was superior to slavery and was the very foundation of civic virtue and true republicanism; this was the ""Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men"" ideology. Without using the term ""containment"", the Republican Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy: The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery."
"The Republican Party launched its first national convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on February 22, 1856. The convention elected a governing National Executive Committee and passed resolutions calling for the repeal of laws enabling slaveholding in free territories and ""resistance by Constitutional means of Slavery in any Territory,"" defense of anti-slavery individuals in Kansas who were coming under physical attack, and a call to ""resist and overthrow the present National Administration"" of Franklin Pierce, ""as it is identified with the progress of the Slave power to national supremacy."" Its first national nominating convention held in the summer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. John C. Frémont ran as the first Republican nominee for President in 1856 behind the slogan ""Free soil, free silver, free men, Frémont and victory!"" Although Frémont's bid was unsuccessful, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in New England, New York and the northern Midwest and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–1860 as a divisive force that threatened civil war."
"The Republican Party absorbed many of the previous traditions of its members, who had come from an array of political factions, including Working Men, Locofoco Democrats, Free Soil Democrats, Free Soil Whigs, anti-slavery Know Nothings, Conscience Whigs, and Temperance Reformers of both parties. Many Democrats who joined were rewarded with governorships, or seats in the U.S. Senate, or House of Representatives."
"During the presidential campaign in 1860, at a time of escalating tension between the North and South, Abraham Lincoln addressed the harsh treatment of Republicans in the South in his famous Cooper Union speech: [W]hen you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to ""Black Republicans."" [...] But you will not abide the election of a Republican president! In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, ""Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!"""
"The election of Lincoln as President in 1860 opened a new era of Republican dominance based in the industrial North and agricultural Midwest. The Third Party System was dominated by the Republican Party (it lost the presidency only in 1884 and 1892). Lincoln proved brilliantly successful in uniting the factions of his party to fight for the Union in the Civil War. However, he usually fought the Radical Republicans who demanded harsher measures. Many conservative Democrats became War Democrats who had a deep belief in American nationalism and supported the war. When Lincoln added the abolition of slavery as a war goal, the Peace Democrats were energized and carried numerous state races, especially in Connecticut, Indiana and Illinois. Democrat Horatio Seymour was elected governor of New York and immediately became a likely presidential candidate."
"Most of the state Republican parties accepted the antislavery goal except Kentucky. During the American Civil War, the party passed major legislation in Congress to promote rapid modernization, including a national banking system, high tariffs, the first temporary income tax (subsequently ruled unconstitutional in ""Springer v. United States""), many excise taxes, paper money issued without backing (""greenbacks""), a huge national debt, homestead laws, railroads and aid to education and agriculture."
"The Republicans denounced the peace-oriented Democrats as disloyal Copperheads and won enough War Democrats to maintain their majority in 1862. In 1864, they formed a coalition with many War Democrats as the National Union Party. Lincoln chose Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate and was easily re-elected. During the war, upper-middle-class men in major cities formed Union Leagues to promote and help finance the war effort. Following the 1864 elections, Radical Republicans Led by Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House set the agenda by demanding more aggressive action against slavery and more vengeance toward the Confederates."
"Under Republican congressional leadership, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution—which banned slavery in the United States—passed the Senate in 1864 and the House in 1865; it was ratified in December 1865. In 1865, the Confederacy surrendered, ending the Civil War. Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865; following his death, Andrew Johnson took office as President of the United States."
"That sentiment was soon revised; also in 1994, Nintendo's vice president of marketing Peter Main stated that ""The choice we made is not cartridge versus CD, it's silicon over optical. When it comes to speed, no other format approaches the silicon-based cartridge."""
"The Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995, which destroyed a major RAM factory in Japan, increased the prices of RAM in the 1990s. Nintendo planned to continue to supplement the use of system RAM through innovations in high speed ROM cartridges. SGI suggested that Nintendo should utilize cartridges to keep the console's costs low and performance high."
"At Shoshinkai of 1995, Nintendo announced its development of the complementary 64DD, a rewritable magnetic disk based peripheral with several times faster transfer rates and seek time than competing CD-ROM consoles. In 1997, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, ""CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres. ... I think we'll make the game on a cartridge first, then ... finish it up as a full-out 64DD game."" Many Nintendo 64 games were developed in a way that depended upon or were expanded by that device. However, after the device's launch had been delayed several years until 1999 and restricted to Japan, it was discontinued early as a commercial failure."
"In 1996, prior to the Nintendo 64's launch, President of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi praised the user experience of the cartridge format:"
"Until the launch of the Switch in 2017, the Nintendo 64 was the latest major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, although most handheld systems (with the exception of the PlayStation Portable) continued to use cartridges. Most home systems began using disc, flash, and online formats. With the Nintendo GameCube, the company utilized the optical disc format instead of the cartridge format, in a boon to some developers. The company's stated goal was to reduce manufacturing costs; Nintendo did not cite storage space as a rationale. While the new console lacks backwards compatibility with Nintendo 64 Game Paks, Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo 64."
"Some Game Paks include internal EEPROM, flash memory, or battery-backed-up RAM for saved game storage. Otherwise, game saves are put onto a separate memory card, marketed by Nintendo as a Controller Pak."
"Each Nintendo 64 Game Pak contains a lockout chip (conceptually similar to the 10NES) to prevent manufacturers from creating unauthorized copies of games and discourage production of unlicensed games. Unlike previous versions, the N64 lockout chip contains a seed value which is used to calculate a checksum of the game's boot code. To discourage playing of copied games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak, Nintendo produced five different versions of the chip. During the boot process, and occasionally while the game is running, the N64 computes the checksum of the boot code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak, failing to boot if the check fails."
"On June 2, 1997, a U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order against Games City for its Game Doctor and Doctor V64 products, which allow users to copy from a Game Pak to a CD or hard disk drive. Games City was ordered to stop importing, distributing, advertising, or selling any such devices."
"The Nintendo 64 Game Pak medium provides essential benefits alongside a number of drawbacks. While they provide the fastest possible load times and greater durability, the format is more expensive to produce and has less storage space than the competing CD-ROM format."
"Nintendo was concerned that a CD-ROM drive would increase the cost of the console in a price-sensitive market. Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick said, ""We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off."""
"Specified at 5 to 50 MiB/s, Nintendo cited the ROM cartridges' very fast load times in comparison to disc-based games. Few contemporary CD-ROM drives have speeds above 4×, and the competing consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation have 2× drives running at about with high latency. This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers in many games, such as Nintendo EAD's ""Super Mario 64"" or Factor 5's ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine"". Howard Lincoln said, ""[Genyo Takeda, the Nintendo engineer working with Silicon Graphics to design Project Reality] and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do the kind of things that we wanted to do with ""Super Mario""."""
"Sega countered by claiming that load times on CD-ROMs could eventually be minimized. ""We are finding more and more ways to mask the load factor,"" Ted Hoff, vice president of sales and marketing at Sega, said. ""We are working out ways to overlay or leapfrog the loading time."""
"Game Paks are far more durable than compact discs, the latter of which must be carefully used and stored in protective cases. It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors. While Game Paks are more resistant than CDs to physical damage, they are sometimes less resistant to long-term environmental damage, particularly oxidation (although this can be simply cleaned off) or wear of their electrical contacts causing a blank or frozen screen, or static electricity."
"Due to complex manufacturing processes, cartridge-based games are more expensive and difficult to manufacture than their optical counterparts. PlayStation CD-ROMs reportedly cost $1 to manufacture, while cartridges for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System cost $15 and Nintendo 64 cartridges reportedly cost more than $30."
"Publishers had to pass these higher expenses to the consumer and as a result, Nintendo 64 games tended to sell for higher prices than PlayStation games. While most PlayStation games rarely exceeded US$50, Nintendo 64 cartridges could reach US$79.99, such as the first pressing of ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". Games in Sony's line of PlayStation Greatest Hits budget line retailed for US$19.95, while Nintendo's equivalent Player's Choice line retailed for US$29.95. In the United Kingdom, Nintendo 64 games were priced £54.95 at their time of release, while PlayStation games were priced at £44.95. In the United States, the typical price of a third-party game was around in the system's first year on the market, though this dropped incrementally after Nintendo reduced wholesale prices on the cartridges."
"Game Paks took longer to manufacture than CDs, with each production run (from order to delivery) taking two weeks or more. By contrast, extra copies of a CD based game could be ordered with a lead time of a few days. This meant that publishers of N64 titles had less flexibility to forecast demand for their titles. Publishers had to attempt to predict demand for a game ahead of its release. They risked being left with a surplus of expensive Game Paks for a failed game or a weeks-long shortage of product if they underestimated a game's popularity."
"Sony used this shortcoming to appeal to publishers. Andrew House, vice president of marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment America, said ""They can manufacture the appropriate amount of software without taking a tremendous inventory risk associated with the cartridge business."""
"During the Nintendo 64's development in 1995, Nintendo reported that the then-realized maximum cartridge size was 96 megabits (12 megabytes), with a theoretical maximum at the time of 256 megabits (32 megabytes). As fifth generation games became more complex in content, sound and graphics, they pushed Game Paks to the limits of their storage capacity. In practice, the few largest vintage Game Paks can hold up to 512 megabits (64 megabytes) of data, whereas CDs can hold more than 650 MiB. Games ported from other media may utilize more aggressive data compression (as with ""Resident Evil 2"") or altered content (as with ""Spider-Man"" and """") so that they may be released on the Nintendo 64. Exceptionally large games on CD-based systems can be made to span across multiple discs, while most Nintendo 64 games are contained within one Game Pak, as the use of an additional Game Pak or of one maximally sized Game Pak was often considered prohibitively expensive, and the 64DD expansion drive was released late and discontinued early."
"Due to the Game Pak's space limitations, full motion video is not usually feasible for use in cutscenes. A notable exception is ""Resident Evil 2"", which contains the equivalent material of the two CD-ROM discs of the original PlayStation version, plus some expanded content, plus higher quality audio samples and unique surround sound technology, making it what IGN calls ""the best version of the game"". Some games contain significant cinematic scenes whose graphics are generated by the system in real-time, as with """". Nintendo downplayed the importance of studio-prerendered videos, with software engineering manager Jim Merrick saying, ""Full-motion video demos really well on a CD-ROM, but once you get into the software, as a gamer, you're thinking 'let's get on with the game.'"""
"Nintendo also countered that developers did not generally use the full 650MiB capacity of CD-ROMs, stating that the smaller storage space encouraged developers to focus on gameplay rather than flashy visuals. Many CD-ROM games are known to simply consist of cartridge sized games alongside a prerendered audio track, or just a copy of a game already released on cartridge. The relatively few games that have ever been released based on full motion video typically have very high production costs and timeframes."
"CD-ROMs are known for relative ease of illicit copying on personal computers, whereas Game Paks are physically proprietary and more difficult to copy."
"John Ricciardi, writing for ""Electronic Gaming Monthly"", called Nintendo's decision to stick with a cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 ""stubborn"". The author called it a major contributor to the company's competitive disadvantages, even more so than the failed partnership with Sony to create a CD format and console. Brian Dipert, writing for ""EDN Magazine"", said that the Nintendo 64 Game Paks are ""bulky and expensive, eating into Nintendo's profit margins compared with competitors’ inexpensive CD and DVD plastic discs"". On a more positive side of the topic, Aaron Curtiss of The ""Los Angeles Times"" praised Nintendo's choice of the cartridge medium with its ""nonexistent"" load times and ""continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver"", concluding that ""the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega [Saturn] and Sony [PlayStation] seem downright sluggish"". Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, Curtiss cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to ""place a premium on substance over flash"", and noted that the launch titles lack the ""poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures"" which he believed were usually found on CD-ROM games at the time."
"As part of the controversial technological tradeoffs between storage and performance, which has been endemic to the entire computing industry, and which Nintendo had faced since the Famicom's cassette and floppy disk systems, the selection of a cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 was essential to several developers' ability to deliver top quality games. However, the choice of cartridge format coupled with the commercial failure of the supplemental 64DD were also key factors in Nintendo losing its dominant position in the gaming market. Some of the Game Pak's advantages are actually nullified by its disadvantages."
"That generation's primary competitors, the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, rely completely upon 2× CD-ROM drives for game storage. These discs are much cheaper and faster to manufacture and distribute, resulting in lower manufacturing costs to third-party game publishers. As a result, some game developers who had traditionally supported Nintendo game consoles prior to Nintendo 64 were now developing games for the competition."
"Some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation. This includes Square who had produced a ""Final Fantasy"" technology prototype using the same SGI-based development platform used by Nintendo, and Enix whose ""Dragon Warrior VII"" was initially pre-planned for the Nintendo 64 and its yet-unreleased 64DD disk drive peripheral at least by 1996, but reluctantly migrated due to the developers' increasingly ambitious use of storage space with their fundamentally cinematic game format. Shiny Entertainment had been planning to develop ""MDK"" for the Nintendo 64, but switched to PC when they found the cartridge space was insufficient for their plans for the game and Nintendo failed to produce the promised 64DD in a timely manner."
"Some developers who remained on Nintendo 64 released fewer games for the system. Konami was the biggest example of this, releasing 29 Nintendo 64 games but more than 50 on the PlayStation. Overall, new game releases were less frequent for the Nintendo 64 than those for the PlayStation."
"Aside from the difficulties with some third parties, the Nintendo 64 supports some of the most popular, genre-defining, and critically acclaimed games such as ""Super Mario 64"", """", and ""GoldenEye 007"", having given the system a long market lifespan. Much of this success was credited to Nintendo's strong first-party franchises, such as ""Mario"", which had strong name brand appeal, and by Nintendo's own second-party developers such as Rare."
"When interviewed by ""Computer & Video Games"" at Shoshinkai of 1995, about how the theoretical use of CD instead of cartridge could have impacted its past game development, Rare reportedly said that """"Blastdozer"" would require more time and much more RAM"", and that """"Goldeneye"" would require twice the RAM"". In the 2013 Director's Commentary video about ""Conker's Bad Fur Day"", after observing the imperceptible loading times and the ""seamless"" transitions between major scenes of the game, Rare programmers declare that ""the thing about cartridges is … it's solid state ... so it's actually a much more advanced, better medium than discs. You can't have as much [content] on there—or, rather, you can but it's very expensive—but as a medium, cartridge is [vastly] ahead in superiority to any blu-ray or disc … [or] hard drives."""
"Upon Factor 5's introduction to the Nintendo 64, the developer had already delivered highly optimized multiplatform games for almost a decade, ranging from 8-bit home computers to 32-bit CD-ROM. After having developed innovative techniques for CD-ROM media in two different Lucasarts releases for PlayStation, Factor 5's cofounder Julian Eggebrecht said this:"
"Eggebrecht identified RAM, not storage, as the key bottleneck for any console; so he identified CD-ROM performance of the day as exacerbating that bottleneck and favored cartridges to virtually eliminate the bottleneck. Even after having designed ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine"" for personal computers equipped with hard drives, Eggebrecht significantly attributed the technologically and aesthetically superior nature of Factor 5's Nintendo 64 port, to his programmers' aggressive utilization of the cartridge format."

= = = Voith Turbo-Transmissions = = =
"Turbo-Transmissions are hydrodynamic, multi-stage drive assemblies designed for rail vehicles using internal combustion engines. The first turbo-transmission was developed in 1932 by Voith in Heidenheim, Germany. Since then, improvements to turbo-transmissions have paralleled similar advances in diesel motors and today this combination plays a leading role worldwide, second only to the use of electrical drives."
"Turbo-transmissions serve as a hydrodynamic link which converts a motor's mechanical energy into the kinetic energy of a fluid, via a torque-converter and fluid coupling, before producing the final rotary output. Here, the fluid is driven through rotor blade canals at high flow-rates and low pressure. This is where turbo-transmissions differ from similar hydrostatic transmissions, which operate using low flow-rates and high pressure according to the displacement principle."
"Turbo-transmissions are hydrodynamic, multi-stage drive assemblies whose performance is based on the Föttinger principle of fluid dynamics. Torque-converters, fluid couplings and optional hydrodynamic retarders are the key components in these assemblies, which are ideally suited for powered rail vehicles."
"The first turbo-transmission from 1932 used a relatively simple design. It consisted of a single torque-converter for the start-up phase and a fluid coupling for the travel phase which were both mounted on a common shaft. A key feature of this turbo-transmission was the filling and emptying of the hydrodynamic circuit, a principle which was first used in Föttinger marine transmissions. This offered the advantages of frictionless start-ups, frictionless gear shifting with constant traction, freewheeling through emptying of the hydrodynamic circuit, and more efficient operation of the fluid coupling."
"Contrary to Föttinger however, Voith used low viscosity oil in the hydrodynamic circuit of its turbo-transmissions rather than water. In addition, various other improvements were made in the 1930s: The addition of a high-speed gear, a more compact housing, greater compatibility with different motor types, automation gear shifts, as well as cooling via a heat exchanger."
"In the 1960s the hydrodynamic retarder was also introduced as a third stage which complemented the torque-converter and fluid coupling. Together, all these engineering improvements had a common goal: To continually increase the transmission's performance rating without compromising its installation complexity or proven reliability."
"In 1969, the smaller T 211 turbo-transmission was developed as an alternative to hydro-mechanical bus transmissions, being designed for diesel railcars in the low power range of . Similar to the first turbo-transmission, the T 211 used a linked converter-coupling combination but it also had a high-speed gear for greater efficiency. Additionally, a reversing gear assembly was added and an optional hydrodynamic retarder could be installed if required. The converter had a hydrodynamic circuit diameter of , while the fluid coupling had a slightly smaller diameter of . And due to its high-speed gear, the main shaft could run significantly higher at 4,170 rpm. As a result, the T 211 r had reserve power, which was reflected by its reinforced mechanical components (gears, bearings and shafts) as well as the transmission controls. At the same time however, the diameters of the converter, coupling and retarder remained unchanged. The overall flow rate within the hydrodynamic circuits was increased to accommodate the higher power rating of . At , the main shaft ran at just under 5,000 rpm which resulted in rotational speeds for the (empty) converter of 74 m/s when the vehicle reached its maximum speed. To ensure adequate cooling of the converter during high-speed operations, a stronger hydrodynamic fluid pump was installed, which supplied 3.5 l/s of oil through the heat exchanger during the travel phase and 9.0 l/s when in the braking phase, with the retarder rotor also serving as an additional circulating pump. When viewed from the outside this T 211 r transmission differed from its predecessor, the T 211 re.3 with , only slightly through the addition of a built-in electronic control unit and an enlarged air filter."
"In 1995, an entirely new transmission design was developed, the VT 611/612, for high-speed trains with tilting technology used by the Deutsche Bahn (German Railways). This new transmission concept used a converter-coupling-coupling design with an integrated hydrodynamic T 312 bre retarder and it had a power rating of 650 kW. To shorten the transmission's overall length, a twin shaft construction was used over the high gears, which was similar to the design used in reversing units. The electronic control unit was also built into the transmission. In addition, the transmission's reversing cylinders were operated hydraulically, which eliminated the need of having a compressed air supply on board. Five years later, the T 212 bre transmission was developed with a power rating of 460 kW. This transmission was similar in design, but unlike other large transmissions the T 212 bre could be mounted directly on the drive motor. This was a significant advantage, because it resulted in a very compact motor-transmission combination for high-speed trains which could travel at up to 200 km/h. The T 212 bre had the same hydrodynamic circuit dimensions as the T 211 r, but it had the further advantage of greater coupling efficiency for trains operating at only 50% of their maximum speed. For high-speed diesel trains this was important, because it permitted dramatically improved fuel consumption."
"In 1999, a new twin converter transmission, the L 620 reU2, was developed for high-performance, main-line locomotives. The new L 620 reU2 was equipped with both a start-up converter, having a diameter of 525 mm, as well as a travel-phase converter, having a diameter of 434 mm. The design of the new L 620 re U2 was based on its successful predecessor, the L 520 rzU2 which had a power rating of 1,400 kW. This new transmission however was rated significantly higher at 2,700 kW and therefore virtually all of its components had to be enlarged as well as reinforced. In the standard version of the transmission, two gears were mounted on the secondary shaft rather than using the idler wheel found in the older L 520 rzU2. As a result, the drive shaft's output speed could be adjusted to suit the locomotive's power requirements. The drive shaft's main bearing was also enlarged to 550 mm. In general, this new high-performance transmission clearly illustrated the enormous capability of hydrodynamic couplings. With a weight-to-power ratio of only 2.06 kg/kW, the new L 620 reU2 set a record for locomotive transmissions. By comparison, the similar L 520 rzU2 transmission had a far higher weight-to-power ratio of 2.4 kg/kW. In addition, a newly designed hydrodynamic retarder, the KB 385, was available as an optional component. At Vossloh, the locomotive manufacturer based in Kiel, these transmissions were installed in both its G1700 and G2000 main-line locomotives. Finally, the latest development is the LS 640 reU2 transmission which will be used for the first time in the Voith Maxima locomotive having 3,600 kW. The LS 640 reU2 is a so-called split turbo-transmission which uses two drive shafts from the L 620 reU2 to power both bogies of a six axle diesel locomotive."
"The operating conditions of rail vehicles are the key factors in determining the power requirements of both its motors and transmissions. These operating conditions cover: hauling loads for diesel locomotive, passenger capacities for diesel railcars, the topography of the rail line, and the climatic conditions when the vehicle is operated outside of Europe. The expected operating conditions are part of a vehicle's technical requirements and determine the follow points:"
"Maximum speed, vehicle weight, acceleration rate and the railway slope all influence a motor's performance specifications. Added to that, the requirements of the auxiliary systems also need to be considered, such air-conditioning units, motor cooling systems, brake compressors and in some cases the need for a separate power supply to run the air-conditioning and heating systems of each passenger car. Here, a range of diesel motors can be selected, from large frame V-motors for locomotives to flat 6-cylinder sub-floor motors for motorized railcars or even the compact 12-cylinder motors often used by utility vehicles. For most modern motorized railcars, the preferred solution is a sub-floor mounted motor and transmission combination."
"In turbo-transmissions, the torque-converter is clearly the centerpiece of the entire construction and over the past decades its continuous improvements have been primarily responsible for satisfying the steadily increasing demands of diesel powered vehicles. Here, the goal of each improvement has been greater efficiency and better start-up performance, without compromising the start-up converter's dimensions as well as consistent loading of the travel-phase converter when in transit. Of the many different torque-converter designs, the single-stage converter using a centrifugal-flow turbine has proven to be the best. It has a relatively simple construction and due to the radial stability of its turbine the converter is well suited for high rpm operations."
"In the 1970s, thanks to new torque-converter developments with improved traction characteristics, (approaching the start-up traction) a two-converter transmission was designed to replace the previously used three-converter transmission. And even today, torque-converters are still being improved, although they have reached an advanced stage. Modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can now provide engineers with detailed information on the flow-patterns inside a rotating turbine wheel. Here, the oil-filled circuit in which the turbine turns is portrayed as computerized grid showing the flow characteristics at each grid intersection. For each of these points, the flow volume, speed, and pressure can be calculated. Later during the analysis phase, a three dimensional model of the circuit's flow pattern can be viewed and flow disruptions which reduce the converter's efficiency can be identified, such as: eddies, surface turbulence and mis-directed fluid-flows along the turbine wheel. In addition, aside from visualizing these flow disruptions engineers can also use CFD to calculate the resultant loss in converter efficiency."
"In the end, the relationship between changes in a converter circuit's flow-patterns and the efficiency of a torque-converter can then be used to identify potential improvement areas. To a large extent, the predicted values match well with the actual operational measurements, although some differences do occur due to the use of time-saving simplified simulations. Still, CFD allows the optimization of existing converters as well as the development of new virtual-converter types via computer. Afterwards the building of a prototype and the verification of the actual performance results concludes the development phase."
= = = Seven Wonders of Portugal = = =
The Seven Wonders of Portugal () is a list of cultural wonders located in Portugal. The creation of the list was supported by the Ministry of Culture and organized by the companies Y&R Brands S.A. and Realizar S.A.
"Initially 793 national monuments of Portugal were listed by Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico (IPPAR) as candidates, however in the first round of selections a board of experts reduced the number to 77. The contenders were further reduced to 21 finalist in four different categories by Conselho de Notáveis at the University of Évora."
"The six-month-long public elections started on 7 December 2006 to select the top seven wonders. Votes could be cast via internet, telephone and SMS. Results of the vote were announced on 7 July 2007 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, as were the results of the global New Seven Wonders of the World contest."

= = = Heart in Hand = = =
"The Heart in Hand or Heart-in-Hand is a symbol of a heart in an open palm, and is symbolic of charity, given from the heart. It is an easily recognizable symbol in the Northeastern United States and used by the Shakers as a pictoral reminder of the words of Mother Ann Lee, the founder of the Shaker sect, who promoted a simple life of hard work and spirituality, ""Put your hands to work, and your hearts to God."" The image is typical of the Shaker attitude, and also implies a loving welcome."
"A heart in hand has also been a symbol of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, a fraternal organization derived from English Oddfellows orders of the mid-18th century. These commonly display three linked rings representing friendship, love, and truth."
"The symbol originated as the seal of the Protestant Reformer John Calvin, and thus appears in the official seal of Calvin College with Calvin's motto,""My heart I offer to you LORD, promptly and sincerely."""
The symbol is also frequently associated with Amish communities.
The symbol was also used as a chop mark in the woodblock prints of Gustave Baumann (Germ./Amer. 1881-1971).
"Hemp fibers are traditionally coarse, and have been historically used for ropes rather than for clothing. However, modern technology and breeding practices have made hemp fiber more pliable, softer, and finer."
"Bamboo fabrics are made from heavily pulped bamboo grass. Making clothing and textile from bamboo is considered sustainable due to the lack of need for pesticides and agrochemicals. Naturally disease and pest resistant, bamboo is also fast growing. Compared to trees, certain varieties of bamboo can grow 1–4 inches long per day, and can even branch and expand outward because of its underground rhizomes. Like cotton fibers, bamboo fibers are naturally yellowish in color and are bleached white with chemicals during processing."
"Burnished by a grant from the US. Environmental Protection Agency, associate professor,Young-A Lee and her team are growing vats of gel-like film composed of cellulose fiber, a byproduct of the same symbiotic colonies of bacteria and yeast (abbreviated SCOBY) found in another of the world's popular ""live culture"" foods: kombucha. Once harvested and dried, the resulting material has a look and feel much like leather. The fibres are 100 percent biodegradable, they also foster a cradle-to-cradle cycle of reuse and regeneration that leaves behind virtually zero waste. However, this material takes a long time to grow about three to four weeks under lab-controlled conditions. Hence mass production is an issue. In addition, tests revealed that moisture absorption from the air softens this material makes it less durable. Researchers also discovered that cold conditions make it brittle."
"Qmilch GmbH, a German company has innovated a process to produce a textile fiber from casein in milk but it cannot be used for consumption. Qmilk fiber is made from 100% renewable resources. In addition, for the production of 1 kg of fiber Qmilch GmbH needs only 5 minutes and max. 2 liters of water. This implies a particular level of cost efficiency and ensures a minimum of CO2 emissions. Qmilk fiber is biodegradable and leaves no traces. In addition, it is naturally antibacterial, especially against the bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is ideal for people that suffer from textile allergies."
Fabrics made from Qmilk fiber provide high wearing comfort and a silky feel.The organic fiber is tested for harmful substances and dermatologically tested for the wearer's skin and body compatibility 0% chemical additives.
"S.Café technology involves recycling used ground coffee beans into yarns. A piece of S.Café fabric is made with less energy in the process and is able to mask body odour. In addition, S.Café yarn offers 200% faster drying time compared to conventional cotton, with the ability to save energy in the process."
"S. Café coffee grounds come with numerous microscopic pores, which create a long-lasting natural and chemical free shield for yarn or fiber, reflecting UV rays and provide a comfortable outdoor experience."
Other alternative biodegradable fibers being developed by small companies include:
"Protein fibers originate from animal sources and are made up of protein molecules. The basic elements in these protein molecules being carbon, hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen. Natural protein fibers include: wool, silk, angora, camel, alpaca, llama, vicuna, cashmere, and mohair."
"Manufactured fibers sit within three categories: Manufactured cellulosic fibers, manufactured synthetic fibers and manufactured protein fiber (azlon). Manufactured cellulosic fibers include modal, Lyocell (also known under the brand name Tencel), rayon/viscose made from bamboo, rayon/viscose made from wood and polylactic acid (PLA). Manufactured synthetic fibers include polyester, nylon, spandex, acrylic fiber, polyethylene and polypropylene (PP). Azlon is a manufactured protein fiber."
"PET plastics are also known as Polyethylene terephthalate(PETE). PET's recycling code, the number within the three chasing arrows, is one. These plastics are usually beverage bottles (i.e. water, soda, and fruit juice bottles). According to the EPA, plastic accounts for 12% of the total amount of waste we produce. Recycling plastic reduces air, water, and ground pollution. Recycling is only the first step; investing and purchasing products manufactured from recycled materials is the next of many steps to living sustainably.Clothing can be made from plastics. Seventy percent of plastic-derived fabrics come from polyester, and the type of polyester most used in fabrics is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET plastic clothing come from reused plastics, often recycled plastic bottles. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, created a ""Drink2Wear"" line of T-shirts made from recycled bottles. Generally, PET plastic clothing are made from recycled bottles as follows: plastic bottles are collected, compressed, baled, and shipped into processing facilities where they will be chopped into flakes, and melted into small white pellets. Then, the pellets are processed again, and spun into yarn-like fiber where it can be made into clothing. One main benefit of making clothes from recycled bottles is that it keep the bottles and other plastics from occupying landfill space. Another benefit is that it takes 30% less energy to make clothes from recycled plastics than from virgin polyesters."
"Whereas many producers have since the turn of the century been striving for a cradle-to-cradle model of production, or a circular economy, there has so far been no successful example of fully sustainable production, as there is environmental impact from all extractive production practices (in processes of material production, dying, assembly, accessorizing, shipping, retail, washing, recycling etc.) There are many small initiatives towards change, yet so far all these incremental improvements have been drowned by the explosive popularity of ""fast"" fashion and its economy of extraction, consumption, waste."
"The global political economy and legal system supports a fashion system that enables fashion that has devastating environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts to be priced at a lower price than fashion which involves efforts to minimize harm in the growth, manufacturing, and shipping of the products. This results in higher prices for fashion made from reduced impact materials than clothing produced in a socially and environmentally damaging way (sometimes referred to as conventional methods)."
"Innovative fashion is being developed and made available to consumers at different levels of the fashion spectrum, from casual clothing to haute couture which has a reduced social and environmental impact at the materials and manufacture stages of production and celebrities, models, and designers have recently drawn attention to socially conscious and environmentally friendly fashion."
"3D seamless knitting is a technology that allows an entire garment to be knit with no seams. This production method is considered a sustainable practice due to its reduction in waste and labor. By only using the necessary materials, the producers will be more efficient in their manufacturing process. This production method is similar to seamless knitting, although traditional seamless knitting requires stitching to complete the garment while 3D seamless knitting creates the entire garment, eliminating additional work. The garments are designed using 3D software unlike traditional flat patterns. Shima Seiki and Stoll are currently the two primary manufacturers of the technology. The technology is produced through the use of solar energy and they are selling to brands like Max Mara."
"Zero-waste design is a concept that, although has been prevalent for many years, is increasingly being integrated into production. Zero-waste design is used through multiple industries but is very applicable in developing patterns for garments. The concept of zero-waste pattern making is designing the pattern for a garment so that when the textile is cut, there is no extra fabric going to waste. This means the pattern pieces for a garment fit together like puzzle pieces in order to use the entire amount of fabric provided, creating no waste in this step of production."
"Traditional methods of dyeing textiles are incredibly harmful towards the earth's water supply, creating toxic chemicals that effect entire communities. An alternative to traditional water dyeing is scCO2 dyeing (super critical carbon dioxide). This process creates no waste by using 100% of the dyes, reducing energy by 60% with no auxiliary chemicals, and leaving a quarter of the physical footprint of traditional dyeing. Different names for this process are Drydye and Colordry. Another company called Colorep has patented Airdye, a similar process that they claim uses 95% less water and up to 86% less energy than traditional dyeing methods."
"So far, no brand can label itself as fully sustainable, and controversies are abundant on exactly how to use the concept in relation to fashion, if it can be used at all, or if labels such ""slow"" and ""sustainable"" fashion are inherently an oxymoron. Brands that sell themselves as sustainable often still lack systems to deal with oversupply, take back used clothes, fully recycle fibers, offer repair services, or even support the life of the garment during use (such as instructions on washing, care and repair). Almost no brands offer spare parts, which says a lot about the general life expectancy of garments in general: brand are not supporting consumers to make garments last."
"That said, some comparison websites (such as Rank A Brand, Good On You, ...) exist which compare fashion brands on their sustainability record, and these can at least give an indication to consumers."
There are much ecolabels in existence which focus on textile.
Some notable ecolabels include:
Some brands that sell themselves as sustainable are listed below;
"There is no certain stable model among the designers for how to be sustainable in practice, and the understanding of sustainability is always a process or a work-in-progress, and varies by who defines what is ""sustainable;"" farmers or animals, producers or consumers, managers or workers. Thus critical scholars would label much of the business-driven discourse on sustainability as ""greenwashing"" as under the current economic paradigm, ""sustainability"" is primarily defined as keeping the wheels of perpetual production and consumption turning; to keep the ""perpetuum mobile"" of fashion running and in perpetual motion."
"A question at the foundation of sustainable fashion concerns exactly what is to be ""sustained"" of the current model of fashion. Controversies thus emerge what stakeholder agendas should be prioritized over others."
"A major controversy on sustainable fashion concerns how the ""green"" imperative is used as a cover-up for systemic labor exploitation, social exclusion and environmental degradation, what is generally labelled as greenwashing. Market-driven sustainability can only address sustainability to a certain degree as brands still need to sell more products in order to be profitable. Thus almost any initiative towards addressing ecological and social issues still contributes to the damage. In a 2017 report, the industry projects that the overall apparel consumption will rise by 63%, from 62 million tons today to 102 million tons in 2030, thus effectively erasing any environmental gains made by current initiatives."
"Though organic cotton is considered a more sustainable choice for fabric, as it uses fewer pesticides and chemical fertilizers, it remains less than 1% global cotton production. Hurdles to growth include cost of hand labor for hand weeding, reduced yields in comparison to conventional cotton and absence of fiber commitments from brands to farmers before planting seed. The up front financial risks and costs are therefore shouldered by the farmers, many of whom struggle to compete with economies of scale of corporate farms."
"Though some designers have marketed bamboo fiber, as an alternative to conventional cotton, citing that it absorbs greenhouse gases during its life cycle and grows quickly and plentifully without pesticides, the conversion of bamboo fiber to fabric is the same as rayon and is highly toxic. The FTC ruled that labeling of bamboo fiber should read ""rayon from bamboo"". Bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo. Impacts regarding production of new materials make recycled, reclaimed, surplus, and vintage fabric arguably the most sustainable choice, as the raw material requires no agriculture and no manufacturing to produce. However, it must be noted that these are indicative of a system of production and consumption that creates excessive volumes of waste."
"Used clothing is sold in more than 100 countries. In Tanzania, used clothing is sold at the ""mitumba"" (Swahili for ""secondhand"") markets. Most of the clothing is imported from the United States. However, there are concerns that trade in secondhand clothing in African countries decreases development of local industries even as it creates employment in these countries. And the authors of ""Recycling of Low Grade Clothing Waste"" warn that in the long run, as prices and quality of new clothing continue to decline, the demand for used clothing will also diminish."
"The increase in western consumers’ environmental interest is motivating companies to use sustainable and environmental arguments solely to increase sales. Because environmental and sustainability issues are complex, it is also easy to mislead consumers. Companies can use sustainability as a “marketing ploy” something that can be seen as greenwashing. Greenwashing is the deceptive use of an eco-agenda in marketing strategies. It refers mostly to corporations that make efforts to clean up their reputation because of social pressure or for the purpose of financial gain."
"In the European Union, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations required in 2007 that clothing manufacturers and importers identified and quantified the chemicals used in their products."
"On May 3, 2012, the world's largest summit on fashion sustainability was held in Copenhagen, gathering more than 1,000 key stakeholders in the industry to discuss the importance of making the fashion industry sustainable. Copenhagen Fashion Summit has since then gathered thousands of people from the fashion industry in their effort to create a movement within the industry."
"In July 2012, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition launched the Higg Index, a self-assessment standard designed to measure and promote sustainable supply chains in the apparel and footwear industries. Founded in 2011, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition is a nonprofit organisation whose members include brands producing apparel or footwear, retailers, industry affiliates and trade associations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, academic institutions and environmental nonprofits."
"When it comes down to the garments themselves, their durability depends on their use and ""metabolism"" - certain garments are made to withstand long use (ex. outdoor and hiking wear, winter jackets) whereas other garments have a quicker turn-around (ex. a party top). This means some garments have properties and a use-life that could be made more durable, whereas others should be compostable or recyclable for quicker disintegration. Some garments age well and acquire patina and a romantic enchantment not unlike the wonder, fascination and grandeur of historical ruins, whereas the derelict and discarded rags of last season is an eyesore and nuisance; the first connotes a majesty of taste, whereas the second is the underclass of waste."
"One of the most apparent reasons for the current unsustainable condition of the fashion system is related to the temporal aspects of fashion; the continuous stream of new goods onto the market, or what is popularly called ""fast fashion."" The term has come to signify cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes, sourced through global production chains and sold through chains such as H&M, Zara, Forever21, etc. The 2012 book ""Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion"" by journalist Elizabeth L. Cline gives a clear introduction to the rise of disposable consumption of fashion and its impacts on the planet, the economy and consumer relationships with clothing."
"However, the ""fast"" aspect of consumption is primarily a problem to the environment when done on a massive scale. As long as fast conspicuous consumption was reserved to the rich, the global impact was not reaching public attention or seen as a problem. That is, ""fast"" shopping sprees of haute couture is not seen as a problem, rather it is celebrated (for example in movies such as Pretty Woman), whereas when people with less means shop fast fashion it is seen as unethical and a problem. Today, the speed of fast fashion is common across the whole industry as exclusive fashion replicates the fast fashion chains with continuous releases of collections and product drops: the quality of a garment does not necessarily translate to a slower pace of consumption and waste."
"Slow fashion can be seen as an alternative approach against fast fashion, based on principles of the slow food movement. Characteristics of sustainable fashion match the philosophies of ""slow fashion"" in that emotional, ecological and ethical qualities are favored over uniform and bland convenience with minimal friction. It requires a changed infrastructure and a reduced through-put of goods. Categorically, slow fashion is neither business-as-usual nor just involving design classics. Nor is it production-as-usual but with long lead times. Slow fashion is a vision of the fashion sector built from a different starting point. Slow fashion is a fashion concept that reflects a perspective, which respects human living conditions, biological, cultural diversity and scarce global resources and creates unique, personalized products."
"Slow fashion often consists of durable products, traditional production techniques or design concepts that are season-less. The impact of slowness aims to affect many points of the production chain. For workers in the textile industry in developing countries, slow fashion means higher wages. For end-users, slow fashion means that the goods are designed and manufactured with greater care and high quality products. From an environmental point of view, it means that there is less clothing and industrial waste that are removed from use following transient trends in slow fashion. New ideas and product innovations are constantly redefining slow fashion, so using a static, single definition would ignore the evolving nature of the concept."
"Examples of stability of expression over long times are abundant in the history of dress, not least in ethnic or folk dress, ritual or coronation robes, clerical dress, or the uniforms of the Vatican Guard. The emphasis on slowness in branding is thus an approach that is specific for a niche in the market (such as Western educated middle-class) that has since the 1990s become dominated by ""fast"" models. One of the earliest brands that gained global fame with an explicit focus on slow fashion, the UK brand People Tree, embraces the concept of ethical trade, manufactures all products in accordance with ethical commerce standards and supports local producers and craftsmen in developing countries. The People Tree brand is known as the first brand in the world that received the Ethical Trade Brand award, which was given in 2013. In addition to adopting ethical trade, the brand also prefers to use nature-friendly materials, textile products with GOTS certification and local, natural, recyclable material."
"The concept of slow fashion is however not without its controversies, as the imperative of slowness is a mandate emerging from a position of privilege. To stop consuming ""fast fashion"" strikes against low income consumers whose only means to access trends is through cheap and accessible goods. Those who are already having a high position in society can afford to slow down and cement their status and position, while those on their way up resent being told to stay at the lower rungs of the status hierarchy. Another obstacle that the ""slow fashion"" paradigm is facing is related to consumers' behaviour towards the consumption of fashion and specifically clothing . In fact, sustainability conscious consumers, that usually take into account social and environmental implications of their purchases, may experience an attitude-behaviour gap preventing them to change their consumptions habits when it comes to choose ethical clothing. Purchasing fashion is still perceived as an action connected to social status and it is still strongly emotionally driven."
"The environmental impact of fashion also depends on how much and how long a garment is used. Typically, a garment used daily over years has less impact than a garment used once to then be quickly discarded. Studies have shown that the washing and drying process for pair of classic jeans is responsible for almost two-thirds of the energy consumed through the whole of the jeans' life, and for underwear about 80% of total energy use comes from laundry processes. Thus, use and wear practices affect the lifecycles of garments and needs to be addressed for larger systemic impact."
"However, there is a significant difference between making a product last from making a long-lasting product. The quality of the product must reflect the appropriate fit into its lifecycle. Certain garments of quality can be repaired and cultivated with emotional durability. Low-quality products that deteriorate rapidly are not as suitable to be ""enchanted"" with emotional bonds between user and product."
"Sustainability is significant for fashion, because the textiles and fashion industry is among the leading industries that affect the environment negatively. One of the industries that jeopardizes sustainability is the textiles and fashion industry, which also bears great responsibilities. The clothing industry has an impact on the environment. Globalization, consumerism, and recycling are all a part of a clothing life cycle. Globalization has made it possible to produce clothing at increasingly lower prices, prices so low that many consumers consider this clothing to be disposable. Disposable clothing appears popular throughout many malls in America and Europe. This is a key characteristic of fast fashion. However, fast fashion adds to pollution and generates potential environmental and occupational hazards."
"The clothing industry has one of the highest impacts on the planet. High water usage, pollution from chemical treatments used in dyeing and preparation and the disposal of large amounts of unsold clothing through incineration or landfill deposits are hazardous to the environment. There is a growing water scarcity, the current usage level of fashion materials (79 billion cubic meters annually) is very concerning, because textile production mostly takes place in areas of fresh water stress. Only around 20% of clothing is recycled or reused, huge amounts of fashion product end up as waste in landfills or is incinerated. It has been estimated that in the UK alone around 350,000 tons of clothing ends up as landfill every year. According to Earth Pledge, a non-profit organisation committed to promoting and supporting sustainable development, ""At least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into textiles and 25% of the world's pesticides are used to grow non-organic cotton. This causes irreversible damage to people and the environment, and still two thirds of a garment's carbon footprint will occur after it is purchased."" The average American throws away nearly 70 pounds of clothing per year. There is an increasing concern as microfibers from synthetic fabrics are polluting the earths waters through the process of laundering. Microfibers are tiny threads that are shed from fabric. These microfibers are too small to be captured in waste water treatment plants filtration systems and they end up entering our natural water systems and as a result contaminating our food chain. One study found that 34% of microplastics found in oceans come from the textile and clothing industry and majority of them were made of polyester, polyethylene, acrylic, and elastane. Eliminating synthetic materials used in clothing products can prevent harmful synthetics and microfibers from ending up in the natural environment."
"One of the main social issues related to fashion concerns labor. Since the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire in 1911, labor rights in the fashion industry has been at the center of this issue. The 2013 Savar building collapse at Rana Plaza, where 1138 people died, put the spotlight once again on the lack of transparency, poor working conditions and hazards in fashion production. Attention is increasingly being placed on labour rights violations in other parts of the whole fashion product lifecycle from textile production and processing, retail and distribution and modelling to the recycling of textiles. Whilst the majority of fashion and textiles are produced in Asia, Central America, Turkey, North Africa, the Caribbean and Mexico, there is still production across Europe where exploitative working conditions are also found such as in Leicester in the UK Midlands and Central and Eastern Europe."
"The fashion industry benefits from racial, class and gender inequalities. These inequalities and pressure from brands and retailers in the form of low prices and short lead times contribute to exploitative working conditions and low wages. Also ""local"" production, such as garments labeled as ""Made in Italy"" are engaged in global sourcing of labor and worker exploitation, bypassing unions and social welfare contracts."
"The number of workers employed in textiles, clothing and footwear is unknown due to the differences in statistical measures. It is generally accepted that at least 25 million people, the majority women, work in garment manufacture and up to 300 million in cotton alone. Nevertheless, it is really difficult to estimate exactly how many people work in the production sector, because small-scale manufacturing and contracting firms that operate illegally continue to exist within the industry. On the 24th of April 2013, Rana Plaza disaster happened as one of the biggest tragedies in history of the fashion industry. The search for the dead ended on 13 May 2013 with a death toll of 1,134. Approximately 2,500 injured people were rescued from the building alive. It is considered the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history, as well as the deadliest structural failure in modern human history."
"The environmental impact of fashion also affects communities located close to production sites. There is little easily accessible information about these impacts, but it is known that water and land pollution from toxic chemicals used to produce and dye fabrics and have serious negative consequences for the people living near factories. At the global level, fashion is contributing to climate change and threatens biodiversity, which have social consequences for everyone."
"Supply chain transparency has been a recurring controversy for the fashion industry, not least since the Rana Plaza accident. The issue has been pushed by many labor organizations, not least Clean Clothes Campaign and Fashion Revolution. Over the last years, over 150 major brands including Everlane, Filippa K and H&M have answered by publicizing information about their factories online. Every year, Fashion Revolution publishes a Fashion Transparency Index which rates the world's largest brands and retailers according to how much information they disclose about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices, and social and environmental impact."
"However, the focus on transparency and traceability has so far not shown the promise expected. Even if a consumer can find information on the clothing label, such as the address of the factory and how many people work there, it says nothing about the salaries and living conditions of the workers, the factory's subcontracting practices, or the environmental impact of sourcing and production. The focus on transparency has so far not bridged information with systemic action and impact. While the agenda of transparency is honourable and important, it is toothless if not paired with real improvements, policy change and legal action which holds corporations and factories responsible for misconduct."
"In addition, fashion companies are criticised for the lack of size, age, physical ability, gender and racial diversity of models used in photo shoots and catwalks. A more radical and systemic critique of social inequality in fashion concerns the exclusion and aesthetic supremacy inherent and accentuated through fashion that still remains unquestioned under the current environmentally focused discourse on sustainable fashion."
"It is worth noticing that while social ""inclusivity"" has become almost a norm amongst brands marketing ethical and sustainable fashion, the norm for what is considered a ""beautiful"" and ""healthy"" body keeps narrowing down under what researchers have called the current ""wellness syndrome."" With the positive thinking of inclusivity, the assumption is that you can be whatever you want to be, and thus if you are not living up to the ideals it is your own fault. This optimism hides the diktat of aesthetic wellness, which turns inclusion into an obligation to look good and be dressed in fashionable clothes, a ""democratic"" demand for aesthetic as well as ethical perfection, as argued by philosopher Heather Widdows."
"The impact of fashion across the planet is unevenly distributed. Whereas much of the benefits of cheap and accessible clothes targets and benefits the socially mobile classes in metropolitan areas in the Global North, developing countries take a much proportion of the negative impact from the fashion system in terms of waste, pollution, and ecological injustices."
"The current focus on solutions related to ""reduce, reuse, recycle,"" which are primarily promoted through brand initiatives, fails to address the global impact of the fashion system. Not only does it push responsibility for systemic issues onto the individual, but it also primarily positions fashion in a Western consumerism context."
"China has emerged as the largest exporter of fast fashion, accounting for 30% of world apparel exports. However, some Chinese workers make as little as 12–18 cents per hour working in poor conditions. Each year Americans purchase approximately 1 billion garments made in China. Today's biggest factories and mass scale of apparel production emerged from two developments in history. The first involved the opening up of China and Vietnam in the 1980s to private and foreign capital and investments in the creation of export-oriented manufacturing of garments, footwear, and plastics, part of a national effort to boost living standards, embrace modernity, and capitalism. Second, the retail revolution within the U.S. (example Wal-Mart, Target, Nike) and Western Europe, where companies no longer manufactured but rather contracted out their production and transformed instead into key players in design, marketing, and logistics, introducing many new different product lines manufactured in foreign-owned factories in China. It is the convergence of these two phenomena that has led to the largest factories in history from apparels to electronics. In contemporary global supply chains it is retailers and branders who have had the most power in establishing arrangements and terms of production, not factory owners. Fierce global competition in the garment industry translates into poor working conditions for many laborers in developing nations. Developing countries aim to become a part of the world's apparel market despite poor working conditions and low pay. Countries such as Honduras and Bangladesh export large amounts of clothing into the United States every year."
"At the heart of the controversy concerning ""fast fashion"" lies the acknowledgement that the ""problem"" of unsustainable fashion is that cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes have become available to people of poorer means. This means more people across the world have adopted the consumption habits that in the mid-twentieth century were still reserved for the rich. To put it differently, the economic concern of fashion is that poor people now have access to updating their wardrobes as often as the rich. That is, ""fast"" fashion is only a problem when poor people engage in it. In alignment with this, blame is often put on poor consumers; they don't buy quality goods, buy too much and too cheap, etc. Tropes such as these are common in the popular debate on fast fashion, not least in documentaries such as ""The True Cost"" which does not address systemic and economic issues of fashion."
"The economic concerns of fashion also means many of the sustainable ""solutions"" to fashion, such as buying high-quality goods to last longer, are not accessible to people with less means. From an economic perspective, sustainability thus remains a moralizing issue of educated classes teaching the less educated ""responsible consumption,"" and a debate that mainly concerns promoting frugality and austerity to those with less means. It is seen as an opportunity by businesses that allow resale of luxury goods."
"The distribution of value within the fashion industry is another economic concern, with garment workers and textile farmers and workers receiving low wages and prices."
"Sustainable clothing refers to fabrics derived from eco-friendly resources, such as sustainably grown fiber crops or recycled materials. It also refers to how these fabrics are made. Historically, being environmentally conscious towards clothing meant (1) buying clothes from thrift stores or any shops that sell second-hand clothing, or (2) donating used clothes to shops previously mentioned, for reuse or resale. In modern times, with a prominent trend towards sustainability and being ‘green’, sustainable clothing has expanded towards (1) reducing the amount of clothing discarded to landfills, and (2) decreasing the environmental impact of agro-chemicals in producing conventional fiber crops (e.g. cotton)."
"Under the accordance of sustainability, recycled clothing upholds the principle of the ""Three R’s of the Environment"": Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, as well as the ""Three Legs of Sustainability"": Economics, Ecology, and Social Equity."
"Through the utilization of recycled material for the manufacturing of clothing, this provides an additional realm of economic world profit. Sustainable Clothing will provide a new market for additional job opportunities, continuous net flow of money in the economy, and the reduction of raw materials and virgin resources. Source reduction or reducing the use of raw materials and virgin resources can ultimately reduce carbon emissions during the manufacturing process as well as the resources and carbon emissions that are related to the transportation process. This also prevents the unsustainable usage of extracting materials from the Earth by making use of what has already been used (i.e. recycling)."
"Recycled or reclaimed fibres are recovered from either pre or post-consumer sources. Those falling into the category of 'pre-consumer' are unworn/unused textile wastes from all the various stages of manufacture. Post-consumer textile waste could be any product which has been worn/used and have (typically) been discarded or donated to charities. Once sorted for quality and colour, they can be shredded (pulled, UK or picked, US) into a fibrous state. According to the specification and end use, these fibres can be blended together or with 'new' fibre."
"While most textiles can be recycled, in the main they are downgraded almost immediately into low-quality end-uses, such as filling materials. The limited range of recycled materials available reflects the market dominance of cheap virgin fibres and the lack of technological innovation in the recycling industry. For 200 years recycling technology has stayed the same; fibres are extracted from used fabric by mechanically tearing the fabric apart using carding machines. The process breaks the fibres, producing much shortened lengths that tend to make a low quality yarn. Textiles made from synthetic fibres can also be recycled chemically in a process that involves breaking down the fibre at the molecular level and then repolymerizing the feedstock. While chemical recycling is more energy intensive than mechanical pulling, the resulting fibre tends to be of more predictable quality. The most commonly available recycled synthetic fibre is polyester made from plastic bottles, although recycled nylon is also available"
"In addition to promoting a sounder environment by producing newer clothing made with sustainable, innovative materials, clothing can also be donated to charities, sold into consignment shops, or recycled into other materials. These methods reduce the amount of landfill space occupied by discarded clothes. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2008 Report on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States defines clothing as non-durable – generally lasts less than three years – textiles. In 2008, approximately 8.78 millions of tons of textiles were generated, 1.45 millions of tons were recovered and saved from landfills resulting in a rate of almost 17%. The EPA report also states that the amount of MSW being ""Discarded"" is 54%, ""Recovered"" is 33%, and ""Combusted with Energy recovery"" is 13%. Approximately two-thirds of clothing materials are sent to landfills, making it the fastest growing component of waste in the household waste stream. , textiles disposed of in landfill sites have risen from 7% to 30% within the last five years."
"In order to implement the upcycling method, it is important to have an overview of the textile waste available because this is what dictates the garment that can be created. Using upcycling in fashion design emphasises the importance of a local approach. Thus, both the input material (waste) and the production ideally should be local. Since levels of waste production and volumes of waste can differ by region, the first step to collecting materials for upcycling is to carry out a local textile waste study. The definition of textile waste can be production waste, pre-consumer waste and post-consumer waste."
