I'm cuckoo if I do that!
Three!
What?
So!
Well do you want them to think your mother's cuckoo?
"Yeah, well they're not gonna know who you are, are they?"
"Well I think so cos I have to write in the book, I have to put myself!"
Yeah but you don't put  who you are on it!
I put myself.
Well who else is myself?
If that isn't me!
Yeah but they don't know who you are do they?
Well I know!
Yeah.
Yes.
"But er  I sa I said look I said, you're not doing yourself any favours by going to work, and I says, and I don't  mind you having day off."
No you can't when you're bad.
You bloody can't!
"No, no, she we but she were te Friday she was terrible!"
Looked ill
Well she's
"like as well, you know."
she's worse this morning.
She's worse.
She's not been  asleep a minute all night!
"No, that's it."
So she'll to stay in bed for a
"Course, I were ba I weren't very well yesterday so I said  I'm not very well, but I had  pains as well, back pain and all  all"
Yeah.
all kinds of pains this is.
"I says, no, I said I'm gonna stop in bed today."
"So I stopped in bed now I, I'm better, well"
"No, that's only way you'll throw it off."
Yeah.
I'm a bit better but I've had to get out this morning to let  June stay in !
Yeah.
"Well I say, she were terrible on Friday, I know."
"Right then, I'll get off home and er  see what's what."
Alright.
But she never said.
She never bloody said!
Cos she always does bugger you know!
The tight bugger!
"No, she's in bed."
Is she bad?
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then your prince dies under my feet."""
"""Very well, we agree,"" said they all. ""Nay, if we do not get the ring for you, devour us all."""
"This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to the cat and released its son."
"As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything would go on as happily as before. ""How glad master will be!"" they thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it."
"""Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?"" said the dog."
"""What is done is done,"" replied the cat. ""We must try to recover it, and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream."
"I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me."""
"""All right,"" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet."
"Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring."
"This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found and carried back to the cat."
"""Come along now; I have got the ring,"" said the cat to the dog."
"""No, I will not,"" said the dog, ""unless you let me have the ring. I can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you."" So the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite."
"""See, see, there it goes away to that big tree,"" the cat exclaimed."
"""Oh! oh! what have I done?"" cried the dog."
"""You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,"" said the cat. ""But stop your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it."""
"The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree, killed the kite, and recovered the ring. ""Come along,"" it said to the dog when it reached the ground. ""We must make haste now. We have been delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on."""
"The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be."
The Talkative Tortoise
"The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual."
"Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so."
"At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with him, they said to the tortoise:"
"""Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come there with us?"""
"""But how can I get there?"""
"""We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to anybody."""
"""Oh! that I can do. Take me with you."""
"""That's right,"" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air."
"Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, ""Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!"" Whereupon the tortoise wanted to say, ""If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched slaves!"" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, ""A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!"""
"The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, ""Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?"""
"The future Buddha thought to himself, ""Long expecting, wishing to admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his life."" And saying, ""Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes people whose words have no end come to grief like this,"" he uttered these Verses:"
"""Verily the tortoise killed himself     Whilst uttering his voice;     Though he was holding tight the stick,     By a word himself he slew."

forms to this day an important element in Christian worship.
"Besides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn"
the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use
"of _Hallelujah_ as a part of the people’s praise, adding, in the course"
"of time, the _Gloria Patri_, the _Sanctus_, the _Te Deum_, and other"
canticles.

Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney's eager hands. It was an
"ordinary case knife such as the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed"
to two initials that had been carved on the case.
"""J.S."""
"""J.S."" repeated Sidney; then she cried: ""Why--J.S.! That's Jed Starrow!"""
"""Sure it's Jed Starrow!"""

"""He's _been_ on the _Arabella_, Lav!"""
"""Or someone of his gang."""
"""Isn't that _funny_? What would he come here for?"""
"Lavender was silent. And Sidney, staring at him as though to read from"
"his face some explanation, suddenly fell silent, too. The secret that"
Cap'n Davies had laid upon her weighed heavily. She _wished_ she could
tell.
“But I am already married!” cried Yvonne.
“Thinking me dead?”
“Yes.”
"He looked at her for a few seconds, then slapped his thigh and, rising"
"from his chair, bent himself double and gave vent to a roar of laughter."
The tears stood in Yvonne’s eyes.
"“Oh, but it’s comic. You don’t find it so?”"
He leant back against the railings and laughed again in genuine
merriment.
"“Why, it’s all the more reason to come back to me. _Ça y met du salé_."
Have you any children?”
Yvonne shook her head.
"“_Eh bien!_” he exclaimed, triumphantly, stepping towards her with"
"outstretched hands. But she shrank from him, outraged and bewildered."
"“Never, never!” she cried. “Go away. Have pity on me, for God’s sake!”"
Amédée Bazouge shrugged his shoulders carelessly.

The Princess was startled.
"""Who?"" she asked."
"The King peered into his flagon.  ""Well,"" he said, ""there _are_"
"people."""
"""If it had been somebody _very_ nice,"" said the Princess wistfully,"
"""it might have been rather lovely."""
The King gazed earnestly at the outside of his flagon.
"""Why 'might have been?'"" he said."
"The Princess was still puzzled.  ""But I'm grown up,"" she said; ""I"
"don't want a mother so much now."""
The King turned his flagon round and studied the other side of it.
"""A mother's--er--tender hand,"" he said, ""is--er--never----"" and then"
the outrageous thing happened.
"It was all because of a birthday present to the King of Barodia, and"

"“I'll go and tell her now,” said John."
“Let me just say how d' ye do to her first. I won't stay a minute.”
The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great

sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”
"“He has been talking to me quite beautifully for a long time,” said"
"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"

Balt. A half-hour's run down the bay and he clambered from his launch

"""Butcher by hand,"" said the fisherman."
"""But how? That takes skilled labor--lots of it."""
"George grinned. ""I'm too old a bird to be caught like this. I figured"

A HAND IN THE DARK
While they were talking a tug-boat towing a pile-driver came into view.
Boyd asked the meaning of its presence in this part of the river.
"""I don't know,"" answered Big George, staring intently. ""Yonder looks"
"""I don't know. Why?"""
"""I wonder if I could get one."""

And Paul withdrew.
Madder than ever. Some people see flies. Paul saw goldfish.

The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....
It was a Saturday evening. I stood talking to the lawyer in the garden; he
"didn't like the place, and wanted to leave, but Miss Torsen would not go"
"house, she had heard the men summoning him. She had lost no time in"
getting to Sunset Lane.
"""Who went with me? Where? What's happened?"""
Now Aunt Achsa let her whole weight drop against Mr. Dugald.
"""Didn't Sidney go 'long to Truro with you?"" she asked falteringly."
"""I didn't go to Truro. Knew this storm was comin'. Where--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Aunt Achsa moaned Mr. Dugald motioned to Miss Vine."
"""Take care of things--here. I'm off--"""
"""Cap'n Davies and Jim Saunders and Pete Cady's gone out in the"
"_Sally_,"" cried one of the men who had brought Lavender home. But"
Dugald Allan had plunged into the darkness without hearing him. The men
rushed after him.
Miss Vine pushed Aunt Achsa into a chair.

to let him quit it without putting up a pretty good fight. Jeremiah

'round you 'til I can light a lamp and get you some clothes. You're
"shivering like it was December. I'll put the kettle over, too--"""
"Oddly huge and gaunt in the shadowy room, Miss Vine moved and talked"
briskly to keep up Aunt Achsa's nerve and her own against the black
fear that held them.
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....
"Entman's little eyes shone with affection. ""I can only wish you good"
"luck."""
"""Thanks. I'll need it."""
"""And one more thing I was wondering."""
"""What's that?"""
"""Why do you suppose the tenth android killed the one in the Village?"""
"""Another case of taking one reason for want of a better one. I think it"
was his way of delivering the creature to us for research. He couldn't
"know for sure that we already had his 'brothers.'"""
"""You're right--you must be,"" Entman agreed."
"""Small consolation. I'd like a few facts to go on for a change instead"
"of having to depend on logic all the time,"" Taber growled."
"""What are you referring to?"""
"""The data. I'm assuming, _if_ that's what's important, that the tenth"
"creature has a way of getting the stuff back up there."""
"""I can help a little on that,"" Entman said. ""I can assure you that from"
"what I've found in those brains, the data could, most likely, be sent"
"mentally."""
"""You're sure of that?"""
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
"Though I go bare, take ye no care,"
I am nothing a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.

Both foot and hand go cold:

Whether it be new or old.

But Solem urged him on:

"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.

The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"

It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.

He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"What did it mean? Hastily, I could fill in “Dearest Nettie,” and “I am"
"dying to see you.” Kennedy added, “The Recherche to-day,” that being"
"the name of a new apartment uptown, as well as “love and many kisses.”"
But “—rman”—what did that mean? Could it be Herman—Herman Schloss?
She was returning and we resumed our seats quickly.
Kennedy took the jewel case from her and examined it carefully. There
was not a mark on it.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said slowly, rising and handing it back to her,"
“have you told me all?”
"“Why—yes,” she answered."
Kennedy shook his head gravely.
“I’m afraid not. You must tell me everything.”
"“No—no,” she cried vehemently, “there is nothing more.”"
"We left and outside the Deluxe he paused, looked about, caught sight of"
a taxicab and hailed it.
“Where?” asked the driver.

"""How long will that be?"" Slyne inquired. He, too, was smiling"
ecstatically.
"""Not much more than a fortnight,"" the lawyer informed him. ""It will soon"
"pass. We must just be patient."""
"""We must keep very quiet, too,"" said Slyne, ""unless we want to give the"
whole show away to the enemy in advance. We must clear off out of London
"till then. I'll tell you what, Jobling! Why shouldn't we all go down to"
"Scotland to-night?"""
"Mr. Jobling nodded agreement. ""An excellent idea,"" he declared. ""There's"
"nothing to keep us here."""
"""That's settled, then,"" Slyne asserted. ""And we'll all dine together at"
the Savoy before we start. I think we can afford to celebrate the
"occasion, eh! And I want to show Lady Josceline a few of her future"

"""PLEASURES AND PALACES"""

her way to a command performance at the Gaiety; a fact of which the

two hours ago.”
"“Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma’am?” said Mrs. McCool, with intense"
admiration. “You do be a wonder for rentin’ rooms of that kind. And did
"ye tell him, then?” she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with"
mystery.
"“Rooms,” said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, “are furnished for to"
"rent. I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.”"
"“’Tis right ye are, ma’am; ’tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have"

"“She’d a-been called handsome, as you say,” said Mrs. Purdy, assenting"
"but critical, “but for that mole she had a-growin’ by her left eyebrow."
"Do fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.”"
THE BRIEF DÉBUT OF TILDY
“Then we both saw the light creeping over the sea like a monstrous
"ghost. And it all lay so pallid and still,--did n't it?--as if it were"
a sea in a land of death. And then a cheeky little thrush began to
twitter.”
"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"
fich'isme_ about his philosophy which must be very consoling.”
"“I know what that is in English,” cried Stellamaris. “It is"
'don't-care-a-damativeness.' “ Her lips rounded roguishly over the
naughty syllable.
“Where did you learn that?”
“Walter told me.”
"“Walter must be clapped into irons, and fed on bread and water, and"
seriously spoken to.”
Unconsciously he had drifted into his usual manner of speech with her.
She laughed with a child's easy gaiety.
"“It's delightful to be wicked, is n't it?”"
“Why?” he asked.
"""Come along, Flemyng,"" he said. ""The show's over for to-night."""
"He seemed to express the general feeling, but men were reluctant to"
"acknowledge so disappointing a conclusion, and the preparations for"
departure were slow and lingering. They had not fairly begun before Mr.
Kilshaw's entrance abruptly checked them. Instantly he became the centre
of a crowd.
"""Now, Kilshaw,"" they cried, ""you know all about it. Oh, come now! Of"
"course you do! Secret? Nonsense! Out with it!"" and one or two of his"
"intimates added imploringly, ""Don't be an ass, Kilshaw."""
Kilshaw flung himself into a chair.
"""They resign,"" he said."
"""At once?"""
"""Yes. Perry's to be sent for. Medland, I'm told, insists on going. For"
"my own part, I think he's right."""
"""Of course,"" said somebody sapiently, ""he doesn't want to dissolve with"
"this affair hanging over him."""
"""It comes to the same thing,"" observed Kilshaw. ""Perry will dissolve;"
"the Governor has promised to do it, if he likes."""
"""Perry dissolve!"""
"""Yes,"" nodded Kilshaw. ""You see--"" He paused and added, ""Our present"
"position isn't very independent."""
"entirely here. This place belongs to her."""
"""And you?"""
"""I? I have just been released from prison in London, Holloway"
"Prison..."""

Kennedy looked at Cæsar with curiosity.
“And how can it help you with your plans to stay here in Rome?” he
asked.
“It can help me. In Spain nobody knows me. This is the only place where

"“But the support you could find here would be all of a clerical nature,”"
said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”
"“You are not taking it into account, my dear Cæsar, that the Church is"
still powerful and that it doesn’t pardon people who impose upon it.”
“Bah! I am not afraid of it.”
"“And you were just saying you are not courageous! You are courageous, my"

“I need data.”

And the voice was gone.

Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was

"a cushion. Trent, who had been detained a moment by Miss Decker,"
advanced to her.
"“It is very soon to come again,” he said, “but I simply had to call and"
inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently
do.”
"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"
"leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the ring to Miss Decker and raised her"
eyes guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and get the other?”
“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”
“I forgot that water ruins stones.”
"“Well, it is a consolation to know that water does not ruin a certain"
plain gold circlet.”
“Mr. Boswell!”
Jessica gasped and looked at the flames. A crisis had come. Would she be
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"

"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"

"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"

"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"

He climbed the steps of the brownstone and tried the knob. The door
"opened. He went inside and found himself in a drab, dark hall furnished"
"with an umbrella stand, a worn carpet, and a table spread with mail."
"There was a bell on the table. He tapped it and, after a lazy length of"
"time, a shapeless woman came through a door on the right and regarded"
him with no great show of cordiality.
"""Nothing vacant, mister. Everything I've got is rented."""
"""I wasn't looking for a room. I'm just doing a little checking."""
"""My license is okay,"" the woman said belligerently. ""The place is clean"
"and orderly."""
"""That's not what I'm checking about. There's been some counterfeit money"
"passed in this neighborhood and we're trying to trace it down."""
The woman had a pronounced mustache that quivered at this news.
"""Counterfeit! My roomers are honest."""
"""I'm sure they are. But some people carry counterfeit money without"
"knowing it. Do they all pay in cash?"""
"""Only two of them."""
"""Men or women?"""
"""One girl--Katy Wynn."""
"""It was not more than fifteen minutes after I had left, you say?""  I"
inquired.
"""No, m'sieur, not more."""
"""Mademoiselle had no other visitor?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Of that we are all certain."""
"""And the Countess, where was she during the time I was here?"""
"""She was out driving.  She did not return till about five minutes after"
"we had made the terrible discovery."""
"""And how did madame act?"""
"""She ordered us to carry poor mademoiselle to her room.  Poor madame!"
"She bore the blow with wonderful fortitude."""
That remark caused me to prick up my ears.
"""I don't quite understand,"" I said.  ""Did she not give way to tears?"""
"""No, m'sieur; she shed no tears, but sat erect, motionless as a statue."
She appeared unable to realise that poor mademoiselle was actually dead.
"At last she rang, and sent Jean to you."""
"""You are absolutely certain that mademoiselle had no visit or after I"
"left?"""
"I began speaking French, but when I paused for his verdict, he shrugged"
"his shoulders, saying:--"
"""Ah, _oui, oui!_ It may be better than my English."" But notwithstanding"
"his scant praise, we spoke the French language thereafter."
"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"
"good Doctor among the stars, as usual. There was a letter for me from"
Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""This is to tell you that M. l'Abbé du Boise will soon be in London. He"
will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.
"""You do not know him. Please call on him when he arrives. Tell the"

“Why?”
"“Because I remember that I must die, and then I shall not come back"
"to see Rome. She will be here still, century after century, full of"
"sunlight, and I shall be dead.... It is horrible, horrible!”"
“And your religion?”
"“Yes, I know. I believe I shall see other things; but not these things"
that are so beautiful.”
“You are an Epicurean.”
“It is so beautiful to be alive!”
"They stayed there looking at the panorama. Below, in the Piazza del"
"Popólo, they saw a red tram slipping along, which looked, at that"

"A tilbury, driven by a woman, stopped near their carriage. The woman was"
"blond with green eyes, prominent cheek-bones, and a little fur cap. At"
her feet lay an enormous dog with long flame-coloured hair.
"“She must be a Russian,” said Cæsar."
“Yes. Do you like that type?”
“She has a lot of character. She looks like one of the women that would
order servants to be whipped.”
The Russian was smiling vaguely. Laura told the coachman to drive on.

Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"
handkerchief. He sat down beside Alice and smiled at her warmly.
"""That thing is a wonder worker,"" he said, breathing deeply. ""Nothing"
"like exercise to make a man feel fine and fit."""
"Alice looked up at him with some amusement. ""Mr. Andrews, tell me. Are"
you the kind of man who opens the window on a winter morning about six
"o'clock, and takes deep lungsful of icy air?"""

a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Senator Crane sat at his desk. There were a pile of newspapers in front
of him. The first one carried a front page story with the headline:
SENATOR CRANE WARNS OF SPACE INVASION
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."
"“When I look at Rome this way,” murmured Laura, “I feel a pang, a pang"
of grief.”

"""Yes, to him."""
"""And to you also, m'sieur?  You have done your utmost for us, and I"
"thank you warmly for it all."""
"""Madame,"" I said earnestly, ""I have done only what a man should do.  You"
"sought my assistance, and I have given it, because--"""
"""Because of what?"" she inquired sharply the instant I paused."
"""Because I once loved her,"" I responded with perfect frankness."
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."
"""The _Arabella_--adrift out there--Sidney's on it--oh--_help_! And then"
Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.
"""Quick, the _Sally_! She's at Rockman's!"" Captain Davies ran toward"
"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"
boat and had swung her free of the wharf.
"""What the hell--"" shouted an ugly voice after them, but the _Sally_"
only chugged out into the darkness of the bay.

"""Look, Sid--light! It's--it's--morning!"" Mart's voice came in a thin"
whisper. For a long time the girls had lain huddled against the
"taff-rail of the boat, too weary and disheartened to even talk."
Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light that gleamed palely
in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep
"“Now, Mrs. Moulton,” he said gently, “I’m afraid I must trouble you to"
go with me. I am going over to a pawnbroker’s on the Bowery.”
"“The Bowery?” she repeated, with a genuinely surprised shudder. “Oh,"
"no, Mr. Kennedy. Don’t ask me to go anywhere to-night. I am—I am in no"
condition to go anywhere—to do anything—I—”
"“But you must,” said Kennedy in a low voice."
“I can’t. Oh—have mercy on me. I am terribly upset. You—”
"“It is your duty to go, Mrs. Moulton,” he repeated."
“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"
"added, playing a trump card, “We must work quickly. In his hands we"
found the fragments of a torn dress. When the police—”
"She uttered a shriek. A glance had told her, if she had deceived"
"herself before, that Kennedy knew her secret."
"Antoinette Moulton was standing before him, talking rapidly."
“Some one has told Lynn. I know it. There is nothing now that I can
conceal. If you had come half an hour later you would not have found
"me. He had written to Mr. Schloss, threatening him that if he did not"
leave the country he would shoot him at sight. Mr. Schloss showed me
the letter.
"“It had come to this. I must either elope with Schloss, or lose his"
"sense making orphans."""
"""You promised, Sis,"" I told her through my teeth. ""You promised you"
"wouldn't get Butt into trouble!"""
She tossed her spiral curls at me and ground a heel into the purser's
"instep. He screwed up his face and howled, but he didn't let go of her"
arm.
"""_Shush_, Ferdinand, this is serious!"""
"It was. I heard the Captain say, ""I'm not carrying a weapon, Brown."""
"""Then _get_ one,"" Butt's low, lazy voice floated out."
"""No, thanks. You're as handy with that thing as I am with a"
"rocketboard."" The Captain's words got a little fainter as he walked"
forward. Butt growled like a gusher about to blow.
"""I'm counting on your being a good guy, Brown."" The Captain's"
"voice quavered just a bit. ""I'm banking on what I heard about the"
blast-happy Browns every time I lifted gravs in New Kalamazoo; they
"have a code, they don't burn unarmed men."""

"Just about this time, events in the lifeboat went down to a mumble. The"
top of my head got wet and I looked up. There was sweat rolling down
the Second Assistant's forehead; it converged at his nose and bounced
off the tip in a sizable stream. I twisted out of the way.
"""What's happening?"" Sis gritted, straining toward the lock."
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"
"Times Square."""
"""The other's a man--quiet, no trouble, pays his rent right on the dot"
every week. John Dennis his name is and he doesn't look like no
"counterfeiter."""
"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"""Proceed, count."""
"""Monsieur le Comte Hamilton begs me to say that he was called away from"
"London early to-day on the king's business, but that he will return"
in four weeks. When he returns he will do himself the honor to send
"me again, asking you to name a friend, unless you prefer to apologize,"
"which no gentleman would do in a case of this sort. You said, I am told,"
"that Monsieur le Comte lied. If you admit that he did not lie, of course"
"you admit that you did. So, im-pos-si-ble! There must be to fight!"""
"""Do you know, count, the cause of my having given Count Hamilton the"
"lie?"" I asked."
"""I did not inquire,"" he answered smilingly. ""To me it was to carry the"
"message."""
"""George Hamilton is your friend, is he not?"" I asked."
"""Yes, but far more, he is the friend of my king, and will make entreaty"
"with my monarch for my return to France,"" answered De Grammont."
"""It was because of Count Hamilton's insulting reference to his brother"
"that I used the ugly word,"" I returned."
"""A-ah, that is different!"" Then recovering himself quickly: ""But I"
undertook the mission. It is to finish. Monsieur George Hamilton? My
friend? My king's friend? If it had been known to me! But you have the
"message of 'Sieur le Comte."""
"After a short silence he said, ""When Monsieur le Comte Hamilton returns,"
"I shall ask him to relieve me of this duty."""
“I fled.
“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.
"before these, or will you see me alone?'"
"'Your spy, that cat there,' my lady answered, carried away by her"
"temper, 'may go! The women will stay.'"
"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"
hound!'
"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.

For it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin.  The French
"captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one, and"
presently some of his melancholy disappeared.  He gave an order to
"one of his men who brought two more glasses, one for the English"
"captain, and one for himself."
"""I looks towards you,"" said Jones."
"""À votre santé,"" cried the Frenchman.  ""Monsieur, vous êtes un homme"
"de coeur quand mêne."""
"""I don't savvy, but I dessay you means well,"" said the captain."
"""Now, if I'd thought to bring along the signal book we might 'ave 'ad"

"eyes, remonstrated against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed and"
given a drink.
"""Here's to you, old cocklywax,"" said Hart, with a scrape of his leg."
"""I bears no grudge, not me."""
"But Marion wouldn’t be stopped. “No, mother, you spoil father, and it’s"
not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He’s very naughty.” She
"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror."
"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating"
"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it"
"was only “Jam, please, father”—it rang out as though she were on the"

"“Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?” asked Charlotte,"
beginning to rock again.
"“I’m not sure,” said Old Mr. Neave. “I’m not sure. I didn’t see him"

“He said—” began Charlotte.
"But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some"
"paper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair."
"“There, you see,” she cried. “That’s what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with"
touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”
"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her"
"tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab"
"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she"
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I
shouldn’t have the train.”
“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole
point.”
"“Here, mother, let me decide.” Marion snatched the paper playfully from"
ger.

"You've got that right, lady, Vance thought. Three men were just killed."

One of the _kobun  _withdrew the Zenith. He placed it on the mahogany

"blank gray screen, unsure what he was supposed to do next."
"Vera knew. She reached for the switch on the side and clicked it on,"
then stood back and turned to Eva.

The horseman in the valley had swept at a gallop through a sea of
"sun-bronzed fern. His eyes were full of a restless glitter, as the"
"eyes of a man, whose heart is troubled. He sprang from the saddle,"
"and, leading his horse by the bridle, bent low before the twain."
"""Tidings, my lord!"""
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.

"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"

*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

"The horseman leaned against his horse, his arm hooked over its neck."
He pointed to the valley.
"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.
"said. ""Percy says all Indian butter is bad. Of course, it's only an"
"idea of his, but men are such faddy creatures, don't you think?"""
"""They wouldn't be men if they weren't--"" Mrs. Carmichael had begun,"
"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She
picked them up immediately and went on with an impatient exclamation
at her own carelessness. But the involuntary start had coincided with
"a loud report from outside in the darkness, and a smothered scream."
Lois put down her knife.
"""Won't you come and help me?"" she said to Beatrice. ""Your mother will"
"not notice that you have gone."""
"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"
"cushions, came over to Lois' side."
"""How brave you are!"" she said in a whisper. ""You seem so cool and"
"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"
"am so sorry."""
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""
"""Use a little persuasion."""
"""But suppose he won't persuade?"""
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"
got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling you is that
"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"
"you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow."""
"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"
are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main office on
"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"
"and take those two .38's? We really must get this party moving."""
"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"
"me--I imagine you are in diplomacy, as I noticed you went through"
"with a Red passport.--I am Vivien Warren, just out of prison, and an"
"outlaw, more or less."""
"""'The outlaws of to-day are the in-laws of to-morrow,' as the"
English barrister said when he married the Boer general's daughter.
I have thought I recognized you. I have heard you speak at Lady
Maud's and also at Lady Feenix's Suffrage parties. My name is Hawk.
I suppose you've been in prison for some Suffrage offence? So has my
"aunt, for the matter of that."""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but in her case they only sentenced her to the First"
"Division; whereas _I_ have been doing nine months' hard."""
"_Hawk_: ""What was your crime?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I admit nothing, it is always wisest. But I was accused of"
"burning down Mr. ----'s racing stables--and other things..."""
"_Hawk_: ""_That_ beast. Well, I suppose it was very wrong. Can't"
"quite make up my mind about militancy, one way or the other. But"
"here we are up against the biggest war in history, and such"
"peccadilloes as yours sink into insignificance. By the bye, my aunt"
"was amnestied and so I suppose were you?"""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but not so handsomely. I was requested to go away"
"from England for a time, so here I am, about to join my mother in"
"Brussels--or in a little country place near Brussels."""
"_Hawk_: ""Well, I've been Secretary of Legation there. I'm just going"
"back to--to--well I'm just going back."""
"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
In the wind.
"""A passable enough rendering, if I may say, though I don't necessarily"
"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.
"""It's kind of you to have remembered."" Mino drank once more, then"
"was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no"
"good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old"
"spider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the"
"dining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,"
"the office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!"
Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window
"shone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the"
"big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away"
"sounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long"
time. He’d been forgotten. What had all this to do with him—this house
"and Charlotte, the girls and Harold—what did he know about them? They"
were strangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his
wife. His wife!
"... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped"
"sorrowful, mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were"
"round his neck. A face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice"
"breathed, “Good-bye, my treasure.”"
"My treasure! “Good-bye, my treasure!” Which of them had spoken? Why had"
they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. _She_ was his
"wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a"
dream.
"Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his"
"hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, “Dinner is on the"
"table, sir!”"
"“I’m coming, I’m coming,” said old Mr. Neave."
concert. She had forgotten that Amédée was singing there. Everard was
"going. He would see the name on the programme, “Amédée Bazouge.” There"
could not be two tenors of that name in Europe. Everard must be kept
away at all costs.
"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"
silly and cowardly. I am afraid of all kinds of things.”
"“Of course I ’ll come and sit with you a little,” he replied kindly."
They entered her room together. Yvonne lay down. Her head was splitting
with nervous headache. The Canon tended her in his grave way and
"sat down by the window with a book. Yvonne felt very guilty, but yet"
"comforted by his presence. At the end of an hour, he looked at his watch"
and rose from his seat.
“Are you easier now?”
"“You are not going to the Kursaal, Everard?”"
"“I am afraid Emmeline is expecting me.” She signed to him to approach,"
and put her arms round his neck.
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""

"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's
"cut her beautiful hair!"""
"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"
the diplomatic service marriage is a serious drawback to any save an
"ambassador."""
"""When a man is in love as I am with you, dearest, he throws all thoughts"
of his career to the winds; personal interests are naught where true
"love is concerned."""
"""You must not--nay, you shall not--wreck your future on my account,"" she"
"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"
"to the Englishwoman who loves you."""
"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""
"""With the latter you are certainly on terms of most intimate"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"
Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
"""And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me quick!"""
"""I could only get scraps of it. I didn't dare look, I didn't dare move."
But one fellow called the other Jed. I heard 'em say something about
'risk' and a 'stranger from Boston asking too many questions 'round
"Rockman's to be healthy,' and Jed Starrow--I'm dead sure it was his"
"voice--said, sort of blustering like, 'Let them search the _Puritan_!"
They won't find anything on her _now_!' And the other fellow answered
"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""
"""Sid, five thousand dollars!"" Lavender whistled."
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"
"mere! Let them ride in quest of your lost one, ride like the wind!"""
Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""
"someone looking at her, someone different, and someone smiling."
She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.
"""Trude--_Oh, Trude!_"""
"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.
"""Have you come to take me home? But how could they send for you so"
"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""
"""One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better. He'll be all right,"
"the doctor says, after a good rest. Yes, I think I'd better take you"
"home. No, they did not send for me."" Briefly, as though now that"
"earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude told of the sketch"
that had so bewildered and alarmed her.
"""I couldn't understand,"" she finished."
"""I couldn't either, at first. You see the boarder--the man who has"
boarded here so long and is dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that
"letter to me and wrote it _nice_ so as to please her, and, at"
"first--but, oh, Trude, Aunt Achsa _is_ wonderful and so is Lavender,"
"really, truly, even though they are poor--"""
"""Hush, Sidney."" Trude's eyes darkened with feeling. ""You do not have to"
"tell me that. I have learned _that_ in only a few hours. Oh, I have"
"seen straight into souls--those kind men on the street, as concerned as"
"though you belonged to them, and here--Aunt Achsa with her great"
courage and her love. And that Miss Vine--they're so _simple_--and so
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""
"""I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"" she told him, clasping her hands at"
"her heart, her eyes very eager. ""And, Jasper--you must let me take"
"Ambrizette with me."""
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"
didn't waste any time shippin' in the _Sally_. Lucky for us it was
"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"

"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
"""Oh, well...."" she said. ""No, let's not tonight,"" she added suddenly;"
"""some other time. Yes? In a few days? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good"
"night."""
"For the first time it struck me: she wants to rouse you, too, settled man"
though you are; she wants to make you as mad as the others! That's what
she's after!
"And now I remember, before the lawyer arrived, when there was Tradesman"
"Batt--I remember how during his first few days here, she would give me a"
"kind word or a look that was quite out of the picture, and as unmistakable"
"as her pride would permit. No, she had no objections to seeing old age"
wriggle. And listen to this: before this she had been intent to show a
"well-behaved indifference to sex, but that was finished; was she not at"
"this moment resisting only faintly, and raising definite hopes? ""Not"
"tonight, but some other time,"" she had said. Yes, a half-refusal, a mere"
"postponement, that I was meant to hear. She was corrupt, but she was also"
"cunning, with the cunning of a madman. So corrupt."
"Dear child, Pharaoh laughs before his pyramids; standing before his"
"pyramids he laughs. He would laugh at me, too."

Next day we three remaining guests were sitting in the living room. The
lady and the actor read one book; I read another.
"""Will you,"" she says to him, ""do me a great favor?"""
"""With pleasure."""
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."
"""Like as not Lav's plain jealous. Mr. Dugald hasn't had any time for"
anything but toting this Pola round everywhere and Lav notices it. He
hasn't any right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
"Dugald's own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises and sets in Mr."
"Dugald. And like as not he misses you--"""
"""I've missed Lav dreadfully. I didn't know how much I missed him and"
Mart until today when it came over me suddenly that the things I was
doing with Pola weren't really much fun--just at first they were
"because they were different. I'm afraid, Aunt Achsa, that I love"
different things! But tomorrow I am going to play all day long with Lav
"and Mart, see if I don't. I can't wait for tomorrow to come!"""
"""So! We know now what happened to Journeyman and the others!"" burst"
"out Dex. ""I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!"""
"""And me,"" nodded Brand. ""But that doesn't cure the situation. As long"
"as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep"
sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them
as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen
"along who'll weaken under torture. Then--"""
*       *       *       *       *
He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"
"if they found ways of reaching your globe."""
"""But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!"" cried Dex. ""We've got to find"
"a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!"""
"Brand sighed heavily. ""We are two against hundreds of thousands. We"
"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can
"we do to spike their guns?"""
He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the
domed building outside came to his ears.
"""What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?"" he asked quietly."
"""I do not know, exactly,"" replied the girl. ""There is some sort of"
"""If someone 'round here's doing it Cap'n Davies wants to catch him"
himself. He says he doesn't want the reward but he wants to punish the
man who's hurting the honest name of this part of Cape Cod. I think
"that's a grand spirit."""
Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come
"out late this afternoon and if it's gone--well, we'll know someone came"
"to look for it!"""
"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In
"her excitement she scarcely breathed. Every move, every act, was"
"your employ."""
"""What!"""
"""I hear you have bought them."""
"""Do you mean to insinuate--"""
"""I don't mean to insinuate anything. Listen! We are where we can talk"
"plainly, Marsh, and I am tired of all this subterfuge. You did what you"
"could to stop me, you even tried to have me killed--"""
"""You dare to--"""
"""But I guess it never occurred to you that I may be just as desperate"
"as you are."""
"The men stared at each other with hostile eyes, but the accusation had"
come so suddenly and with such boldness as to rob Marsh of words.
"Emerson went on in the same level voice: ""I broke through in spite of"
"you, and I'm on the job. If you want to cry quits, I'm willing; but, by"
"God! I won't be balked, and if any of your hired marshals try to take"
"me before I put up my catch I'll put you away. Understand?"""
Willis Marsh recoiled involuntarily before the sudden ferocity that
"blazed up in the speaker's face. ""You are insane,"" he cried."
"""Am I?"" Emerson laughed, harshly. ""Well, I'm just crazy enough to do"
what I say. I don't think you're the kind that wants hand-to-hand
"trouble, so let's each attend to his own affair. I'm doing well, thank"
"you, and I think I can get along better if yon don't come back here"
"until I send for you. Something might fall on you."""
"satellites."""
"""Their vessels are crude, clumsy things. The journey from the nearest"
satellite is the limit of their flying range. They have nothing like
"your wonderful little ships, and they want to know how to build and"
"power them."""
*       *       *       *       *
"She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: ""You see, yours is the"
fourth space ship to visit their kingdom; and that makes them fearful
because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop
"that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their"
greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely
"sphere, and they are insatiable in their lust for new territories."
"Thus they plan to go to your planet as soon as they are able, and kill"
or enslave all the people there as they have killed and enslaved my
"race."""
"""They'll have a job on their hands trying to do that!"" declared Dex"
stoutly.
"But Brand paled. ""They can do it!"" he snapped. ""Look at those"
"death-tubes of theirs. We have no arms to compete with that."" He"
"turned to Greca. ""So the Rogans plan to force the secret of our motors"
"from us by torture?"""
"She nodded, and caught his hand in hers."
"""Yes. They will do with you as they did with the six who came before"
"you--and who died before surrendering the secret."""
"""Give it here,"" one of the men asked. And as Si handed over the"
contraband it slipped from his hands. He caught at it quickly to save
it from the dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and gleaming
fell from the folds and rolled upon the floor.
"""I'll be ding-blasted!"" roared Cap'n Phin. Someone swore softly. The"
man Si dropped to his knees. Sidney blinked.
Cap'n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And among the countless
folds he found a cunningly contrived pocket filled with hundreds of the
priceless gems.
"For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it all, the wealth of the"
"glistening jewels, held each man in the room. Cap'n Phin folded the"
gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."
"""Reckon we'd better not question Lav Green just yet, he's pullin' out"
of the fog. We got enough as 'tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain't much
mistaken he'll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on the folks
higher up what's paid him to hurt the name of the Cape. That'll do for
"now, little gal."""
dance-contracts.
"Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his"
"black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room.  He"
"was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of"
that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the
"sunflowers, and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view"
"of his thick red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over"
"a shiny white shirt.  And, holding out her hand, she said:"
"""How do you do, Mr. Wagge?  It was kind of you to come."""
Mr. Wagge turned.  His pug face wore a downcast expression.
"""I hope I see you well, ma'am.  Pretty place you 'ave 'ere.  I'm fond of"
"flowers myself.  They've always been my 'obby."""
"""They're a great comfort in London, aren't they?"""
"""Ye-es; I should think you might grow the dahlia here.""  And having thus"
"obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire, satisfied some obscurer"
"desire to flatter, he went on: ""My girl showed me your letter.  I didn't"
like to write; in such a delicate matter I'd rather be vivey vocey.  Very
"kind, in your position; I'm sure I appreciate it.  I always try to do the"
Christian thing myself. Flesh passes; you never know when you may have to
"take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you."""
"""I'm very glad.  I hoped perhaps you would."""
"Mr. Wagge cleared his throat, and went on, in a hoarser voice:"
"""I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your"
every moment was precious.
"'Bring nothing but cloaks and food and wine,' I said. 'We have to go a"
league on foot and can carry little.'
"The Countess heard my words, and looked at me with growing"
comprehension. 'The Waldgrave?' she muttered. 'Is he here?'
"He came forward from the door to speak to her; but when she saw him,"
"and how pale and thin he was, with great hollows in his cheeks and his"
"eyes grown too large for his face, she began to cry weakly, as any"
"other woman might have cried, being overwrought. I bade Marie, who"
"alone kept her wits, to bring her wine and make her take it; and in a"
"minute she smiled at us, and would have thanked us."
"'Wait!' I said bluntly, feeling a great horror upon me whenever I"
looked towards the general or caught his eye. 'You may have small
"cause to thank us. If we fail, Heaven and you forgive us, my lady, for"
this man will not. If we are retaken----'
'We will not be retaken!' she cried hardily. 'You have horses?'
"'Five only,' I answered. 'They are all Steve could get, and they are a"
"league away. We must go to them on foot. There are eight of us here,"
and young Jacob and Ernst are watching outside. Are all ready?'
"My lady looked round; her eye fell on Fraulein Max, who with a little"
bundle in her arms had just re-entered and stood shivering by the
"door. The Dutch girl winced under her glance, and dropping her bundle,"
stooped hurriedly to pick it up.
'That woman does not go!' the Countess said suddenly.
"""We are all here,"" she answered. ""None of us has fled. Did you not"
"know that?"""
He looked about him. A flash of scorn rekindled in his somber eyes.
"""You are alone. Have they deserted you?"""
"""They do not know that I am here. I crept back of my own free will--to"
"speak with you, Nehal."""
"Both hands clasped upon his sword-hilt, erect, a proud figure of"
"misfortune, he stood there and studied her, half-wonderingly,"
half-contemptuously. The restless forces at his back were forgotten.
They were no more to him than the pawns with which his will played
life and death. He was their god and their faith. They waited for his
word to sweep out of his path the white-faced Englishwoman who held
him checked in the full course of his victory. But he did not speak to
"them, but to her, in a low voice in which scorn still trembled."
"""You are here, no doubt, to intercede for those others--or for"
"yourself. You see, I have learned something in these two years. It is"
"useless. No one can stop me now."""
"""No one?"""
"He smiled, and for the first time she saw a sneer disfigure his lips."
"""Not even you, Miss Cary. You have done a great deal with me--enough"
perhaps to justify your wildest hopes--but you have touched the limits
of your powers and of my gullibility. Or did you think there were no
"limits?"""
The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?
"It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in the false"
bottom of a new suitcase. But if the _Mino-gumi_ had been searching
"only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods"
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.
"Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the limo, but"
"maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the"
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex
"had kept it, or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she"
"thought, things were moving too fast now."
"""I get the picture,"" he said, rising from his chair. With a"
"carefully feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. ""Guess"
"it's time we got our toothbrushes."""
"""You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,"" Vera continued. ""Your suitcases"
were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found them conveniently packed.
"Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care of."""
"Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle it here."
"He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them. They"
"caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,"
"who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart."
"""We appreciate the snappy service,"" Vance said. He looked down at the"
"computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his right hand,"
"sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed for"
"the nearest Japanese _kobun_. He was on target, catching the man"
"door. Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally"
"tallying the certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and"
the other the bearer bonds.
"Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance thought."
"Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got some leverage"
left.
But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was still in shock
from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood. Alex's
"abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,"
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man
"deserved it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had"
"always admired players who put everything on the table, no matter which"
side.
"Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned close. But"
maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
"tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last"
time.
"Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich."
"Then Vera turned back to them. ""Now, I want the computer. We know it"
"was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning did"
"not locate it."""
"So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized."
"""Looks like you've got a problem."" He strolled over and plopped down in"
"one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall. ""Too bad."""
"“I want to talk to you, Wallie,” said he."
"“Have a drink? No? I sha' n't want anything, Perkins,” said he to"
the waiting dresser. “Call me when I 'm on in the second act. I don't
"change,” he explained."
"“I know,” said John. “That 's why I 've come now.”"
"“What's the matter?” Herold asked, sitting in the chair before the"
"dressing-table, bright with mirrors and electric lights and sticks of"
grease paint and silver-topped pots and other paraphernalia.
"“Nothing particular. Only hell, just as usual. I saw that child to-day.”"
Herold lit a cigarette.
“Have you ever speculated on what becomes of the victims in cases of
this kind?” asked John.
"“Not particularly,” said Herold, seeing that John wanted to talk."
“What do you think can become of a human creature in the circumstances
of this poor little wretch? Her childhood is one vista of bleak
"ugliness. Never a toy, never a kiss, not even the freedom of the gutter."
"Unless you 've been there, you can't conceive the soul-crushing despair"
of that infernal orphanage. She leaves it and goes into the world.
She goes out of a kind of dreary Greek hades into a Christian hell. It
"lasted for months. She was too ignorant and spiritless to complain, and"
"to whom was she to complain? Now she's sent back again, just like a sick"
"animal, to hades. Fancy, they would n't let her have a few flowers in'"
"the room! It makes me mad to think of it. And when she gets well again,"
obstinately.
"'Wait,' he said; 'I will ask.'"
But when the old housekeeper came she had only the same tale to tell.
She was alone. No young woman had crossed the threshold for a week
"past. There was no other woman there, young or old."
'You will have it that I have a young man in the house next!' she
"grumbled, shooting scorn at me."
"'I can assure you that there is no one here,' Herr Krapp said civilly."
"'Dorcas has been with me many years, and I can trust her. Still if you"
like you can walk through the rooms.'
"But I hesitated to do that. The man's manner evidenced his sincerity,"
"and in face of it my belief wavered. Fancy, I began to think, had"
played me a trick. It was no great wonder if the features which were
"often before me in my dreams, and sometimes painted themselves on the"
"darkness while I lay wakeful, had for once taken shape in the"
"daylight, and so vividly as to deceive me. I apologised. I said what"
"was proper, and, with a heavy sigh, went from the door."
"Ay, and with bent head. The passing crowd and the sunshine and the"
distant music of drum and trumpet grated on me. For there was yet
another explanation. And I feared that Marie was dead.
I was still brooding sadly over the matter when I reached home. Steve
"met me at the door, but, feeling in no mood for small talk just then,"
"I would have passed him by and gone in, if he had not stopped me."
"'I have a message for you, lieutenant,' he said."
"not a day over forty?"""
"""I have given up wondering where the real Dawson ends and where the"
disguises begin. The man I met up north wasn't the least bit like the
"one down here."""
"""A deal younger, I expect,"" said the chief assistant, grinning. ""He"
shifts about between thirty and sixty. The old man is no end of a
"cure, and tries to take us in the same as he does you. There's an"
"inspector at the Yard who was at school with him down Hampshire way,"
"and ought to know what he is really like, but even he has given Dawson"
up. He says that the old man does not know his own self in the
"looking-glass; and as for Mrs. Dawson, I expect she has to take any"
"one who comes along claiming to be her husband, for she can't,"
"possibly tell t'other from which."""
"""One might make a good story out of that,"" I observed to Cary."
"""I don't understand,"" said he. ""Mr. Dawson told me once that I knew"
"the real Dawson, but that few other people did."""
"""If he told you that,"" calmly observed the assistant, ""you may bet"
"your last shirt he was humbugging you. He couldn't tell the truth, not"
"if he tried ever so."""
"""What is he at now?"" I asked."
"""I don't know, sir. And if he told me, I shouldn't believe him. I"
don't take no account of a word that man says. But he's the most
successful detective we've got in the whole Force. He's sure to be
"head of the C.I.D. one day, and then he will have to stay in his"
"office and give us others a chance."""
"this ever happened."""
"She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back."
"""Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell"
"you two that we haven't seen the last of each other."" She paused, then"
"continued. ""In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""You once told me, back when we met on the plane from Athens, you would"
welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about to be
"granted. You both are going to be our guests."""
"""That's kind of you."" He stared at her, startled. ""But we can probably"
"bear up to the separation."""
"""No, I must insist. You were right about the difficulties. Your death"
"now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex will be trouble"
"enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet matter. Moscow"
"Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise awkward"
"inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the"
"project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand."""
He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't figured on.
Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had Ken said?
The Tokyo _oyabun _never forgot. What this really meant was that Tanzan
Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?
Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was going to be a
zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.
"""Oh, yes, a scratch. I hardly feel it. It isn't anything. It can't be"
"anything. There's nothing vital thereabouts, is there, Berry?"""
The missionary shrugged his shoulders. He had flung open the glass
"doors which led on to the verandah, and the brightening dawn flooded"
in upon them.
"""Come and help me carry this poor lady,"" he said. ""We have not a"
"minute to lose."""
"Travers tried to obey, but he had no strength, and the other thrust"
him impatiently on one side.
"""Mrs. Carmichael, you are a strong woman,"" he appealed. Between them"
"they managed to bring Mrs. Cary's heavy, unconscious frame down the"
"steps. It was a nerve-trying task, for their progress was of necessity"
"a slow one, and the sound of the desperate fighting seemed to surround"
them on every side. It was with a feeling of intense relief that the
little party saw Nicholson appear from amidst the trees and run toward
them.
"""That's right!"" he cried. ""Only be quick! They are at us on all sides"
"now, but my men are keeping them off until you are out of the"
bungalow. The old ruin at the back of the garden is our last stand.
"Carmichael is there already with a detachment, and is keeping off a"
"rear attack. I shall remain here."""
"""Alone?"" Berry asked anxiously."
"""Yes. I believe they will ransack the bungalow first. When they come,"
"the Rajah is sure to be at their head, and--well, it's going to be"
diamond cut diamond between us two when we meet. I know the beggars
as little to your mind as to mine.  We can flatter and fool and make
mock with the best; but when it comes to marriage!  Faugh! one’s soul
sickens at the thought.  What man in his senses would trust his
happiness or his honour in the hands of that tawdry crew?  Gilt and
"tinsel do very well to play with; but when one desires to purchase, one"
"asks for gold."""
Grey’s heart seemed to stand still within him.  He felt growing numb and
"cold.  As they passed beneath the gateway, and the lamp shone upon his"
"face, Lord Sandford saw that it was white as death, and a strange gleam"
came into his own eyes.
"""Come, my friend, you do not answer.  What think you of the wife that I"
have chosen?  What think you of the Lady Geraldine Adair?  Is she not a
matchless creature?  Who would have believed such a sport could come
"from such a tree?"""
Grey commanded himself by a great effort.
"""Is the Lady Geraldine Adair, then, your affianced wife?"""
"""That, or next door to it.  My suit is approved of her parents.  We"
shall be betrothed ere long.  I thought you might be learning as much
from her own lips to-night.  Did I not hear my name pass between you
"twain?"""
"""She did ask some question anent you,"" answered Grey, who had no desire"
"to fence or parry—he felt too stunned and bewildered; ""but she spoke not"
"of any troth-plight.  Why should she?"""
"""True, why should she?  She is not one of your empty-headed chatterers."
She wears not her heart upon her sleeve.  And your acquaintance is of
Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude. She frowned over it.
One of the girls certainly did look like Sidney as she remembered the
child from their one meeting.
"""How do you explain it, Trude?"""
"Trude sighed heavily. ""I can't explain it. There's something wrong"
"somewhere. And it's my fault, Aunt Edith. I--I consented--we all"
consented to let Sidney go off down there just so that we could go
ahead with our own plans. But we thought--we felt _certain_ that these
cousins were very nice--I--I mean had a lovely home and were rich so
that Sidney might get something out of her visit that she couldn't get
"at home. It sounds shameful to _say_ it."""
"""I understand, my dear. But what made you think so?"""
"""The--the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It _was_ a very nice letter!"""
"""Well, _I_ have always thought you could judge anyone's character and"
"background by a letter. There must be something wrong. This girl--"""
"pointing to the sketch, ""is positively shocking! At least she would be"
"around here."""
"""I remember now something Sidney said--when she was begging us to let"
her go away. 'I want to be different! I want to go somewhere where I
won't be Joseph Romley's daughter. I want adventure and to do exciting
"things--' Those were her very words! I didn't take them seriously then,"
"but, oh, Aunt Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we guessed!"" Poor"
"Trude rose quickly to her feet. ""Aunt Edith, I simply _must_ go to"
Provincetown at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?
"You'll--you'll understand, won't you? I can't be happy one minute until"
"I see the child. I feel that it's all my fault."""
'The second from the door end of the house?' he asked.
"'No, the third.'"
He nodded with an air of quiet triumph. 'Just so!' he said. 'I thought
"so afterwards. But the fact is, my friend, my house ends with the"
"second gable. The third gable-end does not belong to it, though"
doubtless it once did.'
"'No?' I exclaimed. And for a moment I stood taken aback, cursing my"
"carelessness. Then I stammered, 'But this third gable--I saw no door"
"in it, Herr Krapp.'"
"'No, the door is in another street,' he answered. 'Or rather it opens"
on the churchyard at the back of St. Austin's. So you may have seen
"her after all. Well, I wish you well,' he continued. 'I must be"
going.'
"The crowd was beginning to separate, moving away by twos and threes,"
talking loudly. The lights were dying down. He nodded and was gone;
while I still stood gaping. For how did the matter stand? If I had
really seen Marie at the window--as seemed possible now--and if
"nothing turned out to be amiss at home, then I had not been tricked"
"after all, and the message was genuine. True she had not kept her"
"appointment. But she might be in durance, or one of a hundred things"
might have frustrated her intention.
"Still I could do nothing now except go home, and cutting short my"
"speculations, I forced myself through the press, and with some labour"
"managed to reach the door. As I did so I turned to look back, and the"
"sight, though the people were moving away fast, was sufficiently"
"'em as they were talking to Peasley. You'd better 'beat' it, quick!"""
"""How? I couldn't get through that crowd. They know me. Listen!"" Outside"
the street broke into a roar at some taunt of the fishermen high up in
"the rigging. ""I can't run away, and if those detectives get me I'm"
"ruined."""
"""Well! What's to be done?"" demanded Fraser, sharply. ""If you say the"
"word, we'll shoot it out with them, and get away on the ship before--"""
"""We can't do that--there are a dozen policemen in front here."""
"""Well, you'll have to move quick, or they'll 'cop' you, sure."""
"Boyd clinched his hands in desperation. ""I guess they've got me,"" he"
"said, bitterly. ""There's no way out."""
His eyes fell upon the letter containing his boastful assurance of
victory. What a mockery!
"""From what they said I don't think they know you,"" Fraser continued."
"""Anyhow, they wanted Peasley to point you out. When they come off,"
"maybe you can slip 'em."""
"""But how?"" Boyd seized eagerly upon the suggestion. ""The wharf is"
"empty--see! I'll have to cross it in plain sight."""
Through the rear door of the office that opened upon the dock proper
they beheld the great floor almost entirely clear. Save for a few tons
"of freight at which Big George's men were working, it was as"
"unobstructed as a lawn; and, although it was nearly the size of a city"
"block, it afforded no more means of concealment than did the little"
Besides--in a hundred years it will all be forgotten. Why do we struggle?
In a hundred years someone will read about it in memoirs and letters and
"think: ""How she wriggled, how she fussed--dear me!"" There are others about"
whom nothing at all will be written or read; life will close over them
like a grave. Either way....
"What sorrows she had--dear, dear, what sorrows! The day she had been"
"unable to pay the bill, she thought herself the center of the universe;"
"everybody stared at her, and she was at her wits' end. Then she heard a"
"man's voice outside saying: ""Haven't you watered Blakka yet?"" That was"
_his_ preoccupation. So she was not the center of the universe after
all.
"Then she and her companion had left the house, and set out on their tour."
"The center? Not at all. Day after day they walked across fields, and"
"through valleys, had meals in houses by the way, and water from the"
"brooks. If they met other travelers, they greeted them, or they did not"
"greet them; no one was less a center of attention than they, and no one"
"more. Her companion walked in vacant thoughtlessness, whistling as he"
went.
At one place they stopped for food.
"""Will you pay for mine for the time being?"" he said."
"She hesitated and then said briefly that she could not pay ""for the time"
"being"" all the way."
"""Of course not, by no means,"" said he. ""Just for the moment. Perhaps we"
"can get a loan further down the valley."""
friend?'
"'Like this, my lord?' I muttered stupidly."
"He nodded. 'Yes, like this,' he repeated. 'I have heard him called a"
"brave man. Coming of his stock, he should be; and when I saw him in"
"Tzerclas' camp he had the air of one. Now he starts at a shadow, is in"
"a trance half his time, and a tremor the other half. What ails him?'"
"I told him how he had been wounded, fighting bravely, and that since"
that he had not been himself.
"Count Hugo rubbed his chin gravely. 'It is a pity,' he said. 'We want"
all--every German arm and every German head. We want you. Man alive!'
"he continued, roused to anger, I suppose, by my dull face, 'do you"
know what is in front of you?'
"'No, my lord,' I said in apathy."
He opened his mouth as if to hurl a volley of words at me. But he
"thought better of it and shut his lips tight. 'Very well,' he said"
grimly. 'Wait three days and you will see.'
"But in truth, I had not to wait three days. Before sunset of the next"
"I began to see, and, downcast as I was, to prick up my ears in wonder."
"Beyond Romhild and between that town and Bamberg, the great road which"
"runs through the valley of the Pegnitz, was such a sight as I had"
never seen. For many miles together a column of dust marked its
"course, and under this went on endless marching. We were but a link in"
"a long chain, dragging slowly southwards. Now it was a herd of"
"oxen that passed along, moving tediously and painfully, driven by"
half-naked cattle-men and guarded by a troop of grimy horse. Now it
"hard work must be strong and healthy, and they should have strong and"
"healthy children....  Do I speak truly?"""
"""Yes,"" assented the listeners."
"""But all this will never happen,"" says Yashka, becoming rather"
"frightened at the prospect held out to him by the teacher.  ""She is"
"healthy, and I cannot have reached the child ...  She is a devil--a"
"hag!"" he shouts angrily.  ""I would ...  She will eat me away as rust"
"eats iron."""
"""I understand, Yakov, that you cannot help beating your wife,"" the"
"teacher's sad and thoughtful voice again breaks in.  ""You have many"
reasons for doing so ... It is your wife's character that causes you to
"beat her so incautiously ...  But your own dark and sad life ..."""
"""You are right!"" shouts Yakov.  ""We live in darkness, like the"
"chimney-sweep when he is in the chimney!"""
"""You are angry with your life, but your wife is patient; the closest"
"relation to you--your wife, and you make her suffer for this, simply"
"because you are stronger than she.  She is always with you, and cannot"
"get away.  Don't you see how absurd you are?"""
"""That is so....  Devil take it!  But what shall I do?  Am I not a man?"""
"""Just so!  You are a man....  I only wish to tell you that if you"
"cannot help beating her, then beat her carefully and always remember"
that you may injure her health or that of the child.  It is not good to
beat pregnant women ... on their belly or on their sides and chests....
"Beat her, say, on the neck ... or else take a rope and beat her on some"
"soft place ..."""
expressed intention of hiding this terrible discovery from him. He had
"been duped, not by her, but by his own romantic folly."
Yet what would his life be without her--or rather without his illusion?
An icy hand gripped his heart. He turned to the glimmering window and
stared at the blank wall.
"Presently a moan struck upon his ear. He wheeled round sharply, and"
distinguished her lying with helpless outspread arms on the couch. Mere
humanity brought him to her side.
"“I am so tired,” she moaned."
"“You must go to bed,” he replied in a gentler voice than hitherto. “We"
"had better part now. To-morrow, if you are well enough to travel, we"
will leave for England.”
"“Let me go alone,” she murmured, “and you go on to Switzerland. Why"
should your holiday be spoiled?”
"“It is my life that is spoiled,” he said ungenerously. “The holiday"
matters very little. It is best to return to England as soon as
possible. Between now and to-morrow morning I shall have time to reflect
upon the situation.”
He struck a match and lit the candles and drew down the blind. The
light revealed her to him so wan and exhausted that he was moved with
compunction.
"“Don’t think me hard, my child,” he said, bending over her. “It is the"
bitterest day of our lives. We must pray to God for strength to bear it.
I shall leave you now. I shall see that you have all you want. Try to
"""I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty.  Keep your head;"
"don't look round, but listen to me.  She's at Bury Street and going to"
"stay there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.""  The stout woman's eyes"
grew round and her mouth opened.  Winton put his hand on the
"perambulator.  ""Steady, now!  Go out as usual with this thing.  It's"
about your time; and wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park.  I'll
come on in my cab and pick you all up.  Don't get flurried; don't take
"anything; do exactly as you usually would. Understand?"""
It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
"receive such an order without question.  Her colour, and the heaving of"
that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
"""Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you.  I'll tell you all"
"about it in the cab."""
"The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:"
"""Yes, sir.  Poor little thing!  What about its night-things?  And Miss"
"Gyp's?"""
"Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes"
"with his fingers at the baby, and said:"
"""Never mind them.  As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get"
"ready and go.  Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your"
"retreat!  Don't fail Gyp now.  Pull yourself together."""
"With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:"
"""Very well, sir; oh dear!"" and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet."
"With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the"
"baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house.  He"
"to glitter with a queer metallic sheen. Then, from each of the three,"
as they passed over the boundary--nothing! All radio communication
"ceased as abruptly as though they'd been stricken dead."""
"He stared at Brand. ""That's all I can tell you, little enough, God"
knows. Something ominous and strange is contained in that red spot:
"but what its nature may be, we cannot even guess. I want you to go"
"there and find out."""
"Brand's determined jaw jutted out, and his lips thinned to a"
purposeful line. He stood to attention.
"""I'll be leaving to-night, sir. Or sooner if you like. I could go this"
"afternoon: in an hour--"""
"""To-night is soon enough,"" said Stone with a smile. ""Now, who do you"
"want to accompany you?"""
Brand thought a moment. On so long a journey as a trip to Jupiter
there was only room in a space ship--what with supplies and all--for
one other man. It behooved him to pick his companion carefully.
"""I'd like Dex Harlow,"" he said at last. ""He's been to Jupiter before,"
"working with me in plotting the northern hemisphere. He's a good man."""
"""He is,"" agreed Stone, nodding approval of Brand's choice. ""I'll have"
"him report to you at once."""
"He rose and held out his hand. ""I'm relying on you, Captain Bowen,"" he"
"said. ""I won't give any direct orders: use your own discretion. But I"
would advise you not to try to land in the red area. Simply fly low
"over it, and see what you can discern from the air. Good-by, and good"
"'I do not know,' my lady answered, and told him shortly of our flight,"
and how we had lain two days and a night in the osier-bed.
"'It was a good thought,' he said. 'But I fear that you are half"
"famished.' And he called for food and wine, and served my lady with"
"his own hands, while he saw that we did not go without. 'Campaigner's"
"fare,' he said. 'But you come of a fighting stock, Countess, and can"
put up with it.'
"'Shame on me if I could not,' she answered."
"There was a quaver in her voice, which showed how the rencontre moved"
"her, how full her heart was of unspoken gratitude."
"'When you have finished, we will get to horse,' he said. 'I must take"
"you with me to Nuremberg, for I am not strong enough to detach a"
"party. But this evening we will make a long halt at Hesel, and secure"
you a good night's rest.'
"'I am sorry to be so burdensome,' my lady said timidly."
"He shrugged his shoulders without compliment, but I did not hear what"
he answered. For I could bear no more. Marie seemed so forgotten in
"this crowd, so much a thing of the past, that my gorge rose. No word"
"of her, no thought of her, no talk of a search party! I pictured her"
"forlorn, helpless little figure, her pale, uncomplaining face--I and"
no one else; and I had to go away into the bushes to hide myself. She
"was forgotten already. She had done all for them, I said to myself,"
and they forgot her.
"Then, in the thicket screened from the party, I had a thought--to go"
"back and look for her, myself. Now my lady was safe, there was nothing"
with more flowers.
'Ha!' I said foolishly. 'What is it?'
"'My lady sent me to you,' she answered."
"'Yes,' I asked eagerly. 'Does she want me?'"
"But Marie hung her head, and played with the flowers. 'I don't think"
"so,' she whispered. 'She only sent me to you.'"
Then I understood. The Waldgrave had gone to the farther end. Steve
and the men were tending the horses half a dozen paces beyond the
"screen of willow-leaves. We were alone. A rat plashed into the water,"
"and drove Marie nearer to me; and she laid her head on my shoulder,"
"and I whispered in her ear, till the lashes sank down over her eyes"
"and her lips trembled. If I had loved her from the first, what was the"
"length and height and breadth of my love now, when I had seen her in"
"darkness and peril, sunshine and storm, strong when others failed,"
"brave when others flinched, always helpful, ready, tireless! And she"
"so small! So frail, I almost feared to press her to me; so pale, the"
blood that leapt to her cheeks at my touch seemed a mere reflection of
the sunlight.
I told her how Steve had made the guards at the prison drunk with wine
bought with her dowry; how the horses he had purchased and taken out
of the camp by twos and threes had been paid for from the same source;
"and how many ducats had gone for meats and messes to keep the life,"
"that still ran sluggishly, in the Waldgrave's veins. She listened and"
lay still.
"'So you have no dowry now, little one,' I said, when I had told her"
"""Sidney Romley, you're _crazy_!"" cried Aunt Achsa, in a quavering"
"voice. ""Go away! How _can_ he go away when we ain't even the money to"
"go 'sfar as Orleans. And he ain't plannin' to go on anyone's _charity_!"""
"""Oh, I don't mean he's going away _soon_! I shouldn't have told anyway"
for Lav told me as a secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he'll tell you sometime
"himself."""
"When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved voice."
"""It's what I didn't want him to ever take into his head. Goin' off"
"somewhere--alone. For I'm too old to go with him and he'll need me!"""
"""Oh I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it would make you unhappy."
"He won't go for a long time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he'll come"
"back real often."""
Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought she had consoled her.
But Aunt Achsa was facing in her own way this at which Sidney had
"hinted, drawing for it from that courage of hers that had not yet been"
"exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender some day to go away she'd"
"send him away with a smile even though the heart that had taken him, a"
"wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with loneliness. Besides,"
even if Lavender went away she could go on praying to the Lord to keep
"him ""happy""--no distance could keep her from doing that!"
"""It's like as not his plans in his head that's makin' him act so quiet"
like and short-spoken. And last night he didn't sleep in his bed at
"all!"""
"""Why, Aunt Achsa, where _was_ he?"" gasped Sidney, really startled."
a nice room. It ain’t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in
"it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute."
The water’s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three
months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B’retta Sprowls—you may
"have heard of her—Oh, that was just the stage names—right there over"
"the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is"
"here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It’s a room everybody"
likes. It never stays idle long.”
“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man.
“They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with
"the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people"
"never stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they"
goes.”
"He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he"
"said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The"
"room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the"
"housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question"
that he carried at the end of his tongue.
“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a
"one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely."
"A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and"
a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”
"“No, I don’t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change"
"as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don’t call"
that one to mind.”
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the
won your love by a trick. I had to show you the lowest and worst part
"of myself before the best in me could grow--the best in me, which is"
"yours."""
"""You are raving!"""
"""I am not raving. You must see I am not. Look at me. I am calmer than"
"you, though I face certain death. I knew when I came here that the"
"chances were I should be killed before I even saw you, but I had to"
"risk that. I had to win your trust back somehow, honestly and fairly."
"I can not live without your trust."""
"""Beatrice!"" The name escaped him almost without his knowledge. He saw"
tears spring to her eyes.
"""It is true. Your love and your trust have become my life. Then I was"
unworthy of both. I tried to make myself worthy. I did what I could. I
told you the truth--I threw away the only thing that mattered to me. I
"could not hold your love any longer by a lie--I loved you too much!"""
"For that moment the passionate energy of her words, the sincerity and"
"eloquence of her glance, swept back every thought of suspicion. He"
"stood stupefied, almost overwhelmed. Mechanically his lips formed"
themselves to a few broken sentences.
"""You can not know what you are saying. You are beside yourself. Once,"
"in my ignorance, I believed it possible, but now I know that it could"
"never be. Your race despises mine--"""
"""I do not care what you are nor to whom you belong!"" she broke in,"
"exulting. ""You are the man who taught me to believe that there is"
"something in this world that is good, that is worthy of veneration;"
Slyne silenced him with a contemptuous gesture.
"""Whatever you do will make no difference to anyone in the wide world but"
"yourself,"" said Slyne. ""If you do what you're told you'll get a great"
deal more than you deserve out of it. If you don't--D'ye think I'd have
"taken you into the team if I didn't know how to drive you!"" he asked,"
"his eyes beginning to blaze. ""Why, my good fellow, if you refuse, if"
"you don't travel up to your collar, if you so much as shy at anything"
you see or hear--I won't even hurt you; I'll just hand you over to the
police.
"""So make up your mind now, quick!"""
"""You've nothing against me,"" quavered the lawyer."
"""No, I've nothing--not very much, at least, yet,"" Slyne agreed, knotting"
"his tie neatly before the glass. ""But--that may be because you haven't"
"embezzled any of my money--yet."" He had most opportunely recalled what"
the detective Dubois had told him about his new friend.
Mr. Jobling's face was almost green. He got up with an evident effort.
"""I was only joking,"" he declared with a most ghastly grin. ""I'll be"
"quite satisfied with ten per cent. of the accumulated income--in fact,"
"we'll call it a couple of hundred thousand pounds, if you like."""
"""All right,"" Slyne agreed imperturbably. ""Make it that amount if you'd"
rather. How long will it take you to get the papers drawn out? It's
"nearly one o'clock. And--you won't be safe till they're signed."""
"""An hour,"" said Mr. Jobling. ""I'm a quick writer."""
But after a little it came to him that the yellow gleam did not seem
"any closer; in fact, it grew fainter; he knew then, with a moment's"
"panic, that the tide and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his"
"frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did not come from the"
salt water.
There was only one thing he could do. Turn his back on the friendly
light and strike out in the direction of the beach. It would be
"further, but the cross currents of the tide would not impede his"
progress so much.
"For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly, changing his strokes, even"
"swimming on his back. But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a"
sharp pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain grew sharper
and caught at him like a horrible vise. Once he yielded to it and sank
"down, down into the black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he"
"struck out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of direction."
"""Oh, God! Oh, God!"" he shouted in his heart. His Aunt Achsa's God,"
whose All-embracing Love he had questioned because that God had made
"him crooked, must help him now! ""I _got_ to get help!"" God _must_ hear"
him.
A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again with a quivering breath.
But now his feet touched sand. With new strength he plunged ahead.
Again he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes. The dreadful
pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now he saw moving lights. He was near
the beach! With a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
"water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard voices nearby in"
the darkness.
"striking. Almost opposite us in a beetling archway, the bowed head and"
shoulders of a man stood up above the common level. There was a little
"space round him, whence men held back; and the red glow of the"
smouldering links which the executioners had cast on the ground at his
"feet, shone upwards on his swollen lips and starting eyeballs. As I"
"looked, the body seemed to writhe in its bonds; but it was only the"
wind swayed it. I went in shuddering.
"On the stairs I met Count Hugo coming down, and knew the moment I saw"
"him that there was something wrong. He stopped me, his eyes full of"
wrath.
"'My man,' he said sternly, 'I thought that you were to be trusted!"
Where have you been? What have you been doing? _Donner!_ Is your lady
to be left at dark with no one to man this door?'
"Conscience-stricken, I muttered that I hoped nothing had gone amiss."
"'No, but something easily might!' he answered grimly. 'When I came"
here I found three as ugly looking rogues whispering and peering in
"your doorway as man could wish to see! Yes, Master Martin, and if I"
"had not ridden up at that moment I will not answer for it, that they"
would not have been in! It is a pity a few more knaves are not where
"that one is,' he continued sourly, pointing through the open door. 'We"
could spare them. But do you see and have more care for the future.
"Or, mein Gott, I will take other measures, my friend!'"
So it had been a ruse after all! I went up sick at heart.
"""It's too bad I've got somebody in the best room,"" said Eilert. ""They're"
"gentlefolk from the city. They came down here through Stordalen, and they"
had to walk because the cars have stopped for the season. They've been in
"my house for quite some days, and I think they'll be staying on a while"
"yet. I think they're out now, but of course it means I can't let you have"
"my best room."""
"I looked up, and saw a face in the window. A shiver ran through me--no, of"
"course not a shiver, far from it, but certainly this was a fresh surprise."
"What a coincidence! As we were about to enter the door, there was the"
"actor, too--standing there looking at me: the actor from the Tore Peak"
"resort. It was his knees, his coat, and his stick. So I was right--I"
"_had_ recognized her face at an upper window. Yes, indeed, the world"
is small.
The actor and I greeted each other and began to talk. How nice to see me
"again! And how was Paul, the good fellow--still soaking himself in liquor,"
he supposed? Funny effect it has sometimes; Paul seemed to think the whole
"inn was an aquarium and we visitors the goldfish! ""Ha, ha, ha, goldfish; I"
"wish we were, I must say!--Well, Eilert, are we getting some fresh haddock"
"for supper? Good!--Really, we like it here very much; we've already been"
"here several days; we want to stay and get a good rest."""
"As we stood there, a rather stout girl came down from the loft and"
addressed the actor:
"""The missis wants you to come right upstairs."""
"""Oh? Very well, at once.... Well, see you later. You'll be stopping here,"
"too, I expect?"""
He hurried up the stairs.
He went back into the drawing-room.  There they were--just passing the
"side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning."
"He stood at the window, waiting.  If only that fellow did not come in!"
Through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down
the dining-room.  What a long time a minute was!  Three had gone when he
"heard the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the"
"front door.  What was he after, standing there as if listening?  And"
"suddenly he heard him sigh.  It was just such a sound as many times, in"
"the long-past days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for"
"footsteps, in parched and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really"
"love--almost as he had loved?  And in revolt at spying on him like this,"
he advanced and said:
"""Well, I won't wait any longer."""
Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone.  And Winton
thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
"""Good-bye!"" he said; but the words: ""Give my love to Gyp,"" perished on"
their way up to his lips.
"""Good-bye!"" Fiorsen echoed.  And Winton went out under the trellis,"
conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning.  His
"mission had succeeded, but he felt no elation.  Round the corner, he"
"picked up his convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi,"
"journeyed on at speed.  He had said he would explain in the cab, but the"
only remark he made was:
"""You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow."""
"And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years"
"we damned well need to know the inside story."""
"""Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask."" He winked. ""And if she's"
"the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm her up a little."
"Get her to drop her . . . guard."""
"""If you succeed in that, _moi droog_,"" he said as his heavy eyebrows"
"lifted with a sly grin, ""you'll be the envy of the facility. You've got"
"to see her."""
"""I can't wait."" He shrugged and moved on toward the Hangar Security"
"station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his A-level"
"priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made"
"a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly"
"well, before saluting and authorizing entry."
"That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly have all"
"this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about it,"
the big _nachalnik_ is on the scene.
Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff see the expression on
his face when the truth comes out. That's the real history we're about
to make here.
"As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had never"
"seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a"
"lot of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this."
"Still, he always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just"
more fancy iron. What really counted was the balls of the pilot holding
the flight stick.
"That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and gazing up. He"
For him also there seemed no other escape. He pointed to the revolver.
"""For whom is that?"" he asked."
"""I do not know--but I will make them kill me."""
"""Why do you not shoot me, then?"" he demanded, between despair and"
"bitterness. ""That would save you all. If I fell, they would turn and"
fly. They think I am Vishnu. Haven't you thought of that? I am in your
power. Why don't you make yourself the benefactress of your country?
"Why don't you shoot her enemy?"""
"She made no answer, but her eyes met his steadily and calmly. He"
"turned away, groaning. In vain he fought against it, in vain stung"
himself to action by the memory of all that she had done to him. His
love remained triumphant. In that supreme moment his faith burst
"through the darkness, and again he believed in her, believed in her"
"against reason, against the world, against the ineffaceable past, and"
against himself. And it was too late. He no longer stood alone. His
word was given.
"""Have pity on me!"" he said, once more facing her. ""Let me save you!"""
"""I should despise myself, and you would despise me--even more than you"
do now. I can not do less than share the fate of those whose lives my
"folly has jeopardized."""
"""At least go back to them--do not stay here. Beatrice, for God's"
"sake!--I can not turn back. You have made me suffer enough--."" He"
"stood before her now as an incoherent pleader, and her heart burned"
with an exultation in which the thought of life and death played no
part. She knew that he still loved her. It seemed for the moment all
pillowed on her arm. Her hair spread as in a dusky halo beneath it.
Her bosom moved with the rhythmic calm of dreamless sleep. Her lips
were parted in a smile. One hand was hid in the dark folds of her
robe.
"Francesco knelt with upturned face, his eyes shut to the sky. He"
seemed like one faint with pain; his lips moved as in prayer. A
hundred inarticulate pleadings surged heavenward from his heart.
Again he bent over her and watched the pure girlish face as she slept.
A strange calm fell for a time upon him; his eyes never wavered from
the white arm and the glimmering hair. Vast awe held him in thrall. He
"was as one who broods tearless and amazed over the dead, calm face of"
one beloved above all on earth.
"Hours passed and Francesco found no sustenance, save in prayer. The"
unuttered yearnings of a world seemed molten in his soul. The moon
waned. The stars grew dim. Strange sounds stirred in the forest-deeps;
the mysterious breathing of a thousand trees. Life ebbed and flowed
with the sigh of a moon-stupored sea. Visions blazed in the night-sky
and faded away.
Hours passed. Neither sleeper nor watcher stirred. The night grew
faint. The water flickered in the mere. The very stars seemed to gaze
upon the destinies of two wearied souls.
Far and faint came the quaver of a bird's note. Gray and mysterious
stood the forest spires. Light! Light at last! Spears of amber darting
in the east. A shudder seemed to shake the universe. The great vault
kindled. The sky grew luminous with gold.
It was the dawn.
"""The depth ... seventy-three feet."""
"""What?  Have you guessed, you shaved ugly face?"""
"""Of course, Aristid Fomich!  If you have eyes you can see a thing or"
"two,"" shouted Vaviloff, joyfully."
"A few minutes afterwards they sat side by side in Vaviloff's parlour,"
and the Captain was engaged in drinking large quantities of beer.
"""And so all the walls of the factory stand on your ground,"" said he to"
"the eating-house keeper.  ""Now, mind you show no mercy! The teacher"
"will be here presently, and we will get him to draw up a petition to"
the court.  As to the amount of the damages you will name a very
"moderate sum in order not to waste money in deed stamps, but we will"
"ask to have the factory knocked down.  This, you see, donkey, is the"
result of trespassing on other people's property.  It is a splendid
"piece of luck for you. We will force him to have the place smashed, and"
I can tell you it will be an expensive job for him.  Off with you to
the court.  Bring pressure to bear on Judas.  We will calculate how
much it will take to break the factory down to its very foundations.
"We will make an estimate of it all, counting the time it will take too,"
"and we will make honest Judas pay two thousand roubles besides."""
"""He will never give it!"" cried Vaviloff, but his eyes shone with a"
greedy light.
"""You lie!  He will give it ...  Use your brains... What else can he do?"
"But look here, Egorka, mind you don't go in for doing it on the cheap."
They are sure to try to buy you off.  Don't sell yourself cheap.  They
"will probably use threats, but rely upon us..."""
my rifle and hopped towards the dressing-station. I think it was the
happiest moment in my life. I lost the sensation of weariness for the
time being. But my foot began to hurt very badly and I got someone to
help me along. My wound was dressed. I got on to a stretcher and I
didn't know anything more until I was taken out of the motor ambulance
"here at the C.C.S. Anyhow, I'm all right now and I'm going to try and"
"get across to Blighty and swing the lead as long as I can."""
There was silence for a while. It had grown dark outside. But the call
from the theatre sounded again. Gradually the waiting-room emptied
itself until at last there were only two men left sitting in front of
the fire. They both seemed depressed and gloomy. Then one of them broke
the silence and said:
"""We was goin' over when a 'eavy one burst. I didn't 'alf cop a packet in"
"me shoulder. It's the third time too, an' I've got the wind up about"
"goin' up the line agin when I'm out o' dock. The third time's yer last,"
"yer know. Fritz'll send one over with me number on it, that's a bloody"
"cert!"""
"""If yer number's up it's up,"" said the other, who had a big patch over"
"his right ear. ""If yer've got ter die yer've got ter die, an' it's no"
"use worryin' about it."""
Their turn came before long and I helped each one to get on to a table.
Then I went over to the Prep. to see if any more walking wounded had
"arrived, but there were none at all."
I stood out in the open for a few minutes in order to breathe the fresh
air. There was a roar and rumble of distant drum-fire. The trees behind
the C.C.S. stood out blackly against the pallid flashes that lit up the
entire horizon.
"""What! Is that you, Mr. Dawson? Yes, Copplestone is here. The"
"_Antigone_? What about her? She is a sister ship of the _Antinous_,"
"and was in with damage to her forefoot, which had been ripped up when"
"she ran down that big German submarine north of the Orkneys--Yes, I"
know; she was due to go out some time to-day. What do you say? Wires
"cut? Whose wires have been cut? The _Antigone's?_ Oh, the devil! Yes,"
we will both come down to your office this afternoon. Whenever you
"like."""
"Cary hung up the receiver and glared at me. ""It has happened again,"""
"he groaned. ""The _Antigone_ this time. She has been in dry dock for"
the past fortnight and was floated out yesterday. Her full complement
joined her last night. Dawson says that he was called up at
eight-o'clock by the news that her gun-wires have been cut exactly
like those of the _Antinous_ and in the same incomprehensible way. He
"seems, curiously enough, to be quite cheerful about it."""
"""He has had a few hours sleep. And, besides, he sees that this second"
"case, so exactly like the first, makes the solution of his problem"
"very much more easy. I am glad that he is cheerful, for I feel"
exuberantly happy myself. I was kept awake half the night by a
persistent notion which seemed the more idiotic the more I thought all
"round it. But now--now, there may be something in it."""
"""What is your idea? Tell me quick."""
"""No, thank you, Dr. Watson. We amateur masters of intuition don't work"
our thrilling effects in that way. We keep our notions to ourselves
"until they turn out to be right, and then we declare that we saw"
"through the problem from the first. When we have been wrong, we say"
"nothing. So you observe, Cary, that whatever happens our reputations"
"""No,"" he answered breathlessly.  ""But we must not lose a single"
"instant.""  And I saw that with a lancet he had made an incision in her"
"delicate wrist, and there was blood there.  ""She is in a state of"
"catalepsy, and we must do all in our power to bring her round."""
"""But do you think you can?""  I cried."
"""I hope so."""
"""Do your best, Dick,"" I implored.  ""Save her, for my sake."""
"""Rely upon me,"" he answered calmly, adding: ""Run along to Number 18 in"
the boulevard--the corner house on the right--and bring Doctor Trepard
"at once.  He lives au troisieme.  Tell him that I sent you, and that the"
"matter is one of life or death.""  He scribbled some words on a card,"
"and, giving it me, added: ""Tell him to bring this.  Meanwhile, I will"
"commence artificial respiration.  Go!"""
"""But do you think she will really recover?""  I demanded."
"""I can't tell.  We have already lost so much time.  I had no idea of the"
truth.  It has surprised me just as it has surprised you.  This moment
"is not one for words, but for actions.  Don't lose an instant."""
"Thus urged, I snatched up my hat and tore along the boulevard like a"
"madman.  Without difficulty I found Trepard's appartement, and on being"
"admitted found him a grave-faced, rather stout old Frenchman, who, on"
the instant I mentioned Dick's name and gave him the card with the words
"upon it, naming some drugs he required, went into an adjoining room, and"
"fetched a phial of tiny red pillules, which he held up to the light."
"Then he put on his hat, and descended with me to the street.  A fiacre"
"was passing, which we took, and five minutes later we were standing"
"""I can not trust you,"" he said again, ""nor can I turn back. But there"
is one thing from the past which can not be changed. I love you. It
seems that must remain through all my life. And because of that love I
"must save you from the death that awaits your countrymen."" He smiled"
"in faint self-contempt. ""It is not for your sake that I shall save"
"you; it is because I am too great a coward, and can not face the"
"thought that anything so horrible should come near you."" He turned to"
two native soldiers behind him and gave an order. When he faced
Beatrice again he saw that she held a revolver in her hand.
"""You do not understand,"" she said. ""You say you mean to save me, but"
"that is not in your power. It is in your power to save us all, but not"
"one alone. I know what my people have resolved to do. There are weak,"
"frightened women among them, but not one of them will fall into your"
"hands alive. Whatever happens, I shall share their fate."""
"Though her tone was quiet and free from all bravado, he knew that she"
"was not boasting. He knew, too, that she was desperate."
"""You can not force me to kill you,"" he said sternly."
"""I think it possible,"" she answered. She was breathing quickly, and"
"her eyes were bright with a reckless, feverish excitement. But the"
hand that held the revolver pointed at the men behind him was
steady--steadier than his own.
Nehal Singh motioned back the two natives who had advanced at his
order.
"""You play a dangerous game,"" he said, ""and, as before, your strength"
lies in my weakness--in my folly. But this time you can not win. My
and the framed photographs on the walls and the array of grease paints
on the dressing-table. John walked up and down the narrow space in great
perplexity of mind. Herold was right. He could not introduce Unity Blake
"into lodgings, saying that he had adopted her. Landladies would not"
"stand it. Even if they would, what in the world could he do with her?"
Could he move into a house or a flat and persuade a registry-office
to provide him with a paragon of a housekeeper? That would be more
"practicable. But, even then, what did he know of the training, moral and"
"spiritual, necessary for a girl of fifteen? He was not going to employ"
her as a servant. On that he was decided. What sort of a position she
"should have he did not know; but her floor-scrubbing, dish-scraping days"
were over. She should have ease of life and loving care--his own phrase
stuck in his head--especially loving care; and he was the only person in
the world who could see that she got it. She must live under his roof.
That was indisputable. But how? In lodgings or a flat? He went angrily
round and round the vicious circle.
"When Herold returned, he dragged him round and round, too, until Perkins"
appeared to help him to change for the third act. Then John had to stop.
He clapped on his hat. He must go and work.
“And you have n't a single suggestion to make?” he asked.
"“I have one,” said Herold, fastening his shirt-studs while Perkins was"
buttoning his boots. “But it's so commonplace and unromantic that you 'd
wreck the dressing-room if I made it.”
"“Well, what is it?” He stood, his hand on the door-knob."
"“You 've got a maiden aunt somewhere, have n't you?”"
"“Oh, don't talk rot!” said John. “I'm dead serious.”"
Once again I am at an age when I walk in the moonlight. Thirty years ago I
"walked in the moonlight, too, walked on crackling, snowy roads, on bare,"
"frozen ground, round unlocked barns, on the hunt for love. How well I"
remember it! But it is no longer the same moonlight. I could even read by
it the letter she gave me. But there are no such letters any more.
"Everything is changed. The tale is told, and tonight I walk abroad on an"
"errand of the head, not of the heart: I shall go across to the trading"
center and dispatch a knapsack by the steamer; after that I shall wander
"on. And that requires nothing but a little ordinary training in walking,"
"and the light of the moon to see by. But in those old days, those young"
"days, we studied the almanac in the autumn to find out if there would be a"
"moon on Twelfth Night, for we could use it then."
Everything is changed; I am changed. The tale lies within the teller.
They say that old age has other pleasures which youth has not: deeper
"pleasures, more lasting pleasures. That is a lie. Yes, you have read"
"right: that is a lie. Only old age itself says this, in a self-interest"
that flaunts its very rags. The old man has forgotten when he stood on the
"summit, forgotten his own self, his own _alias_, red and white,"
"blowing a golden horn. Now he stands no longer--no, he sits--it is less of"
"a strain to sit. But now there comes to him, slow and halting, fat and"
"stupid, the honor of old age. What can a sitting man do with honor? A man"
on his feet can use it; to a sitting man it is only a possession. But
"honor is meant to be used, not to be sat with."
Let sitting men wear warm stockings.

"""Oh, no, we shan't,"" I remarked calmly, for I had moved to a position"
"of tactical advantage on the Marine's port beam. ""We will have the"
"story here, if you don't mind, Dawson."""
"He stamped pettishly on the floor, whipped off his cap, and spun it"
"across the room. ""Confound you, Mr. Copplestone!"" he growled. ""How"
"the--how the--do you do it?"" He could not think of an expletive mild"
"enough for Mrs. Cary's ears. ""There's something about me that I can't"
"hide. What is it? If you don't tell, I will get you on the Regulation"
compelling all British subjects to answer questions addressed to them
"by a competent naval or military authority."""
"""You don't happen to be either, Dawson,"" said I unkindly. ""And,"
"beside, there was never yet a law made which could compel a man to"
"speak or a woman to hold her tongue. Some day perhaps, if you are"
"good, I will show you how the trick is done. But not yet. I want to"
have something to bargain with when you cast me into jail. Out with
"the story; we are impatient. If I mistake not, you come to us Dawson"
"triumphant. You haven't the air of a broken man."""
"""I have been successful,"" he answered gravely, ""but I am a long, long"
"way from feeling triumphant. No, thank you, Mrs. Cary, I have had my"
"breakfast, but if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Many"
"thanks."""
"Dawson sat down, and Cary moved about inspecting him from every angle."
"""No,"" declared he at last, ""I cannot see the smallest resemblance, not"
the smallest. You were thin; now you are distinctly plump. Your hair
was nearly white. Your cheeks had fallen in as if your back teeth were
"missing. Your lower lip stuck out."" Dawson smiled, highly gratified."
"""I took in all my people at the office this morning,"" he said. ""They"
"have left him long ago,' she said, 'but I tried to save him. Thank God"
"we have no children,' That seemed to be her most insistent thought,"
for she repeated it over and over again. 'Thank God that we have no
"children.'"""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" said I, deeply moved."
Long ago the wife had come to me and pleaded for her husband. She had
"shed no tear; she had admitted the justice, the necessity, of my"
"sentence. ""Can you not give him another chance?"" she had asked. ""No,"""
"I had answered sadly. ""He has exhausted all the chances."" When she had"
"risen to go and I had pressed her hand, she had said, still dry-eyed,"
"""You are right, sir, it is no use, no use at all. Thank God that we"
"have no children."""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" I repeated."
"He astonished me by the suddenness of his explosion. ""Damn,"" roared"
"he--""damn and blast! Do you think that I am a brute. Gentle! It was as"
"much as I could do not to kiss the woman, as your little daughter"
"kissed me, and to promise that I would get her husband off somehow."
"But I should not be a friend to her if I tried to save that man."""
"So Dawson had soft spots in his armour of callousness, and little"
Jane's instinct was far surer than mine. She had taken to him at
"sight. When I tried to get from her why, why he had so marked an"
"attraction for her, her replies baffled me more than the central fact."
"""I love Colonel Dawson. He is a nice man. He has a little girl like"
me. Her name is Clara. Her birthday is next month. I shall save up my
pocket money and send Clara a present. I like Colonel Dawson better
"even than dear Bailey."" I tore my hair, for ""Bailey"" is a wholly"
"imaginary friend of little Jane, whom I invented one evening at her"
bedside and who has grown gradually into a personage of clearly
"assuring myself that there was no other body near, and peered into her"
"face, I saw that it was seamed and wrinkled. She was barefoot, and her"
clothes were foul and mean. She had the reek of one who slept in
ditches and washed seldom. Her toothless gums grinned at me. She was a
horrible mockery of all that men love in women.
"When I had marked so much, I stood up again, my head reeling. Where"
was the man I had seen scouting up and down? Where was Marie? For a
"moment the wild idea that she had become this thing, that death or"
"magic had transformed the fair young girl into this toothless hag, was"
"not too wild for me. An owl hooted in the distance, and I started and"
shivered and stood looking round me fearfully. Such things were; and
"Marie was gone. In her place this woman, grim and dead and unsightly,"
lay at my feet. What was I to think?
"I got no answer. I raised my voice and called, trembling, on Marie. I"
"ran to one side of the road and the other and called, and still got no"
"answer. I climbed the mound on which the ash-tree stood, and sent my"
voice thrilling through the darkness of the bottom. But only the owl
"answered. Then, knowing nothing else I could do, I went down wringing"
"my hands, and found my lady standing over the body in the road. She"
had come back with Steve and the others.
"I had to listen to their amazement, and a hundred guesses and fancies,"
"which, God help me! had nothing certain in them, and gave me no help."
"The men searched both sides of the road, and beat the moor for a"
"distance, and tried to track the horse--for that was missing too, and"
there lay my only hope--but to no purpose. At last my lady came to me
and said sorrowfully that nothing more could be done.
'In the morning!' I cried jealously.
"themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not"
mount.  Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp.  She could almost hear
"him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young"
"female, wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter?  Delicate-that's"
what it is!'  Then the words burst hoarsely from him.
"""This is an unpleasant business, ma'am.  I don't know what to say. Reelly"
"I don't.  It's awkward; it's very awkward."""
Gyp said quietly:
"""Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her"
"just now."""
"Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe.  ""Pardon me, ma'am,"" he"
"spluttered, ""but I must call your husband a scoundrel.  I'm sorry to be"
"impolite, but I must do it.  If I had 'im 'ere, I don't know that I"
"should be able to control myself--I don't indeed.""  Gyp made a movement"
"of her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he"
"went on in a stream of husky utterance: ""It's a delicate thing before a"
"lady, and she the injured party; but one has feelings.  From the first I"
said this dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more
sense than an egg.  Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it!
"Career, indeed! Pretty career!  Daughter of mine!  I tell you, ma'am, I'm"
angry; there's no other word for it--I'm angry.  If that scoundrel comes
"within reach of me, I shall mark 'im--I'm not a young man, but I shall"
"mark 'im.  An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my"
"daughter should be'ave like that!  Well, it's made a difference to me."
An' now I suppose her name'll be dragged in the mud.  I tell you frankly
"I 'oped you wouldn't hear of it, because after all the girl's got her"
punishment.  And this divorce-court--it's not nice--it's a horrible thing
"for respectable people.  And, mind you, I won't see my girl married to"
"being like a chest of drawers, or pigeon holes to hold the dead. Tufts"
of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.
"In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The"
"dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of"
"graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,"
with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly
"strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,"
"that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the"
"south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out"
by the dryness.
"""I like it! I like it!"" cries the q-b."
"""But could you live here?"" She would like to say yes, but daren't."
We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag
arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but
"peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a"
"sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white"
cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and
magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the
fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it
cost? Forty-five francs.
There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and
"go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of"
"the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called"
Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.
"Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,"
"pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the"
"platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,"
aside o' me an' smothers me with earth. Then another'n bursts an' I
"'ears a man 'oller out--krikey, 'e didn't 'alf scream. I gets up and"
"another'n bursts, so I flops down agin, but it didn't come so near that"
time. I waits a bit an' then I gets up an' goes to see what they done. I
"couldn't see nothin' at first, but I sees some fellers runnin' about wi'"
"lights. There was a noise in one o' the wards, so I goes in. A bomb must"
'a' burst on the roof--there was a big 'ole in the canvas. The bed
"underneath was all twisted an' torn, but there wasn't nobody in it."
"There was some wounded lyin' in beds at the fur end of the ward, an' one"
of 'em was cryin' somethin' chronic. Then someone brings a light an' I
sees an orderly lyin' by the side o' the bed with a big 'ole in 'is face
an' the blood pourin' out. I goes roun' to the other side--gorblimy--an'
there I sees the Sister lyin' on the floor with 'er 'ead blown clean
"off--I dunno where it was blown to, I couldn't see it nowhere. Krikey,"
it wasn't 'alf a sight to see 'er body without a 'ead lyin' in a pool o'
"blood. It made me feel sick, so I ran orf an' came 'ere."""
Private Trotter was trembling in every limb. He was the pluckiest man I
ever knew and capable of any piece of foolhardy daring. But this time he
was near a nervous breakdown.
"We went to bed full of anxiety. For a long while we lay awake, straining"
our ears to catch the sound of firing or the drone of German propellers.
"But no sound broke the stillness of the night, and one by one we dropped"
off to sleep.
The next morning was clear and sunny. The sky remained blue all day. Not
"a cloud could be seen. ""Our turn next""--that was the thought in"
everybody's mind.
The evening was starlit once again. As we lay on the floor of the
"marquee, wrapped up in our blankets, we heard the sound of bombing and"
"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the"
"handsome apples up there on the tree! If you were really kind, you would"
"fetch me down a couple of them!"" The youth was not lazy, and climbed up."
"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took."
And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. She at once
"put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was"
that minute.
"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down"
the tree. He began to cry and did not know what to do. And as he was
"sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down. No sooner"
"had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he"
"looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. ""Well, now it can do me no"
"more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples. But suddenly"
"the horns had disappeared, and he was as before. ""Good enough!"" said the"
"youth. And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to"
search for the king's daughter.
"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; but it"
"was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer."
"But one day he got there after all. It was a Sunday, and he found out"
that the king's daughter was at church. Then he sat himself down with
"his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler."
"""Apples of Damascus! Apples of Damascus!"" he cried. And sure enough, the"
"king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable"
"things the peddler from abroad might have to offer. Yes, he had apples"
"of Damascus. ""What do the apples give one?"" asked the maiden. ""Wisdom"
"and beauty!"" said the peddler, and the maiden bought."
"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of"
horns. And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was
"the slightest; is it not so?  Have you met before, since that evening in"
"the water theatre when I did first present you to each other?"""
"""I have seen her but once between,"" answered Grey, still in the same"
"quiet, stunned fashion; and when they had entered the house, he made"
"excuse to go at once to his room, declining all proffer of refreshment"
or further converse.
"Lord Sandford looked after him with an intent look upon his face, which"
"slowly clouded over, till there was something almost malignant and"
ferocious in his aspect.
"""So it is as I thought.  He has been hit, and hard hit.  Where can he"
"have seen her in the interim?  They would not have been standing thus,"
"talking thus, if some bond had not been established between them.  Yet I"
thought I had kept an eye upon him.  I knew there might be danger.  I
saw it the first moment that they met.  There is something akin in their
natures.  They feel it themselves. Hr-r-r-rr! that must be put a stop
to.  I will have no rival in Geraldine’s heart.  She does not love me
"yet; but she fears me a little, and she thinks of me. That is no bad"
"basis to build upon.  I shall win her yet, if I have a fair field.  But"
"a rival—no, that must not be!  And yet I read somewhat in her eyes"
to-night which had not been there before.  The fiend take all false
"friends!  I must rid myself of this one, and that speedily.  I have"
"liked him; but he shall not stand in my way.  Well, ’tis I have made"
him: I can quickly unmake him.  Let me but think of the way and the
"means.  Grey Dumaresq, you are a pretty fellow and a pleasant comrade;"
but you shall never be suffered to stand in the light of Sandford’s
"hopes and plans and desires.  Look to yourself, my friend; for evil is"
"abroad for you!"""
"""Yes, master, and so I am; and this is the hostelry at Hampstead where I"
have taken up my quarters with the horse; and hither it was that you
"came yestere’en, with Lord Sandford and his friends, to be ready for the"
match to-day.  But beshrew me if I did think yesterday you would be fit
for the saddle to-day!  Is it strange I should mutter and grumble to
"myself when such things happen?"""
"""Nay now, what things, good Dicon?  I pray you tell me,"" spoke Grey, as"
"he drained at one draught the ice-cold water, and drew a long breath of"
"relief. ""I feel like a man waking from a strange and fevered dream; for,"
"in sooth, I know but little of what has been passing these last days."
Some strange madness seems to have possessed me.  I had meant to say
"farewell to Lord Sandford and his world, and seek mine own fortunes in"
some other field.  Yet methinks I have not made the break.  I have
visions of wild orgies and furious gaming—such as I held aloof from
"before.  Dicon, I fear me I have made a desperate fool of myself, and of"
"my fortunes too.  Tell me, what money have I with me now?"""
"""Not much, master.  I took what you had—a matter of some twenty guineas"
perhaps.  I have it safe in a bag.  But surely that is not all.  You had
"won a fortune, you did tell me—"""
"""Ay, and now I have lost it.  I can recollect how the guineas flew, and"
"how the stakes were doubled, and how I lost again and yet again.  I take"
"it I am a ruined man, good Dicon.  These twenty guineas saved from the"
"wreck are all the fortune I possess, and belike it is better so—better"
"so."""
"""Better!"" echoed the dismayed Dick; ""nay, my master.  But you will win"
it back again.  The luck cannot always be against you.  Think how it was
"at the first!"""
"cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the path.  Four little icicles had formed"
"beneath the window of the music-room.  They caught her eye, and, passing"
"round to the side, she broke one off. There must be a fire in there, for"
she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn.
"Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it!  But, suddenly, she stood still."
There was more than a fire in there!  Through the chink in the drawn
curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan.  Something seemed
to spin round in her head.  She turned to rush away.  Then a kind of
"superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately looked in. He and"
Daphne Wing!  His arm was round her neck.  The girl's face riveted her
"eyes.  It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the lips"
"parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to"
"shiver--with cold, with ecstasy?"
Again that something went spinning through Gyp's head.  She raised her
"hand.  For a second it hovered close to the glass.  Then, with a sick"
"feeling, she dropped it and turned away."
Never!  Never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her!
Never!  They were safe from any scene she would make--safe in their nest!
"And blindly, across the frosty grass, through the unlighted drawing-room,"
"she went upstairs to her room, locked the door, and sat down before the"
fire.  Pride raged within her.  She stuffed her handkerchief between her
teeth and lips; she did it unconsciously.  Her eyes felt scorched from
"the fire-flames, but she did not trouble to hold her hand before them."
Suddenly she thought: 'Suppose I HAD loved him?' and laughed.  The
"handkerchief dropped to her lap, and she looked at it with wonder--it was"
"blood-stained.  She drew back in the chair, away from the scorching of"
"the fire, and sat quite still, a smile on her lips. That girl's eyes,"
"like a little adoring dog's--that girl, who had fawned on her so!  She"
"had got her ""distinguished man""!  She sprang up and looked at herself in"
"thorns? If we could gather the flowers and find no thorns, we should not"
"care for them. The more the thorns, the more valuable the blossoms.'"
"So they said, and they gathered the blossoms, and they faded. But the"
thorns did not fade; they were ever there. The more blossoms a man had
"gathered, the more thorns he had to wear, and Time was ever behind him."
"They wanted to rest in the glades, but Time willed that ever they must"
"go forward; no going back, no rest, ever and ever on. So they grew very"
weary.
"'These flowers,' they said at last, 'are always the same. We are tired"
of them; their smell is heavy; they are dead. This forest is full of
thorns only. How shall we escape from it? Ever as we go round and round
"we hate the flowers more, we feel the thorns more acutely. We must"
"escape! We are sick of Time and his whip, our feet are very, very weary,"
"our eyes are dazzled and dim. We, too, would seek the Peace. We laughed"
at those before who went along the rocky path; we did not want peace;
but now it seems to us the most beautiful thing in the world. Will Time
never cease to drive us on and on? Will these lights _never_ cease to
flash to and fro?'
Each man at last will turn to the straight road. He will find out. Every
"man will find out at last that the forest is hateful, that the flowers"
"are deadly, that the thorns are terrible; every man will learn to fear"
Time.
"Then, when the longing for peace has come, he will go to the straight"
way and find it; no man will remain in the forest for ever. He will
"learn. When he is very, very weary, when his feet are full of thorns,"
"and his back scarred with the lashes of Time--great, kindly Time, the"
schoolmaster of the world--he will learn.
"the glass; shuddered, turned her back on herself, and sat down again.  In"
her own house!  Why not here--in this room?  Why not before her eyes?
Not yet a year married! It was almost funny--almost funny!  And she had
her first calm thought: 'I am free.'
"But it did not seem to mean anything, had no value to a spirit so"
bitterly stricken in its pride.  She moved her chair closer to the fire
again.  Why had she not tapped on the window?  To have seen that girl's
face ashy with fright!  To have seen him--caught--caught in the room she
"had made beautiful for him, the room where she had played for him so many"
"hours, the room that was part of the house that she paid for!  How long"
had they used it for their meetings--sneaking in by that door from the
back lane?  Perhaps even before she went away--to bear his child!  And
there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of
"outrage--a spiritual tug-of-war so deep that it was dumb, unconscious--to"
"decide whether her baby would be all hers, or would have slipped away"
"from her heart, and be a thing almost abhorrent."
"She huddled nearer the fire, feeling cold and physically sick.  And"
suddenly the thought came to her: 'If I don't let the servants know I'm
"here, they might go out and see what I saw!'  Had she shut the"
drawing-room window when she returned so blindly?  Perhaps already--! In
"a fever, she rang the bell, and unlocked the door.  The maid came up."
"""Please shut the drawing-room, window, Ellen; and tell Betty I'm afraid I"
got a little chill travelling.  I'm going to bed.  Ask her if she can
"manage with baby.""  And she looked straight into the girl's face.  It"
"wore an expression of concern, even of commiseration, but not that"
fluttered look which must have been there if she had known.
"""Yes, m'm; I'll get you a hot-water bottle, m'm.  Would you like a hot"
"bath and a cup of hot tea at once?"""
"""I do not recognize you when you talk like that!"" she exclaimed."
"""That is surprising, seeing that you have made me what I am,"" he"
"answered. Then he made a quick gesture of apology. ""Forgive me, that"
sounded like a reproach or a complaint. I make neither. That is not my
"purpose."""
"""And yet you have the right,"" she said, drawing a deep breath, ""you"
"have every right, Nehal. It does not matter what the others did to"
you. I know that does not count an atom in comparison to my
"responsibilities. You trusted me as you trusted no one else, and I"
deceived you. So you have the right to hate me as you hate no one
"else. And yet--is it not something, does it not mitigate my fault a"
"little, that I deceived myself far, far more than I ever deceived"
"you?"" He raised his eyebrows. There was mockery in the movement, and"
"she went on, desperately resolute: ""I played at loving you, Nehal. I"
played a comedy with you for my own purposes. And one day it ceased to
be a comedy. I did not know it. I did not know what was driving me to
"tell the truth, and reveal myself to you in the ugliest light I could."
I only knew it was something in me stronger than any other impulse of
"my life. I know what it is now, and you must know, too. Can't you"
"understand? If it had been no more than a comedy, you must have found"
me out--months ago. But you never found me out. It was _I_ who told
"you what I had done and who I was--"""
"""Why did you tell me?"" He took an involuntary step toward her."
Something in his face relaxed beneath the force of an uncontrollable
emotion. He was asking a question which had hammered at the gates of
"his mind day after day and in every waking hour. ""Why?"" he repeated."
"""I have told you--because I had to. I had to speak the truth. I"
couldn't build up my new life on an old lie. You had to know. I had
"This wood was never quite dark, it was so full of these lights that"
flickered aimlessly.
There were men in this wood who wandered to and fro. The wood was full
of them.
They did not know whither they went; they did not know whither they
"wished to go. Only this they knew, that they could never keep still;"
"for the keeper of this wood was Time. He was armed with a keen whip, and"
kept driving them on and on; there was no rest.
"Many of these when they first came loved the wood. The glades, they"
"said, were very beautiful, the flowers very sweet. They wandered down"
"the broad roads into the glades, and tried to lie upon the moss and love"
the flowers; but Time would not let them. Just for a few moments they
"could have peace, and then they must on and on. But they did not care."
"'The forest is full of glades,' they said; 'if we cannot live in one, we"
"can find another.' And so they went on finding others and others, and"
each one pleased them less.
Some few there were who did not go to the glades at all. 'They are very
"beautiful,' they said, 'but these roads that pass through them, whither"
do they lead? Round and round and round again. There is no peace there.
"Time rules in those glades, Time with his whip and goad, and there is no"
"peace. What we want is rest. And those lights,' they said, 'they are"
"wandering lights, like the summer lightning far down in the South,"
moving hither and thither. We care not for such lights. Our light is
firm and clear. What we desire is peace; we do not care to wander for
"ever round this forest, to see for ever those shifting lights.'"
"And so they would not go down the winding roads, but essayed the path"
"upon the cliffs. 'It is narrow,' they said, 'it has no flowers, it is"
"And without so much as turning his head again, Grey Dumaresq walked off,"
"his head held high, neither observing nor returning the many salutes and"
bright arch glances shot at him from the lane of bystanders through
"which he needs must pass, but walking like a man in a dream, and so"
disappearing from view along the white road which led Londonwards.
Round Lord Sandford men were buzzing like bees disturbed.
"""Insolent young jackanapes!""  ""What did he mean?""  ""What was his motive"
"in such an insult?""  ""What will you do, my lord?""  ""Whither has he gone?"
"Whither will he go?""  ""Is it true that he is ruined?""  ""He has lost his"
"horse, at least. None will give him a score of guineas for the beast"
"now.""  ""How did it chance?""  ""Was it an accident?""  ""What meant he by"
"his words?""  All were pouring out these and like questions; but there"
"was none to answer them, till Lord Sandford himself spoke."
"""The fellow’s wits are gone astray,"" he cried in his loud, dominating"
"tones.  ""It is the Dumaresq blood.  Sir Hugh was just such another—mad"
"as a March hare half his time, flinging his gold to the winds, and"
"quarrelling with every man he met.  Like father, like son.  It has been"
coming on for days. I misdoubted me if ever he would ride this race. He
"came and told me he must reform.  That was ever his father’s cry, and he"
"would disappear into the country for a while, and reappear again as gay"
"as ever.  ’Tis the same with the son.  I saw it then, and I strove to"
combat the madness; but ’tis ill dealing with the lunatic.  You see what
we get for our pains!  Tush! let the fellow alone.  I did wrong to
"answer him.  Let him go his own way, and we will think of him no more."""
"And Lord Sandford, with a heavy cloud upon his brow, and a look about"
"the corners of his mouth which warned those about him to say no more,"
"but leave matters as they were, flung away from them, and made his way"
"back alone to the inn, from which he was presently seen to issue forth"
Then I reached my own hut of last winter where I had passed so many lonely
months. I did not enter it.
"Or rather, I did enter it, for I had to spend the night there. But I shall"
"skip this, so for the sake of brevity, I call it not entering. This"
"morning I wrote something playful about Madame, the mouse I left here last"
spring; but tonight I am taking it out again because I am no longer in the
"mood, and because there is no point in it. Perhaps it would have amused"
"you to read it, my friend; but there is no point in amusing you now. I"
must deject you now and make you listen to me; there is not much more to
hear.
"Am I moralizing? I am explaining. No, I am not moralizing; I am"
"explaining. If it is moralizing to see the truth and tell it to you, then"
I am moralizing. Can I help that? Intuitively I see into what is distant;
"you do not, for this is something you cannot learn from your little"
schoolbooks. Do not let this rouse your hatred for me. I shall be merry
"again with you later, when my strings are tuned to merriment. I have no"
power over them. Now they are tuned to a chorale....
*       *       *       *       *
"At dawn, in the bright moonlight, I leave the hut and push on quickly in"
order to reach the village as soon as possible. But I must have started
"too early or walked too fast, for at this rate I shall reach the village"
at high noon. What am I chasing after? Perhaps it is feeling the nearness
"of the sea that drives me forward. And as I stand on the last high ridge,"
"with the glitter and roar of the sea far beneath, a sweetness darts"
"through me like a greeting from another world. ""_Thalatta!_"" I cry;"
and I wipe my eyeglasses tremblingly. The roar from below is sleepless and
"fierce, a tone of jungle passion, a savage litany. I descend the ridge as"
though in a trance and reach the first house.
"flowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and"
"out of the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and I"
(his name was Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be
"arranged—and that began it. Flowers! you wouldn’t believe it, madam,"
the flowers he used to bring me. He’d stop at nothing. It was
"lilies-of-the-valley more than once, and I’m not exaggerating! Well, of"
"course, we were going to be married and live over the shop, and it was"
"all going to be just so, and I was to have the window to arrange...."
"Oh, how I’ve done that window of a Saturday! Not really, of course,"
"madam, just dreaming, as you might say. I’ve done it for"
"Christmas—motto in holly, and all—and I’ve had my Easter lilies with a"
"gorgeous star all daffodils in the middle. I’ve hung—well, that’s"
enough of that. The day came he was to call for me to choose the
furniture. Shall I ever forget it? It was a Tuesday. My lady wasn’t
"quite herself that afternoon. Not that she’d said anything, of course;"
she never does or will. But I knew by the way that she kept wrapping
herself up and asking me if it was cold—and her little nose looked...
pinched. I didn’t like leaving her; I knew I’d be worrying all the
"time. At last I asked her if she’d rather I put it off. “Oh no, Ellen,”"
"she said, “you mustn’t mind about me. You mustn’t disappoint your young"
"man.” And so cheerful, you know, madam, never thinking about herself."
It made me feel worse than ever. I began to wonder... then she dropped
her handkerchief and began to stoop down to pick it up herself—a thing
"she never did. “Whatever are you doing!” I cried, running to stop her."
"“Well,” she said, smiling, you know, madam, “I shall have to begin to"
"practise.” Oh, it was all I could do not to burst out crying. I went"
"over to the dressing-table and made believe to rub up the silver, and I"
"couldn’t keep myself in, and I asked her if she’d rather I... didn’t"
"get married. “No, Ellen,” she said—that was her voice, madam, like I’m"
"giving you—“No, Ellen, not for the _wide world_!” But while she said"
"it, madam—I was looking in her glass; of course, she didn’t know I"
could see her—she put her little hand on her heart just like her dear
"there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you"
"what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind"
"the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock"
"with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell"
"him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him"
"as much as you can carry."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until"
"evening, and he might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not"
reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before
"the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl"
"had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it."
"Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you"
"want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the"
"king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never"
"ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is"
"lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the"
"one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the"
"king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the"
hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was
"packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in"
"the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room,"
"whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to"
"the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said"
"the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood"
"the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that"
"at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was"
"really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver"
"rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must"
"have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I"
"will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's"
"son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is"
"talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about"

Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling and like that.
Uh....
"Well, you see, um--"
"I mean, I hope you can hear me."
Can you hear me okay?

"Uh, ha-ha-ha."

"I don't know what to say, though."
Um--
"Well, let's see."

"See, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and...."
"He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said:"
"No, I better not."
Not tonight.

It's a surprise.
"Good, I like surprises."

"Truly, truly sorry, baby."
Mi sorry.
Alright.
Hey!
"It's okay, man--"
"Thanks, man--"
Yeah--
"So, you just got dipped?"
Is it that obvious?
I've been here seven years myself.
Shite...
"Oh no, I'm heading back to London."
Oh yeah?
Yup.
Mum's got me a fancy lawyer working on my case and everything.
Hm--
"Well, good luck with that, man."
Keep your head up.
Thanks.
"Eat your food, man--"
Huh?
Eat your food.
"Finish that, man."
"Hey, man, what's up with all your tatts?"
Oh--
This is my family back home.
"Two sons, ex-wife."

- She was my wife.
"Oh, Nicole, I don't know what to say..."
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

I think it might be good if you waited a bit.

"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
-This doesn't feel right.
-It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't...
It doesn't mean anything.
-But it feels like it does.
"-Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.

"Buck, come back here!"
"If that's a pack, they'll kill him."
"Buck, come here!"

Seems as though he remembers things up here.
"Buck, come back here!"

"Oh, bless you."

"Oh, thank you."
"Stand aside, Mrs. Fishfinger."
Sorry.
Are you all right?
You almost cut my arm off!
"You always were a clumsy one, Dennis Cooper."
Shame on you!
Get out!
Jesus!
I could get blood poisoning.
Was that sword sterilized?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I'll bind it up.
I'll get bandages.

Sixteen.
Thank you.
"Sorry, gentlemen."
"So, Henry, did I tell you I read about this place in a magazine?"
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.
$300.
$300.
"You bet, sir?"
Thanks.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."" All right."
Nice.
"Can I get another drink, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything!
Get off me!
"Get off, I haven't done anything!"
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, at a lot of places, a famous ghost is a huge draw."
"Like the, um, the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, or the Maison de Ville in New Orleans."
That's ridiculous.
Everyone knows there's no such thing as ghosts.
Ow!
Oh!
"Honey, you okay?"
You okay?
What happened?
Ow.
My shoe.
What?
Aren't those shoes you got at the sale where Monica...
Yes.
"Still breaking 'em in, I guess."
Whoa.
Wait.
You bought those shoes where she died?
They were on sale.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Yes.
Now?
"Oh, my God."
I'll be right there.
"The health inspector, he's here."

Weird.

Nothing's wrong.
That's just it.
It's freezing in here.

Sharon Curley's up the pole.
Sharon Curley's having a baby.
I don't believe you!

Are you serious?
Who's she having it for?
I don't know.
She won't say.
She doesn't know.
Ha ha ha!
She can't remember!
That's shocking!
Dirty bitch.
Mmm.
Poor Sharon.
The slut!
I don't believe her.
The stupid bitch.
She had that coming.
Serves her right.
"Ah, poor Sharon."
Let's see her get into those jeans now.
"Yeah, you've got a friend in me"
Score!
You got a friend in me
Wow!
Cool!
-What do you think?
"-Oh, this looks great, Mom!"
"Okay, birthday boy..."
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!
-I hope I have enough places.
"-Wow, look at that!"
That's so...
"-One, two..."
Four.
"-Oh, my gosh, you got..."
"-Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough."
-Could we leave this up 'til we move?
"-Well, sure!"
We can leave it up.
-Yeah!
Now go get Molly.
Your friends are gonna be here any minute.
Okay.
It's party?

Yee-haw!
"Howdy, little lady."
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
"Come on, Molly."
"Oh, you're getting heavy."
"See you later, Woody."
Delicious?

No.
"We say ""good."""
Hmm.
"I like ""delicious."""

Another day at the office.
All right.

Okay.

It's delicious.
Maybe later.
Thanks.
You're always welcome.
"In fact, more than welcome."
"Obviously, you're welcome."
"Fucking hell, it's your house."
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.
Someone else got there first.
So you never harmed any of your fellow Dauntless or the Abnegation?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I did.
Both.
Who?
(SNIFFLING)
My mom.
Um...
I watched her die first.
And then my dad.
They were killed trying to save me.
And...
I... (STRAINING)

He was trying to shoot me.
And I...
(SOBBING)
I shot him first.
What was his name?
I can't.
What was his name?
Will.
I killed Will.
'Cause that's what happens to people when they get close to me.
They get hurt or they die.
I can't forgive myself.
Thank you for your candor.
ALL:
- Yes?
- Chef says you must continue to go to the therapist.
I was waiting for 1 hour.
I think o. ..

"Is He sold the house, John?"
Why are you still living there?
This will bring them back.
"That night I must have died, the doctor."
Well ... not dead.
You see?
...
"I can not escape anything, doctor."
You were right.
I certainly am.
"Yes, ladies!"
This is a very definite ...
"We're fine, right?"
I'm still here.
In this absurdity.
You are gonna love this.
"Because, sir... you're gonna get to pick..."
your own voice.
Thank you.

What white guy wouldn't wanna sound like Louis Armstrong?
Just one more.
Quick.
"Luke, I am your father."
"Robert, enough."
"- Sorry, Mom."

"- Yeah, whatever you say."
You're the boss.

He's detained.
"Let's go, get your stuff."
We got 10 hours before he follows us.
SNOW:

How?
I got a friend looking after him till then.
(PANTING)
You told her to cut it down?
Yes.
I couldn't risk...
We go back together.
That is the only way.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
You know that.

All right.

I don't believe this.
[Jimmy] Relax.
"You're having fun, ain't you?"
[Engine Starts]
"[Jimmy] Man, if that's not a drop..."

I must keep my promise.
Weng won't hurt me.
I still deserve some respect.
"Sidney, I don't need the money."
I do need your friendship.
Chang!
Chang!
I followed him to 6 Horizon Drive.
I almost got him.
I know.
I could have... got him.
"Don't worry, I'll find him."
"Chang, don't worry."

You can't win all the time.
"But you can't lose forever, either."
Chang...
Chang...

Hmm?
I had a good game -- 13 strikeouts.
Did you win?
I just found out there's a chance we may be restationed again.

-
- It's in West Texas.
The Navy wants me to be a recruiter there.
Texas?
When?
Three weeks.
"But, Dad..."
We still got half our season to play.
I'm aware of that.
"Well, maybe I could stay with the Johnsons."
Unh-unh.
We move as a family.
I don't have a choice in this.
What kind of baseball do they have?
They don't.
I hear they might be starting some summer ball.

I can't believe it.
Go!
Huh?
Doc... the flag means go.
Remember the fl...
Here we go.
Go.
"Doc, what are you doing, man?"
"Oh, dear."
It would seem I'm off to a poor start.
"Well, better late than never."
"Come on, Mater."
She's got to be French.
I'm parked on Kattegat Road.
A red Ferrari.
- You called for some company?
- You're Chinese.
"- I'm French, honey."

- Fucking tart.
That was school French.
You're not from France.
Do you want company or not?
"300, cash in advance."
- What's that?
- 1500.
Say your name is Michelle and say you love me in French.
- And then I'll break your arm.
- Like hell you will.
- 3000.
"- No, I said."
4500.
That's more than you make in a week.
- You're sick.

I'II do anything I want.
Fucking cow.
"I'll get you, bitch."
Hey!
- Let me go.
- I'm going to kill you.
Michelle...
Michelle...
She is going to Mumbai.
Party is fine.
But till 2 o'clock?
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?
I worry when I think about it.
Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.
"Well, she is our daughter."
She will make us proud.
And keep your diary with you.
It pricks me the whole night.

I didn't like that.
"Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase."
"Me, you, dinner."
Pi-cha-kow!
- What the...?
Ow!
Oh!
- Ka-chow!
- Please!
- I know.
I get that reaction a lot.
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Agh!
Ow!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
"Do what you gotta do, baby."
But listen.
Be careful.
"Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean."
Ka-ching!
Ah!
I'll keep that in mind.
"- Hey there, Mater."
"- Howdy, Sally."
"- Hi, folks!"
- Good morning!
You know her?
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.
What?
I think I'll stay here for a while.
It's peaceful.
Go home.
It was good to meet you.
Thank you.
"Don't look back, Tony."
"Hey, Tone."
Where are Sid and Michelle?
No idea.
"You're a terrible liar, Jal."
Anybody can see you've got something going on.
- Shit!
- Christ!
What the fuck?
!
Tony!
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!
"- Sid, are you gonna let him?"
"- Tony, I'm objecting to..."
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?
OK.
"OK, Jesus."
"Tony, what?"
"Are you trying to scare me, because it's not working?"
I love you.
I'm saying it again.
OK?
And you.
"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.

Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.

Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"Come on, don't be afraid."

Okay.
Were you in the studio for a long time?
"-No, not long."

In the studio.
"Yeah, I did, actually."

My mother's birthday.

52... cards in a deck.
The next number is... 7.
The seven dwarves.
Seven dwarves.
32.

Apparently not everybody's favorite.
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age.
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the gold rush numbers are 25, 52,"
"7, 32, 10, and 17, so that's it for now."

"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
God!
I was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
- Yes.
- You were great.
"God, I don't know what happened."
"Shoo, shoo."
"Go on, get..."
"I'm in a band, you see."
And we've got this song.
"And our lead singer, Andrea, she's really great."
And she thinks we could be super mega pop stars just like Livi.
"But only if Livi hears our song, and then she can help us."
Hmm...
Interesting.
"Well, thank you, Mary."
Mia.
Quite.
"I couldn't possibly take it from you, sweetie."
"But, uh, Megan?"
Hmm...
"I like your spirit, Mary."
Let me see what I can do.

You don't pass the ball.
I got hurt because of you.
Are you alright?
Hurting your own teammates!
It hurts!
Are you OK?
There was no teamwork.
I never meant to...
You drag them down.
You can't play in a team.
There's no team play in Kung Fu.
But you're teaching them Kung Fu.
No!
I'm teaching them the spirit of Kung Fu.
You know only the form.
This can't be true.
Mr. Iwai is...right.
I don't understand teamwork.
But...
please forgive me.
Let's go!
Yes!
Be careful.
"Slowly, slowly."
"Minmin, watch it!"
"Ayasa, pass!"
"Mami, get it!"
"Nana, pass, pass!"
"Mayu, pass!"
What is Kung Fu all about?
Pass!
No.
For safety.
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
Talk to me.
"Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?"
"Come on, just tell me what you want."
Jesus!
"Oh, no, no, no!"
"No, it wasn't me."
It was Ignacio.
He's the one.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"Shut up, dude."
"Shut up, all right?"
Just speak English.
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?
- Who?
"- Oh, thank God!"
"Oh, Christ!"
"Oh, I thought..."
What can I do for you gentlemen?
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.
"This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000."
You should have taken it.
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

My brother got trapped.
Come on.
There you go.
Give me your hand.
"Hang on, we're coming in!"
- Are you hurt?
- My leg's stuck.
Hang in there.
Don't panic.
I don't know.
That's what we have to find out.
I hate it when she says that.
(Angela) Whoo!
"Oh, oh."
I forgot you were coming.
Hi.
You must be Sondra.
Hi.
"Yeah, sorry."
"I, uh..."

"No, it's--it's great."
It's great.
I love cookies.
[clears throat]
"So you want to just, uh, come into the kitchen with me, and we'll get us all something to drink?"
Sondra?
Water?
Milk?
"Uh, I, whatever."
Okay.
"She's hot, right?"
Seems...sweet.
I've been dying to find out if anything panned out with Dad's lead.
I tracked down a guy named Henry who encrypted the papers.
"We do have a male masseur available, madam."
"Daddy, I can't wait to get my drink on tonight!"
Damn!
Is this whole thing uphill?
Where's the downhill part?
We gonna get our groove on tonight.

"Of course, baby."
You know how we do it.

"Hey, I'm talking to you!"
Jesus Christ!
Loomis!
I need you to come with me.
Just a minute.
It's Sophie.
Sophie thanks I have a mistress.
You're worried about that?
"If you lived with Sophie, you'd understand."
Sometimes I yearn for our bachelor days in the army.
"We were happy there, no?"
"Well, I was happy!"
But you-
I wonder If you've ever been happy.
No.
It's not Sophie that worries me today.
[Gagging]
"Now, be careful, okay?"
"Oh, wow..."
There you go!
That's a good boy...
Come on!
"Oh, my."
"John, what are you doin' here?"
"Hi, John... hi, John!"

Ohh.
I didn't know it was gonna get that crowded!
"So, what do you think of the book so far?"
"Dude, seriously."
Quit asking me.
I will throw this book out the window.
That's the only signed one in the world.
It's a collector's item.
"We'll always have omaha, mouth."
You just said a mouthful.
Nice.

I can go where I want.
"- No, you're not."
"- I don't need your permission, Horace."
"- No, you're not."
- You have no right to keep me here like a fucking prisoner.
"Just let me go, please."
You can't force things.
"I mean, relationships, they either work, or they don't."
I could be your last chance at happiness.
Come inside.
I can't.
Okay.
Good night.

What happened?
She's worse than Audrey.
Or maybe it's you.
Can I buy you a drink?
"Uh, are you supposed to smoke around pressurized oxygen?"
No.
That's why I turned it off.
Dip shit.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
That was the wrong way to start this.
- Gee.
"- Maggie, my name is Lance."
"I'm, uh... in a relationship with your niece."

You still want Amelian?
No...!

Give me the money!
"Some more, don't you try to fool me!"
Where's the 'Beast'?

Have you got it yet?
In a second!
Soon!

"That was super interesting, Jenna, but it added nothing to the conversation."
Just a tip.
- Let me see that.
- GREG:
I can't see it.
- Zoom in a little.
- SAMANTHA:
"No, don't... (gasps)"
"Oh, my God..."
What?
What did I do?
"You ""liked"" it."
..Creations' press conference with Vivek sir and Adi.
"Pia, you will come, won't you?"
"No, sweetheart."
Even I have to meet my old friends.
But you can do one thing.
- What?
Go with Aakash.
- Who is Aakash?
You don't know Aakash (Sky)?
I know.
It's above.
- Correct.
He is always above her.
She is Aakash's ground.
Thank you.
"- Yes, sir."
Hi.
- Come.
"Baby, where were you?"
You said you will come in ten minutes.
See this.
Whole 25 minutes have passed.
You are always late.
I have finished dinner.
And see this.
Bill has also arrived.
"I am so sorry, darling."
You had dinner?
- Yes.
Let's go.
- Hang on.
I have to pay the bill.
-Erik.
-Dad!
Where are you Dad?
Where did he go?
-It is not healthy.
Are you all right?
I've been better.
"Daddy, what is doing down there?"
Go back to here.
I do not know if I can.
There's a way.
More you do not like.
"Do you want I pull back, right?"
"Hurry up, you can."
"Least we will not like from you, Dad."
"Well, I presume technically is a tactical retreat,"
I think it will just a bit.
"-Yeah, Dad."
-It is going well.
-It.
Volta.
That's right.
"To me, this is nothing normal."
Now see if you can turn to the other side.
-All right.
-Use the flippers.
-Stop!
Do not.
"Come on, Dad, you can."
"Dad, hear me, Dad?"
"Shyne, Darren!"
-Dad!
You're welcome.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
"They're excellent, yes."
I don't know what...
So today's...
Where is...
"Pete, in the room, please!"
You do something with your hair?
Would you help me with this bag?
"Just open it up, take everything..."
"- Dude, dude, take your meds."
"- I want a turn, bro."
"Pete, sit."
- You saved at least?
Thank you.
- I saved.
"Focus, focus!"
"- Wait, what are you doing?"
- Focusing.
You don't...
We're gonna...

Is it Joe the barber?
"Joe the barber, right?"
"That's who it is, isn't it?"
"- Aw, don't give us any shit."
What's Joe's last name?

"I know you,II do your best to help."
"You,II also be helping your fellow citizens - and France!"

That's what I'm talking about.

It's just the shoes.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Morning, David."
What's that?
"We need to have Toxie move, remember?"
TRENT HAAGA:
"Yes, I--"
"He can't stay on his knees, otherwise there's no movie."
So how do we-- let's just get the next move.
I'm very wide.
INTERVIEWER:
-Sir.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Would you like the wine list?
-No.
I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir.
Or should we get a bottle?
"Oh, definitely get a bottle."
Coffee for me.
"You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you."
Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.
"No, I mean, I've only got one good eye."
Could we change places?
"Oh, sure."
-Are you okay?
"-Oh, yes, yes."
Fine.
-This is a nice place.
-Yeah.
It's my favorite.
You ever come here with Charlie?
I don't know.
Probably.
He's a big steak-eater.
I'm more of a fish guy.
"You know, I'm surf, he's turf."
And we're cops.
-You're very cute.
-You too.
All right.
So tell me about yourself.
"Well, there's not a lot to tell."
I was San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year...
"Well, when Michelle came to me, she and Darren wanted a sibling so badly for Tammy."
"When they finally got pregnant, they seemed so..."
"So happy, I know."
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for coming with me today."
"Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to see Violet, and this gives us a chance to hang out."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Things have been a little awkward, you know?"
"Well, no."
"It's just, uh..."
It's nice to see you... outside of the office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Mnh-mnh.
Apparently... there's a closet situation.
Violet.
"Hey, it's me."
"Uh, Nai and I are outside."
Okay.
Hello?
Vi?
"Could you... could you shut the front door, please?"
And... and lock it.
Both locks.
It's closed and locked.
Okay.
"Hey, you guys."
Hi.
It's so good to see you.
Hi.
After you.
Hmm.
"Oh, thank God."
(LAUGHS)
Let's see them.
There's not as many as I thought.
"Yeah, but they're super pricey."
"That's $20,000 easy."
Twenty thousand?
(WHISPERING) Tallahassee.
"Listen, I'm gonna go meet the fence."
I'll meet you with the money.
Mm-hmm.
- Do you remember where?
- Mm-hmm.
- The parking structure by the tracks.
- Yes.
9:00 sharp.
This is so there's no mix-ups.
So I guess we're keeping this one?
How can we not?
Look at how good it looks on you.
"Tallahassee, baby."
We're almost home.
Home.
Hey!
Hey!
"(GRUNTS) You got the wrong guy, officer."
I wasn't even jaywalking.
It's not like that.
You wanna protect Emma?
Come with me.
-Rocco.
"Anthony, everything is going to be all right."
Try to sleep.
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.
I know.
Did you like them?
Yeah.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
"Well, they were friends."
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.
I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.
-Will you take me?
"-No, I can't, Anthony."
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.
I could help you.
I know.
Some day you will.
Get some sleep.
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.
I left Naples.
I left Mama.
For a no-good tramp!
"Now here I am in America, in New York."
Alone!
Thinking of my mother.
Without news from home.
You gonna be angry 'cause she lied to you again or what?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm angry."
"You know something, Danny, if I'm honest with myself,"
I also understand why she did it.
"I mean, given the circumstances,"
I probably would have done the same thing.
"Yeah, see, 'cause I think that maybe she just didn't want you worrying about her."
Little hard not to now.
Huh?
I think that she is gonna be fine.
She's gonna be fine.
She's a very tough lady.
She can handle herself.
Everything'll be okay.

They massacred us and destroyed our beans.
I heard it the other way.
That's because the victors get to tell the story.
(GRUNTS)
Okay!
Stop!
Here.
See?
I'm not the bad guy.
Maybe you are telling the truth.
It doesn't really matter.
I have to go.
Are there any more of you?
No.
I'm alone.
What's this?
Is this a bean?
Can this make a portal?
Not anymore.
It was destroyed like the rest of them.
I wear it as a reminder.
A reminder that you're all killers.

May I touch it?
You want to touch it?
Go ahead.
Thanks.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you need a lift?
- No.
- My car is parked outside.
- What colour is it?
- Colour?
- It's rusty.
"- No, thanks."
- Because of the colour?
- Yes.
Listen...
I'd like to ask you a question.
I'd like to take you out for dinner somewhere.
- Your choice.
- You're strange.
I'll give you my phone number.
"Call me, if you change your mind."
I won't.
I'm a drug addict.
I'm definitely a drug addict.
I'm hooked.
"Hey, easy, easy!"
Right in the nuts!
"Bitch, you asked for it..."
"Hey, Tom, looks like she's not your kind, dude."
Stop the truck and get your paws off her!
"You better let her go, he means it."

"I missed the jeep, so..."

"It was fantastic, Jimmy..."
"This is Zelmira, a goddess!"
That's Maria Concetta.
Bring the gurney here.
She needs a transfusion.
Take her to the ambulance right away.
Deborah?
"But as you drive like a maniac, it helps to pass the time."
- Like a maniac?
- We ought to be dead by now.
I've a daughter too.
I need 2 hours for her.
Spare me!
Not your daughter.
The bypass will be jammed.
I don't know where to go.
- Any idea?
- No.
- I'll go north.
"- OK, go north."
- Where shall I drop you?
- In the north.
OK.
At least you're not complicated.
There.
It was nice talking to you.
- It was mostly me who...
- So...
Thanks for the adventure.
You're welcome.

You can talk to him?
Kinda.
He can't say a lot of words yet but he understands things pretty good.

"Oh, yeah."

You got plenty of room here.

I'll take my chances.
Go ahead.
Take your chances.
You've lost yours with me.
- Good.
- Fine.
I was fine until he made me call you.
- He made you call?
- Yes.
"Well, yeah, mom, 'cause I was worried about you"
After the one night gross you guys had.
You didn't call me back.
"I didn't call because it was nice to feel wanted by you,"
To be desired and paid attention to.
He goes nuts.
Shoves her up against the wall.
Me and my buds step in to try and help...
"Next thing I know,"
I'm in E.R. getting stitches.
We're gonna need the names of all your buds.
"- Hey, Richie."
- Batten down the hatches.
Brother big-mouth strikes again.
Damn it.
Did Steve call you?
Uh-huh.
I told him not to tell anyone.
Does dad know?
"Well, I haven't heard any yelling, so I'd say no."
You want to meet for lunch?
Yes.
Usual?
Richie?
Richie!
"Yeah, I'll see you there."
All right.
- Boyfriend?
- Brother.
Another brother.
How many you got?
- Three.
- He a patrol cop too?
"Oh, yeah."
"Three brothers, all patrol cops."
And my dad.
You had to know they'd be upset.

"Oh, my God. okay, we have to get you to a hospital."
Wh--what did you do to yourself?
"Well, it was the only way I knew how to get the sword."
What if we didn't get here in time?
"Yeah, I thought you would."
"So just--right now, could you just hurry up,"
Pull it out?
Wait.
Wait.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.
Are you sure?
"Yeah, it's the sharpest sword ever made."
It should slide out just like butter.
"Just--just do it really, really, really, really fast."
Okay!
Not like butter!
You all right?
"Catch that brat, be quick!"
- Whom do you mean?
-That Major!
Be quick!
I was at the door.
Nobody came in or out.
Nobody?
"You slept on duty, didn't you?"
No.
Nobody came in.

We're clear.
There is nobody here.

You're so lovely.
"Yes, you are."
And you're so soft.
And you smell so nice.
I forgot your juice.
That's all we needed.
That dumb juice.

Right there.
- There.
- Thank you.
"Jorgen, here you go."
Thanks.

What does that leave us?
That leaves this Igle down the bottom .
"Let's go for that now, and see what happens."
Bung that one in now.
And...
It might be the red herring.
What's going on down here?
Nigle?
50 seconds.
"No, that's not working, is it?"
I don't...
I'm wondering whether...
Aberdeen?
Aberdeen!
Aberdeen...
I think...
That would put... 30 seconds.
We'd have to have a lot wrong if it were going to be Aberdeen.
I think that's a red herring.
What's this Y for then?
Something-dray?
20 seconds.
Bay?
There's Ayr...
No.
Yeah!
"Yes, Ayr, yes."
You said that before.
"No, no!"
I was thinking Antigua.
Always wanted to go there.
"Nope, nope."
"Nope, nope, nope."
No.
I dated a girl from there once.
What?
So the whole country's off-limits?
The whole West Indies is off-limits.
"Well, who's this girl?"
It's a long story.
"If we ever make it out of the U.S. alive,"
I'll tell it to you.

No.

What's up?
You have to help me!
They're coming!
Okay...
"Schmidt, hang on."
What -- what's the problem?
Is somebody at the motel?
"No, I'm not at the motel, okay?"
"I mean, I was at the motel."
Then I went back to my warehouse --
Wait a minute.
What -- y-you went to the warehouse?
Why?
- [Laughs]
- Went on and on and on.
"- Okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high security."
'Cause we mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
- Hi.
"- Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"- Yeah, I know, I know."
This is my home.
[Sighs]
It is!
Rough day?
Y-Yeah.
Were you...
Were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
Most people think she's a lot younger than that.
"Hello, I'm Olga."
"Olga, I'd like you to meet my good friend Bob Hartley"
How old do you think I am?
"Forty, 41."
I am 65.
- That's amazing.
- Yes.
"Now, what is it that you want to work on?"
"The legs, the thigh, the hips, the bust?"
A little below the bust.
"Well, just follow along."
We start very slowly in the beginners group.
All right.
Line up.
Arm's distance.
Good.
"We'll start with a little, stretching."
"Well, so much for the stretching."
"Now, we go."
And... run!

"Hartley, you're behind."
"One, two."
"One, two."

"Wong Fei-hung, I'm not afraid of you!"
You're not?
How about this?
It's time to build up your confidence!
"Relax, follow me."
- Lock him up!
- Yes!
"Marshal, which one?"
"- Numbskull, the one behind you!"
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Nothing to do with you.
Excuse me!
You dare to retaliate?

Don't be afraid.
Fight!
- You bast...
"- Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Marshal, are you OK?"
Nifty footwork.
You ambushed me with your No Shadow Kick!
Give me my weapon!

We don't know!
Tell me!
You know something.
Memory has become weak!
Which diamond?
What diamond?
What car?
"One, two, three."
- This was the one!
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
"Papa, they both are the one!"
Tell me!
Where is the diamond?
I don't know!
"Very good, Chandu!"
Don't tell him!
Even if you have to lay down your life!
Don't tell him!
Okay!
Chandu!
Where is the diamond?
Stop it!
Make some noise.
Sing it!
Let me see those hands.
"Come on, everyone."
You guys sing!
Am I better when I'm naked?
I Iike being free.
"I recorded ""What Makes You beautiful"" in my boxers."
Who gets to go on the O2 stage in their dressing gown?
Not many so 'm gonna live that dream boys.
And 'm gonna go out there and rock me little socks off.
"Thanks, everyone!"
Free hugs.
Free.
"Free hugs, anyone?"
I Iove you.
"You'II give me a hug, won't you?"
Yeah.
Another hug.
And one more?
One more hug?
please.
One more?
please.
The most important thing is not to pull it.
careful!
We've got a bomb.
"Oh, that wasn't-- I did not pull that."
"Three, two, one, go!"
What happened?
I've got no brakes!
I've got no brakes!
Huh?
"You good, B.?"
Yeah.
"Come on, man, let's go."
Come on.
"Come on, we gotta go, we gotta go."
(Club music thumping)
(Cell phone vibrating)
Hello?
Okay.
"Okay, thank you."
He's at Hector's.
It's not me he's running away from.
"17 years, Kike."
I gave my life to you.
"It was hard, but I did it."
I put my trust in you because I knew
You would take care of us.
But now my baby's out there.
"E., I don't know what happened to you up there,"
But it has nothing to do with Michael.
The boy loves you.
He needs you.
We need you.

(Knocking)
(Door creaking open)
"(Manny) Hold it, hold it."
"Right there, right there."
I just want my family.
Can I talk to him?
Son.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.
–Where is he?
–Who?
Fleetwood.
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
"Now, where is he?"
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.
- Maybe I just feel insulted.
- Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I'm putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
!
91.
Number 91!
91.
Number 91.
"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
Excuse me.
"Oh, impressive wingspan!"
Very good!
"Oh, what?"
What?
These are plastic.
He can't fly!
"They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly."
"-No, you can't."
"-Yes, I can."
-You can't.
-Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!
"I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!"
"-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it."
"-All right, then, I will."
"Stand back, everyone!"
To infinity and beyond!
-Can!
-Whoa!
"Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!"
-I found my moving' buddy.
-Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
"Man, the dolls must really go for you."
Can you teach me that?
-Golly bob howdy!
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"I can't stay here, Henry."
I'm sorry.
"Ah, shit."
Fuck yeah!
"Fuck yeah, Akan's boys are here."
"I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?"
"I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?"
"More guns for you in the drawer, yeah?"
Whoo!
"This is fucking war, baby, yeah!"
Whoo!
"Oh, fuck yeah!"
I fucking had that!
"Go, go, go!"
The floor is fucking lava!
I'm gonna burn it!
"Oh, Olga, Katya!"
"Oh, please, please!"
Please don't hurt me.
- I've got a family.
- Is that your wife?
"Um, uh..."
"Don't mind her, Henry."
She's mourning her late husband.
I wasn't betting on seeing you again.
Your persistence is unparalleled.
And quite exciting.
Slick Dimitry's services were excellent.
I'm just glad I never paid upfront.
I'll tell Estelle you did well.
"This is a club, not a boxing ring."
The cunt walked right into us.
- Where's your booze?
- So you beat him up?
- You let too many losers in.
- He owns three restaurants.
I'm spending 30 grand here tonight.
I can beat up anyone I want.
Have we finished?
Come on.
"Hey, T!"
Send up a couple of bottles.
"Fuck, man."
- Fucking Paki.
- We taught him good.
- Hi.
"- What's up, Hanne?"
I was wondering...
can I have a line?
Help yourself.
- I'm in the mood now.
- For what?
A fuck.
- Who says I am?
- You were just now.
That was then.
But if you want you can give me a hand job.
- OK.
Where shall we go?
- Do it right here.
- Here?
- Hey?
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.
"The guy you're looking for, Dragan."
I know where he is.
At a chick's place on Borrego St.
Don't ask how I know.
Police!
Freeze!
Stay there!
Get up!
Let me hug my kid.
Your wrists!
Sign there.
"Have a nice leave, Silien."
Your Puch's in the toolbox.
"With a 2nd clip, just in case."
"This is dumb, Silien."
You got 3 weeks to do.
Watch the road.
Neat vodka.
You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"
We're not dancing anymore.
"Anyway, he was a bum lead."
How do you know?
I know.
That's all.
Silien here.
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right. lt's all right. lt's okay.
"-Go, go..."
-Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
(breathing heavily)
-Did we do it?
-l think so.
-Will I die?
"-No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
(GRUNTlNG)
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
(dialing)
-MAN:
Somerset Textiles.
"- Oh, thank you."
Smell that?
'25.
PHILIP:
"All right, the good stuff."
"Philip, I've, er..."
I got something special for you.
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I just sort of assumed it.
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.
"Oh, God."
She can be such a pain in the ass.
"Anyway, here's to us."
Cheers.
Philip.
"Seems like it's just you and me left now, Norm, huh?"
"Oh, hey."
I forgot to tell you.
I saw this the other day.
Hmm?
"The guy you were supposed to do the journalism piece on, that snake?"
It seems he took his own life.
- Jesus.
- Who is it?
Who's that?
IKE:
What's he called?
PHILIP:
"Josh Fawn, the writer."
"I mean, I'm glad he's dead and all, but..."
"Stay with him, Stoke, stay with him!"
"Oh, it's a high fly ball, folks, right along third-base line."
Palmer is after it.
He's after it.
He's got it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Let me see that cut!
Stoker's through!
He's through!
How many more beatings do you have to take?
Better lay down.
Better than having your brains knocked out.
- Better than having you dead.
- You gotta lay down.
Lay down.
Lay down!
Six!
Seven!
Ten!
Fight!
Let them fight!
What a switch!
Stoker gave him one under Nelson's chin!
- Knocked him right over the ropes!
"- You got him, Stoker!"
"Hold on, Nelson!"
"Stop him, Nelson!"
"You got him, Stoker!"
You got him!
Stoker!
Stoker!
- I would do bad things.
- I do not believe.
You're only a child.
Have to believe me.
My brother worked for a very long time.
You know.
Always been interested in him ...
I like that.
I love you.
- I do not believe.
- But it's true.
- Where is my brother?
- Good question.
"This, we also want to know."
We believe that some kind of trouble.
"Us, we found him want to help?"
- Okay.
- Fine.
- Cookie?
Here you go.
- Milk.
I need to find a statue.
In this sculpture.
A very special statue.
Angel?
Have you seen anything like this before?
- Yes.
- Well done to you.
"- Where, honey?"
Where did you see?
One church.
-Dad.
I'm not the one who has the explaining to do.
Dale's son--explain that.
Explain cancer.
Explain war.
Explain the whole damn thing to me just one time... so I can understand why everything has to be so hard.
"( sobs ) Oh, God."
I'm sorry I hurt him.
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
Allie...
LISA:
Allie...
"What are you doing, Allie?"
Charlie...
Look at me.
Look at me.
"Look at me, Dad."
He's all right?
What do you think we ought to do now?
.
( cell phone rings )
"Yes, Ray?"
"Heiio, Ray?"
No.
This is Allie.
We're all going to come out of the building now.
Please tell everybody not to shoot.
I'll go with you.
All right.
They're coming down.
She says she'll come with us if we let the others go.
Everybody set?
- Mary...you can't do this.
She'll pick you up later.
Don't go!
Maria!
Where are you?
"Hold on, Quico."
Come back already!
Now you can blow out the candles.
Should I make a wish first?
"Sure, my darling."
Help!
Get me away from here!
Well done.
Let's eat the cake now.
Doesn't your doll get a piece?
She doesn't know how to eat.
You never talk to me.
- Talk about what?
- Anything.
"I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me."
Tell me what's on your mind.
- When?
- Now.
Where is my mom?
Where is my dad?
What?
Where are my mom and dad?
- Time for your presents!
"- Tell me, grandma."
"What, darling?"
Where are my mom and dad?
I told you already.
They left you with me.
You should have let me break your arm.
Help!
Let go of me!
Help!
- So you're not seeing anyone?
- Nobody regular.
- Why?
- Would you like to?
Maybe.
How about going down to the car?
On your front.
Not anal.
You whore.
You're hurting me.
You bastard.
My pleasure.
I want to report a rape.
- 26000.
- I expected it'd be more.
Thursdays are never that full.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She OD'ed on X.
The ambulance came.
- Which hospital?
- Bispebjerg.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Hello?
"Hi, mummy."
I'm in a bit of a rush.
"No, my birthday was yesterday."
"Yes, I'm sure."
How's Tetty?
Be careful.
"Let's find those parts, okay?"
Okay!
We're going.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
You mean your Mom will...
Thanks for having us.
Um...
It's kinda dark.
I'll walk you home.
Really?
Don't bother.
She lives near me.
"Misaki, let's go!"
"Okay, I'll come back soon."
"Bye, Tetty."
See ya.
An unexpected rival appears...
His chances are good.
Yusuki is on the defensive...
Get lost!
"Ooh, I'm scared."
Why get in the way?
"They're so soppy, it makes me puke."
Really?
Really what?
What're you saying?
Don't you like her as well?
"Childhood friends, blossoming into more..."
No way!
Just hold it right there.
"Yeah, he's young."
"He's not tall, but he's young."
Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hey, let's hope it's a boy!"
Huh?
Philip!
"Come on, stand up."
"Oh, you are standing. (LAUGHS)"
"Come in, come in."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh!
In you come.
(WHISPERS) We will be social with these women tonight.
"Son, you're young."
Come on.
Huh?
What are you?
- Old.
- Yeah?
Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
You were there?
Yep.
"You know, before I touched down here, I moved around a lot."
"New Orleans, New York, Chicago."
Been here the longest.
Ah!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Ahh.
Yo?
I'm stripes.
That's right.
What?
You're kidding me.
"No, no, I can't switch shifts with you."
I've been drinking.
"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!
Bleah!
Oh!
Wow.
What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."
My sister?
Danielle.
"You mentioned her earlier, no?"
- No.
- Oh.
"It must have been Simon, then."
He talks about you a lot.
Thanks for the dance.
Anytime.

I'm warning you.
Let this go.
I have it under control.
There you are.
Sorry.
I-I think I had too many mojitos.
I just... needed to lie down.
"Well, I hope tonight wasn't a complete waste."
Did you at least manage to have some fun?
"- I mean, Blanca's great."
- Mm.
"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.
She's right.
I've never met a woman like you... ever.
And I don't think I ever will again.
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?
8!

Lock him up with crazy girls?
"Then he'll become crazy, too!"

He's exhausted now.
Then!
I have a request!
Jumping Dragon!

You crazy women!
Remember my strikes!
Use this to save him!
Can't you hear?
Let me go!
Yeah.
Lock down all these doors.
- Do it quickly.
"- Go, go, go!"
- Sir.
- The residence.
Bear with us.
"Sir, we have a tour group on the State Floor."
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.
Keep the hallways clear.
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.
No one goes anywhere till we lift the crash.
- She's just a little girl.
I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.
"Keep moving, please."
Everybody.
"Gentlemen, we're on lockdown."
You can't be in here.
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

You gotta be kidding me.
Movie time is over.
Shut this down!
Let's go.
"Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds."
Silencer.
Let's go.
"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
I seem to have left my keys in the lab.
You're gonna get it.
Who 's there?
Come on!
Stupid antenna.
Invaders from Mars!
Honey?
help!
help!
Stop!

Don't you know better than to wander off at night alone?
What if something happened?
"I'm sorry, Mom."
Don't you ever do that to me again.
I was so scared.
I thought I'd lost you.
You won't believe this.
Something ate our TV antenna.
No!
I'm serious!
"It's not Sputnik, Iike Mr. Stutz thought."
"No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
"And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!"
And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...

I'm not--
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.
- Malakai ?
Are you all right ?
"- Yeah, yeah, man."
Anybody catch one ?
"It ain't over, bitch."
"I don't even know why it started, bitch."
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek.
That's what this is about.
"No, it's about you."
White girls like you.
"Creepin' up, takin' our men."

Let's go!
Wait!
Come!
Good morning.
"Minmin, you're late."
Who's this?
This is Rin.
Rin Sakurazawa.
I'm here to observe your practice.
Grade?
An SIU student?
Ever played lacrosse?
I will play lacrosse.
So you'll learn Shaolin Kung Fu.
"""ShaoIin Kung Fu""?"
What is it?
It's a martial art.
This is weird.
"What's ""a martial art""?"
Like kendo?
Or karate?
"I've heard about ShaoIin, but..."
I think it's geeky.
It's not!
What do you wear?
I hate ugly uniforms.
Is it practiced outside?
Even the UV creams don't help anymore.
I bought a good moisturizer.
Show us!
Reason why should be showing her
Off in public anytime soon.
"OK, bye bye."
Sir.
Sir!
Yes?
You have to pay.
"No, no."
It's OK.
I'm a fireman.

"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."

"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?
Copper.

I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?
.
-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
- Fuck from there!
"I inference here, or he dies!"
Did you hear me?

Bring me a car!
S.ktirip go from here!

Damn!
Jesus Christ.

"Here you go, chief."
- Before you why do not you?

- Do you hear that?
"Baby, I'm thirsty."
Give me your drink.
Please.
One sip.
It's poison.
It was a joke.
"Okay, he.."
He caught me on that.
"- But everyone copies my style, baby."
- Please.
- Everybody.
- You can flaunt your style...
But I'll be the one taking her home.
Wow!
You're learning pretty quick...
- I like him.
- Yeah?
He's learning pretty quickly.
Very very quickly.

Excuse me.
Thank you.
I have found out everything.
Are you thinking about him?
Are you drunk?
It's a ladies' loo.
You'll get beaten up.
"No, I am not going anywhere."
I am missing you a lot.
"Anyway, I won't be able to meet you for a week."
Why a week?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.
(SCATTING)
I'll be right back.
Crazy.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Siri?
"The number you called, not ..."
You see?
Whether they find?
-We Need to confess.
"-No Need, no!"
My father would kill me.
-what Are you doing?
-help Me.
Play more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-was Zana.
She was alone in the E6 after the killing.
-Five Miles away?
There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"This is so hard, you know?"
Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- Are you a cop?
- Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
No.
I am not a police officer.
"Okay, then."
175 for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
"On your stomach, get on the ground!"
Nicely done.
That's a good look.
"Don't laugh at me, Drew."
Come on.
What happened to your eye anyway?
My eye's fine.
Just let me...
"Let me have your shirt, please."
What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.
I can't go in to Gates like this.
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...
All right.
All right.
Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.
Stop being like that.
"Hey, everybody, I made it."
Just kidding.
"Big day, huh?"
Everybody pretty excited about it?
"Hey, Allan made it."
Whoa.
"What happened with your eye, bud?"
"Nothing, man."
I'm okay.
Yeah?
"Too risky to call, especially for Dana."
"Cut over to Magnolia, we'll box them in."
(tires squeal)
(tires screech)
Heads up!
I think we're being followed.
Call it in.
What're you doing?
Wasn't me.
The truck just shut down.
(tires screech)
Move and you're dead.
Locks!
Now!
Come on!
"Take it, take it easy."
- Move it!
"- Okay, okay, all right, all right."
Get the money!
(tires screech)
(shouts)
"Go, go, go!"
NCIS!
I got this.
Go get Dana.
(siren wailing)
(tires squeal)
"Wait, i-is she signaling us?"
She wants us to cut around.
Why?
One way to find out.
Hang on.
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
- Hey.
- Dad!
"- Hey, pal."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mind if I use your bathroom?
I've got to make a pit stop.
Not a full pit stop-- just an oil change.
I'm going to pee.
So do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?
We don't have to do the small talk.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Okay.
"Buddy, put your backpack on."
"Okay, have a good day at school."
"I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say good night, okay?"
"Okay, Mom."
I love you.
"Oh, that is so sweet."
Reminds me of my mom.
Not that you're as old as my mom.
My mom is young.
She looks great.
You look great.
- We're going to go wait in the car.
"- Great, great, great."
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.
"# Oh, baby, I love your way #"
# Every day #
# Wanna be with you night and day #
# Every day #
I don't know.
You set the bar pretty high.
Oh.
That's funny.
I'm Carol...
Rance.
I know.
I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.
I get that.
I want a partner.
"Hey, mertala."
Is she here?
Who is it?
!
It's Mr. Matt!
Then start acting like an adult.
I'm done here.
Go.
(DIALING)
Alice?
"Uh, It's me."
It's Leo.
"Oh, hi, Mr. Boykewich."
You have Ben's phone?
"Yes, I do."
"Oh, no, did you tell him that you know?"
"Yeah, but I told him, uh, Dylan's dad told me."
Oh.
Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.
Henry!
Hi!
Come in.
I want you to meet my parents.
I never smoked weed.
Marijuana.
Thank you for the clarification.
And I've never had a drink.
Filipino parents are very strict.
What time would you like me to bring your daughter home?
We haven't said she can go out with you yet.
"Uh, how do you two know each other?"
Not this time.
What are you talking about?
Everything.
Wait!
Laura!
Wait for me!
- Laura!
- Come on!
- Come on!
- I'm thirsty!
Shall we go to the movies tonight?
The movies?
I have free tickets.
From that weird guy?
"He works there, doesn't he?"
Weird?
"He looks a bit strange, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Did you talk to him?
A bit.
At least he gave you free tickets.
Right.
So do you want to come?
I can't.
Marco's coming.
"You don't like Marco, do you?"
"Yes, I do."
It's just that...
I don't really understand what he wants.
From me?
No... just generally.
"Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest."
"Actually, I wouldn't..."
I wouldn't mind if we just cemented over the ocean.
I hate fish.
"Speaking of oceans, who wants to take a dip?"
Oh!
"- Yeah, now we're talking."
- Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.
I feel like such a man right now.
Oh.
"Guys, you might wanna start small,"
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!
"Is that mint, or is that just, like, coffee?"
I'm buzzing really hard right now.
That's good.
"Oh, my brain hurts a little."
I'm tingling.
We should s'go right now.
S'go!
- S'go!
- Yeah.
Ooh.
[Grunting]
"Yeah, baby!"
"Oh, this song..."
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."
How long is it going to take?
OK.
Bye.
How much money do you think the Old Lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"Yeah, it's really good."
It's like...
It comes out sizzling.
Sizzling?
"Yeah, it'II..."
It'll save your life.
It's amazing.
Weird.
It'll definitely help with physics.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you gonna get?
Hi.
I didn't know you were...
Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."
- You want me to put out an APB?
- No.
I think I know where she is.
What's that?
Lunch.
Open it or he dies!
Open it.
MAN:
Step on it!
"Quiet, boys, quiet!"
"Meuller, Johnny, Ross, you come with us."
"Carr, you stick here."
"I told you, I didn't want any part of this."
[MEN SHOUTING]
Quiet!
"Oh, we get it."
"You want the warden to think you're too good to stick with your pals, huh?"
"No, I don't wanna make the Hole for life."
"Listen, Ross."
"Get moving or I'll bump you, Stacey or no Stacey."
MAN:
Come on!
[MEN SHOUTING]
Come on.
"Move aside, Ross."
They're all screwy.
I'm glad you use your head.
I'll make my own break when the time comes.
So the picnic is on.
This is it.
"And there's Polecat, like you asked."
I'll get to him later.
"Hello, Frankie."
I been waiting to see you for a long time.
I got a surprise for ya.
"All right, boys."
Right here.

"Go to the bathroom, grab a pair of scissors and untie me."
Nothing bad happened.
Untie me.
I want you to repeat 10 times:
"""I don't listen to my brother."""
I don't listen to my brother.
I ...
"Louder, please."
I don't listen to my brother.
I don't listen ...
I said louder.
Our mother wouldn't do that.
More convincing.
Elias ...
Sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
Come on.
Please?
Untie me.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
See?
If you let me go I can make you breakfast.
"Untie my feet, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's difficult, but we're gonna make it."
"Come on, untie my feet."
"Go ahead, then I'll make breakfast."
- Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven´t had the chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase."
You understand me?
You just make it right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.

You.
How's Keela?
"Ah, you know, they're in"
Disneyland for 10 days.

Gets back.

Can you do me a favor?
Can you doublecheck on Lou cause
I'm worried about him.
Yeah.
I'll take care of this shit.
All right.
"Hey, man."
You wanna grab a beer after
Work?

Spread to his balls.
How did that happen?
Sucking his own cock.
Too much.
"Sorry about tonight, frankie."
"Oh, hey, man."
"Don't even sweat it, you know"
What I mean.
Er...
Maybe I should let you talk.
You tell me what you feel

"- Please, not now."
"Right, right."
It's not my call.
Er...
"Erm... the thing is, Frances..."
I hate meself for what I've done.
Much more than you ever could.
You know?
I know that doesn't change anything or make it better...
"God, I'm terrible at this!"
All I want to say is...
"I've been... a terrible father... but... that doesn't mean I, er... don't care or... feel..."
What the fuck?
Jesus!
You...
Get out!
Get out!

"- Yeah, no shit."
- Shut up.

Get up.
Get up.
I'm going again.
- Are you sure?
"- Yeah, I just fucking..."
I turned too quick.
"- So, uh, talk to Lauren yet?"
"- Yeah, I talked to her yesterday."
- So what'd she say?
- I don't know.
- Y'all dating?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- Since yesterday.
- Where'd you guys go?
- We really didn't go anywhere.
"Went to her house, but..."
"- What do you mean, nowhere?"
- It's... nowhere.
- Wait.
"So you haven't been on a real date yet, but you're dating?"
"- Yes, it's been one day."
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
It's him.
"It's him, he's my friend."
"Here, hold onto it."
For your son.
Don't lose it.
"Don't lose it, Pedro."
Well?
How about that drink?
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
There's somebody else but you can't see who.
It's just a spot.
To Truman Capote.
To Truman Capote.
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.
It was an accident.
A gift.
This enlargement came out better.
Taken the day the girl was killed at the protest.
They called him the Crow.
He alone tortured over 100 people.
And he was the best at it.
"Take care, Pedro."
Jesus made us some food for the road.
"- Here, I owed you this."
- What is it?
Bambi stew.
- Watch yourself.
- You too.
"We're good, right?"
"- Hi, girls."
- Hi.
Look who I found!
"Hi, Simon!"
- Can I have a drink?
- Have mine.
- So sweet.
- As always.
So I'd noticed.
Too strong?
- Where's my sister?
- Sofie?
- I haven't seen her for days.
- We thought she was with you.
Hasn't she been home?
"Tommy, my top was brand new."
I told you to come on my tummy.
You've ruined it.
- Dry clean it.
- In the middle of the night?
- Look what Tommy did!
- I told you to use a rubber.
- He didn't want to.
- Wear this.
- Josephine's got a bottle for us.
- You forgot something.
What?
- Give me a break.
- What's up with you?
I'm not kissing a sperm mouth.
It was your sperm.
- I'm not a fucking faggot.
Swear you'll get it right back.
I won't do--
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you have a-- Could I--
Yeah?
"Here, you take the twenty, I don't want to touch his money."
His money.
"Your money, I don't do anything."
Just-
- Just fold it.
"No, no, no."
"Fold it, fold it, fold it."
"And then again, this way."
Crease it.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like this.
"Yeah, yeah, good, good, good."
"Here, so if I rub the twenty, just like this, here."
"Can you see, your twenty?"
- Yeah.
- Look.
"If I rub the twenty against the one, see, the ink'll start to change."
See?
"Here, you see your twenty?"
"I'm going to give you my one, but look."
If I just place the little piece on top like this and I do that.
"See, now, actually--"
No...
I kinda messed up.
George:
Oh!
That's a--
She was a nurse.
"No, thank you."
I'll do that.
I could probably get Miss Brody to come by.
- What?
- Emma Brody... the woman who received your daughter's cornea.
She says you've written to her.
No.
I never heard of Emma Brody.
Is this the place?
"Well, this is the right block... but... jeez, what a dump."
He said that the Davisons were at 523 South Sawyer.
"Well, there it is."
That's it.
That's it?
"Now, wait a minute."
We got to find a place to park here.
"OK, I'm gonna turn around up there... and park back there across the street."
"Oh, they've seen us."
This is good.
I'm gonna go.
Hold it.
Hallstrom said... never to take my eyes off you.
I'll be on the porch.
You'll see me.
"Now, wait."
Hold on.
Hold...
"Ah, shit!"
"Hey, officer."
Mrs. Davison.
It's Emma Brody.
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-go?
Now what?
Starting to see the light?
I'll give you three days.
"Get out, or you'll end up like your goddamned dog."
Translate.
Translate what I said.
How long has it been like this?
Just a few days.
$0?
The symptoms- they're the same as the others'.
There's gotta be an explanation for what she has.
They say they don't know.
What is it?
Oh God!
Who the fuck did this?
What?
!
You Okay?
Get your husband.
Who did this?
Who the fuck did this?
Jong-go!
Jong-go!
What's the matter!
Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
"Riley, you want your gun back?"
Yeah.
You can have it if you go first.
Are you sure?
Deal?
Let's just get this over with.
"Hey, you know who always dies first in these situations?"
The black guy.
What the fuck is this place?
What is that?
Blair.
"Sorry, sorry."
You still do that?
She laughs when she's scared.
"Dude, I thought it was a ghost."
Really?
A ghost?
"I'm afraid of ghosts, okay."
"Riley, keep going."
"Okay, okay, okay."

Am I standing in the middle of debating club?
"I'm like, you fucking died."
"That was pretty good, huh?"

Is that Jonathan?
It is Jonathan!
- Give it to me.
He won't let me in.
I just want to apologize.
Why don't you stay here and I'll try and talk to him?
Thanks.
Did you try him at home?
"Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna..."
"Hey, he's not there and his cell's still turned off."
You told him you were coming here.
"He knows, right?"
I told him.
"Or, I mean..."
What?
Did you?
"Oh, man."
I'm not gonna do this.

I will always miss Max.
Of course you will.

You're just in time.
I was about to fix some tea.
"Oh, I can't stay."
I'm late for my class now.
I just come over to deliver Wilbur.
"Well, if you can't."
Have a good time.
Thank you.
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.
- Moms?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- It is.
"Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that."
"Oh, thanks."
See you soon.
"Oh... down the street, I'm telling you."
- You're really good.

"I thought you did great, way better than me."
I'm supposed to be good at this.

I've been going on and on.
You haven't.

Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."

"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This my home.
It is!
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
[ Laughter ]
Don't know.

"Right, right, right."
Plaid buttoned-down interior.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe.
Um...
Yeah.
He's a keeper.
You'd think sensible...
He's a keeper.
...Good dancer...
"He's a great guy, great dancer, kind of suave, knows his way around a kitchen."
Fun at parties.
"""Knows his way around a kitchen""?"
Was that a fat joke?
[ Laughter ]
No!
You could have said anything.
A kitchen?
No.
That was like sexy chef.
"Oh, is that what it was?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"Your lap... fast, slow?"
How did it feel?
"When you got out of the car, you thought, ""that was..."""
Slow.
Slow?
Yes.
I am.
It's just that you're sometimes...
What?
"I'll finish this quickly, OK?"
Here.
I put a vitamin pill in it.
A vitamin pill.
- Shall I let in a little light?
"- No, please don't!"
It's better this way.
- I wanted to ask you out.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- To dinner.
- To dinner?
- Don't you want to?
"- Yes, dinner."
OK.
It's you.
"- You don't like it, do you?"
"- No, it's different."
- You didn't even recognize me.
"- Sorry, I was daydreaming."
- Well?
Black coffee as always?
- Yeah.
What were you thinking about?
I forgot.
I think it was important.
- I know the feeling.
"- No, not like that."
- I have a problem here anyway.
- Yeah?
- 'Bye.
Save you a twinkie.
"Ho, ho."
( Rock Music Playing in Headphones )
"- Hi, Jessie."
"- Hey, Mick."
Ben around?
No.
He went with Mom to the store.
Are you bored?
"Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid."
You can hang out here with me for a while if you want.
Are you sure?
You don't mind?
Tell you what.
I was thinking about going for a boat ride.
I could use a little muscle.
Sure!
I'm real strong.
Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you.
"'Cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser."
Ready?
Go!
I'll race ya!
"Jessie, why do you have to go away to school?"
JESSIE:
Because I'm a woman with a past.
I was a bad girl.
I got kicked out of my school here.
MIKEY:
What did you do?
Kill somebody?
Which one?
"Over there, near the lady sitting on the steps."
You can't see much from here.
"Let's go up higher, I'll show you."
- Which way?
- This way.
Let's go.
Farzad.
Why don't you bring us back the soup bowl?
I'll return it.
I need it.
Who is that lady?
That lady there?
"No, the neighbour."
Mim Khamman.
What does that mean?
My aunt on my father's side.
"- Hello, engineer."
"- Hello, are you well?"
- How's your family?
- Very well.
- Who's that?
- My mother.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
Are you Mr Hashemi's sister?
He sends his greetings.
He wasn't able to come.
I understand.
I'm at your service.
"Farzad, help them bring the gear in."
All right.
We can't just leave him.
Either he's gutted or scalped.
"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.
"All right, shit, then, buddy."
Get him up.
You want to take him?
(GLASS GROANING)
Come on now!

Fitz.
You have to take another year.
I started when I was thirteen.
Then you can drink your coffee without crying on my nose?
Do not make fun of a grown man.
'You thought I was tough?
-I Was.
You wash the dishes?
"I'm glad I came, Henning."
I do not like it here after what happened.
So let's run away?
Play a little water on the fire.
"Nixon, where are you?"
Please answer me!
Are you hurt?
Not a scratch.
And you?
I need your help.
Hello.
I was asleep.
Enters.

"Welcome home, Batts."
"Hiya, sweetheart."
How are you?
Sit down.
Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.
"And give those Irish hoodlums a drink, down there."
There's only one Irishman here.
"It's a celebration, fellas."
-Top of the morning to ya.

This is my friend Jimmy.
Henry. lt's his joint.
This is Lisa.

All dressed up.
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.
Forgot you were having a party for him.
Come here.
I'll say hello.
"How are you, Billy?"
I haven't seen you in six years.
Jesus Christ Almighty.
You look terrific.
Watch the suit.
"You little prick, ya. I've known you all my life."
-Don't go gettin' too big on me.
"In a half-hour, it's done."
Here he is.
Stay in the car!
Get going!
Stop it!
Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.
Choose.
"OK, let's have it."
I know two of 'em:
Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.
You got friends now?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
"I've got to-- My homework, OK?"
OK.
"That was, um-- That was nice of you."
No problem.
She's a good dancer.
"Yes, she is."
I'm sorry we made a mess.
"Oh, no, don't worry about that."
"So, what do you think about Shannon?"
"Well, l-- l think that she's--"
"She has good instincts, but she's, um-- she's at least a grade behind, and she can-- she has a way with the truth."
[chuckles]
"A way with the truth, right."
"Listen, if you're asking me if it's too..."
Too late?
"It's never that, Mr. Fallin."
Never.
Never that.
"So, you want to-- you want to stay?"
- Yes.
- Good.
Good.
Thank you.
"She's, um-- she's really excited about this dance."
"A night out with you, a new dress."
She's really excited.
Do you want to call me Dad or Jim?
Dad.
I think Dad's nice.
Yeah.
And you?
"Um, are you Samantha or Sam?"
You know.
How do you say?
- Tail.
Do you want to taste it?
- No thanks.
But you have never tried it.
Assaggiala.
"- Probate, burglary."
You have never experienced it.
"- Monna, tell her to try it."
You have to taste it.
"Yes, is..."
But it hurts.
"- Thank you very much, but..."
She barked and tossed it.
She does not like the queue.
"I do not like it, but you're sitting on mine."
My dear friend.
Go straight and then left.
"Right, right."
"Sorry, right."
"Nice, huh?"
"Oh, fuck."
Louise?
Is it his version of the disciple?
"She takes, takes and takes, is not it, Mr. Lloyd?"
For what noble purpose?
"Good morning, Ludovic."
- My jacket.
Thing?
- My jacket.
Thing?
Hit him in the belly!
"You got him, Nelson!"
Knock him out!
- How do you like it now?
- I still say it'll go the limit!
"- Little Boy, I need some more dough!"
"- All you want, baby!"
We'll make it 100!
A hundred?
"Look, I don't want to take your money, sister!"
- Put your dough where your mouth is!
"- Okay, okay!"
It's a bet!
Finish him!
"Come on, finish him, Nelson!"
Nelson's opened up his left eye!
- It's bleeding!
- Good!
"Come on, Nelson!"
"Get him, Nelson!"
Come on!
Stand up and fight!
Nelson's pounding his kidneys!
The sucker!
Why don't he work on that eye?
That's more like it!
Come on!
I don't like this!
I don't like it!
"- Hey, what goes on here?"
- Don't you like it?
You're trying to cross me!
Yeah.
Rock star!
- Hi.
"- Sarah, hi."
I'm Vanessa.
I'm sorry.
"I didn't realize you had a lesson, Joe."
"Oh, no."
Just us playing a few tunes...
And I made the mistake of saying it looked easy.
It's nice to see the guitar.
It's been a while since it's had any recreational activity.
Yeah.
"You know, I should get going."
Time to round up my little warrior.
"Oh, she's great."
- I'll ring you tomorrow.
- Sounds good.
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
"- You, too."
"Vanessa, right?"
- Right.
- See you.
Don't tell me.
You're jealous.
Don't be ridiculous.
Come on.
She's just another mom.
Lovely.
"Oh, my."
This is so beautiful.
"You know, your home says a lot about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
-
I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Frankie Valli or some big shot?
I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
she was screaming on the street and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.
Hill.
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
Henry.
Ready?
Yeah.
Come on.
Wait a minute.

You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that

What's wrong?
"It's been days, you know..."
Don't stay in the water for long.
You'll catch a cold.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's me.
"Please fasten this, please."
"What's your size, aunt?"
- 48 C.
That sounds like a bus number!
So much of junk!
I can't find a thing in this drawer!
What are you looking for?
A safety pin!
Remind me to clear out the mess tomorrow.
- 5 kilos of gourd... that's what we call it here in Mumbai.
What's going on over here?
Today's the Karva Chauth.
It's enough.
It's really enough for me.
And you would be willing to take the whole marriage thing off the table completely?
"If you promise to commit to me and to love me, and..."
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.
Okay.
All right.
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.
Okay.
You have to snake the drain when my hair gets clogged.
You know that happens.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
And also you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins in bed.
You gotta give me that.
"- Okay, fine."
All right.
- Okay?
And...
- Yeah.
- And?
- That's it.
- Okay.
Do I get to come home now?
I guess you can.
But these cannot come.
"- What, my pants...?"
- That's correct.
- Can't come home?

Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Gordon, I..."
"Denise and... all the others, they don't know, John.I do."
"I don't think you're crazy, Do you hear me?"
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
"I understand, everything."
"I understand, everything."
John do you remember the last time you were happy?
It's real.
These things are real.

I promise!
"I swear today until the end of days,"
"I will love you and honor you, if you are with me."
"I will, now and forever."
"Stop, before you get hurt!"
I'm Atka.
It's okay.
I am here to help you.
Let go!
I helped you.
Where are my clothes?
How long I was passed out.
Not enough.
You're welcome!
Bishop.
Bishop?
where we are?
This is Quannik's house.
- Quannik?
- He's been waiting for you.
- As it did?
- He died.
Forget this.
I have to get back on the road.
How can I get out of here?
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to a dictator...
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
-What is this here?
-Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
She likes it when she gets a warm meal.
Oh Franz.
I'm not hungry.
"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."
- Bon appetit!
Thanks.
Do we want to leave?
Why don't we just stay?
Just for now.
310?
Women's bathroom.
1 15?
"Two keys, no lock."
412?
Two keys.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.
What's the matter?
You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.
Do we?
Hello?
I'll meet you there.
- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
- You the owner?
"- Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like somebody's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?
Where you going?
Don't know.
"We both keep our mouths shut, they may never know it was us."
- What are you doing?
The cat.
The composer's dead.
Okay.
Shit!
_
Abby?
What?
Is this usual for your...
people in your native form?
She's building a nest.
We do it during molting and breeding.
"- I know, it looks..."
- Freaky as shit.
No offense.
"Trust me, it's a good sign."
Can I ask you something?
"Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are?"
"No, a few are human, scientists like you are."
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.
I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my family.
- My kids.
- You have children?
Two.
Six and eight.
They live with my ex.
You?
You have any little ones?
A daughter.
She's 16.
Very disappointed!
Morning!
Lovely start to the week.
After you.
Hey!
I know!
Yep.
Belting.
And you were right what you said about pasties and leper colonies.
Was I?
Bought her a plant?
Lovely - she's in a meeting.
"No, it's for him."
It's him I've come to see.
The boss.
"Oh, blimey."
There'll be no trouble.
"We just need to set things straight, the three of us."
To move forward.
You can't lay new lino over a dead cat.
"Now, tell him he's got a visitor."
Use the intercom if you don't want to go in there.
Hello?
"Sorry, Mr Stanley, someone to see Mr Stanley."
Over.
"'I'm in a meeting, Pauline!"
'
Say it won't take long.
"It won't take long, he says!"
Over.
'For crying out loud.
Hang on...'
I need you to be strong.
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Yes.
Paul.
Hmm?
I think my hands are nearly free.
Guard them!
Hello.
Hello.
"Oh, my God."
Felix.
"- Cut us free, Luke."
- I don't think so.
What?
"Just do it, you little turd."
- I killed Jonesy.
"- And what, hey?"
"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.
Would you care to bet?
One dollar. I serve him.
"Any trouble, you win."
"Fine, be a dollar more than I made yesterday."
Inez:
What will it be?
"Well, now, ain't you just a pretty little frijole."
I need me a rye whiskey.
Comprende?
"Sí, señor."
Now I need me a kiss.
-Do you?
MAN:
Yeah.
"No kiss, no money."
-l see.
-Get ready for some heaven.
There's your kiss.
What's your name?
Inez Rocios.
"Well, Señorita Rocios..."
... welcometoyournew job .
All these men deputies too?
Sure.
Soon as I steal them some badges.
vin:
"Well, well."
"You're a long way from home, Eli Joe."
"Well, I figured I'd see some more of this beautiful country."
Look up old friends.
Hang him.
Sure went to a whole lot of trouble not to face me alone.
"And the midnight screening of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" at the Cinedome."
I can't.
I have a curfew... at 11:00.
So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
Seriously?
"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
The motel?
"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.
What?
"I do whatever I want, whenever I want."
It's perfect.
"Yeah, but... don't you miss your dad?"
Yo!
Sammy!
That's your brother with Amanda Heckerling?
He's cool.
Yeah.
He thinks so.
"Hey, tough guy."
I been looking for you.
Why my place of origin?
Somewhere else ok?
"Up to you, just be 500m away from Lisa."
"Michael,"
I know what you're thinking.
You want me to stay away from Lisa cos you are not confident.
Good morning Mr. Lin.
Morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Thanks David.
It's my duty.
Good morning Mr. Mak.
You didn't drown?
"No, thanks for your concern."
You're such a dog.
Really?
It's my duty.
Go to hell!
Goodbye.
You don't like him?
I don't like you too.
Just 3 weeks.
"After breakfast, I'll change and set off."
Going home to nap.
Call me later.
I don't like to sleep.
What if you fall asleep during investigation?
Wake me up.
Hey!
What?
Driving 2 cars is a waste?
Expect me to sit in your car?
Unless they've got a special job like you.
"- What about the navy, Billy?"
"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."
"- Well, I can't swim a stroke."
- Then the air force is out.
- Why?
"- Well, you haven't got wings, have you?"
"- Take these over, love."
- Thank you.
"- All the best, love."
- Thank you.
- All the very best.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Mrs Rose?
"David, darling."
I think I'd better go and get changed.
- Can I help?
"- No, you can't."
"Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron?"
"Tomorrow, sir."
A Spitfire.
I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.
There we are.
"Mama, I'm so happy."
"Oh, darling."
- He is a lovely boy.
- Isn't he.
Darling...
"Off you go, Emma."
Both of you.
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
"Better, thank you."
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy Rose.
- How do you do?
- This is my husband David.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
"- Yes, thank you."
"Can you tell me the time, please?"
It's ten to nine.
Ten to nine?
- Help yourself to cider.
"- No, thank you."
Thank you.
"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Just hang on a second for me, please."
Alright.
"I'm sorry about that, Guv."
I'll catch up with you next time.
Alright?
Thanks.
Yeah.
(phone ringing)
Mum!
Ev!
"How are you, love?"
Have you found Uncle?
"Yeah-- yeah, but there's people living in his house!"
Oh Ev...
(crying)
"Oh, come on, mum!"
Really?
"That's not helping, isn't it?"
"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."
But you're not there on holiday!
You can't afford that!
You need to find another place!
"Okay, yeah, where?"
Drink rakia.
- He does not like.
You have to make it fast.
"Look at me, my friend."
"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."
She's a little...
So you knew.
Yeah.
Wash me.
Wash me.
Make my body clean.
Maybe it won't come off... but wash me.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We'll call it even.
I was sleeping with a Japanese woman
for money on the side.
Now hit me.
"Hit me, too."
Hit me!
Here's your sushi delivery.
How much?
Please pay when you check out.
It's Kiriko Kashiwagi.
- No!
- Kiriko Kashiwagi.
You're under arrest.
What's going on?
Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
-No!
Is it wrong?
.
-I called her because she's my friend!
-Because Bela is your ex!
I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!
-What the--
So what's up?
Let me get at you.
You want my number?
"Yeah, I want it."
I want to take you out.
"I could treat you real good, you know?"
"Oh, word?"
Yeah.
(Whispering)
Trans what?
Transsexual.
"Oh, for..."
For real?
"Hold up, you know, that's cool, ma."
"So, like, it's... it's gone, right?"
"No, um..."
I still have a thing.
You real freaky with it?
What?
Like... you suck dick?
Um...
I mean...
"No, I'm sayin', like, you like that?"
You suck dick?
You don't even know my name.
"It's Vanessa, right?"
(Door closing)
(Man) What do we got here?
"' 95, two years grand larceny."
"'01, a year on arms possession, resisting arrest."
Last bid's a three out of five.
"Drugs, possession and selling."
Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?
- No way the Rams cover.
You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.
It's all right.
All right.
"Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna get out of here, okay?"
"-No, you're gonna hurt yourself."
-Don't have a choice.
One...
"-Okay, okay."
"-...two, three."
"Now go, go, go."
Ryan?
"Ryan, are you okay?"
"Yeah, yeah."
-You?
-Yeah.
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--
"Oh, my God."
Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.
"-Oh, no, no, no."
It's just glitter.
Okay.
-Taylor.
Taylor.
Call when you get tired of it.
Shit!
May your hands wither away!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Nina's out, I... it's her mother."
"Right, Maria Vasilyevna."
See how it turned out!
And who are you?
Ghena?
From her work?
"I'll tell her, I will."
All right.
Mom!
"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
Get them here!
"Wait a minute, sir-500 coppers!"
Four hundred-just 400 a string!
Just 400 coppers a string!
Damn it!
Three hundred!
Two hundred!
I'm generous today!
Now I'm mad!
One hundred a string!
A hundred coppers!
?
Not even a hundred!
Take them free!
Don't leave!
Don't go!
They're free!
They're all free!
They don't cost a cent!
Come here and have some!
Come on-eat as much as you like!
Bastard!
What?
Why are you ruining my business?
You're trying to take my business away?
What do you want to do?
Me?
To beat you!
You'd beat someone!
?
What a hard bean curd!
Bean curd!
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...
- the summer...
"- Laura, come quickly."
What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."
You've got no choice.
Come here.
Hold this.
Swab.
Suck it up.
I can't see anything.
- We need more blood.
Ligature.
Ok.
Oh... you know you love it.
"Ooh, you like that?"
"Huh, what about here?"
"Oh, work it."
Work it.
You better tag me in all these photos.
"Ok, I like that."
Oh.
Hey.
"No, seriously."
I can't find Drew.
I'm sure he's just finishing getting ready.
"Seven, you ever think about marriage?"
Do I ever think about marriage?
"To who, you?"
No.
Never.
No.
"Do you ever think about, you know having a family."
Kids?
"Yeah, I mean I want to."
Do you ever think about marrying a guy?
Maybe.
If they ever make it legal.
Or if I ever move to Canada.
Right.
"What about you, Dale?"
Do you ever want to get married?
"Excuse me, Dale?"
Hi.
We're gonna close the front doors now.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.
- He is not much more than a cloud.
I'll come back to you.
I'll never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
All I have left is a show of strength.
"Besides, women like that sort of thing."
Are you insane?
Pretty dress.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?"
And... one.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
- This man has fainted!
- That man is wounded.
Too bad!
Help us lift him.
Wait!
Come back!
I knew it!
It's the frail one!
"Oh, my God!"
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
Ay yi yi...
Tu viste eso?
"Her daughter, son?"
"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."
Want some coffee or something?
Let's sit here.
I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.
Dating?
"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?
Henning.
He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.
-Are You good?
"Yes, yes."
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.
[PLATES SHATTERING]
"Okay, gotta go."
"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates."
Maybe I'll see you there.
You're busy.
I shouldn't have called.
You called me.
"- Yup, good."
- Bye.
KEITH [ON TV]:
How...?
How do you work on it?
"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
I mean  pretend I'm her.
Amanda.
He's into me.
Awesome.
I knew it.
- Who's this now?
- Alex.
It's totally clear to me now.
He's Watts.
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?
No.
Thank you. one of your friends is here to see you.
what's up?
bro.
But I don't think Victor likes you very much-- just the sense I'm getting.
don't sweat him.
It was him and Jason.
You shouldn't be thinking about that stuff right now.
Are you all right?
Do you need anything? please?
bro.
So when's your next fight?
It's tomorrow.
I'll be there.
Are you gonna be all right to come?
don't worry.
Just get ready.

Price.
I hope this isn't your fighter.
No.

I've done four years of this show and I just feel like
I've earned myself to live out this dream of--
"I just want to sing the song, so..."
"Um, yeah."
Thank you!
Thank you for letting me live it out.
Thank you.
Okay.

Thank you.
-It sounds amazing.
-Thanks.
-I'll get the rest this week.
"-Yeah, no problem."
Good night.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's lan in the penthouse.
We need another bottle of Chateau Marmont.
Sorry.
Dom Perignon.
Cheers.
Thanks.
I think it's more comfortable inside.
I think it's one of the best records I've done.
I think it's the best record you've done too.
"I didn't say ""the best."""
"-She said the best, didn't she?"
"-I thought she said ""the last."""
You see?
You saved the best for last.
I know it's not the last.
"No, don't go."
Don't go.
-You should get some sleep.
"-No, we never sleep."
Why have you got your clothes on?
-What are you talking about?
-You look so much better with them off.
Come here.
We've been entertaining you for a while so why don't you entertain us?
Concentrate.
Pardonme.
Can I point out your heart rate just increased?
Yeah.
"Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider."
You see a spider?
- You don't... you don't see that?
- No.
Don't...
Don't walk.
Don't...
Holy shit!
"Tough guy like you, scared of spiders."
"Yeah, I'm just not fond of them."
It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly.
It's probing for weak spots.
God damn it.
Fucker!
Yeah!
Um...
Okay.
"Yeah, well, yeah."
Whole lot more realistic than the gopher game.
It's good.
It's good graphics.
"It's good, uh..."
Yeah.
Weak sauce.
- What is it?
- Just...
Nothing.
Nothing.
(laughter)
- Fuck?
What the fuck?
How did you do that?
- I didn't do that.
It just happened.
"- Come on, what do you think--"
- Don't fucking touch me.
"Now, just tell me how you did it."
How the fuck did you do that?
Horace:
"Hey, it's a trick."
Horace Sr:
"Tell him it's a trick, please."
Horace:
It's a trick.
- I don't know any tricks.
I just watch nature happen.
- Nature?
You fucking freak!
What?
"My eyes didn't see that, all right?"
What did you do?
What happened?
"- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick."
He's doing-- Show him the trick.
- I don't know.
Horace:
Show him the trick or we need you to go.
- I don't know.
Here.
(glass breaking)
"Now, if you come back to this town,"
I'll know it.
And I'll get you.
Understand?
"(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, sir."
"Oh, I won't come back to this town, honest."
"As a matter of fact, I'm going home today."
Tout de suite.
"Here, let me..."
Let me show you.
"You see, here's my... my fare, $26.40, to Blitzen, Washington."
"Oh, man."
"Oh, be careful, bleeding."
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm going to get the very first train home.
"I swear, honest, so..."
"So, goodbye."
Au revoir.
Remember me to the little woman.
(TITTERING)
"(STUTTERING) Goodbye, man."
Nice...
Nice going.
Let's have the diamond.
Here you are.
"It's only bubblegum, stupid."
But it was in his pocket.
I thought...
"Oh, he's still got it on him."
"Well, you can get it back."
You know where he's going.
MAN 1 ON PA:
You know the Bowlmor Lanes?
Okay.
I'll see you there in a while.
Good.
- What's up?
- I'm going to roust a couple guys.
"Well, let me cancel this."
I'll go with you.
- I'll take Martinez.
"- Andy, it's no problem."
"Don't worry, I'll take him."
Those guys who took off that Vietnam vet?
He's crippled.
They left him lying there.
- Let me go with you.
"- No, I'll take the kid."
Okay.
You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I'll see you later.
HEYWOOD:
John Kelly?
Stan Heywood.
"Sit down, Stan."
Why did you pick this place to meet?
"Well, I wanted a place you'd be familiar with."
"- Can I get some coffee, please?"
WAITRESS:
Sure.
- Thank you.
WAITRESS:
Whoa.
Yikes.
Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."
- We came a really long way to visit.
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, that is so sweet and thoughtful."
It is.
Isn't it?
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....
Or enough.
I don't know.
They don't seem inspired.
Inspired?
I'm fine.
"Grey, what are you doing?"
"If you sleep with me, you lunch with me."
New rule.
"You let interns sit with you at lunch, dr."
Sloan?
That is so cool.
"Oh, you want to go halfsies with me on that cookie?"
"Uh, what are you gonna trade me for it, huh?"
"You guys, they have Tater Tots!"
I have to go.
Mark.
Mrs. Shepherd.
- You've been avoiding me.
- What?
No.
You have that same guilty look on your face as you did when you were 10 years old.
And you put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave.
"I never pressed ""Start""."
What's going on?
I'm sleeping with her.
"Oh, Mark!"
Not again.
- How could you?
"- No, no."
"No, not Meredith."
"God, no."
Meredith's little sister.
Which one is she?
"The, uh, the... one with the juice box."
Are my new organs here yet?
"Mm, not yet."
Starting to see the light?
I'll give you three days.
"Get out, or you'll end up like your goddamned dog."
Translate.
Translate what I said.
How long has it been like this?
Just a few days.
So?
The symptoms- they're the same as the others'.
There's gotta be an explanation for what she has.
They say they don't know.
What is it?
Oh God!
Who the fuck did this?
What?
!
You okay?
Get your husband.
Who did this?
Who the fuck did this?
Jong-gu!
Jong-gu!
What's the matter!
Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
It's started.
You better brace yourself.
What I said the other day-we'll do it tomorrow.
Where is Hyo-jin?
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
"Hey, you now.. come here!"
Come here!
Indy!
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
"Oh, my God."
Marion.
These good people want to see me fuck you now.
No!
"We're gonna go away, We're gonna go away."
We're going to Berlin.
Right after you fuck me.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Berlin.
"Help me hold her down, she likes it."
It's Ok.
"It's Ok baby,"
No!
You'll die Adrian!
Kill me baby!
Kill me baby!
No!
What have we done?
Wait a minute.
We think clearly this cannot be explained.
It's easy to explain.
You wanna know who and what I am?
I'm a killer.
I kill with my cunt.
You can write about it... in Midnight Magazine.
Or National Enquirer.
It's gonna be a new sensation.
You wanted to know where I'm from?
I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.
Right!
Right!
isn't it better to open the bag and check?
Right!
- No!
Now it's not about the bomb exploding!
It's about my honour!
Now until the bomb doesn't explode..
..Give me the gun!
Hey!
- Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!
Otherwise I will shoot!
Give me the gun!
- Give the gun!
Otherwise he will shoot himself!
Please!
Give the gun!
- Quiet!
You don't say anything!
I will explode you before the bomb explodes!
"Albert, come here!"
- Fine..
I am normal with you!
Go and buy two batteries from the shop.
Go.
I don't have change.
Change!
I will give you.
But bring it quickly.
Go.
Go.
- No.
"You're doing the right thing, man."
- Send a postcard?
- Sure.
Call me.
Fly's down.
Honey.
Michael's coming over.
- You told him I was here?
- He knew.
"Come on, Mom."
"Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know."
"I know it hurts like hell and I am sorry, I really am."
"But you know, two days ago you told me these things happen..."
"You and Daddy have been together 30 years, Mom."
We aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know.
I know.
"And I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?"
I'm not.
There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable.
He did an awful thing.
"It's not an awful thing, Mom."
It's an unforgivable thing.
Unforgivable?
What do you want?
- I just want to talk to you!
- Get out of here!
It's over!
- Jenna?
- You hear me?
This sucker's got a lot of symptoms.
"No shissh, Sherlock."
Good luck faking the goiter.
Goiter?
"Oh, my God."
That's why they wanted to see my neck.
"Oh, good lord."
Ooh.
- It worked.
- Yay.
"She says she loves you and she's sorry and-- oh, she's sending you a picture."
Yes.
Perky.
Just erase it.
He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
Can't you see it's all wrong?
You're my girlfriend!
And you're my best friend.
"- Tony, I love her."
"- No, you don't."
"OK, maybe I don't."
He loves Cassie.
And you love me.
That works.
- We work.
- Why now?
It's too late.
"It's always been there, Michelle."
It just took a while.
I need you.
You can't have her.
It's wrong.
It's wrong.
That's all I'm trying to say.
"Everything's gonna be all right, Cass."

"Effy, 100% success."
My art coursework.
It's on the subject of emotion and you seem quite emotional.
So you can do it for me.
I'm Pandora.
I'm new.
Tell him I've discovered the power of the pussy.
And?
I'll sort out your fucking soap opera.
"And that, ladies, is why Monet was shit."
"Pilaf-sama, the boat's taking on water."
So row with all you've got.
"One, two."
"Pilaf-sama, it's no use."
"Okay, okay."
Come to the front.
Pilaf-sama...
"Don't cry, Mai..."
Easy for you to say.
"Don't cry, Siu."
"If we can just get the Dragon Balls, we can do whatever we want."
But we didn't even see them.
Are the seven Dragon Balls really even there?
"Mai, trust me."
They're on that ship.
P-Pilaf-sama.
Huh?
What?
Let's get out of here.
"How'd you like that, you dumb shark?"
.
"Pilaf-sama, we made it."
I thought I was going to die...
You two have done well.
Hey.
What're you doing?
Hey.
Climb this.
"You have my thanks, children."
What were you doing down there?
We're here for the Dra drama serial we're shooting.
Where're your cameras?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
Of course.
Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Goodbye, and thank you."
627...
Wait.
... 9 6... ... 6 1... .
... o 9.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
Hello?
"Marco, is that you?"
"Yes, Benigno."
It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
Where are you?
Outside the clinic.
Dr. Vega told me everything.
That was just an accident.
Come on.
Cheers.
- Straight As!
How does it feel?
- OK.
The best in the country.
"The minister of education says hi, by the way."
Don't you ever get laid?
- Of course I do.
- What now?
I'm going to do law at Harvard.
- I'II visit.
- Are we partying or what?
- I'm not sure about that.
- It's only X. Total love drug.
- We need love.
- I can't swallow pills.
- Just for fun.
"- What about you, kiddo?"
"Alex, isn't it tough always being daddy's boy?"
He's right.
You're such a girl.
Is it because your dad's a high court judge?
All right.
"- Welcome to the club, kiddo."
- He's doing it!
Cool!
Mind out.
Is he dead?
"Wake up, Alexander!"
Hi.
- What?
"It means that when you're in love, you're blind."
Ow!
"- Do you like life here, Anna?"
"- Yes, Paris is a big break for me."
That's not what I asked.
Show me your finger.
(sensual piano and flute music with female choir)
Don't be afraid.
(music starts building up)
"(music stops, Anna breathing heavily)"
"Just when I think it's over between us,   he's back in my face."
And I can't say no.
I've got to stay out of that crap.
"It's gotta be fun, for Christ's sake."
Right?
"It's gotta be fun, right?"
"It's gotta be fun, right?"
Fun's OK.
- Maybe fun's not enough anymore.
- You're a romantic!
So that's why!
I've met romantics before.
She's got to be special.
- She is.
- So there is someone.
I knew it.
Who is she?
- You know her.
- I know her?
"Oh, my God!"
It's Anna.
Not anymore.
You know why;
"Maybe you better not talk about it now, Doc."
Got to-- l'll tell you why.
Lutie.
I can say it now.
Lutie.
"Wouldn't let anybody speak her name, would you, Jim;"
But you gotta humor me.
"Last wish, you know."
All Lutie needed was a little help from you.
She had better coming than she got.
She never forgot her children.
She was all right.
And you sent her away twice.
Your fault.
"That's right, yours."
"People don't tell you that much, do they, Jim;"
Jim.
Jim.
You hear me;
"Yes, Doc. I hear you."
"You, you'll never change."
You still got that same look in your eyes.
"No, you'll never change."
The Doc.
"Out of his head, I guess, Jim."
"No, he was right."
Just right.
"He's gone, gentlemen."
"Colonel Brewton, I had no idea."
-Are you sure;
"- No, I'll walk."
- As you wish.
- How much?
450 francs.
"- No, keep it."
Good evening.
- Thank you.
"Say, Sir..."
I think your walk might be on the long side.
- On the long side?
"- Yes, it's quite far."
"- Come on, get in."
Tonight you get to ride for free.
"- Ah, thanks!"
"No, not back there."
"Up front, next to me!"
Thanks a lot!
- Who is it?
"- Me, Andrea."
- Hold on.
"Listen, Andrea..."
"It would be better if you went to sleep in Mimì's room, she's not feeling well."
What's all this about?
You gave me permission...
"- No, no..."
- Now you send me to sleep alone?
She really doesn't feel well.
I've made your bed in there.
- What happened?
"No, because..."
- She's just fallen asleep.
"But, I didn't do anything..."
–I know.
–When can I see them?
–Now?
I got to finish up somethin' first.
I'll be right there.
–Okay.
–Okay.
Looks like he's making a deposit.
"Yeah, you gotta love good intel."
Stay here.
Watch my back.
This is for my boy down the street.
Fully automatic.
You know what I get for those on the street?
Drop it!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Fingers interlaced!
Palms on the back of your head.
"Now, asshole!"
"Come on, man!"
Let's move!
Let's move!
–Vic!
–Stay back!
–Vic!
You been hit?
–I'm all right.
Get out of here.
–I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
–Just get out of here.
"–No, no, I'm not ditching you, man."
- Hi.
"- Hi, dear."
"- Hi, Emily."
"- Hi, Jer."
Come on in.
"Oh, hi, Howard."
Bob.
Happy birthday.
Here.
It's a cake.
"Well, I can only eat it if it's made out of water."
"Well, it almost is."
"Uh, let's see."
"It's made out of, your lettuce, bean sprouts, your ground carrots."
Sounds delicious.
"Well, we don't know, Bob."
Nobody's ever eaten one.
- Let me put it in the kitchen.
"- Yeah, and I'll make us all a drink."
"Oh, Thank you, Howard."
"Gee, if I'd have known it was gonna be formal, I'd have worn my cummerbund."
Go ahead.
Open her right up.
- What do you guys want to drink?
"- Scotch for me, Howard."
"- Uh, I'll have a glass of wine."
- Me too.
"- Uh, Bob?"
- What the heck?
It's my birthday.
Uh-
"Give me a glass of water, and... drop a ice cube in it for flavor."
Where's Sefton?
I don't know.
- He wouldn't be at the kommandant's?
"-I don't know, I told you."
What did the Krauts trade him for the radio?
I don't know.
- Why don't we look in these footlockers?
-No.
"Come on, you stooge."
Hand over them keys.
I haven't got any keys.
"- Okay, then I'll get me a key."
-Ow.
- Hey!
-Okay.
Hoffy?
- Okay.
"-Hey, wait a minute."
"Hey, don't."
Sefton will get mad.
Of all the hoarding cruds.
"Looks like Macy's basement, don't it?"
That kid's richer than my mother.
"Oh, shut up!"
For crying out loud.
What would he be doing with these?
Suppose you ask me.
"Go on, ask me."
Because I got the goods on Mr. Sefton.
Because this time he didn't shake me.
Take a look for yourself.
It'll curdle your guts.
I'd like to be brought back to the barracks.
I want to be with my brothers.
We shoot the tires.
Take out the guards.
"With machine guns, we won't make it 50 feet."
He's right.
We don't have the gunpower.
Hey!
Steady.
"You all right, mate?"
Ah!
Eric!
- Did you see that?
- Poor bastard.
I don't think the guards did.
Eric!
Eric!
Come on!
Oy!
You bloody goon!
"- Whoa, whoa!"
- You see what you did?
- You did this to him!
- Alfred!
What the bloody hell!
He was my brother!
You did this to him!
Shut your mouth!
"You make one more sound, I shoot you right there!"
Get back to work.
Schweinhund.
Anybody else have a problem?
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Hey, I got it."
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"- This is so hard, you know?"
- Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- You a cop?
"- No, no."
Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
"No, I am not a police officer."
"Okay, then."
Hundred and seventy-five for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."
All right.
There you go.
Enjoy.
"Thanks, man."
Albuquerque Police!
- I'm coming.
- Look after Gucci.
- But you're way till Sunday!
I've got Robbie Williams tonight.
Helene says Gucci can't be left on her own.
She gets scared.
Just do it.
Then you and I can do something nice next weekend.
Can we go to mum's?
It's her birthday.
- You know I can't.
- Why not?
You know my lawyer says we mustn't see each other.
But call me.
"- Hi, Yugo Danny."
- Fuck off.
- I thought the cops had got you.
- I need your blow.
Where the hell is that coke?
About fucking time.
- What's that?
- Sherbet.
What do you think?
My blow comes in one big bag.
There were problems.
That's not 20 grams.
"As I said, problems."
You get the rest tomorrow.
No.
I want it now.
Or you give back my card.
This is Alexander's.
"And something sweet, like a cookie or a piece of candy."
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.
I don't have that CD.
Uh-oh.
That's ourfavorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.
"Oh, but look."
- I have it.
- Go get the stuff.
"Don't forget the towel, the washcloths or the cookie."
- Or candy.
- Or candy.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Hey.
Ready to do this?
- I am.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"- Yeah, we're good."
"Okay, here are the rules."
You have to keep this pillow on your face.
You can't watch us.
- Okay.
- You can't touch us.
You can't touch our heads.
And we're not going to touch each other.
"And you have to tell us when you're going to ""scooch."""
- Okay.
"- So, take off your pants."
A bullet proof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
"- Come on, Jimmy!"
Me and you!
- Go on.
"Run, you son of a bitch."
Tommy!
I just want to talk to you!
"Tommy, what are you making me chase you for?"
"Come on, are you mad at me?"
I just shot my dad.
"Call me, Tommy."
"No, I'll call you."
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?
Where's Detillo?
- He's been shot!
Get off!
- I'm not getting off.
"Hardy, you son of a bitch!"
Get away from me!
You could never beat me!
You like to jump off bridges.
Who's the best cop now?
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.
"It wouldn't do any good, Eddie."
On the other hand...
Hardy!
You're okay.
"I hardly think she'd have the nerve to appear, let alone testify."
Have you heard what happened?
I was there.
I saw it.
You...
You mean you saw the man?
Did I?
"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.
"You know, Nancy never had a chance."
"Well, that explains everything."
I'll let you see for yourself.
(ALL MURMURING)
Mr. Wilbur Hoolick.
WILBUR:
Hello.
I...
I can do a trick!
Want to see it?
"Excuse me, Aunt Nancy, I'm gonna do a..."
Help me with the trick.
"Oh, Wilbur, stop."
Help me with the trick!
I want to do it!
One trick.
Hold my hands and then...
All right.
Oh!
I landed right on my feet.
Very suave.
"And, uh, and a good trick."
"Oh, swords!"
That's like the worst combination for you.
I know.
"Oh, just..."
I'm stuck.
"I'm sorry, Dale."
Jill...
You don't have to be sorry.
You just got a little wasted that's... all.
"Oh, I drank too much."
I'm never drinking again.
I've heard that one before.
I don't think he wants to marry me you guys.
And I'm getting married in three weeks.
Dale.
Don't worry about Drew right now.
"Just finish blowing chunks, ok?"
Why don't you go make sure everything's ok out there.
I'll stay here with Jill.
Ok.
"Listen, Hallie."
I'm really sorry.
Are we ok?
Yeah.
We're ok.
I said a lot of things I didn't mean.
I'm sorry.
"Jill, I'm so sorry."
Ok.
Look... what the cat dragged in.
Seven told me about your little...
surprise party.
It's your birthday so I wanted to come out.
♪ And your time (time) ♪ ♪ fades (fades) away (away) ♪
Woo!
"Cor, my main man."
- You all right?
"- Yeah, to see you."
"- Hello, boys."
"- Hi there, Gem."
"- And hi, Chris."
"- Hi, Luke."
You guys been here long?
Just got 'ere.
"So, uh, where's the party?"
Hello!
Here we go.
"Hi there, we've, uh..."
we've come for the party.
- The house is closed up.
"- Uh, we can see that, mate."
We're friends of Felix.
- Friends of Felix?
- It's his birthday.
You want the keeper's cabin.
You'll have to follow the track through the woods about half a mile.
"Right, uh, thanks."
You'll have to walk.
The track's too rough for city cars.
"Oh, okay."
"""Welcome to the country, folks."""
- Is it just me or is this a bit spooky?
"- It's just you, pussy."
- What's that?
- Do it!
That's my chips!
Alright.
"Catrin Pule, you're coming with me."
"Try again, Johnnie."
Positions.
No.
"No, no makeup."
Quiet please.
Quiet please everyone.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.
"Just a very quite click, please."
"It's hard to explain to a non-actor but I want to react to the sniper up there and not the click down here, you see?"
Is there a chance to find a real gunner up there?
No.
Right.
Up for take?
Sounds.
Sound rolling.
Scene.
"Dunkirk film scene 17, take 1."
Good luck Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Action.
Here boy.
Here.
Cmon boy!
Don't be a fool Johnnie!
There's a sniper out there!
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 kurz.
Best damn gun since the wor...that's the 73!
I...
I'm awfully sorry.
Do what I said!
Clear out or I'll call the cops!
Cops don't scare us!
"Down, everyone!"
Noses on the floor!
Move it!
Strip!
Kill me instead!
A short poem...
"I wrote it, so listen!"
"""Eddy..."
"""Loyal friend, goodbye,"
"""Prince of the B.R.I.!"
"""You're a man so true,"
"""We will all miss you."
"""Beloved by everyone,"
"""Without enemies, not a one."
"""You're so dear..."
Shaddup!
"""That we'll all shed a tear,"
"""A new life you've found, now you're Riviera-bound,"
"""Why go away, leaving Titi this way?"""
"Great, Titi!"
The gift!
"We'll see you soon, dear Eddy!"
"We'll meet again, for sure!"
"Shit, guys!"
A mouse!
Let's split!
"Bye, thanks."
- How you getting home?
- A ride with Smao.
- Darling.
"- Here, sweetie."
Excuse me.
Quico!
Maria is here.
- Look at her beard!
"- ""Her""?"
"Careful, kid!"
"What, you think my wife's beard is fake?"
- Is she really a woman?
"- Yes, sir."
Don't you mind that she has a beard?
I sure don't.
And she doesn't mind that I'm a fire eater.
- You eat fire?
- I do.
Do it for us.
Eat it!
Eat it!
Gather 'round for my amazing trick!
I am about to take this wooden match and light it!
Let's hear it!
Eat more fire!
"Just one more time, if you please."
Do not try this at home.
It's dangerous.
Playing with fire means you pee...
In bed!
Eyes on the fire.
"That's enough, Foguinho."
We have a show tonight.
Your stomach can't take this.
"- Listen if you're going, you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses."
Elaine!
Hey.
- How'd it go with Gary?
- Fine.
Fine.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Looks like something's on your mind.
"- No, nothing."
I'm fine.
So that's your poker face.
- A regular face.
"- No, it isn't."
I've seen your regular face.
That is not it.
What are you saying?
"All right, George, come on."
What do you got?
- I got nothing.
- What do got?
A pair of bullets?
What are you talking about?
Two pair?
Three of a kind?
- Will you stop it?
"- Oh, my God."
You got a flush.
- You're holding a flush.
- I don't have a flush.
A full house?
You got a full house?
- What is it?
I've always wanted a grandchild.
-And I a grandpa.
Senna...
Give grandpa a kiss.
We must find Jesse.
I told him that you two are my parents.
Shut up and listen.
Let him believe it's true.
Let him at least die happy.
Dad... it's me.
I'm a grandfather now.
I fired the rocket that burnt you.
It wasn't you.
It was the fire devil.
"Put him on a leash, son."
He's hallucinating.
Morphine often does that.
I want to be under the blue sky where the birds sing.
-I'll fix it.
How are you going to fix that?
I don't know but I'll think of something.
Will he live till tomorrow?
-Maybe.
"Jesse, wait!"
Where are you going?
I have to find out why I became a firefighter.
There are no devils in you!
Jesse.
Look!
Good old Tinky Winky.
This is my piece of meat!
Shut up and eat!
That's too much.
I don't want to get fat.
Idiot...
You were supposed to pick me up...
Who is this?
Can't I have friends?
"Friends, sure."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Watch it, you're only here because of me..."
OK OK.
I may as well clearthe table.
"Yeah, and the floortoo please."
Fuck off!
Mom...
Some snacks please.
I love you mom.
You're the best mom of all.
He's depressed.
He doesn't tell fortunes anymore...
I've been looking for a job all day.
I quit the cafe.
Fuck!
Did you get fired?
Boss kept nagging me about being late all the time.
And this military service thing suffocates me.
Shit.
Come here.
Fight at the bar?
Someone threw a bottle?
I got fired from the cafe.
Couldn't pay the rent...
What...
Who was it?
Her ex-boyfriend?
No!
"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi."
He checked out.
"Oh, God."
That's right.
You weren't at the meeting this morning.
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three.
Three.
Three.
Tres.
Three.
Hello.
Sorry.
Just remind me.
All right.
His name is Malcolm O'Dwyer.
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
He wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
Thank you very much.
Not you.
The lotto girl.
"""You'll thank me later!"""
That's not actually my line!
Mr. Monk said it first!
I'll be in touch!
"Hey, you."
Come here!
You got a lighter?
What the fuck you think I have arms for?
You're free to go now.
- You want a smoke?
- Yes.
"Henry, Akan's already started."
"If we do not stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
I can tell you something very important... about the man who sent you here.
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high class establishment.
Follow the door and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
Knock on the knocker!
Ella.
"Ella, you whore."
Take him to Jimmy.
Is this Jimmy?
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
A Lexus convertible!
I'm going back in there.
That thing's destroyer-class.
- It feels good.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Oh God, that's amazing."
Yes!
"Fuck, you're late!"
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.
- I love you.
"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
- Very loud.
"Yeah, it's very intense."
This is what men listen to.
Yeah!
This is like Satan's lullaby.
It's brutal!
It's masculine!
Yeah.
Who wants margs?
- I would love a marg.
- I'll take a marg.
Man marg.
"It's not strawberry, I hope you don't mind."
It's just traditional.
That's cool.
That's cool.
I'm okay with that.
"He also said, ""rocks,"" but whatever."
"You know, men, they..."
"Sometimes they don't get what they want, and they deal with it."
- They deal.
- 'Cause we're men.
Who the heck brought lettuce on this trip?
Men don't eat lettuce!
- I didn't pack lettuce.
- Men don't eat lettuce.
But I will put some Lawry's salt on these burgers.
Both:
Lawry's.
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"- I like that, man."
"- Yo, Blaze."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you."
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!

- Hollis.
I ain't troubling no one.
- Your neighbors are complaining again.
"You got to turn that music down and go back inside, son."
- It's a free country.
I can do what I want.
"- Come on, man."
Don't cause any more trouble.
We don't want to bring you in again if we don't have to.
Was it you?
Huh?
Fucking no-good coward.
"Hey, you got something to say to me, Harold?"
You say it to my face!
- Hollis!
Hollis.
"Hollis, that's enough."
That's enough.
Go in the house and sleep this off.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."
Really?
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
And that's the end of my 20-second break.
"Good luck, man."
"So, Emma, what kind of music do they play?"
It's like an '80s pop vibe mixed with a little Black Keys.
Cool.
This is gonna be painful.
Be nice.
"So, Emma, how do you know Mat?"
"I think what she's trying to ask is, does he have a girlfriend?"
That's definitely what she's trying to ask.
That's not what I was trying to ask.
Do you guys want me to ask?
"Hey, Mat!"
No!
That is not what I was asking.
He's single.
- Lou?
- Yeah.
Lucy.
We're Someone's Little Sister.

You wanted me.
- Why did you kill Foon?
- White Tiger killed him.
You're harboring a fugitive!
"Yes, so what?"
"While you're still alive, I'll only be second-best."
Only Lion's Roar Hall can beat Bo Chi Lam.
You've committed a terrible crime!
You must pay for it!
You're my problem!
Sifu Wong...
Stop!
"Sifu Wong, spare me!"
Please let me go!
Let me go!
I apologize!
I'll turn over a new leaf!

"Good try, asshole."
Speaking Japanese speaking Japanese
what happened?
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We lost taka.
What about the guns?
Gone.
It wasn't a complete loss though.
Kuauo got it out.
We got it out.
"Wow, this is great."
"This is your new place, huh?"
"No, yours."
Mine?
Mine?
You don't like it?
"No, no."
I mean yeah!
It's just that it's so big.
"You know, for one person."
Perhaps that will change.
What kind of bullshit is that?
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
What's happening here?
What are you talking about?
.
Brother Migs!
"If you're always like that,"
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I will really leave you!
...as her husband.
Brother!
Brother!
Oh no...
"Where are we going, sir?"
Do you know the way to Makati?
I'm lost.
I don't know...
I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
What is it?
You won't tell me.
I'm hungry.
We can go to my place.
- Who did you inherit it from?
- My great-aunt.
She was great.
She loved collecting things.
She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled.
This was her depot.
- Her depot?
- So to speak.
You'll see.
"The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed."
Almost everybody.
Yeah.
She saved my life.
Just because you went shopping once!
"OK, OK."
Forget it.
- Lf I'd only known before.
- What?
That you're such a great roommate.
Where are you going?
What?
"I have to pee, you dumb cow!"
Or maybe not.
Hello.
Good-bye!
Shit!
Just a minute.
Great.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
"(GROANS) Come on up, come on."
"Hey, come on."
"Here, take your coat off."
Here you are.
Yeah.
This is my place.
My humble home.
I know.
- You want to take your coat off?
"- Oh, thank you."
"Yeah, I'll set it right here."
"- So, er... drinks?"
"- Sure, of course."
"We have some wine, red wine, white wine."
- Erm... red.
- Red?
- Norm?
- Prosecco.
- Ah...
- Prosecco!
"That's fancy, Norm."
NORM:
"You know, I love movies."
So here's a line from a movie.
You have to guess.
"She says to a younger man who's trying to woo her, to flirt with her..."
"And she says to him, ""You don't want me."
"You want somebody young and fresh."""
"And she goes, ""Armies have marched over me."""
"- All right, guess that one."
- Right away.
Thank you.
All right.
Here they come.
All right.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Come on.!
Come on.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
"I'm telling you, I don't know where it is."
I buried it under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.
But that was a year ago.
The whole garden's changed since then.
"Ain't buying' it, Roger."
The sun's almost gone down and the race is over.
"If you don't get that money before they close this place, there's gonna be something else planted here."
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!
"Nine, 10, 11, 12..."
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!
This is ridiculous!
It's okay.
He can still win.
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!
"Come on, Magnum!"
- Come on!
So that we may continue the climb.
So it is witnessed.
So it will be.
So it will be.

More use to who?
I can't tell you that.
"The government gave Carlos Mejia, the man who gunned me down in cold blood, a deal?"
Yes.
And you let that happen.
"I didn't have a choice, Cali."
You didn't have a choice.
That doesn't sound like you.

Wow.
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
"Wa, wa, wa-wa!"
"Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!"
"Geez, man."
I'm surrounded by amateurs.
"[Scuttle] Wa, wa, wa, wa!"
You want something done you've got to do it yourself.
First we got to create the mood.

Yes.

- Now you know I exist.
- Yes.
I've got a pencil and some paper.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I better go now.
Bye.
I'II be home very soon.
Do I have any brothers or sisters?
"- No, not really."
- What do you mean?
There's a little boy at the orphanage called Pramod.
- Pramod?
"- Pramod, yes."
I've taken care of him since he was a baby.
- How old is he now?
- He'll turn eight in precisely a week.
He's this big.
"He's tiny, but he want's to be a footballer."
"Maybe it's stupid, but I brought some pictures, if you'd like to see them."
"Yes, please."
Here I'm taking a bath.
"That's Lennart, my first boyfriend."
He had a moped.
- But he didn't want me.
I led him to Minks' daughter.
What if something goes wrong?
How long will you stay?
A week?
A month?
"Then you'll be gone, and I'll be free for slaughter."
You are already.
Gentlemen...
Nowthe back.
What if he doesn't get in touch?
Don't worry.
He won't pass up this opportunity.
Go on.
Talk to her.
Irezumi!
"Take the suitcase to Convention Center, place it in a van with the number 1969."
We have to put something in it.
"Lynn's tattoo, the 3rd Hiromitsu."
When's the exchange?
- Midnight.
Just one more hour.
Come on.
I'm here.
Do you have me?
I see you.
The transmitter's working.
Midnight.
"Okay, Poscher, let's go."
Take the suitcase and get out.
Check if one of the vans has the number 1969.
I got it.
Try the doors.
May he do the same for you.
Have hope.
You deserve it.
PAULITO:
"La Primera lives, ese."
It lives through us.
It gives to us.
It is us.
"SimÃ²n, ese, it's all we got."
It's all we've ever had.
"Carnal, remember that time we went down to the L.A. River?"
"We drank that funky, funky wine, ese."
"Man, I was sick for a week."
You wanna know what Lourdes asked me?
I'm telling you this 'cause you're my carnal.
"She wanted to know if the reason why they call me ""Little Puppet"" was..."
You know.
Made me real angry.
I think she's pregnant now.
"I guess I showed her, huh?"
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.
Don't fight.
"Please, don't fight!"
J ust die!
J ust die.
Mi carnalito.
God damn me.
Coming out?
Paulito.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Your brother sent this for you.
"Everyone get insomnia, now and then."
Stevie.
I haven't slept in a year.
Jesus Christ!
I tried him too...
Sorry.
Hello?
Yeah.
No I can't.
I can't talk now.
Okay.
"My ex, he's a fucking Psycho."
"Trevor, I'm worried about you."
"Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia."
"I hope not, you are my best client."
Can't afford to lose ya.
"Gee, thanks."
"Reznik, I need a hand."
"Gotta get this dead level here, help me out."
- Safety on?
"- Oh, yeah."
How's that?
"No, still off."
Is that any better?
"Hey, do your sleeping on your own time."
I need some help here.
Better.
It's now level.
Try the other side.
I hate this bitch.
Hey!
what did you do?
"Yahoo, ya motherfucker!"
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
Shot in the foot.
He's fine.
So he got shot in the foot.
"What is it, a big fuckin' deal?"
"Vito, get a towel."
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
"Don't get me upset, now."
"Don't make a big fuckin' thing out of it, Spider!"
Ya little prick.
You trying to make me think what I did here.
It was an accident.
Fuck him.
Little fucking actor.
-You in?
-l'm in.
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
"Karen, will you grow up!"
Stop.
I'm still gonna go out!
"Not without your car keys, you're not."
Are you nuts?
What's your problem?
It may interest you.
But personally...
May I get out here?
- Where are you going?
"- To school, this way."
I'll drop you.
I'll see Farzad too.
"He has exams, I'll see what he's done."
"Sir, thank you."
Thank you again.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- Are those the exam papers?
- Yes.
- Don't be too harsh on them.
- l'm not.
Tell our little colleague to come and see me.
Excuse me!
- What?
- Please do me a favour.
Don't tell Farzad what we were just saying.
All right.
Don't worry.
"Go on, get in the other side."
"Hurry up, get in."
- l can't come now.
- Why?
I need one more answer for the exam.
What is it?
The fourth question.
- You don't know the answer?
- No.
Red Cross!
- Hello?
- Hey!
Hello.
Is your mom home?
"No, she's not home."
She's not upstairs?
We heard something.
"No, that was our dog."
- She's not home?
- No.
It's our dog.
When does she get back?
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where can we wait?
Let's see how much we raised.
- The money also?
- I can count everything.
- What a bad handwriting.
- Yes.
Like a doctor's prescription.
Barely legible.
You want to go to school again?
- Well ...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school?
- In Vienna.
"It's a lot busier there, huh?"
We have already picked up a nice sum.
"If everyone continues to give as much, we did well."
We'll see how much more we get.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
She still is.
Roommate I.D'd the photo as a Jordan Arnold.
Run the DMV.
Get me an address now.
We're running out of time.
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
Break it down!
This is a waste of time.
We don't need him anyway.
I need him.
"If he's a member of the resistance, he may be able to help me contact my ship."
Monster!
He's the one.
He took your mother.
We have to...
They want a fight.
Don't give them one.
What?
I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.
Please!
Please...
You look like a helpful citizen.
"So, tell me."
You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today.
"No, sir."
"No, I've seen no one."
Please.
You!
"I'm looking for someone, a woman."
I haven't seen any woman.
There are two right over here.
"You see them, don't you?"
Yes.
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
Caylem...
Please.
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacksin there.
"Yeah, in there."
So your name's Henry and...
"Okay, what a good news is that you gonna a while."
"Bad news is that in this case,"
"""a while"" means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky."
Which you are.
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, Shit."
We got ?
on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's no clothes in here.
Put the hoodie on.
"There's no enough time, fuck."
Just cover the blood up with the your bag.
Just stay calm and let me handle this here?
Maybe we can skip right to the fine?
So...
Shit.
Fucking Akan paying...
Do you know what's wrong with Mother Russia?
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
As you wish.
"Master, he's right!"
Seems like he's not bad
What did you say?
Master is angry!
No wonder you can't win over him!
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Master!"
Master's technique is good
But now he can't even stand still
He was defeated in at least six or seven stances
He picked up the brick
The brick?
You bastard!
Master!
Stay there!
Don't run
It's me!
"Master, stop it!"
Stop it!
You bastard!
How dare you beat me up!
I didn't mean it!
"You did, too!"
And you beat me so hard?
It's just a mistake!
Mistake?
It's more than one time
"No, Master can't take it"
Dad!
"T ell me, who taught you those stances?"
Me
I taught him!
And a six.
Pair of threes still best.
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
"Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me?"
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal...
-...the poor box?
-Ha.
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.
I believe you.
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.
"Oh, Christ!"
I should have been there.
I wasn't there.
Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
Good night.
- Yeah.
What did you want to tell me?
"You know, it..."
It's just work.
I should go.
Big day today.
Thanks for the coffee.
Every time.
Bring up retail.
"How may I assist you this morning, Mr. Larson?"
I wanna buy something for my wife.
What's the occasion?
Just because.
May I suggest jewelry?
I thought you might.
How about a ring?
A silver band.
Lined with amethyst.
Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone?
I just think it would look nice.
"Hey, that one."
It's perfect.
[pop music playing]
Pretty.
Can I have it?
No.
Don't touch that.
I got an idea.
♪
Don't move.
I'm gonna smack that ball into Lake Michigan.
[grunts]
"-Aye, free."
And we'II take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
-For now.
-Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'II buy you a refreshment.
"please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'II buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will."
-I will.
-I will.
-Me!
Me!

"Please, I don't mean to interrupt but am I close to the end of this bridge?"
"No, far from it."
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!
I can explain everything!
"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Shut up!
Henschke!
We'll leave for a couple of days.
I'll let you know where we are.
Quiet!
You're coming along!
"Hey Mr Biberkopf, how are you?"
You've been away for a long time. 3 weeks.
Glogg stove?
"No, look."
- I'm not gonna buy that.
- It's a bandage anyway.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.
What's that about?
"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."
Car accident.
Knock on the knocker!
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
Lexus convertible!
"Oh, that's good."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God, that's amazing."
Yeah!
"Fellow, you're late!"
You're late!
"The last 15 minutes... have been a fucking rollercoaster of emotions for me, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I fired up some of this shit.
"Fire up my fucking nose, yeah?"
But there you are.
"It's okay, Henry."
You just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
And... my heart is broken.
Yeah.
Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
What?

Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!

"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"

"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."

Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.
I knew it.

"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
WOMAN 1:
You're doing a great job.
"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget."
Hi!
WOMAN 2:
"Oh, my goodness."
That is the reason!
That will deepen the hatred between us.
I don't care!
You want us to kill own men!
"Yes, kill them all!"
- And if we won't?
- And if we won't?
"Listen, I want you to fight with your own men."
Only the winning side can survive.
Or all will be killed.
We have no choice!
"Tat-chi, do your best!"

"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.

This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.

"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.

"Well, now that's depressing."

I don't know.
"Ok, then let's go the other way with it, ok?"

Ok.

The thing is they use very good fabric.

"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!
Dave!
Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
I didn't get your invitation card.
Damn it.
"If I'd a gun,"
I'd have blown his head off.
"Pity, you've been suspended."
I'll get a gun tomorrow.
Is that easy to buy one in HK?
"A toy gun would do, baby."
This is it.
Chinese Tea.
You can go home when we are done.
Sure.
Take care of Lisa.
I know you'll take good care of her.
Scorpion Yong.
"You want trouble, I'll give you trouble."
Revenge?
Lucky I heard about it...
Fight me!
Try fighting with my gun!
Fight now?
"Michael, wait."
Be careful...
Did you kill my brother Lin Long?
Lin Long?
I killed many in my fights.
But we'd signed fight contracts.
Which clan are you from?
We are the police!
"Whatever, please put down your gun."
I'm afraid of guns.
I beg you.
Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!
"To me, she looks like a ravishing film-star!"
Don't touch me.
Or else...
I haven't yet.
But here goes!
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.
Let go of my hand!
Let go of her hand first.
"Go away, Janki."
"Come along, aunty!"
Take the doctor and leave!
"Take Mom away, Bharti!"
"Let's go, Mom!"
Please!
I'm about to lose my temper!
Let go of my hand!
No one dares touch me here!
Bloody rat!
You can touch women!
"But women can't touch you, eh?"
I want to ask your Mom what she ate before delivering you!
Shera!
Ashok!
Kaliya!
I spare you because you're a woman.
Or else...
Don't just stand here!
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"
Josie!
Josie?
!
Don't!
Don't!
Please don't lock me in here!
Don't!
Please!
No!
I just want to go home!
Please!
Lies.
Lies.
Lies!
I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
"If nothing else, kill me, please."
Make this end.
- You're gonna be...
"You're gonna be okay, Mary."
You're gonna be okay.
"- ""The gardens at midnight... beneath the gnome."""
- Isabel.
- Ah!
"Foul demon, leave me be!"
- What's wrong with you?
- He knows everything.
You will tell him and he'll hurt me!
- Isabel.
Isabel.
"Please, you can trust me."
- You keep calling me Isabel.
I am Mary.
But I remember you.
Margaret!
"- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?"
What did they do to you?
- I dreamt I killed you.
- I'm still here.
- Did I hurt you?
Margaret!
No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...
"- Now, where were we?"
- My plan.
I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.
Hey!
I asked you to sit down.
Get that thing out of my face.
I've been abducted by aliens.
You think I care about your little toy trumpet?
( group gasps )
RAY:
"You sit down, hero, or I will shoot your bride-to-be."
DR PENZLER:
"Ray, I'm sure if we talk about this, we can work it out."
"Ray, listen to Dr Penzler."
It's gonna be all right.
DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
I would.
I know you would.
–Who did this to you?
–Fleetwood.
That prick that got Joe kicked off the force?
Yeah.
Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.
Okay.
You gotta stop him.
"–Come on, guys."
We're losing blood.
–Just hang in there.
–Gotta go.
–Just hang in there.
"Detective Wyms, Carlson just called."
There's a homeless guy with a bloody machete saying he killed somebody.
–Where?
–Just south of Bell on Vine.
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?
I don't know.
Maybe he's checking in on Vic.
Have you heard anything?
Not yet.
Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
They got the guy?
"–Sir, put the knife down, please."
–I'll kill again!
What are you doing?
"Between you and me, I can't wait to find out."
"Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can..."
Clara!
Doctor!
That was stupid!
"You were stupid, too!"
"I'm allowed, I'm good at stupid!"
That's the way to do it!
Why does she keep saying that?
"Mirroring, random mirroring."
We need to get on the roof.
This way!
"I do the hand grabbing, that's my job, that's always me!"
"Come on, quickly!"
Agh!
What are you doing?
My bustle is stuck.
Your bustle?
!
You're going to have to take those clothes off!
I didn't mean...
I know.
"I understand, I do."
Good.
What's the plan?
Who said I've got a plan?
Course you've got a plan.
You took that.
Maybe I'm an idiot.
"You're not, you're clever."
Really clever.
"Brucey, Moreno, Lung-Dog..."
"I mean, all those guys started investing a couple months back."
They're doing well.
"I mean, so..."
"Like, if those idiots can do stuff in the stock market, why can't I?"
"Oh, my God, what are you gonna..."
You're gonna apply your grade nine education to the stock market?
I'm not...
That's...
Shh.
Yeah.
Go.
Be quiet.
Hey.
Sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, what's up?"
Tim here?
Billy.
Yeah.
Came to bring you this.
What's this?
It's the money you owe those guys.
I don't want you to get beat up again.
I'm not bringing you into this.
"You're not bringing me into anything, Tim."
Is this why you came over?
Yeah.
And I'm not...
I'm not coming back here anymore.
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
"I've looked everywhere, Max."
Where could she be?
"Well, look at what the catfish dragged in."
[Laughs] Look at ya.
Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it.
"It's your hairdo, right?"
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No?
"No, huh?"
"Well, let me see."
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
"She's got legs, you idiot!"
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs.
"Geez, man!"
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
"She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her."
[Sebastian] And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs!
On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
He looks like one of those make-believe toys.
"You know, like you wind up."
He's beautiful.
"I hope Ralph'll like him as much as you do, Ed."
"Oh, boy, I'm telling you, when Ralph sees this little fella here, he'll go out of his mind."
(Alice speaks indistinctly)
Put him back in the box 'cause I got to feed him now.
"Supper in bed, huh?"
"Boy, they talk about a dog's life."
TRIXIE:
Alice!
"Oh, Alice!"
"There it is, the voice of doom."
"Oh, Ed."
"What is it, Trix?"
TRIXIE:
Come on up.
Your mother's on the phone.
"Oh, I'll be right up."
Thanks.
"Go ahead, go, go, go, go."
I'll take care of the pooch.
I'll feed him.
What do I do?
"Oh, you just take two spoonfuls of this dog food and put it on that plate and just give it to him."
- Gotcha.
"-Thanks, Ed."
"Here it comes, poochy!"
Here's your din-din!
There we are.
That a boy.
"Eat up, eat up, eat up."
Did your mother change her mind?
No.
I didn't get on the plane.
Can you hide me?
Come in.
-You're so slow!
-Who's slow?
"It's really nice in here, isn't it?"
This is really what I want to do.
On the anniversary of the day we first met.
"-Wait, what are you looking for?"
"-Wait, don't move too much."
Wait!
"-Wait, wait a second!"
Wait!
-What are you looking for?
.
Where could it be?
"Here, here, here, here!"
Is this what you're looking for?
.
"Hey, wait!"
Wait!
Can you see that tree?
.
It's been there since I was young.
"You know, whatever storm comes, whatever kind of earthquake,"
It's still standing.
"Joy, I promise you."
That tree is as strong as my love for you.
"If you can't answer now, it's okay."
Here.
You okay?
"I'll call the ambulance, okay?"
Mary.
"- Yeah, hey, this is Detective Ben Wesley."
- Help me.
Help me.
I need an ambulance to 1287 Monument Drive.
"Yeah, male, 40s, gunshot wound to the chest."
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
And then he pinned me down and shot me with pento.
"And I really thought, ""This is it."""
"And it's true, you know, that cliche?"
Your life really does flash before your eyes.
And then you were there.
"Uh, look, we can take it from here."
We'll get the results back shortly.
Okay.
I'm glad you're okay.
"Am I okay, Ben?"
Ma'am.
I'm here to take you home.
"Yeah, wait, you sure you don't need to go to a hospital?"
I'm sure.
"I'm a doctor, remember?"
Yeah.
"Grady's gun is a 9-mil, same as the bullet we found in Sid Thomas-Haye."
"Yeah, we're gonna have ballistics compare."
Let's get it on.
Now I know nothing about this guy.
Take him out quick.
Ready?
Fight!
That's it.
That's it.
man.
You look really good.
doing some fighting?
man.
Price.
I hear ya.
No harm in asking.
- All right.
- Nice fight.
Thank you very much.
I'll be talking to ya.
Price.
it's so nice not having to go to work.
I could do this every day.
You'd get bored.
I wouldn't.
honestly.
I do this nearly every day.
You'd get bored.
A man needs a reason to get up in the morning.
So is that why you stopped fighting and moved out to this bumfuck town?
I didn't stop fighting.
And I certainly didn't move here.
I had no choice.
What do you mean? I'm in the witness protection program.
Don't worry about it.
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.
Ignore that.
Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Do it!
Aah!
My gosh!
In your face!
That is bullshit!
"No, no, no, that is such bullshit."
"Let's go again, double or nothing."
"Double or nothing, let's go again."
- Let's go again.
"- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy."
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.
"Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?"
You don't have to be a pussy.
"And he's, like, so cranky."
He's so cranky.
Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy...
"Keep talking, Freddy."
Keep talking.
"- Jesus, calm down."
- Keep talking.
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Apologize to the lady.
"""No!"
Get the fuck off of her!
"""Get the fuck off of her!"
"""She's coming home with us!"
She's coming home with us!
"""Get the fuck--get-- Get off of her!"
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"""Stop it, bitch!"
Stop it!
Ha!
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
"No, let me talk to her."
"""Karen, look at me, Karen."
"""Sweetie, you're drunk, okay?"
"""If he wants to take you out, he's gonna wait"
"""till the freakin' sun comes up and take you out"
"""on a respectable date like an adult."
"""We came together."
We're leaving together.
"""Fuck you, Tyrone!"
We came together.
"We're leaving together."""
"And then the girlfriend-- Then the girlfriend, she's all fucking like this."
"She's like, ""I don't know, Karen."""
Her name's Karen too.
"""I don't know, Karen."
"""I mean, he's still nice."
"""I really can't stand up straight right now,"
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.
Chopin.
Do you love me?
"God help me, I do."
You are superb.
Don't.
What is wrong?
I'm frightened.
Of me?
Certain acts are unseemly.
They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
Thas all.
Is no big deal.
We just used up a little gas.
"Look, not a scratch oh, the starter needs adjusting."
"If you want me to fix it, I've got a screwdriver."
Go ahead...
Listen to their sob story.
You'll cry your heart out.
Wait...
listen.
I said hands up.
"Hey, Carnoles!"
Need the police?
I'll call them.
Wait...
There's something you ought to know...
We had a run-in recently in a five-and-dime store.
So we're kind of on parole.
Next time is jail.
"We don't want to go to jail, sir."
Poor slobs.
I'll put you in jail myself.
"Hey, how 'bout giving these hippies a haircut?"
"We're in France, all right!"
Watch out!
Jean-Claude!
What?
I'm all bloody.
Get a doctor.
What a mess!
Whas going on?
Have to get another car.
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.
- You know what?
You are so cute when you pout.
There's no other woman.
At my age.
At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
Ab!
Hello!
-Wait a moment.
We've not seen each other for so long.
Come in.
I have to finish something for a party.
Before the children come out of the cinema.
You're a better grandpa than me.
"-Yes, but they're not my grandchildren."
They're my children.
-Oh.
Late happiness.
Thanks for the... coffee!
"My ass is spreading, that's bad."
"I don't mind, I love big asses."
Know what my big ass says to you?
That it misses me.
Sunday's my dad's 70th birthday.
He hopes we'll come.
There'll be a crowd.
You don't have to talk.
- What crowd?
- My mom's family.
"Uncles, aunts, cousins coming from Rome."
We'll see.
"Lola, hurry!"
"Bye, daddy-o."
"Bye, honey."
6 slugs were fired.
"2 hit the driver, 1 the goon, 3 Zerbib."
No one saw much.
The building's all oldies.
"By the time they shuffled to a window, it was all over."
But the concierge saw a girl get out of the Merc and run away.
"Brunette, red coat, a BJ artist."
Zerbib liked cheap whores.
We'll find her.
"That's for Homicide, not us."
You knew him well?
Enough to want to nab his killer.
"Vrinks, bri."
The names Horn and Boulanger.
Give me all you've got.
What's with the Zerbib case?
We're talking about 100's square miles of forest.
Be patient.
"Ronon's been going up against the Wraith, one on one, for the last seven years."
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
And exactly how is he gonna do that?
I also have good hearing!
Right!
Carry on!
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I am not sure.
What do you mean?
"There is a presence here, but it is different."
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Dammit!
It's in there.
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.
- Did you see it?
- No.
"- Well, so how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female!
Ellia?
- Get out of the way!
- Please don't shoot!
She's not what you think!
She's my daughter.
She means you no harm!
"Oh, same old, same old."
You?
Yep.
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.
What happened?
Where is she?
"Well, you were right."
We shouldn't have left.
No.
Hungry?
"Next time, you'll listen to me."
I'm home.
"Teeth brushed, ready for bed."
Safe and sound.
"Oh, good, good."
I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
"No, no, no."
Uh...
Not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?"
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
- Such a liar.
"- No, I'm serious."
"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.
Mr. Crusoe.
I thought you'd forgotten us.
Are you going to be leading us?
I'll leave that to you.
Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
Lancaster.
Unshackle the men.
"Come on, let's go."
"Get up, Velasquez."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sots!"
They're in disarray.
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Fire.
Reload!
No!
"No, wait!"
Hold your fire.
One more shot and I kill her.
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
A night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.
"Yeah, what's up?"
What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.
"I'll be right there, okay?"
Sorry.
"Hey... 2 beers, please."
Recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter.
Got it?
She's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie?
"This is Marc, the friend I told you about."
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her.
You really just want to talk?
What if she doesn't want to?
- What?
Go back to her old man?
Will you leave her alone?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
"- Man, I have my rights."
"- What do you mean, your rights?"
"Who's the boss here, huh?"
"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
- I am.
- You are?
- What are you doing here?
Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.
"Don't talk back to me, man."
What are you doing here?
"- We saw the car, man."
- You heist this car?
No.
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
"- All of you, come on."
- Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.
"You dumb spics, get outta here!"
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!
[Police Radio Chatter]
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.
- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
Did you say anything stupid?
"By ""anything stupid,"" I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago.
Go on.
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Brandon Mayhew.
Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
- Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me
# I know I messed things up and got them wrong
# That can't be changed with just a song
# I really want our lives to intertwine
# To make you proud
# To bring you joy
# So you can say
"# Yes, he's my boy"
# He's mine. #
"Thank you, Baker."
You'll hear from your teacher.
Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.
"Give me a sec, Tom."
Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
We're gonna miss out on all this money.
- Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
- I know.
Come on.
You could kick...
You-You could kick that guy's ass.
You think?
"Oh, my God."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know."
I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
- You almost hurt him once.
- With the bottle?
"- Yeah, and that's next to impossible."
- That was good.
- You're...
You're good.
- I am good.
Yeah.
Tell you what.
Um...
Why don't you go stretch out.
I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Goddamn it.
"- Frankie, what's the deal?"
- She got arrested.
- Ah!
I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
- So we'll never get the fight.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!
Me!
Kinotar presents
A SUBURBAN TALE
Directed by Sakari Kirjavainen
My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
I'll look for her later!
I was dead.
"I mean,"
I was really dead.
Really.
Tell me about it.
What's it like to be dead?
I'd got loose.
It were as if I was getting out of my body.
"My body was staying here, and I..."
I was flying.
You were floating?
Yes.
"I heard that dog, and a woman screaming."
"They were around me, panicking and... then I heard that noise."
It was like a whistle.
"A very, very loud whistle."
I saw... a light.
A light?
Yes.
It was alive.
It was alive as if it were waiting for me.
I was in the light.
I felt good.
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.
But you did come back.
Yes.
Why did you come back?
I just did.
Something made you come back.
Is there something you're holding back?
"in ""Assistant""."
I left my coat on the bus.
- Can you describe it?
"Yes, it had eight wheels, hard plastic seats, and when it stopped, it went, ""sh-h-h-h"""
"Harry, he means the coat."
"- Oh, oh!"
"Um, well, it kind of looked like this one, only it was furry.."
don't have it.
Next.
Night Eddie.
- See you Monday.
He's got my coat.
"- Harry, be a man."
"Hey, Mister, that's my coat."
No it isn't.
"- Yeah, that's his coat."
"If it's his coat, how come I'm wearing it?"
Good point.
Hey babes.
"Good morning Dick, did you sleep well?"
"Once the adrenaline wore off, like a baby."
"You know when you've been riding the bullet train to ""yuk-ville"", it's kind of hard to slow down."
I've been up all night faxing jokes to Leno.
What have we here?
Eleven banana cream pies!
One for every letter in my name.
Am I right?
Right.
Oh girls.
You shouldn't have.
"Oh, we had to."
Really.
I didn't see anyone either.
I made it up.
I am not going to drive my son around until he's 40.
The only thing stronger than Manny's fear is his need to protect his mama.
"Oh, no!"
He got away!
"But you did very good, Manny."
That was a frickin' rush!
But we're not giving up.
We're gonna find that guy.
No!
Are you sure about this?
Just go.
I'm walking home.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
Can everybody just shut up?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
- Stop.
"- What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
Is that your hot wife I hear?
"Hey, is she still taking those yoga classes?"
Hanging up.
W-w-wait.
Wait.
Real quick.
"The listing at 225 cedar street, it's mine now."
You poached my listing?
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
"One time, we had a warning of an attack."
We had the entire village like this.
"When the raiders came, we jumped up and chased them back to the beach."
But there was one small problem.
You couldn't find the village again.
Have I told you the story before?
"Now, remember, just remove the leader."
Jacob moore.
"If we take him, we gain a significant advantage."
There!
- Get after it!
- All right!
What witchcraft is this?
What are ya?
Nolan!
Atkins!
Come help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
"Where are ya, ya dog?"
"Now, what have we here?"
You're a demon... come to trap me!
"No, it's us!"
"Will, nolan!"
It--it was here.
What was?
A net!
- A net?
"- A net, aye!"
It caught me in a net!
It tried to capture me.
Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on.
It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.
If...
Look.
I have to disconnect.
Look...
"Yeah, that's cool."
'Cause I don't see no bwoy.
"Well, I suppose that is a matter of opinion."
I suppose.
(grunts)
Oh--
You're home early.
Mmhmm.
They changed my shift.
I'll get you food.
"I like dat, you should wear it more often."
Well it doesn't help much with finding work.
(kisses teeth)
Excuse me?
"Listen girl, no decent folk is going to hire any deportee, alright?"
That's just great.
"Alright, alright, listen!"
None of dat is my business anyway.
But you?
You have a problem.
But I tied him up.
Fine!
Fine.
I will go find him then--
"But I bet you could, right?"
It's doubtful.
That's almost $200!
"Uncle Archie, I can't afford that!"
"Well, Marva, there are other ways to pay for tings."
Hm?
♪
- No.
It's our dog.
Uh-huh.
When will Mom be back?
Hmm?
Um...
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where should we wait?
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.
- The money too?
"- Yeah, I'll count it."
Okay.
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.
You'd swear a doctor had written it.
It's barely legible.
Looking forward to school?
- Well...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.
A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.
"If somebody else gives as much as him, we'll have done pretty well."
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how much more we get.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.
( indistinct chatter )
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
"""..."
"Even holy waher cannoh whihen you."""
How do you know that poem?
Our teacher recites poems to us from time to time.
For homework?
No.
He recites and I learn them.
You must be a good student.
Yes.
Well done!
What grade did you get in the third term?
We haven't finished our exams yet.
"In the second term, then?"
Twelve.
And the first term?
Ten.
When do the exams end?
They start today and go on for two weeks.
- Good luck.
- Come in.
How is she?
Who?
- You don't know who I mean?
- Mrs Malek?
She's so-so.
What does that mean?
She's still in bed.
"She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak."
"Wait, I'll fetch it."
Here.
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
"That's, please don't take that call."
"I've got to, booty calls."
"I'm looking for the truth, Mr Sugar."
Alan?
"Alan, someone who's smashed up the shop."
Mr Sugar?
"You got some sort of problem, boy?"
We've got some talking to do.
And I'm looking for the truth.
"Yeah, well, I'm telling you the truth."
You want to smash my shop up?
Not particularly.
"Let's smash, let's smash it up."
Let's smash it up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's smash it up!
I appreciate you're a little bit angry...
HE LAUGHS
Have one!
Have one!
These are beautiful.
They're great.
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to know?
Have a nice fruit salad.
One of your five-a-day.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You can eat them...
Why have you got it in for Cowell?
"Cowell sent his boys around here, did you know that?"
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
He's in the Army.
At Angelras.
That so?
Is cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
French is $15.
"And anything special will cost you $25, okay?"
"Yeah, baby."
"Handcuffs, that'll be $35, okay?"
"Uh, they're for you, baby."
"I'm a cop, and you're under arrest."
"Oh, shit, what kinda shit is this, man?"
"You know this is entrapment, man."
"Aw, my man is the man, holy shit."
What the fu...
Who the fuck are you now?
"Uh, what-what's um..."
Where am I now?
"What, uh... who..."
What's this room?
I don't understand.
I never seen this place before.
Nobody ever did anything.
[Indistinct mumbling]
"Uh, is this... is..."
Where's everybody else?
What do you want?
I want the person who killed the ghouls.
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't tell you...
I don't know nothin' about that.
I can't...
I can't tell you what I don't...
Wha...
Those are my things.
"Um, do... are you..."
Are you new?
- We can't lose him.
My husband's a good man.
You can't do this.
George is gonna die.
They see this is a con.
- They're gonna kill him.
- We got to go.
It's not just him at risk.
It's you too.
"And, by the way, the FBI, so let's get real here."
I'm not going to give up on my husband.
"Salt, at the end of the day, you're a Federal Agent."
"We do not negotiate with terrorists, and I'm sorry, but you know that."

Aborting now.
Pack it up.
♪
Do not let your husband die for them.

[Plane engine humming]
It's time to move.
"Salt, get in the van now"
I'm going to go get George myself.
"Salt, stop."
Think about what you're doing.

Truth.
Who do you think should take the test next?
No one.
No one should.
"You have to choose a friend, or take the test yourself."
- Who're you gonna choose?
- Fuck you!
5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...
Chris!
- I'm so sorry.
"- Now that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Sorry.
I need a drink.
Luke... please.
Look in the drawer of the workbench.
Find something you can use as a weapon.
"Something small enough to hide, a s-screwdriver maybe."
- He's too fast.
"- No, no...not when he spins the bottle."
"When he spins the bottles, he's distracted."
"If you can get his gun, this is all over"
"I don't know, mate."
"He's going to kill us, Luke."
"And when he's killed us, he'll kill you."
Didja get that?
He'll kill you.
Chris... shall we?
It was me.
I sent the postcard.
I confess.
You were in Spain.
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?
Right!
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
I'm telling you!
No one owes me money!
I'll break your neck!
What are you staring at?
You don't know me?
You look rough!
But you're a coward!
Just wait till you meet my sister!
Mousy!
What are you doing?
I'm scolding him!
Who is he?
Me.
You're useless.
Have you collected the money?
I've collected...
Some more clothes.
More clothes?
Take off your clothes.
I'll wash them too.
It doesn't matter.
Take them off!
Money?
Where's the money?
"I was chased by dogs, and Biggie threatened to kill me..."
We'll never survive like this!
- But Biggie was tough!
- Why not say that you're scared.
You're a coward!
Admit it!
Wake up!
You fool!
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?
Counting now...!
"5, 4..."
- Can't you slow down?
"- 3, 2, 1...!"
Damn it!
Still 2 more customers?
"won't scratch the backs of foreign devils, get lost!"
"I wouldn't do it for more money, damn it!"
Damn it again!
It's dangerous!
"Gosh, I forgot to ask where the Jew is!"
You're Yoyo?
"Yes, this is he!"
Prove yourself.
My father said so.
How did he know?
My mother said so.
"Alright, I believe your mother."
Thanks.
Who are you?
- Helle's my last name.
- Hello!
- Not Hello!
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor.
Now go before I change my mind.
"Actually, I get two favors."
What?
"Well, the way I see it I could have killed you twice."
The poison and when you were knocked out.
I didn't!
What do you want?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(HOOK LAUGHING)
You are bloody brilliant.
Amazing!
(LAUGHS)
May I see it?
The compass?
It's more beautiful than legend.
(CHUCKLES)
"Come, let's go."
(CLANK)
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Hook, I... (SIGHS) I can't..."
"Emma, look at me."
Have I told you a lie?
"I brought you here, I risked my own safety to help you."
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry!
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."
- With what?
- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?
"- Sorry, we just wanted to ask..."
All right.
Go!
Good-dye!
I can't take any more!
A little trout for my little princess.
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Is it that dastard who's making you cry?
I'll kill him!
Luigi!
Renato!
Hello.
Renato.
Hello.
Don't scream.
Not a word.
The others are out there.
Just act natural.
That's fine.
Just like that.
You dastard!
Who's that?
Some nut.
Come on!
What adout Aldin?
So the microfilm got to Italy... to the top of the mountain on its own.
I don't give a damn adout the microfilm.
I just want to find Aldin.
You detter give a damn.
It may de our only means of getting him dack.
Why?
If it is the list of their agents... we'll know exactly where to find him.
Got a little trick
I've been working on.
Ooh.
"It's up to you now, Jefferson."
"Gray, listen."
"If we're going to do this, we got to do it together."
"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.
I got this.
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Uh...
time will remain intact.
The world?
Not so much.
How the hell is this a surprise?
This is the most cliche thing in the world.
Je.
We've been together for many years.
"If you're so happy, you cry."
Tomorrow I'll kick you in the head.
Will you marry me?
Alright.
"I'm sorry, I didn't cry."
It's okay.
Hold on.
I'm crying.
Shit!
What the hell!
February.
"How could you make the wrong diagnosis, doctor!"
?
"This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken!"
You shouldn't be a doctor!
Go do something else!
"Please calm down, sir."
Calm down please.
Doc.
Here a New Year's present for you.
Last time you didn't come.
So I'm giving it to you now.
Thank you.
Let's have a look.
Rash: 24 spots
Better.
See you again next month.
Any medicine left just tell the pharmacist.
-Of course I am.
-You can not see.
"No, we are all equal."
I do not.
Will we Krill.
We are all born alike.
"I'm not Bill, there is only one like me around the world."
I am a single krill.
-Where you going?
-I'm leaving.
"-I want to be free, Bill."
Do not have that to be free.
"Come on, let's think more school."
I'm full of shoals.
We walked into school life.
Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.
I'll count to three.
A. ..
Two ...
Three ...
"No, I can!"
I always figure to check out first anyway.
- Why?
- Because that how usually goes for the good ones.
You got a hair dryer?
"Unit 42, come in."
"Unit 42, respond to dispatch."
You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.
What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.
The guy's.
We're heading out.
Regards to President Wilson.
"Hi, it's me, Artie."
"No, I-I-I know."
I know.
"Look, please, do you think you could meet me?"
As soon as possible.
Artie does to us what he's making us do to them.
He keeps us in the dark.
"For all we know, we're decoys too."
"Look, we're all pretty good at our jobs, okay?"
We accepted the risks going in.
"Having intel in the field keeps an agent alive, Pete."
But Artie acts like keeping us alive
Isn't a priority.
"To him, we're just-- red shirts?"
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"First, he doesn't think we're red shirts."
"And second, that's so cool you knew what I meant."
Come on.
He's got a Tesla too.
Drop that weapon!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Grab the tsuba.
Ah.
You get a look?
- We get it?
- We got it.
Yes.
Now give it back.
- Push him on the floor.
- Talk to me.
Do it now.
Push him on the floor.
"- You, kick him like a football!"
- My feet are tied.
"Ernie, talk to me!"
"Talk to me, Ernie."
"Hey, pal."
"Come on, talk to me."
Talk to me.
I come in here after I saw you in the station house.
"I tell Chicky, ""Hey, there's no hard feelings."""
"You know, it's worth a thousand to get my wheelchair back."
She gets me in touch with her friends.
SlPOWlCZ:
I don't care what happens to them.
"But if they're hurt, you'll wind up either dead or in jail."
- So what?
"- So your room is bad, jail's worse."
"- Well, that leaves dead."
"- No, I don't want that."
I've seen too many good men go down.
Do you want a drink?
It's on the house.
"I can't, Ernie."
I'm a drunk.
"Everybody's got their battles, Ernie."
ERNIE:
Push him on the floor.
- Ernie.
Tell him you're going to punt him!
- Ben and Mike.
- Mike?
- Jade trying to kid.
- He should be.
Someone else could not.
"- This is true, and I go on and kill."
I will not have to do that.
I'll do.
- Let me find a statue of a she.
- Here's what I want to say.
- You got your passport?
"- Yes, sir."
I always forget mine.
Rook This is a great issue.
This is a very big issue.
A very vital situation.
I know.
"I know, Dad."
Do not worry.
You can make it.
You know what?
In this world there are 2 types of crime.
"I used to did not know it, but now I know."
"In other words, the Wall Street bankers."
I always keep the people robbed.
Zırvalıklara spend all their money.
People are descendants.
This is the real crime.
They are the real criminals.
Bankers.
You know what?
Toronta'daki venue had bi guy.
- I don't know her.
"We wanted to ask if you once made a film, a movie with Isabelle Moretti."
I didn't make anything.
And now I'll ask you not to disturb me.
If Mom were alive I'd strangle her.
Are you sure his face...
- I've never seen him.
- He has an Arab accent.
- Cut it out.
- Why are you pushing?
I'm fed up!
"Mom had an Arab accent, too."
"She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden."
So what?
So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you.
- Are you cursing me?
- Yes.
"And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay?"
Now lay off.
"Get down, he's coming out."
"- We lost him, damn it."
- Where are we?
- Where to?
- I don't know.
Sir?
Sir?
I'm calling an ambulance.
I'm starving.
Where are your sandwiches when we need them?
Maybe that's the doctor.
About time.
It's not the doctor.
How come?
I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."
good bye.
Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
- Amy!
"- Amy, be careful!"
Go on!
"Get outta here, you hear me?"
!
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Go on!
"- Now, easy."
- Go!
Just go!
Come on.
Come on.
"Please, you have to leave."
"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!
[Cork rattles]
I know.
That was wrong.
I know.
I'll apologize to Gracie in a minute.
Did something happen at work?
Yeah.
No.
I...
Let me ask you a question.
"If Dad came back, right now..."
What would you say to him?
"Oh, my god."
It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.
"Whoo, yeah!"
You think the city's big.
It's huge!
And lots of naked ladies.
"If I had my own naked lady, I'd never leave my room."
"If you had your own naked lady, I'd never leave your room."
"So, hold on-- do you got the money?"
We got everything!
Whoo!
Whoa...
Whoa...
"Oh, no."
I want to go back.
"Hey, the footpath's for virgins."
We are virgins!
"Hey, not for long."
"If you guys get killed, I'm going home."
Beautiful.
"Oh, my God."
Do you believe this?
"This woman gave birth to her own head, and it sang to her."
-Wow.
-Wow.
"Hey, Cash, where you going?"
You don't ask me that.
Never ask me that!
"Okay, I'm sorry."
I just forgot for a second.
"Guys, come here."
Whoa!
This is going to be tougher than we thought.
How do we tell a prostitute from everybody else?
All you can eat?
Dyn-o-mite!
"That's right, I'm gonna dine with all my might."
RALLO:
Ha!
"What up, black people?"
These threads ain't about the cruise.
I'm filling in for the Sandman at The Apollo.
"But the Commodores, those cats are outta sight!"
You dig?
Is everyone in this family stuck in the '70s?
Can any of you name a single current rapper?
What's a rapper?
"Oh, Cleveland, you are stuck in the '70s."
"They're the guys who wear the gold chains and go,"
"""Wibbity-bop, flibbity-blop."""
"Oh-ho, Donna, that is fresh."

"♪ Her bad, mmm. ♪ ♪ I'm bad. ♪"
"Well, if we're going on a '70s cruise,"
I'm gonna go get un-waxed.
"Oh, Cleveland, this cruise is gonna be fun."
But are you sure you can take the week off from work?
Of course I can.
Everybody gets off for spring break.
Can't swim...
"Oh, you're such a pussy."
I can't.
You just don't want to.
Lie back.
That's it.
You're OK.
It's easy.
Just float.
Excuse me.
"Come here, please."
Come on...
Bit naughty.
Never mind.
Up you come.
- Tony - is that right?
- Yes.
"Now, Tony, the thing is, we're not really supposed to go in the pool."
It's really only for sporting events.
And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club.
"And the Super Irony Fun Splash Club, too."
You're supposed to be on the tour.
"There was this girl, but she's gone."
"Don't go with her, Tony."
- What?
- You should join us.
What?
Yes.
We'll find you somewhere you can dry off.
"You should get out of those wet clothes, too."
I'd really like to see you out of those clothes.
I'll lend you my cagoule.
Shut up!
"It's my place, you have no say here!"
"Now, I swear in front of the lights!"
I will never care about Ho Foon.
"If I don't keep my words, I'll be punished by law."
Don't you care about me any more?
You mean it?
You are selfish!
You are merciless!
You are impotent!
Bastard!
You bastard!
You really mean it?
Bastard!
How dare you cheat my money?
"Brother Foon, hide up first."
Hide up?
"Yan, take care."
I am not impotent...
I am not!
"Hubby, what's wrong with you?"
It's only a dream.
Foon said that I am merciless and selfish.
Is that true?
"I feel lonely, how to say in English?"
I love you.
I love you.
Really?
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
"Yes, sir?"
"Box F, sir."
Right this way.
"Now, all together, boys."
Two pints.
"Oh, oh."
A tip.
"A tip, of course."
"Seven shillings, sir?"
Why...
- Why not?
"You work hard, don't you?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Bless you, sir."
"- You have a family, no doubt."
- Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What the...?
"Oh, what a pity."
"You were thinking of the children, no doubt?"
"Now, have that barmaid bring me some champagne."
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood me.
- What's all this here?
"- This gent here wants champagne, sir."
Champagne?
"All right, then, bring it, bring it."
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it.
Go on.
Hey.
Cover's off this fuse box up here.
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.

How about that?
Must've been those guys that were workin' on the sign today.
Yeah.
Sounds like that.
"Sorry about your husband, ma'am."
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll get a flashlight.
I know it's tough...to go down and see him.
You're sure you don't want me to drive?
Hurry back.
"Take it easy guys, there's plenty here."
Cut pie.
Little portions.

I don't want to make love tonight.
It's our last night.

I don't want to make love.
"Yeah, you're right."
Me neither.
"Oh, Christ, Cora."
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.
-Can I talk to you a minute?
"-It is beautiful, believe me."
-You just watch your feet....
- All right.
Yes?
- What's your name if it's no secret?
- Tanya.
"Tanya dear, some tea, please."
"I guess your tea isn't strong enough, so don't bother, I'll make it myself."
I've got such little bomb...
Just bring me some boiling water.
- So it's you?
"- Yes, me."
It means...
- With me?
- I guess so.
- You alone?
- Alone.
All right...
How about you...
None of your business.
Miss!
- Go away mister!
"- I apologized, didn't I!"
Miss!
I'm not going like this.
- What's up?
- Don't you have women's beds?
You put me up with some...
Don't you see...
How come?
- Is he making passes?
"- What do you mean, passes?"
"I can't change, can't put my slippers on."
"Go back to your compartment now, we'll find something for you."
Okay.
"Thank you, Brian."
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good.
"Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now."
We'll take it.
-Really?
"Oh, my God!"
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
"- We bought a really, really..."
- Excuse me.
We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
"Mary, are you all right?"
"Mary, talk to me."
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
But you're talking to me.
Let's meet at our usual place.
What a fool!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
Moloch!
No!
Don't do it!
No!
Be quick!
Run there!
Here she is!
"You didn't expect it, did you?"
I knew that it was not delirium!
I knew it.
You'll tell me everything now!
You'll sign everything off to me!
How much did you get for it?
How much was your price?
You're the one who sold your soul.
You!
You didn't rape me.
You stole my life away.
You killed my son.
He could have lived.
He could have been saved.
But you demolished the hospital.
What did you do it for?
You did it for the sake of your damned mega-center.
Save our children!
Korob is the killer!
"Brother Foon, he's the one!"
"- Mousy, you have a go!"
- I can't do it!
My legs go weak when I see him.
Brother Foon is a really good fighter.
I'd be happy if I was half as good as him.
Does it hurt?
I forbid you to scream!
"You've got to smile, too!"
Smile like you mean it!
Mousy.
"Next time you see Mousy, I want you to smile like you mean it."
- Brother Mousy...
- Don't you know what to do?
Scram!
"Brother Foon, you're brilliant."
"When you meet people like that, you've got to behave like a bully."
I can't act fierce.
"Brother Foon, you're my idol."
Everything will be OK if Sifu Wong agrees to take me on.
"OK, I'll put in a good word for you."
We're done for the day.
I've got to dash.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, please."
Stop clowning around!
Let me pass!
Help!
Help!
This actor is trying to kill me!
Make way!
"Make way, please!"
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."
Two...
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.
I'll watch myself.
Just give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm different now.
Really.
I'm ready.
I can do this.
Okay.
That's the kind of confidence
We've been waiting to hear.
Yes.
Okay.
We will.
We'll give you a chance.
We're gonna start out with two weeks
And then we'll check in on you.
"And if that goes well, then we'll give you two months."
"And then if that goes well,"
- You'll be free.
"- Yeah, two weeks."
Yeah.
Okay.
So you can leave here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
"Listen, i really believe in you."
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
So go out there and make us all proud.
Make yourself proud.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
"Good luck, monica."
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia?
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
No!
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?
no.
Huh.
- About as sure as an old man can get.
Is she related to you?
No.
Never met her.
"Anyway, thanks a lot."
Thank you.
Could I play anything particular for you?
"Oh, no, thanks."
"I'd love to some other time, though."
Good.
Come back again.
"Now, don't go doin' that, Mrs. Pauley."
You've done enough.
"I want to, Tickler."
?
"[ Piano Stops ] Well, I'm gonna have to earn it."
I don't know.
I have to think adout it.
"In any case, it can't go very far."
He has no education.
He is a dit uncouth.
And you are not a woman.
"You know, Renato, you're a real killjoy."
Are you OK?
"You do everything to hurt me, Renato."
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not exaggerating.
Let me tell you something.
I've had it with you.
I've had it up to here!
And I'm getting the hell out of here.
I've had it.
"Pull me up, please!"
- What a nice country road!
- Don't look down!
Hold on tight!
That's it!
That's it!
Now!
Like that!
Good!
A bit more!
Thank you.
"So, we've arrived."
"But I'm afraid, not where we were supposed to."
- According to the plan we should be...
- Let's check it out.
"- Come on, please!"
- My transmitter has disappeared!
What did you want to transmit anyway?
That we landed at the wrong place?
- That's all we know.
- Leave that to me.
What's this?
Against the cold.
- Maybe we pressed the wrong button.
- Why?
Did you press anything?
- No.
Emilia!
Katya!
I see flowers!
And bees!
I thought they only existed in fairy tales!
I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.
This is all we've got.
One price for all.
And here's some fuse.
Keep the change.
I'm getting chills.
-I'm getting nauseous.
-I'm getting rich.
"Come on, I told you it's all an act."
There's nothing to it.
It's all fake.
See?
"This isn't real wood, it's fake."
[BELL RINGS OVER TV]
There's the bell and we're under way.
"Come on, Bull."
Come on.
-Pulverize him.
-Use your footwork.
He's not moving.
"[CROWD YELLING, BOOING OVER TV]"
"Come on, Bull."
Do something.
The Battling Bailiff has yet to come out of his corner.
-You're very calm about all this.
-It's all part of the act.
"No, this isn't in the script."
"Wait, wait, he's moving."
"I told you, it's a sure thing."
The only way I can lose is if he left the ring.
He's leaving the ring.
"Bull, what are you doing?"
I could have burned the money.
It would have been quicker.
It's that kind of performance that gives this game a bad name.
[S|
GHS]
"It's big, Mama!"
"Oh, it's lovely."
"Oh, it's gorgeous, isn't it?"
e'll go upstairs.
This is your room.
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't dirty the windows.
hello?
Hello sunshine.
How are you
"hello, you all right, Mum?"
t's just so nice to hear your v oice.
Yours too.
What's going on?
've just rung to say your house is amazing.
-You happy
"-More than happy, Zayn."
t's lik e a dream come true.
It's all right.
"That's why I did it, didn't I?"
I told you that I wanted to.
know you always used to say.
""" I'II always get you a house, Mum, when I'm older."""
"I know you did, but...."
"That's the best thing, isn't it, about what we're doing?"
"You work so hard, Zayn, and I just.... 'm so proud of you."
Very very proud of you.
I can't even thank you enough for what you've done for us.
t's all right Mum.
You don't have to cry.
"You're just happy, aren't you?"
Happy tears.
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
It's got my arm!
Somebody help me!
Someone help me!
Reznik.
"I got ya, I got ya."
"Be cool, be cool, alright?"
"Who did it, huh?"
Why didn't you turn the fucking braker!
Can people be evil?
- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.
You know what?
"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.
Dad!
"Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?"
You mother just... she has problems... and I'm gonna talk to her.
"So I don't want to hear any more about this, alright?"
alright?
...Yeah...
"You have a good night, pal."
I love you.
"And I'm sorry about the last couple months, but I'll see you real soon, okay?"
- I promise!
Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood.
To live.
- How old are you?
Really.
- twelve...
But...
I been twelve for a very long time...
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
No Italians.
No Italians.
"Frank, it's not really our bag."
"Frank, it's not really our bag."
"Pot of VB, thanks, love."
"Pot of VB, thanks, love."
"Hey, mate."
"Hey, mate."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Are you looking for a shooter?
Are you looking for a shooter?
I'm available.

You're the boss.
"It's your call, mate."
You're the boss.
How much it worth?
How much it worth?
You ever offed a man before?
You ever offed a man before?
LookI know he's not dead.
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
No.
Agent Lee.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a DNA search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca Kemp.I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... you miss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why, do you miss me?"
"Uh, sure."
Boss...
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At Finn, us, the world."
"Go back with her to her apartment, get Finn's stuff."
"And, no, I don't want to wait for a search warrant."
- I'll grab my coat .Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.
"Hey, you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah, you."
Did you and Jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am Jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
He used you.
I know that what he did was wrong.
It was stupid and I was angry at him.
But you were his best friend.
You should've helped him.
You were a little girl then.
I'm a big girl now.
I gave him a chance and he blew it.
You liar.
He's the one who gave you a chance.
He made you thrive on stage and gave you the best parts.
He took you places you thought you'd never reach.
"He let you dance and sing, the best thing you ever did."
I loved your father and mother very much.
How can you even talk about love?
"Relax, it'll be easier if you relax."
My love.
We'll try again.
Help me.
- Okay.
Gently.
- Okay.
"Okay, never mind."
I can't.
"Never mind, my love."
I'll get some bandages.
"Tell me the truth, Daddy."
"What, Gonki?"
About Mommy.
Tell me about Mommy.
"Say it, Daddy."
Mommy is dead.
Say it again.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
I'm starving.

MAN:
"That's Pam,"
The Overly-Confident Morbidly Obese Woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
WOMAN ON P. A:
"Going again, please."
Thank you.
"And this is the set of ""The Girlie Show."""
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
"Hey, everybody, look."
Here's someone you never get a chance to meet.
"It's the head writer of ""The Girlie Show,"" Liz Lemon."
[Clapping]

Hey.
PETE:
What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that cat-lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
Why?
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
Slug.
Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."
Quit the Agency.
Have your drink.
It could have been anybody walk through your door.
Yeah.
But it was you.
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.
Start the count.
"No, please, God."
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
What a shame.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"- The fuck, Emerson?"
No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?
- No!
No!
- On the hood right there.
"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.
Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
Where can I contact her?
Look.
If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she.
Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you.
she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah.
I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah.
Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes.
The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her.
You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK.
"- Oh, my God."
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now.
I'm clean.
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"After what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help.
I really do.
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
$3.200.
That's what he gave me.
$3.200 for a lifetime.
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.
I don't want to.
Am I supposed to just pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.
I'd get the witch hazel.
"And I'd say, ""Witch hazel?"
"""What are you, 90?"
"Get some fucking painkillers."""
"And I'd say, ""Hey, it's an excellent astringent,"
"""and we're out of aspirin."""
"I'd turn the argument into a good, hard, angry fuck."
"Well, that's where we might have a problem."
What do you mean?
I've got... a bit of a problem in the downstairs department.
What?
"You know, downstairs."
What?
!
Where?
!
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?
My cock doesn't work!
Hi...
He's watching us.
"We can't help it, Sid."
No.
"It's OK, isn't it?"
Isn't it?
It's fine.
We're fine.
Fine.
OK?
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
I hope you don't mind that we opened things up.
Long as you pay for them.
"Not planning on drinking that beer and driving, are you?"
LILA:
No.
No.
We wouldn't do that.
This is for later.
Just kidding.
"CASHIER: $7.95, please."
Y'all have a nice night.
Y'all too.
"She's too young for you, Bill."
I like them young.
Shit!
"That trooper's behind us, man."
Don't look back.
Just be cool.
What do we do if he pulls us over?
He ain't going to pull us over.
"Slow down, Ray."
Don't panic.
"He recognized me back there, man."
I know he did.
"If he did, he would have arrested you."
He was just looking us over.
"White boy and a nigger girl in Texas, that's all it is."
Right now he's probably running our plates.
FEMALE RADIO DISPATCHER:
5-42.
"5-42, go ahead."
"On your out-of-state plate,"
How you know?
Change the tags.
Here how?
The hotel staff is here.
"Its big job Papa, yeah it is."
Go tease the girl who is standing being me.
Who me?
"Yeah who elss, go tease her."
"She will shout, help... help... i will come and beat you, hotel's staff will gather here."
At the same time they will change the tags.
No one has ever tease a girl in my whole family.
"You are saying i tease her, i don't even know it."
"There is not much to do, go near her and say."
Coming?
And that's it.
How will you say?
Coming?
Ma am.
Ma'am?
Is she your sister?
No...
coming?
Coming?
"No... no... which one, the one behind me."
Right or left behind you?
Left one.
You left or mine?
Your left.
There are two girls in my left.
The pink one.
"There are two with pink, light pink or dark pink."
Laxmi Narayan do one thing.
Pure killing without motive.
Wasn't that our challenge?
And then you go and kill my boss.
You tying to make things easy for them?
"I mean, I like a challenge, but..."
"Well, that was just stupid."
Don't worry.
They have no idea who killed Henry.
What are we gonna do?
We'll go back to basics.
We'll mess up the pattern that they think is emerging.
What do you suggest?
I've got you a double.
Is that OK?
Beats chemo!
Cheers.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
Yes?
Nik?
Did you get the paperwork?
Yes.
I haven't had time to Look at it.
"Nik, I really need you to sign it."
Soon.
Nikki?
I will.
But right now I'm...
"Don't tell me, you're busy."
Yes.
OK.
I'll sign them and send them.
Thanks.
Can we spend some time together?
You're so beautiful.
- You're not serious.
"- No, you're really beautiful."
I envy you.
"- Please, stop."
You're much prettier.
- Not at all.
- How old are you?
- How about you?
Thirty-one.
I'm older.
You are?
Then I should call you Big Sis?
How did you meet Joongrae?
It was just a coincidence.
He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.
Who told you that?
The restaurant owner told me.
That man always talks crap.
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
That the phones are lighting up like crazy?
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
"So, what do you say?"
About what?
About doing it full time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Well, I..."
Why don't we think about it?
Okay.
I will.
I just did.
I want to do it.
"Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry."
But I could really use the money and I think it could be fun.
There you go.
A star is born.
No.
Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
I saw it like five times.
Where's the love?
"Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles."
"Nothing for me, I--"
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon."
Eat!
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lorna."
Ten beers.
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
"Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way."
"You know, I want it to be raw."
HBO-style content.
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit--
"You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs."
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racism.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight up mentally ill!
Sure.
I got mental health issues.
"Sure, well, you know..."
"Who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
- Where?
Where?
Whaddya have to do?
Don't you plug in the phone?
- Which part?
- I don't get it.
"What about that guy, Taka?"
We need to ask you something.
How d'ya get on the 'net with PlayStation2?
We can't?
!
But I heard you could.
Says we need an adapter...
But we don't have one!
Who does he think we are?
We ain't got one.
Have you?
Why the hell not?
That was no use.
We're back to square one.
Doesn't Taka have a computer?
"No, he just knows a lot."
Buys magazines then can't afford a computer.
What's up?
"That guy, Kanzaki!"
He'll have one.
That weirdo electrician?
He's not a weirdo!
"Who, who?"
My Dad told me.
So the weirdo's got a computer?
He's not weird.
You're one of those rich computer twins.
Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood.
You brought me back to save you.
Otto:
The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated.
[Gunshot]
"You hang on, all right?"
You hang on!
I should have gone to your ball games.
I should have...
I should have been better to your mom.
Duval:
He's dying.
He said you could fix him.
I'll meet you at the gate.
"No, we're coming in together."
No more lies.
Why does he think he's my father?
Because he is.
No.
"No, no, no, no."
"No, it can't be."
It is.
It is not.
It's impossible.
This doesn't happen.
It...
it... it never happens.
"If by ""it"" you mean me, it's happened."
Look at me.
You know who I am.
- Shut up.
That's all we need for now.
"You know, I don't think they're going to Jeremiah's at all."
Me either.
Fantasia's coming home to see her kid.
"Hey, Hurricane, just how well do you know this gal anyway?"
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
"Ha, ha, that's real fucking funny."
Fuck.
Goddamn her.
Ronnie.
Lila.
"Why, look at you."
You've gone to Hollywood.
Look at you.
You're all grown up.
"Stand back, let me have a look at you, girl."
"Yeah, you're still ugly."
I'm just playing.
You look fine.
"You know what, I'm feeling fine."
I'm going to go see my baby.
I'm going home.
"You can't go home, Lila."
The cops are after you.
What did they say?
Get in the car.
"You know, I didn't do the things they say I did."
"Yeah, I know that."
Being on the run makes you look guilty.
I already look guilty.
And looking guilty's being guilty for black people.
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- What is wrong with your mom?
- She's bipolar.
She's bip...
She's an official lunatic.
And you let us get in a car with her?
"I tried to talk you out of it, but you would never listen to me."
If you would've told us she was crazy.
"No, near the mall."
"No, I'm fine."
"No, Mom, I just need you to come pick me up."
"Mom, no, please, just come pick us up."
"Izzy, I'm so sorry to have to put you through this."
"Grace, it's me."
I always knew.
I always knew there was something different about your mom.
Go.
Go.
"I'll deal with Olivia, okay?"
- Mom?
"- I'm up here, honey."
How could you do this?
You lied to me again.
You stopped taking your medication again.
"- Oh, I have my medicine."
- I hate you.
I'm done.
I'm so over it.
I have my medicine.
It's right here.
How strange!
He still hasn't appeared.
Oh!
It fell apart!
"Oh, my god!"
This is Moriarty's doing.
There he is!
Hey!
Here we go!
You won't get away from me!
Wait!
Here they come!
What a fantastic engine I have stolen!
It works perfectly with my beloved 'Crow'!
Dirty rats!
Here we go!
"You, get out of my way."
How paltry!
Here we come!
"Stop that, stop that!"
You won't get away from me.
You coward.
"Oh, I'm coming apart!"
It seems that we're the last two planes left.
What?
!
Here I come!
"When it comes to technique, I can hold my own against anyone!"
Get down!
How swift he is!
"If that's how you're going to be, I'll just come to you."
"All right then, commence Mrs. Hudson's basket operations."
Hit it!
"Stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
I didn't factor into this experiment that the stig only knows how to drive fast.
"Eventually, he got bored with the truck, so I took advantage of his window of low-speed driving and gave it my best shot."
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
This is the slowest the stig has ever driven.
Don't let him down.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
The plane threw me.
Come on.
Just like a football.
Throw it!
I'm coming!
Wood:
"All right, that didn't work."
Ferrara:
"All right, you ready?"
I'm ready.
[ Tires screech ]
Yeah!
Yes!
"Aw, come on, you unplugged it!"
You ready?
"Oh, I got it!"
I got it!
"Oh, crap!"
All right.
"Now, listen, we're gonna do it this time."
I feel good about it.
"Are you a robot, too?"
Yeah.
"I started to rust here, but Ohji fixed me."
"I'm usually prettier than this, but you caught me at a bad moment."
Because the Ruin's begun.
What is the Ruin?
"Is it going to happen to me, too?"
"Man, I don't know what's going on!"
"But, you really are beautiful, mister."
You aren't all beat up like me.
You're like a human!
"I have to get back, or else Ohji will be worried!"
Ohji will be worried!
Ohji will be worried!
Bye-bye!
I don't think you're beat up.
I don't.
You can have this.
It's the prettiest one I've ever found.
It'll keep you safe.
Thank you.
"Just now, that was..."
Luna...
Ringo!
"Humans will perish, just like us."
I'm a robot.
A robot kid?
I can't stand kids!
They have that new kid smell!
The world's on its way to Ruin!
It doesn't need any goddamn kids!
Die.
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight and go skinny-dipping.
Yeah!
You know?
"Like,I just want to be naked in the dark ocean with you."
Naked.
You know?
Johnny?
"No,no,no,no,no."
"Everything's fine,it's just..."
What?
I like you.
"I just need you to,like,taper it back a little."
Just a little.
Like this.
You don't need to do that.
It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."
Have a little flirty time.
I don't want flirty time.
Flirty time's awesome.
"Flirty time is not awesome,okay?"
This is awesome.
This.
"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
The ambulance is saying 15 to 20 minutes.
- I can take him.
- Caroline can take me.
"- No, I didn't drive."
- Then I'll wait.
You will not wait.
"Okay, you need to see a doctor."
- Tyler's driving.
End of story.
- Fine.
- Go.
- I'll bring my car around.
- I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.
- It won't be long now.
- Did you get the missing piece?
I am a fucking bastard.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna come over and hit me?
you've been waiting your whole life.
I'm in a chair.
Come on and hit me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Come over here and hit me.
I'm in this chair.
Now's your chance.
So hit me.
I'm nothing fucking like you-- nothing.
I'm never gonna be like you.
I'm not that little boy anymore.
Can I ask you something?
what's up? just packing your bags just leave?
What have you done?
"""The lovers moustache tickles"", doesn't it?"
I've shaved it!
I can see what you want.
"You misunderstand, sir!"
This is... a cross-connection!
What?
Let me put it plainly.
What you are dreaming of can never be true!
But what are you scared of?
Wouldn't you be scared if a man proposed to you?
It's wrong.
Cancel it!
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?
Hart's my husband.
"But he's Godbole, isn't he?"
True but I'm married!
Obviously.
But you never spoke of it.
I thought...
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?
I'm not gonna answer it.
What?
What?
I don't have the money.
What do you want me to do?
"Ok, you tell your mom, she gives you the money, you're out of debt."
Then you enroll in a public school.
You make it-- you make it sound just so easy.
It's--it's not--
I will give you until tonight to tell your mom.
"Nick, please, man."
I will get the money.
Ok?
That's--that's not a problem.
"I'll get it from this guy who owes me anyway, and I can pay him back with that and she'll never know."
Ok?
[Cell phone rings]
Uh...
Please don't make me sorry that I told you this.
Your client will talk?
Not on your terms.
What do you want?
An s-visa.
No.
What do-- TRENT HAAGA:
All right.
"No, let's get smoking."
Let's have him go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Can we come back tomorrow?
TRENT HAAGA:
Here we go.
My wife wants just what I wish for.
You must take Lajwanti's place in this family now.
We clash again!
As if we were separated in our last birth!
Jai's waiting for you.
There!
I've startled you!
I always say he's not in and you say you know!
"And you say ""You've told me"""
I've trapped you this time!
He's not in!
I know that.
How did you know?
You just told me so.
Damn it!
I'm trapped again!
Laxmi!
It's me...!
When did you arrive from outside?
I'm going out.
But when did you arrive?
I said I'm going out.
Okay?
Why have you locked that aunt in?
Chachi's gone out.
Impossible!
I just saw her coming up the stairs!
"This thing about in and out is a long story, Haribhai."
When aunt went upstairs...
"you saw her, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see when I went upstairs.
How could I see myself?
Ma'am?
"No, thanks."
You sure you don't need something?
"I need 100 bucks, or I'm going to get smacked."
You got that?
"Yes, I do."
You can have it.
You saved my life.
What are you doing with all that money?
We wanted to see a naked lady.
"Oh, God."
You know what?
"Why don't you take that money and go home, before you get hurt, okay?"
"I-I wish I could, but... it means a lot to my friends, and we just want a look."
How much looking?
As much as money can buy.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, pull your shirts up over your heads."
You first.
"Show me yours, and I'll show you mine."
Our what?
"Armpits, come on."
Come on.
"Okay, you're not hairy enough to be dangerous."
We're not hairy at all.
"So, what's your name, lady?"
V.
Like the letter?
What's it stand for?
What's your name?
Take care.
What?
"Come on, Allie, just step down."
- She's scared.
"- No, I'm not."
"You're not helping here, Zack."
- Zack wets his bed.
- I do not!
- His whole room smells yucky!
- Liar!
"Hey, hey!"
Since when do you go after her?
You're twice her age.
"- She's a liar, I hate her."
- He hit me.
You hit her?
- Don't ever hit her.
"- I didn't, I just swung my arm at her."
"What was the deal that we had, huh?"
I'm not through with you yet.
What was the deal we had?
"When I'm not around, you protect your little sister and your mother."
I can't stop any big guys.
"Don't worry about the big guys, I'll take care of them."
How?
You're never around.
"I don't care any more anyway, cos Mum said if you don't come back, she's gonna get me a new dad."
- Excuse me.
"- Can you ask someone else,"
- I'm on my way home.
"- I'm Beth Felton, I'm Beau's wife."
"Oh, well, I'm Megan, Lieutenant Megan Russert."
"If we ever have a daughter, we should do her hair like that."
"- Oh, like Jeannie's?"
- Yes.
"No, no."
You got to be born in a lamp.
"No, it's adorable!"
"I could do it one day, and then you could do it the next day."
- But no hat.
- I love the hat!
"Hel, that hat looks like it's for a monkey who should be clanging a symbol."
Austin.
Okay.
How does the other guy look?
"Oh, no."
You're not gonna be one of those exes that shows up when he's drunk?
Even though we're not exes.
Even though we only did it once.
They're gone.
What?
Who's gone?
My kids.
I lost custody of my kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Get in.
"Austin, I'm so sorry."
It's all right.
"The judge said, and I will quote him directly because he was such a complete and utter asshole..."
Sure.
"You know, get comfortable."
- Does your mom know?
"- No, but..."
- ...it's for a couple of nights.
- A couple of nights?
- Are you crazy?
- This is stunning.
Guys.
"Oh, wow."
Hold on.
Turn around.
It fits perfectly.
Let me just pull this over it.
"The length looks great, it's beautiful."
I want it to be perfect.
He likes lace.
I'm not misinterpreting.
Your dad came in like he wanted to chop me off at the knees.
And I'm telling you that's not my dad.
I recognize him from the picture of everybody on the glacier.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. I act like I'm not in love with his daughter.
He's acting like he wants to challenge me to a duel over your mother.
- I don't understand.
- I do.
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
He hates me or he's crazy.
"No, he does not hate you."
He couldn't.
Then he's crazy.
Pam.
"Oh, hey, Ella."
Where are you going?
is she your aunt?
Yes.
Why don't we go to your mother's?
She says that our house is too small and that you deserve better.
I think your mother's wrong.
Small things have their value too.
You're small but skilful.
I'm going to grow.
The house won't grow though.
You'll grow up and go to school.
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.
You want to keep on studying after?
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.
"For the final years, I'll go to Kermanshah."
Where is it?
"Over there, look."
It's over there.
Look.
The blue window.
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.
"I see, he's her son."
Yes.
Where's the cemetery?
Up on the hill.
I have to go.
I'll take the others to Hammad's.
Are you worried about them or your book?
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.
You'll come back?
"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
"You're sure about this, Chase?"
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
Go!
Go!
Right behind you.
- Come on!
- Ah!
This way!
Hurry!
- Won't they search the Abbey?
- Probably.
Behind there.
Quiet.
Hurry.
- Bread.
- Thank you.
- Be safe.
- You too.
We'll move you when the search dies down.
You must go before the Abbess sees you.
Come.
This way.
- Never do that again.
- What?
You broke rank.
You took action with no plan in place.
You've never broken a rule to save someone?
- Your job is to follow my orders.
- Our job is to recruit fighters.
We got what we came for.
We got lucky.
"If you want to stay on this team, you can't be so impulsive."
- We almost lost you once.
- Is that what this is?
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
You've gotta be the youngest attorney in the firm to sit on a case this big.
I don't know.
"Listen, here, hey."
"I was gonna give this to you at dinner, but it feels appropriate here."
Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."
- Can we afford this?
I had some stocks pay out dividends.
You know.
Can't a guy do something nice for this girl?
"Yes, he can."
I love you.
"Wait, you didn't get this off that dead girl, did you?"
Wow.
Wow.
- Just checking.
I'm just... pushed too far to his throat.
Did you know...
- I don't know.
Tell me how.
Say it.
"Yeah, I would've."
- How?
"I don't know, okay?"
"No, it was an accident."
I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
Here.
Take this.
You look half frozen.
Thank you.
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
Let's go.
"Marshal, please."
What kind of place is this?
This is a high class brothel.
A brothel?
What do you take me for?
The moral standard is down the drain...
What a lovely bottom!
What a surprise!
Take good care of him.
Marshal...
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's stay and check the place out.
There may be underage girls here.
Yes.
Let's have a toss.
Drink up.
Don't be shy.
What's wrong?
You're flushed.
What?
I just had a little drink.
But you just drank the soy sauce.
I want to investigate this girl.
Wait.
What's the matter?
Can I investigate your wife?
Do you know who I am?
- And do you know who I am?
- Who are you?
- Liang Foon of the Pochilam School.
- I've never heard your name.
I'm here for a few days.
- My cell number's on there.
- Of course.
"Were you and your aunt, uh, close?"
For most of my life she was a birthday card with a $5 bill in it.
But she never missed a birthday.
I understand.
How about you?
How well did you know my aunt?
My great-aunt.
Oh.
She came in once a year.
- Like Santa Claus.
- Heh.
She was very sweet.
"When I called, they told me that you had spoken to her just before she died."
I'd like to know what you thought of her.
- I don't know what I could tell you.
- We could talk about it over drinks.
Uh...
I don't know.
Heh.
Consider it.
You've got the number.
I will get these to the Revenue office.
Thank you.
I didn't know my dad was coming.
He wanted to know how somebody could beat me.
If I slacked off.
I didn't.
You know I didn't.
I told him we tied but you got the slot.
"Yeah, sure."
"You cry, and it's all my fault."
I'm not crying.
You don't even want me to live here.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"
"Besides, it's starting to melt."
"- So, it's that urgent?"
- I already told you that.
What if Lella is delayed?
It would be a disaster.
Then let me handle this before it's too late.
Mother of God!
Actually...
I'm going to devour you!
- Just a moment...
let me get undressed.
- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."
I got it.
"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"
- What?
- Turn into a fox!
- You don't change when you do this?
- No.
You're still the best!
Welcome!
Tickets are sold here!
"Hey, they didn't buy any tickets."
"Dad, what's with all these people?"
It's a sign that everything will be alright.
The cop.
Welcome.
May I help you?
I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.

I lost my motherfucking money.
you and Todd get ready to leave.
I'm going to get our money.
but--
Our money?
Your choice.
Take it.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
000 looks like?
This is fucking awesome.
boys.
Our next fight's a 10-grand buy-in.
Todd?
When do I get some?
I discovered him.
This fucking guy.
How would you like to discover this?
I'm serious.
yeah?
These fights today-- these private fights man.
You want to fight in real fights-- proper fights with proper prize money and betting money.
That's how you make money in fighting.
- So when do we get some?
- I've already put the word out.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
We'd been here all night.
"June's mixed up, he's getting old, he don't see very well."
Lying son of a bitch!
I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
"What's going to happen to our baby, with me in jail?"
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
I escaped because I played dead.
Played dead?
Yeah.
That wasn't my fault.
Get me?
Yeah.
Where'd you come from?
I've known this guy for six months.
What is that?
It's a good plan.
"I'm his crew, we go way back."
What about you?
I'm his sister.
"Okay, everyone stop."
"This is my lead, my research, my job."
You're out.
"No, wait."
Connor listen.
"Look, I'm begging you, okay."
I'm begging you to let me go.
"Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me."
"I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything."
And I can't risk losing her too.
"I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score."
I'm begging you.
Please let me come.
If I let you come...
I have ground rules.
"First, the cut remains the same."
You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along.
Totally fair.
Yeah.
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...
If it's a nice day?
"Yeah, let's do that."
"And tomorrow night,"
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
- You believe me?
- Yeah.
- Poor bastard.
"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
That was your first lie.
It's inevitable.
"You're gonna get old, Stefan won't."
Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
"I'm sorry, but I don't have what you're looking for."
Sit down.
And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
I know that.
But Damon does.
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.
Then the blood will be on your hands.
"It was nice meeting you, Elena."
"Hey, Anna."
"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...
Give me a call when you get this.
How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
they're on a boat
Near the south side pier...
"the heartbreak, dock 12."
Who is this?
Just a pal.
Tell me you na...
how did you get this number?
Have a lovely night.
Right.
Very good.
Who was that?
Anonymous tip.
Let's go.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
That didn't take long.
Oh.
Thought you were someone else.
Brannis told me one of you would be coming.
One of me?
Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."
What did you do?
What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.
Jarvis:
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
Wait a minute!
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging in some creepy, spooky joint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
You know...
Whole creepy house-of-wax vibe goin' on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"

Get out.
- Ooh!
Let's do that again.
- No!
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!
Frank.
Frank.
"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
You know that.
Do not want to get involved with them.
He lived for the club!
-And Died for him too!
-My Condolences.
Thank you.
My condolences.
He was a good man.
-I Can send flowers?
-Of Course.
Thank you.
My condolences again.
Let the memorial later if you want.
They will make a memorial at the club and want me to be there.
-You Can stay with Jimmy?
"No, you will not."
"You can be a cop, but you can not order me around."
We can have it.
Let's leave it.
Health then.
-It Was a beautiful funeral.
-Yup.
He was a very good people face.
"He was like a brother to me, you know?"
'You just said that.
"Yes, but he was there."
I do not sit and stare at someone kill my brother.
Raymond!
Free your mind.
Preserves you!
Sorry about that.
-Get It.
What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!
Nelson's working on his belly!
Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?
- What you trying to do?
Cop a Sunday?
- What's the matter?
Can't you take it?
"It looks like a home run, and it is a..."
"No, it's going to fall inside."
- You're doing swell!
"- How're you doing, Stoke, huh?"
"Okay, fella!"
"Okay, let's see that!"
That will be all right!
"Take it easy, Stoke!"
Take it easy!
There we are!
Give them a show!
"One more heat, and we'll call it a day!"
"Sure thing, Danny!"
Sure thing!
You're doing fine!
You're doing fine!
- I told you I'm gonna take this guy!
- He never laid a glove on us!
Ten seconds!
"Don't forget, if you try to slug with him, he'll kill you!"
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?
The joke.
My room.
Lie down and rest.
What room is this?
It hurts here.
I can't believe this.
This is my room.
Just lie down and relax.
You were in my dream.
"No, when I was taking a bath."
Really?
Do I look dirty to you?
Think I slept with Changwook?
"No, no."
"Then, what's wrong, huh?"
Because I used to date foreigners?
No.
"Actually, it makes it better."
"When you're dating, it's a turn-on."
It is?
"But to cherish someone in your heart, it can be a problem."
It hurts so much.
"There's no woman here, is there?"
"No, stupid."
Really?
Of course not.
It hurts?
It's nice being with you in the morning.
I don't know what to do.
In my brain there is this illness.
My ex-wife had slept with my friend before we married.
I didn't know that before.
"But then, I found out, and I couldn't forgive her."
Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"
Jump!
"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to
"Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
How?
Here's 50.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
You didn't forget your phone again did you?
"Anyways, Aunt came out to check her bank account, and it broke her heart."
Give her a call ok?
Welcome!
This is driving nuts!
Give me a can of beer that's past the expiration date.
There's no such thing.
It's $1.70.
-Get money from Jang Min.
-Sis said that she will kill me.
"If that kills you, I should've been dead 88000 times."
It will be $1.70 sir.
I don't have money.
See?
"Fine, let me call my sister first."
Chan!
Come on Chan!
Geez.
"""Sis isn't answering her phone."
"I left her a voice mail."""
"""I told her that you cried your eye balls out."" Hehe look at this kid."
"""Ok."" Send."
"This is so simple, Honey."
Hey what time are you coming home?
"Yes, mother around 7?"
"Ok, I'll get ready then."
"Ok, Mom see you."
What did you want to eat?
Just make whatever you want.
Fine!
"We can just text this, ""What time?"" ""What do you want?"""
"""7,"" ""Kimchi"" It's so simple."
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
"Okay, I'm making out with this guy..."
PG stuff.
"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
Run.
But maybe he is going out of town.
Where?
Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
Where are you going out of town to again?
Um...
Uh...
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh.
Run.
"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
Yeah.
There's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
[SIGHS]
BEN:
"Yeah, the boat looks great."
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
How's that working out for you?
"Yeah, what a shocker."
Right.
"Next, I need you to, uh, take your shirt off, please."
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacks in there.
"Yeah, in there."
"So, your name's Henry and... okay, well, the good news is that you're gonna live a while."
"The bad news is that in this case, a while means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky... which you are."
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, shit."
We got bacon on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's some clothes in there.
Put the hoodie on.
Shit.
There's not enough time.
Fuck it.
Just cover the blood up with your bag.
"Just stay calm and let me handle this, yeah?"
That's how it goes...
Bollocks.
"Fucking Akan, paying off the..."
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
Just give me your arm...
Hey!
Shit!
It's me!
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
Is this... um...
Who-who-who...
Who... where...
"Uh, gee, if i..."
How 'bout it?
What's up?
"Do-do you know many, um... [crying]"
Wait!
"Please, don't go."
[Crying]
It's up to you.
I'll talk.
I'll tell ya.
What did he look like?
[Monitors beeping]
I think it's time for us to go.
"Listen, would you wait for me outside?"
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.
I found the guys that did this to you...
And I've taken care of it.
It was strange.
It was like we were back in 'nam.
It didn't matter if it was right or wrong.
I just did it.
"And don't worry about Maria and the kids, 'cause I figured out a way to get some money for them."
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
"Listen, do you want me to turn this television on here... just blink your eyes if you do."
"I'll get the nurse to come in and look after you, okay?"
Just hold on.
Please.
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
- Then say it!
I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!
This is my home!
Open this door!
Just wait until I ―
"Because I should feel terrible, and I don't."
"And you're right, it does feel good to say that."
Dam... broken!
Go-to guy!
"Hey, girls!"
I did it.
I broke this dude's dam.
"Hey, I'm going to bed."
"Okay, I love you."
You can sleep outside if it makes you feel more comfortable.
"Oh, and make sure to close the window so the alarm sets."
I got it.
See?
Go team!
"Uh, or you can just keep it open, in case there's a fire, so you can just throw me out of it."
I love you.
Ugh.
"Oh, balls."
"Oh, my God, a squirrel!"
Aah!
"Okay, calm down."
I...
I can't.
You know I hate rats.
"Okay, it's just a squirrel."
"No, no, squirrels are just sexy rats."
Everybody knows that.
"I think it touched my leg, ugh."
Where is it?
"I don't know, I don't know, all I feel is a squirrel touch, ugh."
"Okay, it's fine, all right?"
"It is much more scared of us than we are of it, all right?"
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We cool?
"Your satellite's on, by the way."
That screen's bad-ass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologize.
Is this going to be every weekend now?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.
"He may be a screwball, but he wasn't lying."
He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's
Stop it!
Hyo-ijn!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.
"Have you got a cold, Ed?"
I didn't have a minute... didn't have a minute ago.
"Scratch me there, will you?"
- Here?
-(sneezes)
"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
[Brakes Screech]
[Cloudy] Here.
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four.
He went up to six.
He's cute.
Real cute.
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
- [Cloudy] Come on.
- Look.
My partner and I made this case.
You know?
Originally.
We don't want any feds screwing' it up.
Case?
So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.
Hasn't she prettied up the place?
"Wait till you see how gentle she is, and good as gold."
You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!
Hide and don't make a sound!
"Stop right there, Mieze."
You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.
"""I swear..."" Come on!"
I swear.
"""I swear I won't look behind the curtains."""
- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
- All right.
Come here.
All right.
"I'll allow this but if you start making strain noises,"
- we're breaking up.
- We should go.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She should just move on.
She falls all the time.
What do I care?
What we need to be concerned about is getting that diamond back.
We need someone to kiss Trent.
- Can you do it?
For Candace?
- Oh no...
I'm not into that kind of thing.
"- Yep, that's Trent"
- I'll do it.
I don't like seeing you all torn up like this.
You know what?
You know what we could do to cheer you up?
Let's do that thing where we pretend to be an old couple that's been married for 50 years.
Come on.
"I'm coming for you, stud-muffin."
Hot wheels.
Almost there.
Sweetie...
This usually gets me going.
My heart's just not in it.
Guys.
The fight with Danny is killing him.
I know.
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!
"- I know you are, Dale."
- I am.
"Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!"
"- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?"
"- You know we are, dude."
- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.
But what can you do?
"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
The flat's yours.
You are the one who pays the rent.
Anyway I'm going to Manchester tomorrow.
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
This is a success then?
It's success.
I'm glad.
You know the first time I painted you outside the steelworks?
Maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away.
Oh!
I don't know Ellis.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me so bloody small.
One ticket madam.
Safe journey.
Next please.
War widows.
War widows.
There you are.
War widows.
War widows.
War widows.
(THEY CAN'T BLACK OUT THE MOON BY ART STRAUSS)
* I'm not afraid of the dark * * Are you?
(Are you?
) Are you?
(Are you?
) *
"* Gee, but it's nice in the dark * * With the moon and you (and you) *"
* When we go strolling in the park at night * * All the darkness is a boon *

-l'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
"You don't buy anything, you hear me?"
You don't buy anything!
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
The fat fuck.
He oughtta wear a sign.
I can't believe this...
"Are you stupid, or what?"
Excuse me.
-Take it off.
-Why?
Take it off!
Take it off!
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big or attract attention?
"One guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20,000 mink."
I'll return it.
Bring it back where you got it.
Get it out of here.
Understand?
Get it out of here!
"This drink here is better than sex, babe."
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody.
You look straight ahead or I'll fuckin' kill you.
"He's so jealous. lf l even look at anyone else, he'll kill me."
That's great.
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?
I've been looking all over for you.
"Listen, I need the money."
What do we think?
Uncool!
It's not uncool!
Who said uncool?
Me!
Why is it uncool?
It's a Peugeot!
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?
"Right, I do."
I'm gonna explain why.
It's a hot hatchback - hot hatchbacks are cool.
"They're small, they're easy to run."
"I had one the other week, came down here, drove it in second gear all the way, made me feel 18!"
"All of which is good, and they're good cars."
I just...
"Everybody else thinks it's uncool, you think it's cool."
Casting vote here.
"I reckon, apply your own test."
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment in that.
She'll get in.
No.
She'll get in the diesel one of the bloke behind.
I think it's uncool.
"Oh, my God!"
What's up with you?
Chinese burn.
Why don't you give him a dead leg?
I will.
Your silence has saved your life.
Until now.
"Now you need us, and we need you."
There's only one way to catch that maniac.
Hold on.
By offering him something he can't refuse.
You aren't serious!
We have no other choice.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
He wants to use you as bait.
You what?
- It's your only chance.
Put me out there like a piece of meat.
You came to see us.
Don't get her involved!
She already is!
You wanted to solve this case.
Not at her expense.
And we'll solve it.
Always you!
And if it's the last thing I do.
You just can't be trusted.
What?
Here's a package.
Speak up!
Who's it for?
"For you, lnspector Minks."
From somebody named lrezumi.
I'll put it here.
Car keys and a parking-lot ticket.
No.
OK.
Nice.
That feels good.
Are you gonna fuck me now?
Yup.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I stay up late watching movies?
-Yep.
You're not gonna make me go to bed?
Do whatever the fuck you want.
What's wrong?
"It's... you know my friend you met here tonight, Bender?"
Yeah.
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but she was here before you got here and she kissed me."
She kissed you?
"Yeah, she was tying my tie and she pulled me in and kissed me."
Did you kiss her back?
No. [LAUGHING] Of course not.
"But it was- you know, it was peculiar."
"Well, girls do funny things sometimes."
Yeah.
"There was this once, a long time ago, actually when we first met, she and I made out."
Nothing really came of it... [SIGH]
She and I - we don't make sense as a couple.
Do we make sense as a couple?
-Yes.
-Yeah?
Water!
"Please, let me get water."
I'm so not done with you yet.
"What, what?"
"Oh, yeah."
No.
My boyfriend.
He hurt you?
"Uh, you want me to call the cops?"
No.
No.
That'll only make things worse.
"I just want to go to his place, pick up my stuff."
If I just had an hour.
[phone rings] [ring] [beep]
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
Otto speaking.
I'm at the bar.
Come see me now.
[click]
"Yeah, it, uh..."
"Well, no, no, no, sir, we don't, and, um, I would..."
I would appreciate it if you would take us off your list.
[beep]
"Hey, uh, you mind watching the place for a few minutes while I go hit the head?"
You don't have a toilet?
"Oh, it's busted."
Goddamn landlord doesn't want to pay to fix it.
We've been using the bar down the street.
"Anyone stops in, just tell them I'll be back in five or thereabouts."
"At my age, it may take a little longer."
[honking]
Hey.
"Hey, why'd you park me in?"
"Hey, what the fuck, man?"
Why'd you park me in?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"You were after money, the same as i was."
You would've cornered gold if you could've done it.
"I'm broke, too."
I'm right back where i started 10 years ago- right down to my last dollar.
"But i'll get on top, and you'll stay right where you are!"
You belong in the streets!
Get back into the streets!
Get a doctor.
"Yes, sir."
"Take it easy, jim."
The doctor's coming.
You're going to be all right.
Jim!
Jim.
"I'm all right, josie."
"Lie still, jim."
Don't move.
I'll go.
"No, no, no."
"Don't go, luke."
We can't split partners now.
"We're not going to split partners, jim."
"We never have, and we never will."
"Take it easy, boss."
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna pull through.
"Sure, i will."
"You know, it's a great life."
I wouldn't sell this next minute for... for a million dollars.
Nick... i owe you a bet.
So I'll call you later.
"Hey, do you mind..."
"uh, driving me home?"
No yoga?
No.
We missed it.
"Um, yeah."
I guess.
"Ok, when did that start and did you know?"
"Well, I mean, I kind of guessed, but..."
Does she know about... you two?
What's there to know?
Hallie should know better.
Seriously.
Anybody that knows you would know that you are so hot for him.
"Becca, I'm not so hot for him."
No.
He's your friend.
And it is so typical of Hallie.
She's a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
It's...
Damn it.
She is a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
"Oh, God!"
"Hallie, it's just frustrating."
It's so much right now.
She doesn't deserve that.
Hallie was there for me when I had that swine flu.
Every time I've broken up with a quasi boyfriend.
And I don't know what I would've done about that stalker if it wasn't for Hallie.
"I mean, she has to come back, right?"
I don't know.
My mom's... kind of a train wreck.
So's mine.
"Well, I mean, what about your dad?"
Can you call him?
Dad's in jail.
Armed robbery.
"Impressive, huh?"
"My dad, he's, like, a financial planner."
And I think he's in trouble.
I don't have any stock tips.
"He stopped going to the office and these guys keep showing up at the door like cops, but he won't answer."
"Look, I haven't told anybody about it."
I can keep a secret.
Hey!
"Where you at, girl?"
It's time for you to get your buzz on.
"Nolan's so faded, he can't even feel his feet."
There goes the left leg.
"I miss you, babe."
"You know, it's not a party without you."
"Oh, you're sweet."
What's the deal?
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Say hi to everyone.
Allright.
Love you.
"Love you, too."
Bye.
So how long you been with him?
- And the redhead?
- She's my associate.
You don't fancy her?
None of your business.
What about you?
No girlfriend?
It never works out with girls.
"You're good-looking, you should be popular with the girls."
I'll let you finish.
I'm off to bed.
Catch!
A T-shirt for the night.
"Good thinking, thanks."
- Good night.
Niko?
How's your hand?
That bitch bit through the skin.
You'd better get tested in case she has AIDS...
I'll call you back.
"Hello, Vlad."
How are you?
"Not so good, mate."
Why didn't you tell me a girl tried to run?
"I was going to tell you, but we got her."
Tani took care of her.
We have more pressing matters.
Did you watch the news?
Not yet...
The cops are looking for the football player.
They found his hideout.
Find him and kill him.
I don't want him to talk about us.
And I got my period at a very young age.
"Oh, my God,"
I-I got to get out of here.
I-I can't breathe.
I don't know why I let myself get close.
"Christine, hold on."
I don't want to hear any more jokes.
"Come on, you joke about New Christine all the time."
"Like how she's so dumb, she has to take off her shirt to count to two."
"Or when you killed that moth, and you said she moved up on the brain donor list."
"Well, that's different."
That's funny.
"Anyway, it's not just your lame jokes, Richard."
It's everything.
It's the pancakes and the princess and the periods.
She's not my daughter.
I don't want to be her mother.
I thought you liked Papa Jeff.
I do.
I did.
I-I don't know.
I just...
I've just got to get home.
Wait.
What do I tell people?
I don't know.
Just tell them I got sick.
That was my mother-in-law.
She had to leave.
Her broom was double-parked.
It's funny.
"Oh, I'm glad you're home."
Anybody else?
"No, I don't think so."
Wasn't Bertrand JoyaI with you?
"Yeah, but no..."
Was he there or not?
"He was there in the yard, but he wasn't with us... at the hotel or in the car."
alright.
So when you got there?
He ran away.
And you caught him.
Yeah.
You ran after him?
"Yeah, well Touchy ran, me... with the pick up."
With the pick up?
In the corn?
"Yeah, I've got a bad leg."
So then... you caught him and you brought him back.
What did you do to keep him from running away?
You locked him up?
You aimed the gun at him?
What?
"No, no, we thought that was too dangerous."
Same with locking him up.
We didn't want him to break anything else.
So...
We didn't...
we didn't lock him up.
"In that case, what did you do?"
Did you tie him up?
You tied him up?
You tied him up?
Just like that?
Fine.
It's very viscous.
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Bob, do you know what the wine is?"
It is a blend.
But it's a blend of spit.
Because it's from the spit bucket!
What?
He's right.
Bobby wins.
What?
!
"You drank spit, Rick."
You drank a lot of it.
What?
You poured that from the spit bucket?
Why did you do that?
Because I knew Bob would know what it was.
Why would Bob know that?
"Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did."
That's disgusting.
And that's how you win a wine-off.
Ah!
Wine fight!
"No, no, no."
Not the jacket.
"Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere."
That's for lying on your profile.
I'm sorry.
"Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and..."
Now I plan to mary and settle down.
Good idea.
Have you seen any girl?
"- No, I haven't yet."
But I will.
I see.
You hide from me?
"Tell me, who is she?"
"Hey, there's nobody."
"Don't wory about me, big daddy."
Find a good girl for yourself and settle down.
I did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.
"Come on, you are good at it."
But I am no good.
I get a bit nervous.
- So what?
I'll speak for you.
"- First, speak for yourself."
"Sheetal, these flowers are rosy in colour like you."
But you are looking more red in your anger now.
"Yes, I'm Vijay here."
I was waiting for your call.
Really?
"So, you were sure I'd call you, were you?"
Of course. I have seen a lot of cases like this.
Tell me...
How are you?
May I ask you why you sent me these flowers?
Just to get a call from you.
And just why did you expect a call from me?
Just because I want to meet you.
Trust me.
This is it?
What do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No matter what you see... stay in the car...
until I say.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's Jasper?
Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
"If you want water, I will get you water."
"No problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
"You have to get me out of here, quick."
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
The Ark's here?
"I'm coming with you, Jones."
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
!
"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
I'll be back to get you.
"Jones, what's the matter?"
That's it.
Who knows?
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
Is...
Something wrong?
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I... which is why this is gonna hurt."
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please... you have to tell him.
"It's okay, your baby's fine."
Not...
The baby.
He killed Sean.
"Honey, the police know."
They don't...
They didn't see it.
- Where?
I can't see you.
Come down to the beach and walk to the left.
Left?
Towards the inlet?
"Yeah, turn left and straight on."
Hurry up.
"Okay, be right there."
You told him to walk down that way?
"Yes, in the meantime we should go back to our rooms."
It feels so weird.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
I see nobody here.
Keep on walking to the end of the beach.
All the way to the end?
Yeah.
It's so wonderful.
I'm hearing so much about films from Director Kim.
Keep on walking and you'll see us.
"Alright, wait for me."
Okay.
What is it?
A splinter?
I think so.
I'll poke it out where there's light.
"Yeah, thank you."
Let's tell him that I vomited.
That I got a bad stomachache.
And we had to run to the pharmacist so that's why we missed each other.
Are you worried?
"Okay, we'll do as you say."
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
On the double!
"Well, at least the search is on."
- Is that everyone?
- One more.
Stiller.
He's bringing the mail from Pasco.
He knows to keep his eyes open.
Got about two hours of light left.
What a mess.
Then let's go down the cliff.
- Why do you do that?
"- We can't make it, that's why."
Those wolves are gonna hang around.
"Anyway, we were dead the minute the engine quit."
- I didn't wanna say anything.
- Why talk that way?
- It's the truth.
- It ain't.
It's what you think'll happen.
- You made a snare and shot a rabbit.
- So what?
I'd rather be trying things than sitting on my butt.
All right.
All right.
Let's go if we're going.
Take what you need.
I was thinking more like a couple of sweaters.
See?
I told you I grew up with boys.
Jesus.
- Do you live by yourself?
"- Yeah, that's right."
It's amazing.
- You serious?
Oh you can get that.
"Oh no, it's OK."
But you can get that.
Sorry.
Oh it's Hallie.
Just 2 seconds.
Hey!
Um yeah I'm still here.
Um sure that's fine.
"Wait, you didn't really just do what I think you just did, did you?"
Because I kind of had plans to just spend the night with you.
Um she's outside.
How did she get my address?
"I don't know, not from me."
Hello...
Door's open.
Hi.
Dale said she was coming by to shoot the band so I thought I'd surprise you.
Hey.
- Hey.
We actually finished a couple of hours ago but um...
Really?
Why don't you sit back down.
You're not...
Yeah you know I'm sorry I'm lame but I have to work in the morning so...
You should see the show she's casting it is so funny.
"Look you could stay, have another beer."
Oh I'm sure we'll do it some other time.
I'll see you guys later.
Just one second.
It's me.
"I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail."
- You're new here.
- It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Hey.
Come with me.
This...
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
Your sword... how strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
Give me ten hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
(Hook) Ladies.
"In this world, we are slaves to time."
And ours is running out.
"In other words, ticktock."
(Zips sleeve)
I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
You're trouble you know that Cece.
What afraid you're going to fall in love?
OK you have got to stop it with the winks.
She winks?
All the time.
Becca is a winker.
Becca's a wanker?
"No not a wanker, a winker."
She winks.
I only do it to guys I think are cute Ok?
It's for this movie I'm doing it's a character role.
So what are you guys doing afterwards?
Ah home.
I've got to work early in the morning.
"Whoa, whoa lame excuse."
Excuse me can we get six tequila shots please?
Top shelf?
- Yeah.
"Oh no, no that is trouble."
I puke.
I'll clean it up.
Ah count yourself lucky you even got he out.
She's always in bed by 10PM.
Just this one night.
Ah I would but I really should go.
Me either.
I have an interview with a wedding planner in the morning.
I have an audition at nine.
I have casting.
I'm free.
I'll stay.
Ok well I'll let you off the hook this one time OK.
Nice.
Where'd you get these things?
- How do I look?
First I gotta know where you got 'em.
I see.
You'd rather look like a tramp than accept something from me.
Take 'em back where you got 'em.
Got that?
Then maybe I should just leave too.
Maybe you should.
"Where'd you get these things, Cilly?"
A girl gave them to me.
I won't ―
I'm telling you:
Watch your step.
"Don't be angry, Franzie."
"None of us are angels, are we?"
Enough!
Let's get down to the bar!
- You really mean it?
- Why not?
Stop pestering it all the time!
And you get out of here with that cigar!
The air's bad enough.
You're nuts!
They've never been in a cage.
They don't understand.
So what's the story?
He wouldn't take the clothes.
"Well, I want Biberkopf, and that's that."
"Well, I won't help."
"I want him, and that's that."
"No, look!"
He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

She...
She was singing.
She had the most beautiful voice.
"Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater."
Off we go.
"Come along, Max."
We just gonna forget this whole thing ever happened.
The sea king will never know.

I won't tell him.

It's so big!
We've passed the single tree.
And loads of others.
Two more up there. lt's beautiful!
I said we're reaching two single trees.
It would help if we could ask someone.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
We can ask them.
Slow down a bit.
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.
"This is farmland, they're out working."
We have to ask.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
I can see a black spot in the distance.
Over there.
He can't hear us.
"Wait, I'll go and ask him."
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Hello, ma'am."
"Hello, I'm honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"200 yards after the junction, turn left."
Thank you.
Good-bye.
"Look, it's behind the hill."
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.
On the hill.
- Siah Dareh's over there?
"No, I'm good."
All right.
Don't got to worry about me.
"You say you're okay, I take your word for it."
Medical suspensions?
[Chuckles]
"That's for the fucking nanny state, and I don't play that bullshit."
But do me a favor.
Put the glasses back on.
You're giving me a fucking headache.
"So, what's the deal?"
You got a spot on this card for me or what?
I can find a spot for you.
It's in Fresno.
It's only a week out.
It's not a problem.
Okay.
- Who's the guy?
- Local kid named Vargas.
He's aggressive.
"Not a lot of skill, but he's a tough motherfucker."
- 155?
- Ish.
"If either one of you's a few pounds over,"
I'm not gonna dock you.
I'll make it.
Even better.
"Unfortunately, though, not a lot of money."
I just want the fight.
All right.
It's a deal.
I'm excited.
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
"All right, I got news."
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
"- Oh, yeah, I knew."
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
"- Oh, yeah, he's fine."
"He was in bad shape for a while, though."
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
"No, he was on his regular bed."
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life- threatening illness?
Because I told you to.
You get up so early.
I have to stop that.
I really shouldn't walk around here like this.
I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.
- The one time I need tape.
- l put it in the wash.
There is tape.
It's in the drawer like always.
- l wanted to wear it.
"- We'll put it in the dryer, sweetie."
"- Oh, my God."
- [Lily] What?
They're pink.
Those were in the washer?
- Yeah. I put them in last night.
"- Oh, my God."
I don't think you're supposed to mix colors and khaki stuff.
Are you?
How do I make them not pink?
I don't think you can.
- Sorry.
"- l think they're cool, actually."
- You don't have to wear them.
- Why did you put them in?
I think Atlantor would appreciate seeing a different side of Rick.
The pinker side.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.
I hope not in those pants.
- Fade-away jump!
- Jess.
"- Of course, who else?"
- You must be making a lot of money.
But your dad could've paid for it.
"Come on, I fend for myself now."
"By the way, how did you two meet?"
"Well, I worked on a student film way back."
I built a set for them.
And she did the music.
"Oh, so that's how you met."
"Like me, she's an avid fan of yours."
Really?
Have you lost your mind?
Are you nuts?
"By the way, I'm Kim Moonsook."
Nice to meet you.
- So you do music?
"- Yes, it's nothing really."
Her music is great!
How do you like this music?
I brought this CD for you.
What?
Is this her music?
"Yes, isn't it nice?"
She's mainly a composer.
She made this to use as a demo for her singing debut.
Very nice.
This is a bit mainstream.
I also have some weird stuff.
Want to hear it?
"No, it's nice."
Let's listen to this first.
I really like this one.
New shoes?
Have you jogged in them yet?
Judging by your rash.
"No, you haven't."
No cream residue.
"You've been scratching, right?"
"It's itchy, doc."
"So I have to scratch it, right?"
"If I scratch, my itch will go away, right?"
Wrong!
"The more you scratch, the itchier you get."
The more your lesions will get worse.
"And the bedtime pill, you didn't take either, right?"
"If I didn't take them, you can tell?"
No.
But based on what you just said.
I know you didn't.
And how is your penis?
"Doc, you don't miss a thing, do you?"
I'm really upset.
What you ask is too hard.
It's like asking me to become a monk.
This...
Who sleeps at 9PM anyways?
"In my profession, it's impossible."
What I am asking you to do isn't hard.
It is hard.
Do you sleep at 9PM?
Or you work 24 hours?
Yes.
No weekends off?
Nope.
- Empty your pockets.
"- Hey, meth-head."
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.
"Do it, or I will kill you both."
"Okay, here you go."
Look.
Empty.
- Now you.
- I don't have anything.
- Do it.
- I don't have...
- Just empty your pockets.
- No.
I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna...
I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
- It's a matter of principle.
- A matter of principle?
- I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
"- I'm gonna stab you, man!"
"- For the love of God, empty your pockets."
- Okay.
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.
You give us a second.
Where did you get that money?
I had to change the bet... a little.
- You bet against me?
- I bet against you.
- Why would you bet against me?
- It was the right move.
Clap on!
"I said, the plate."
...that you're holding.
Get out!
This home is temple for us!
Right?
"You're right, sir."
Go on... don't mind this!
Go away!
Let me not see you around again!
"Thanks, Laxmi."
You have awakened us today.
I wonder how many thieves we have at home!
"She'll play Alibaba and drive away the thieves, grandpa."
"I threw her out of the gate, sir!"
"I'd throw her out of town, if I could."
I'll find another maid in a couple of days.
Why a maid?
Why not a male?
We can find a good cook.
"With a maid around, maybe..."
"You win, aunt!"
A male would be perfect.
I'll find a cook soon.
That's okay.
What do we eat till then?
I'll cook.
I did it for 5 years in my house.
No thank you.
You people have been flesh-eaters!
"You must help her, Laxmi."
I can't stand the smell of flesh in this house!
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lots!"
"All right, all right."
You'll be kissing the gunner's daughter before too long.
Get her out to sea while the tide's still with us.
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
"Aye, Captain."
Stow the prisoners.
Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
Maddy!
"I can't believe you are doing this, Maddy!"
I didn't bring you here so you could catch it.
"Shannon, relax."
This is for our safety.
You said The Beast is killing animals.
It could easily turn on us if it isn't contained.
"So, what?"
Then you're going to let it go?
"I'm not in the business of caging wild animals, no matter how unusual."
"We put it in here to get a closer look, that's all."
That's cool with me.
That thing has some serious fangs.
Shan.
OK.
I'm sorry.
It's just... it just got real all of a sudden.
"That's why I'm here, Shannon."
To show the world The Beast is real.
OK?
OK.
They'll kill us.
What are you going to say to them?
I don't know but I don't think sorry's going to cut it.
We could go back.
Do you want to?
Look.
Put it on me.
Tell them I made you do it.
"Thanks, but I'll take the blame."
I've earned it.
It's starting.
Not so soon.
How about tomorrow?
Let me tell you something.
"No need, just drop me a line."
Some chick is crazy about me.
I'm irresistible!
That's a good joke.
"Very funny indeed, good night!"
You are jealous.
"Guess, who's come to find me?"
The boss's fiancee
B.?
"How dare you call her B., only I can."
She calls me Robin darling too!
Robin darling?
Are you kidding?
"She's so sexy, she even tried to seduce me."
Tore everything off to rush and take a shower...
You mean her?
Me of course!
But she told me to do so.
Do you get it?
But it's very clear what she wanted to do.
Why is she lying on your bed?
I haven't done anything yet!
How dare you steal my first girlfriend?
I didn't.
Don't deny it.
This is the end of our friendship!
Did you go and visit him?
Yes I did!
Did you tell him to take a shower?
- What are you two up to?
"Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak."
"Party time, princess."
It's time for us to say goodbye.
Like hell.
"We made a deal, Karp."
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?
It's a family reunion.
And I'm off to one of my own.
"Farewell, my sweet."
Your generosity will not be forgotten.
It was just an accident.
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.
You could have died.
"If you had died, I'd be alone."
"You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead."
"Emme, I said I'm sorry."
What else do you want me to say?
Huh?
"He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine."
"How are you holding up, Emme?"
Holding what up?
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?
I'm fine.
He's not going to die.
Did my counselor leave?
"She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home."
You mean school.
This is my home.
"Yeah, of course it is."
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.
Have you had a nice day?
"Oh, what's this ***"
"Thank you, Nana."
It's so good to be here with you.
This place is so so acceptable.
Aha!
I got it.
I got the job!
We can definitely move out.
"Yeah, I know."
"I know, I was pretty speechless myself at first, but then I thought ""Hey, come on!"
"You know this was just a matter of time."""
I am...
a manager.
Right.
"Well, this is calls for a celebration."
Let's see.
"Would you like a go, Samuel?"
"No, ma-maybe not go too mad."
So we're going to have to throw ourselves into the house hunting.
"You'll be good at that, eh, Becky?"
"Well, not too far away I hope."
"We'll still be seeing you, won't we?"
Yeah.
"I mean yeah, of course."
You'll come to Sunday lunch?
Yeah.
"Yeah, when we can."
Alright.
I've not been on Facebook for four and a half months.
It is time for a status update methinks.
"Won't be strange, dear?"
So you've got a bodyguard.
But it can't be you.
"Yes, it's me."
"That seems funny, doesn't it... you and the 12 temptations?"
Sure.
I laughed my head off.
"Well, here i am."
"Well, now, that's just fine."
Let me see.
You can... you can go to the photograph gallery with me.
What?
I have an appointment there at 4:00.
That... that's-that's- that's-just a minute.
One second.
Just a little more light.
"Ah, that's fine."
"Oh, the hands... just put the hands out over on that."
Just relax a little bit.
Give me a little smile.
That's right.
"Hold it just like that, and i'll take one more look."
Oh... i've got it.
"Oh, that is beautiful!"
"Oh, that's so exquisite!"
Ain't you think she looks just like a...
like a... ain't you think so?
Maybe you can see something through that thing that i can't see.
"Well, go ahead."
"Look, look!"
"Oh, so soft... hey, you can't take this."
It's upside down.
"Oh, no."
One more time.
"Okay, on this part ?"
"It's like we're battling, right ?"
It's like a challenge.
"When I step forward like this, you have to challenge me back into my space, and I challenge you back in your space, like this."
"So, it's back, front, back, front, back, front, like that, that kinda feel."
"Step, back, forth, back."
"Wait, wait."
You're making me dizzy.
"Stop, stop."
"Sit on it, sit on it."
Stick your ass out.
- Do it.
- [ Both Laugh ]
"Okay, okay."
How am I doing ?
How's my butt ?
"[ Chuckles ] lt's nice. I mean, it's good."
Thank you.
[Sara] You made that ?
It's really nice.
It's Tanisha's.
That girl's gonna pay my way through design school.
What about your mom ?
Where is she ?
She was in jail...
for drugs.
For things women do for drugs.
She got out and took off.
"Well, maybe she'll come back."
"That is what Derek used to say when we were little, when Momma Dean used to piss us off."
But he grew up.
Where's Cutter?
"Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?"
- They catch him.
- What's that?
Who?
"In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter."
Who's they?
Priests or what?
Very bad men.
They'll give him torture.
"Go help, quick."
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
"And you'll run back just as quick, too."
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing!
I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right.
We'll go together.
- No.
"Tommy, what's the matter?"
"Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out."
"Don't worry, I'm not taking him."
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
"- No, you're right, and I don't."
"That doesn't mean I feel that way now, though."
"No, now you feel guilty."
You're still scared.
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.
"Well, that's true."
- You were really terrified?
"- Jenna, I am terrified."
"So am I, you idiot."
"I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and..."
"I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do."
"- Baby, that's not gonna happen."
- How do you know?
Because I know.
"- You know now, you didn't know before?"
- Yes.
I know now.
Were you telling me the truth last night?
You didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
But then I went back.
Fuck you!
Jenna.
Calm down!
Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"It's okay, Pete."
"- I can't come, Abb."
He won't-- He won't let me leave here.
I can't just leave.
He doesn't let me do anything.
"Yeah, well, it's-"
"- That's easy for you to say, Abby, all right?"
I will come and see you tomorrow.
"And we'll talk about it, okay?"
Wha-
- Why?
"Becau-- Yeah, because he's my husband."
That is my fault and I can't do anything about that.
"No, do not come here, I'm telling you, that's gonna make things worse."
"Yeah, I know, I know."
"I know, I know."
I-
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know--
"I don't know what to do, can't do this anymore."
I just want to die every day.
I can't.
"No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby."
Don't do that.
"I'm telling you, don't come here."
Just tell me that--
That you love me and that it's gonna be okay.
"I know, but just say it anyway, will you, honey, please?"
"Iâm dying over here, I need you."
I don't need you like that.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
Chris makes me happy.
That's it.
I'm not taking it.
Okay.
All right.
"Nice, y'all!"
That's the way!
That's the way!
Good teamwork!
You all need to call it!
"Watch that hole in the center, okay?"
You all need to pick that up.
"Hey, time out!"
Time out.
"It's looking great, girls."
They're double blocking me every time.
That's okay.
"No, they've figured out our move."
"No, they did not."
"Now, don't you act like this is luck."
This is not luck.
You all are doing a great job.
We are kind of lucky 'cause their star hitter's out sick.
TAMl:
"No, you all are playing a great game."
You're playing a great game.
I want you to keep it up.
"I want you to keep it simple and remember, you are playing this game and you are winning this game because of your teamwork."
You are a team.
You work together.
"And you, you just focus on that Riggins."
You slam it down his throat.
- Here.
"- God, that stinks."
"Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin."
Hold it.
Here.
Hold it on there.
"So, whatcha gonna do ?"
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
"Oh, ha !"
"Hey, baby, we lit it up out there."
I am serious.
"Did you see us, ""D"" man ?"
Do you see us ?
We're talking.
Anyway.
"Hey, baby, we lit it up."
"- Oh, man, come on, man !"
"- That shit ain't funny, man."
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- l thought you liked it down there.
"That's your specialty, ain't it ?"
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat ofthe moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- l'm gonna go home.
Are you ready ?
"- No, he's not ready."
He's talking to me.
"It's an ""A"" and ""B"" conversation."
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes, mom."
We're all over it.
Watch your step out there.
"Yeah, you too, Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.
He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not."
Stay there.
He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me, do not move."
Petty.
You know me?
A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.
It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
Shh.
Drop the knife.
"Get on the ground, face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
"Ain't no problem at all, Sheriff."
Anything I can do to help.
It's working.
Come on.
"Are you all right, hon?"
Did he hurt you?
"I'm sorry, look..."
"The sheriff's upstairs, all right."
We have to warn him.
I need you to help me open the door.
Can you do that?
Okay.
I'm gonna hook this out through the door.
Okay.
"Then you turn it on, all right."
"Catch you a cup of coffee, Sheriff?"
Homemade iced tea?
"No, thank you."
I'm sorry.
How long did you say you lived here?
I didn't.
"Well, how long?"
Long time.
And not a lot of decorations in this nice house.
"No, never had that for that kind of thing."
Is that right?
"Well, my wife Betty, she..."
She took care of all that stuff before she passed on.
"Nothing quite like a woman's touch, huh."
My wife died just last year.
"Well, my condolences, Sheriff."
Suppose it'll get better with time.

Let's go after him.
"No, you stay here."
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!
I only got one arm.
What do you want?
Put that down.
What do you want from me?
I want to let bygones be bygones.
I'm not falling for that.
"I lost an arm, but otherwise I'm fine."
And?
And nothing.
Tell me what you want!
I want to let bygones be bygones.
Maybe you don't believe me.
My arm's gone.
It ain't gonna grow back.
But here I am.
So it's money you want?
Money?
"Yeah, I want to make money with you guys, work with you guys."
"I thought I could take the respectable route, but I was a real dope."
So here I am.
What else can I do?
Be an organ grinder?
"No, I'd rather steal."
I did everything I could.
"But that's over and done with, even if it costs me my neck."
- So this is your latest idea?
"- No, no, no!"
I did everything I could!
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the treehouse.
But he's a savage!
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lot!"
"All right, all right!"
You'll be kissing the daughter before too long!
We're off to sea while the tide's still with us!
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
- We've all had our fill of jacob moore.
- I know.
So I'm ceasing this ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below!
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Hub sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
- Stow the prisoners!
"- Aye-aye, sir!"
That's it.
Give me that.
You can have it.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, we should probably go to the bedroom and..."
start clearing stuff out of there.
Right.
Yes.
This is weird.
And this is really weird.
Who's this?
- I don't know.
- How could there be a photo of my dad with his arm around this woman... on his nightstand and I don't even know who she is.
Maybe she's an old friend.
"Nah, she's gotta be a new friend."
This was taken at the Wynn.
The Wynn didn't open until just before he died.
Then maybe she's a new friend.
Why wouldn't he tell me about her?
I know.
It's because I didn't call him often enough.
I wasn't gonna say that.
All right.
Let's hit the closet.
Yeah.
We did it.
What did we do?
It took a lot of people.
"It took a lot of man-hours, but we checked everyone that came into the casino between noon and 3:00."
You want to guess how many people that is?
No.
Please don't make me do that.
"Come on, you're a guy."
You do this kind of thing all the time.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just act sexy.
I can act sexy.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm acting sexy.
Looks like you're trying to get a cobra out of a basket.
"Hey, this move killed for me in the '80s."
That's great.
"If a Duran Duran concert suddenly breaks out, you'll be set."
"All right, I got it, I got it."
Here goes.
Hi.
My name is Christine Campbell.
"I'm divorced, but I get along great with my ex-husband."
We're just better as friends.
"Anyway, I'm not crazy."
I'm very stable.
"In fact, I own my own gym."
It's one of those 30-minute workout places for women.
"I make decent money, though."
But most of it goes to my son's private school.
But I'm not a snob.
I'm very down to earth.
I just want what's best for my son.
"His name is Ritchie, we live in Mar Vista."
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Way to play it cool.
"Die, asshole."
"Oh, Ilia, that feels good."
Then I'll make you feel even better.
"Ilia, can't we have sex today?"
You know it's against the rules.
"If we do it, I'd be fired."
Then I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.
"I don't want that, but..."
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Feel good?
Feel good?
Feel good?
I'm gonna come!
"Come, I'm coming too!"
I'm coming!
Ilia.
It's perfume.
I hope you like it.
"I've been with lots of delivery girls, but no one's been as genuine as you."
Service tells you a lot about a girl.
"If you don't mind, will you go out with me?"
I'm sorry.
Of course...
"I'm an idiot, what was I thinking?"
I'm going home to Korea.
I can't take this.
"No, please take it."
"It's my first gift to a girl, ever."
"I talked with the clerk, wondering what you'd like."
"That itself was fun, my heart was bouncing."
My heart was bouncing.
"I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?"
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.
How about this to begin with?
Not that it's enough.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's much more than most people pay.
It doesn't seem near enough to me.
"Harry, listen..."
"Oh, sorry."
"Come along, will you?"
It's getting late.
Well...
But...
But you aren't really going just because he says?
"No, no, no."
But I have to go now.
But look here.
Don't you understand?
I ain't no...
I ain't no...
"No, I know you're not."
You're a girl with her heart just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.
"Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful about the company you pick, huh?"
"Well, but..."
"But you are here, ain't you?"
"Yes, but I shouldn't be."
"And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be."
"Well, I..."
I picks only them as wants my company.
- I'm sorry.
Why?
I guess there were some complaints that your eyes were more interesting to watch than the lead performance.
Ohh.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
"Oh, it stinks."
"(Sighs) Oh, my God."
I can't believe we're not in the play.
"Uh, yeah, well..."
That's not exactly true.
So we are doing the play?
"No, we're not."
So we're off the play.
"No, no."
That's not it.
So we're on the play.
- We're not.
- We're not?
Right.
We're not.
What?
Your mom's in.
You're out.
Just say it.
"Thank you, Mike."
I was getting there!
What?
"But you're gonna quit, right?"
"Well, quitting is certainly something that I could do, although I am the strongest voice of all the Ozians... (Sighs) And it is for charity, but if you really want me to quit, then I--"
I want you to quit.
"Okay, well, let's not jump into any rash decisions."
"Just sleep on it, and if you still want me to quit in the morning, I will."
I want you to quit.
"You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid."
We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain.
"We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here."
And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this.
Can't you drive her there?
It's too much of a risk.
Her condition is critical.
We might lose her then.
Lose her?
A coma.
"What's a coma, Dad?"
Go home and get some sleep.
There's nothing you can do here.
It was...
It was like a snake.
Shaped like a snake.
Pardon?
Has he been treated yet?
"No, I'm OK."
It's nothing.
Come on.
"Hello, sweetheart."
I just can't get you out of my mind.
I miss you.
Really.
Do you actually love me?
Then come over here right now.
"I'll undress you, you'll undress me..."
- Why don't you answer?
- Hello?
- It's me.
What are you doing?
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order
Sonny.
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
too.
You're a funny guy.
Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
I don't even know where to start.
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can."
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...
But not on this.
"You know, I just..."
I'll deal with it.
"I'll deal with it when I get back, you know."
I'll just...
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
"Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in..."
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, my God."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright.
Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag."
Alright.
You are a top bird.
"I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan.
Yeah.
It's odd jobs.
Okay.
The first letter's a B.
A. It's an A.
I think it's gonna tell us who A is.
D?
B-A-D.
Bad.
That's the whole message?
Bad?
- What's it supposed to mean?
- It means you got punked.
Toby doesn't trust us.
I don't blame him.
I don't think he'd mess with us like this.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of.
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
"This might be a joke, but it could be real."
"Look, either way, Toby's not the enemy."
"You know what, guys?"
I'm gonna go.
What was that all about?
How should I know?
Doesn't look like very much.
"Well, it's all we have."
The rest is gone.
"Mom, Mrs. Potter doesn't need that money anymore."
"No, but we can't keep it."
"No, not keep it but I don't know, maybe we could give it to somebody who needs it."
I love you for thinking that but I just want this nightmare to be over.
I'm putting the money back in the safe deposit box.
What is left of it.
- I'll see you tonight.
Put mother on.
I have to talk to her.
"Listen, firstly I'm sorry."
"Then, my condolences."
"If someone asks for me, say you couldn't reach me."
They don't know I've hired a cell-phone.
I'll be back for the seventh day of mourning.
I promise I'll be there.
Don't talk to me like that.
This is the wrong time.
All right. ls there anything else?
Take care.
Hello.
Hello.
Why aren't you singing now?
You sing so well.
"Go on, keep singing."
I dare not.
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.
We can't look each other in the eye.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
What are you doing down there?
I'm digging a well.
You don't dig wells on hills.
- l'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?
For telecommunications.
Why are you alone?
Working alone makes things simple.
"It's good, you don't have a boss."
"We came this far by faith, Lord."
"And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected."
"We thank you for him,Jesus."
- In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
- Amen.
"Oh,you can cry like a river, girl."
"You're crying so bad, I won't even make fun of you."
"Oh, God."
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
"I want you to be good, okay?"
"And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know."
I done told you what to do.
"Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers."
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
"Once he get in the door, I want him to stay in there for four years."
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
"Well, I hope so anyway."
When I was young
"- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA."
"If I set my mind, I can"
- I can go.
I can st
- I can go.
Get in good college.
I can go.
I'll call you tonight.
"Won't you sit down, Miss Kelly?"
My money do all this?
"Yes, your money and my brains."
Except that it wasn't your money.
You stole it from me.
To steal from a thief is no crime.
"Look, I'm broke because of you."
"Well, how would you like a job?"
Doing what?
Working for me.
I could use a pretty thief in my business.
I'd wind up in jail.
Not my way you wouldn't.
Yours for sure.
I'd be no use to you.
I'm not really a thief.
I saw you pull a little job.
"Small stuff, but it showed promise."
The wallet dropped on the floor.
I was tempted.
I was broke.
I never dreamed of picking up that wallet would end that way for Chuck.
He tried to kill me.
He loved me.
He was just trying to help me.
"You know, you and I are very much alike."
"Oh, we're both crooks."
Only there's one difference.
I don't want to be.
And you can't help yourself.
I like you.
A dead man.
A dead man at the lagoon.
We have to leave!
He's been into the grog again!
"Shut your mouth, will!"
"We all saw it, right?"
It's true.
I saw it with me own eyes.
- It rose up like a demon!
- Demon?
Get the women back into the stockade!
"First it attacked you, now it's come for me."
This place is cursed.
We're all cursed!
"Calm down, man!"
We have to find another island to get provisions from before it's too late.
"- It's a devil, sir."
- He speaks the truth.
"Right, you lot."
Load all the goods into the longboat!
Did you not hear him?
Move it!
We shouldn't have taken the ship!
"Shut up, man!"
You're giving everyone the jitters!
He must be sun-struck.
Let me help.
Right.
Just keep him away from the rest of the men.
Come on.
"Roll out the barrel, boys!"
Just put your shoulder into it.
"It's my dad, ok?"
He won't let me.
Why?
I...
"It's ok, just... tell me."
"I know it's not true, but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house because he thinks you're gay."
I know you're not.
I just...
I have to do what he says.
I'm sorry.
What if I was gay?
What do you mean?
Would you not want to sleep over at my house if I really was gay?
Hey.
So... don't worry about last night.
"It was almost curfew, and there was a lot of pressure."
Yeah.
But you still want to... right?
Of course.
"Um, Saturday night, we'll do it the right way, ok?"
"Yeah, I'd like that."
I got it all planned out.
We can go to a really nice dinner.
Totally on me.
"And then afterwards, maybe we can go to the beach."
- The beach?
- Yeah.
What's wrong with the beach?
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
"I know it's supposed to be all romantic and stuff, but there's sand everywhere, in all your business, and bugs."
It's...
It's pretty terrible.
Whatever.
We're probably gonna get arrested.
What do you want me to put?
Like how I said it.
"""I'll poop in your butt hole... and then you will poop it back... into my butt... and we will keep doing it""-"
- Back-
- Back-
- And forth-
- And forth-
With the same poop.
Same poop.
Forever.
"Wow, look at these beds!"
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.
Where'd you learn to make corners like that?
It's just the way we like it.
Really?
"I thought you preferred the rumpled, unkempt look."
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.
"At Mom's house, we have a chore wheel."
- What?
- Nothing.
A chore wheel.
"You put chores on it, and then you can spin it."
There's this metal thing... and it helps it to spin.
It's spinning from the metal.
Okay.
"Well- So, it's just a half shift."
"I'll be back in four hours, and we'll go do something fun, okay?"
Okay.
"Yes, but..."
"Don't bother about us, lvy, dear."
"- Oh, Marcia!"
- Oh.
For Miss Ivy Peterson.
"Thanks, governor."
Look.
Fifty pounds.
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?
He must have sent it for what he's done.
"No, not him."
"He's too mean, he is."
"Oh, I don't know."
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.
"Yes, that's it."
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.
"Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can."
"And then, then he'll follow me."
"And just when I think that I've got free, he'll..."
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it.
"Oh, if I could only do it I'd go down to the river."
"Oh, lvy."
"It's her nerves, that's what."
She ought to see a doctor.
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.
I know because I saw it there.
What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?
"What's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture if you're not going to pay attention?"
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!
Talking to locals is the best way to get information!
"You guys should be doing it, too."
That's a great idea.
We split up.
"That way, we find her twice as fast."
"Shane, with me."
"We shouldn't split up, we should stay together."
"Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else."
"We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay?"
Come on.
Let's go.
"Jason, there's a ton of people here."
"If we split up, we're gonna..."
Stay with Joey.
This place rocks.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm trying to have a good time.
I'm trying to have a party going on.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We gotta find Trudy.
I don't want to get into this.
"Come on, buddy."
"What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene?"
Look at all these people.
"They're running around, they're..."
I came to offer you true happiness.
"I'll marry you, Elise, you'll live in luxury!"
"You can even bring the child, if you want to."
You're a lucky girl.
"I was happy with my Henry, but then my luck flew away."
"Except for - look, they have the same eyes."
I'm sick of your comedy.
Keep your palace.
I don't want it.
And get out!
I'll stay true to Henry even though he's gone!
Impossible!
You must marry me!
Leave Elisa alone!
She's got to marry me!
She must marry me!
"So you won't let her be, you nasty wretch?"
We've had really enough of you.
We saw right through you!
Get out or I'll change you into a limping mare!
- You said you can't do it.
"- I know, but he doesn't."
Let's scare him out of his wits!
"Climb on my back, quick."
Don't drop me!
"Jean, it's me!"
The Duke!
"It's all her fault, and she's waiting for you!"
- Who?
- The old witch!
Our salvation!
But your Grace...
"and half of you is man, and the other half is woman. (Chuckling)"
"Shame on you, how can you say such things to your elders?"
"Nevermind, come on, let's all have a drink."
Bastard!
I'll tear him to pieces!
"Hey, what are you saying?"
Let's not worry about those things when we have these two beautiful young ladies to enjoy ourselves with.
(laughing)
(banging)
I'm sleeping.
"Hey, what's wrong?"
"He's so cold to us, we've done nothing to him."
Didn't you see his pigtails?
He acts just like a woman!
(Laughing)
He is more like a woman than a man!
"Well, you're a man."
"So, does he love you?"
Shut your mouth!
"Come on, let's go."
"No wait, don't rush."
"No, I can't wait!"
"If you rush, then you're gonna spoil the mood."
What do you want?
I want you to come and undress me.
But not using your hands.
But how?
I can't wait!
Just how am I gonna do that?
"You idiot, you'd use your mouth."
Well?
Do you like that?
I looked through your suitcase.
How often do you shave?
Once every day.
That's better.
"Well, you're not going to give me away, are you, Mike?"
It's very important to Nancy that you don't.
She'll be in very big trouble if you do.
"Now, why are you dressed up like that?"
"Oh, well, to help Nancy."
"Okay, but why are you dressed up like that?"
To help Nancy.
"You see, I can't explain it now, Mike, except that if they find out, see, that I'm a grown-up man, it can get Nancy in all kinds of trouble, see."
We don't want that to happen.
"So you'll help me out, huh?"
Okay.
Good.
"Do you collect rocks, too?"
"No, not really."
Then what are you doing with this?
"Oh, that ain't mine."
I found this in your suitcase in your pants' pocket.
Oh.
It still ain't mine.
Can I have it?
"Sure, be my guest."
Thanks.
I'll run a test on it.
I'm going to be a geologist.
"Oh, that's swell."
What do we do now?
Let's go.
Let's go.
- You're welcome.
Is that your car stuck there?
We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out.
"I see, thank you very much."
I'd really like to repay you somehow.
- Don't worry about it.
- But still.
It was really nothing.
Let's go.
- Thank you for your help!
- You're welcome.
Get her keys.
"We're just gonna grab some stuff and then we're gone, all right?"
"hey, hey, hey."
Come on.
Army food.
Yum.
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.
Let's get out of here before I start puking again.
"Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here."
Just take the boat and go.
Please.
"Actually, we don't really need this."
I'm gonna find them.
The people who did this are not gonna get away.
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.
"She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong."
We just have to keep watching her.
Bad heart valve.
She's had it since she was born.
"Alright, buy it at four."
I'll try.
You knew something.
"Well, I told you."
It was too late when you told me.
If I'd had the pleasure of knowing you before.
Do you think he's going to get it at four?
"No, but it's a good buy at five."
I couldn't get it.
"Alright, buy it at five."
"I'm sorry, it's going to six."
Buy it at six.
I won't buy it at all.
Cancel the order.
You mustn't get mad just because you missed a good buy.
Who gave you this tip?
I specialize in tips.
Give me your card.
I'm afraid I don't have one with me.
But I'll be happy to call you when I get the next tip.
I usually don't do this.
"I'll call you, Mrs. Ryan."
"And if you're not in, I'll leave the message with your husband."
"I have no husband, I am a widow."
Who was your husband?
Peter Ryan.
Peter Ryan!
Did you know him?
"Everybody knew Peter Ryan, the financial wizard."
We were married in Europe.
He brought me to this country.
A short while after he died.
There may be some tools we can use.
"Okay, I'll try to reach it."
"There'll be a phone line as well, I heard the main house."
"Probably a burglar alarm too, so we need to... we need to get the police here if we can Okay, how're you doing?"
You okay?
"Better than you, babe."
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
You think Chris could have sent the postcard?
I don't know.
Maybe.
"But really, I-I-I don't know."
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Of course.
Might get a little hairy.
I don't want you getting any ideas.
Absolutely not.
I just wanna get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke.
"None of us sent the card, Justin."
Seriously... this hasn't gone too far.
"You can just set us free, walk away."
No one will talk.
You have my word.
Here's the deal...
Someone owns up to sending the postcard
- I let you all go.
- And if no one owns up?
"- Well then, we play Truth or Dare."
"- You're full of shit, man."
- It's a nice word for titties.
- Where's Mom?
- What doyou mean?
What do you think she's doing right now?
I don't know.
Screwing her new boyfriend probably.
- I think she's buying us presents.
"- Yeah, Robby."
Right now she's probably buying us each a car!
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
I can tell it is.
What should wewrite?
"""I have a big wiener""?"
I want to poop back and forth.
What?
What does that mean?
"Like, I'll poop into her butt hole... and then she'll poop it back... into my butt hole."
And then we'll just keep doing it back and forth... with the same poop.
"Oh, my God."
I'm going to put that!
"""I want to poop... back and forth."""
"Oh, God."
"She's gonna think we're a crazy, perverted person."
- Ooh!
She thinks we're crazy!
"- No, tell her like how I said it."
"No, she'll never write back."
"We have to sound like we're a man, you know?"
That's just lame.
It's stupid.
"But you said I could do half, and you've done all of them before this."
I need to know what happened.
"So... there's no party and it's just us, and what, this is some sort of set up?"
You're his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
"- Come on, Paul."
We're going.
- I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of the summer term.
I think something might have happened there.
"He topped himself, mate."
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have got us to come here under false pretenses.
That's just out of order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
This is what drove him to it.
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"""
What does this mean?
"I mean, you're his friends, you must have some idea."
I've heard enough of this.
I'm leaving.
Who's coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
"- Yeah, well, we can take our chances."
"I'm not finish yet, Chris."
"Well, I am."
Step aside.
I can't do that.
"- Oh, my God!"
- This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
"- You know, I'm on to you."
- What do you mean?
"Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?"
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
"Things are different now, man, all right?"
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
"Look, man, this is about respect."
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
"- Yeah, much flyer."
I respect you.
"- No, you don't."
"Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room."
Face to face
Just when...
Just when you thought Our chance had past
What?
I own this song.
"For God's sake, let me kill them!"
Let go of me.
Don't go there!
Come back here.
It's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.
You'll be killed.
You crazy?
Don't go to the ruins.
Come back!
They were in the marshes.
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.
- I'll look after them.
- All right.
You knew the risk you were taking bringing them here.
It's too late now.
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.
I know you are there!
You saw them!
They can set you free if they wish.
But you're the one who has to wait!
They have to come of their own free will.
I've seen how pure they are.
How innocent they are!
"I won't intervene, but I beg you to spare them!"
So be it.
Let destiny be fulfilled!
"Don't you want to play, Madame Louise?"
Last night ended in tragedy.
- What happened?
"""This ain't no beach or park."" ""l'm resting! "" l said."
"They pull me in, they start giving me all kinds of questions."
"You know, this and that."
"""What are you going to tell us, tough guy?"" l says, ""My usual."
Zero.
"Nothing."""
"""Why tell you?"" The fuck."
"He says, ""No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy."""
"I said, ""All right, I'll tell ya something, go fuck your mother."""
"You saw the paper, Anthony."
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
This big prick again.
"He says, ""What do you want to tell me now, tough guy?"""
"I said, ""Bing, what are you doing here?"
"I thought I told you to go fuck your mother."""
I thought he was gonna shit.
The fuckers.
"Me, I wish I was big just once."
Funny.
You're really funny.
"What do you mean, I'm funny?"
"It's funny, you know. lt's a good story."
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
"It's just, you know."
You're just funny.
"You know, the way you tell the story and everything."
Funny how?
"I mean, what's funny about it?"
"-Tommy, you got it all wrong."
- Do what?
You can't kill anyone.
What makes you think they'll let you?
They don't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do.
It's all about Allie.
Then where are they?
We tried to pick up Lisa.
Lisa was helpless.
Allie can take care of herself.
Then what makes you think any of this will work?
I don't know if it's gonna work.
At least I'm not afraid to try.
"Mary, don't do this."
Listen to me.
I-I know this.
Walk away.
"Even if you lose the project, walk away... before you do something you can't walk away from."
MAN:
Here they come.
Why don't you just fade away?
You're a burden to the project.
"You don't have the stomach for it, and you don't have the brains."
You have no idea what I'm capable of?
What I've done?
I won't have any more blood on my hands.
Everybody set?
Get a tight lead on that subject.
Run away!
Take the little girl!
It's a trick!
Run!
It's a trick!
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You got to straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
"I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you got to go back."
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I can't have it.
"I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it."
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
"You got to go home, okay?"
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend to pick up something for me.
Did that...
Did that mean something or was that just us getting caught up in the moment?
"I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,"
I just don't want us to go right back to where we were.
Then... what do you want me to do?
"Amy, I want you to figure out what's important to you."
I have.
"Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have."
So what do you want?
You're gonna have to tell me what's important to you.
Say something.
Just sit down.
They'll be fine.
"Yeah, I know."
I know.
And who do we have to thank for that?
"Hey, honey."
Good night.
"Yeah, tell me again."
Who do we have to thank?
"Yeah, Mel."
"I-no, no, no!"
"These are true ""hot shot"" type horses."
"No, you have to see them."
"Yeah, I got a client roster in my phone from last month."
Is that still up-to-date?
"Okay, good."
"Thanks for spreading the word, Scott."
"Just, just, just come up."
That's it.
"If you see them, I guarantee you'll buy a few of them."
Okay.
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.
No.
"If he stops, it'll fall off."
"Even if he slows down, it'll fall."
The best thing for that fish would be... if he could just drive steadily... forever.
I guess these are his last moments of life.
Shall we say some words?
I didn't know you... but I want you to die knowing that you were loved.
I love you.
Hey.
It was on your roof!
.
We'll go in front of you!
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.
We've got to keep him at a steady speed.
Just keep them steady.
"Oh, God."
That little girl is gonna have towatch it.
But at least they know.
At least we're all together on this.
"When me and Pam were first in love... we hated to be apart, even for an hour."
"Oh, yeah."
I had something like that once.
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.
We loved to sleep when it was time to sleep.
Not sex.
"I mean, we had sex... but what we really loved was to sleep like babies all day long."
That sounds perfect.
I don't want to have to do this living.
You gotta see this.
Look at this.
This is how they're separating us.
You can control the doors from here.
Watch.
There they are.
Yeah.
They don't even care we're down here.
"Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room."
Not yet.
"Now look, I've..."
"I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out."
Where?
"Okay, look at this."
Look at this.
You see that room right there?
"Those are, those are drainage ducts right there."
"Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it."
What do you mean you guys?
"Look, I can hide."
I'll stay here.
I'm gonna slow you down.
Connor.
"Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair."
Okay.
"You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then,"
I'll hide down here and-
- We're not leaving you again.
I would leave me.
"No, we're staying."
How many people have they killed?
"If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again."
It's more than that.
I need help.
I can't stand it anymore.
"It's Hyde, sir."
"It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde."
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.
He ain't a human.
He's a beast.
"And he won't let me go, sir, and I am afraid to run away."
"Marcia, she's my girlfriend, and Freddie, that's her friend, they they say it's my nerves, and that you know about such things."
And that you could help me.
"Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!"
If you can't help me give me some poison so I can kill myself.
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?
"I tell you, I'm afraid."
No he ain't a man.
"He's a devil, he is."
He knows what you're thinking about.
"If he knows I'm here, who knows what he'll do."
"It won't be nothing human, I can tell you!"
"Oh, please."
Please help me keep him off.
"I'll do anything you ask, sir."
I ain't as bad as you might think.
Well...
Men say that I...
I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself.
"You liked me once a little, didn't you?"
"Really, you..."
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.

Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
Like what?
"Well, all those years, I knew there was something."
Not you!

All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.

You look scared for sure right now.

This is really dangerous. or you can do this.

"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.

You know what I'm saying?

I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.

"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!

Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.

How would you know that?

"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.

Look after my shop for a month.
Why?

I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.

Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.

"Well, gentlemen, I think it's all over."

(footsteps crunching)
It's just a matter of time before he catches me.
"I'm smacking tree-- oh, my God."
"- (high-pitched static) - Oh, my God."
(wheezy gasping)
I love and hate this game so much.
"Ooh, my heart just dropped."
(resonating rumbling)
"- ♪ (dramatic chord) ♪ - Oh, sh-- (Finebros snickering)"
It's over?
"""Pages: zero out of eight."" Really?"
My hand is shaking.
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."
Sit in the car.
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.
I won't leave papa.
I'll slap you if you refuse.
"- No, mother."
"Come on, sit inside."
Please..
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).
What?
"lf you were a Muslim, I would've said Allah."
"lf you were a Christian, then Jesus Christ."
"You're a Hindu, so Krishna."
"You, here?"
"You're an excellent stuntman, really."
Very good.
I'm sure you're acting is decent as well.
Why don't you approach some television channel?
They keep remaking Ramayan and Mahabharat.
Krishna.
Suited-booted Krishna.
Here to teach me a lesson.
Look.
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
"And if anything unwanted comes up in the future, get rid of it."
And I'm sorry.
But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
But I love Kishan.
Then get ready for the ruin.
I agree.
Welcome!
Kishan!
Father has come here.
And Jimmy has done this.
"Yes, I heard."
- God!
Support my love.
It has to reveal one day.
"So, let it reveal today."
"""I have heard this from people."""
"""It's also written in books."""
"""Everyone has said the same."""

Uh... pink.
"Yes, I have a pink sari. ..."
"But, it has big flowers."
The big flowers will look very nice.
Now go!
Your daughter is very innocent.
Your dream has come true.
"Miss, your airman has come!"
"Renu, are you all right?"
What's happening?
"- Nothing, sir."
Where is Renu?
- She is inside the house.
"I am aware of that but, where is she?"
- She's inside the house.
Are you all right?!
"- Yes, sir."
"Aunty, give me my clothes."
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.
I have arrived.
I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.
Our wedding is also fixed.
Shameless man!
Impertinent!
Are you going or....
Get dressed quickly.
We are getting late for the function.
Give me something to wear.
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.
[ Finch ]
She reads the articles.
[ Boys Moaning ]
Is she ?
She's goin' downstairs.
[ Moaning ]
"- Oh, my God !"
"- Jackpot, baby !"
- Can you believe this ?
"- Nadia, I would have never known."
I have an announcement that I would like to make.
There is a gorgeous woman... masturbating on my bed !
- [ Finch ]
"Thank you, Nadia !"
"- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it."
- [ Scoffs ]
"What am I supposed to do, Kev ?"
- Seduce her.
Wha-- What the hell would I say ?
Go over there and ask her if she needs an extra hand.
"- That's stupid, Kev."
I can't-- - That's not stupid !
You're stupid if you don't go !
Come on !
Get over there !
"- Get goin', man."
She's prime.
- Get out of here !
- She's waitin' for you.
"- Okay, all right."
The money has been paid
When did I say that?
Go now I won't fight， I didn't say I would
She's really got the nerve.
She's special
She'll crush you to death!
Miss， I give up.
I give up
I give up
Beat her
Don't!
Open up
Help， help!
I hate being hit on the chest， you bitch!
Landal， what are you doing inside?
Why so noisy?
Nothing.
I'm composing
Does it sound pleasant?
So-so
What happened?
My brother's still not back.
What about your sister?
Mimi hasn't returned either
You alone?
And me.
What do you want?
I feel a bit lonely
Shall I keep you company?
No.
Good night
Good night
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

- He urgently requires blood transfusion!
Who?
Who here will give their blood?
What blood type do you have?
- A!
- And you?
- AB!
- And you?
- B!
"- We need blood type ""XZ!"""
It's an extremely rare blood!
And here is where I come out.
- Me.
"I have blood type ""XZ."""
- And you will spare your rare blood?
- I will.
"And here, of course, everyone will applaud."
- Inochkin.
Inochkin!
You used to be my blood enemy.
And now you are my blood brother!
But I still won't let you come back to the camp.
You went swimming in the forbidden area!
Nothing I can do.
Inochkin!
Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
- It's movie night.
We'll go all together!
Nobody will see you in the dark.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
Ay!
Ay! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;All you needed to do was open your mouth.
I can't lie.
Smart ass!
What should we eat?
Uh...
How about ribs?
I like rib patties.
That is slightly...
Then do you want to have sushi?
I know a great place.
"Their fried fish is also good. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;And, they also have Yeongdeok snow crab."
"Even that... for the time being, no..."
Then what do you want to eat?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
We haven't had it lately.
"Oh, Pizza sounds great."
Really?
Then where should we go?
How about Marco's?
Their pizza is good!
That place is expensive.
Let's go where we always go.
Ah!
The pizzeria at the crossroad?
Hey!
There is no place to sit there.
"Baek Go Dong, let's go somewhere else."
Somewhere else!
Forget it.
Go there!
It's a great site.
"Earthquake's got a thing on there, oh my god."
"Oh, I know, I always go."
"That's another thing too, there's like, there like a top link on their US business site, so that the, like, uh, the top thing that's come out."
Visited.
Yeah.
"Let's say, right now."
Have you ever been to
California?
4.5.
There was one last night too.
"It's So it, so it just ended?"
It just happened right now?
Yeah.
"Just now. ,, , What part of California do you live in?"
Los Angeles What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh yeah, I see where it came from."
I'm just looking at the epicenter.
Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."
I hope not.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
- I did everything for you!
"I did everything, what else do you want me to do?"
"For God's sake, Basha."
Is your heart that cold?
"I beg you, answer me!"
What?
Answer me!
Popoy stop it!
Basha...
I love you.
And it hurts.
Take me!
Right now!
Take me right now!
Hello?
Where are you?
Huh?
Where?
"I've been going around here over and over, where are you?"
I'm coming.
You keep saying you're coming but I still can't find you!

I say whoops!
Don't take tings granted..
"It could be really bad, at the end."
"What are you saying , man?- Don't use every opportunity, to come close to Mira."
I don't want to see you next to her again.
"Man, Nylon (Plastic), Whom are you threatening?"
"Get away from my girlfriend, otherwise I will cut your legs."
"Man, i would chew you on this soil and plant parsley over your body."
Leave..
What's that for?
It's my granddad's cross.
It'll keep trouble away.
I'm off.
Go ahead.
You abandoned her!
You hear?
You got cold feet.
Say something!
Tell him he's a coward!
Shut up.
"You mean, everyone run for your life?"
- Yashka couldn't have helped.
- You would've abandoned her too?
What's the use?
He'd have got caught himself and not saved Ksanka.
For shame...
Wait for me here.
"If I'm not back by evening, you come..."
Valerka.
Who's there?
"It's me, Father Mokei."
Danka?
Thank God...
I thought you'd followed your father.
I'm still alive.
Everybody's gone mad.
They threw the bell-ringer from the belfry for spite.
The bell's not been rung since Christmas.
- What are you here for?
- Looking for my sister.
She's at the inn - a waitress.
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."
The GSE is Pete's firm.
All right?
He calls the shots.
Yeah?
"Well, fuck the lot of you."
GSE?
Get out of the fucking way!
Move!
Get yourself cleaned up.
Tommy.
"This is it, mate."
We'll finally get back at those fucking Hammer cunts.
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Millwall!
Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
I said stay there.
You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?
- You're a liar.
She's not coming back.
- I promise she is.
I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Stop, please!"
Where are you?
I don't want to see her die again!
"Please, I beg you."
Help me.
Please.
This is yours.
"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Then buy me a long line at least.
About 500 meters long.
So I can drag the line along to make phone calls.
This is so awkward.
This really is awkward.
My face's burning.
My lips are so dry.
You look Handsome.
"Hey, I showed you my picture."
I couldn't even see your face.
You're really young.
Are you sure you're married?
I told you I married when I didn't know better.
I am a young miss.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
"You're very handsome, too."
And so honest.
Nuts.
This is nuts!
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Just talking to myself.
This is nuts.
This coffee is strong.
"You're 21, then what year does that make you?"
Sophomore.
- Have you dated before?
"- By that, do you mean..."
- if I slept with anyone?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- That's not right.
I'll cook the food and serve you too.
Now go and take a bath first.
You all look like goons.
"We're goons, we'll look like goons."
- What?
He means that we've taken up a disguise of goons.
So we must look like one.
- Oh!
That's fine.
But I didn't ask your names. - your?
- Santo!
Santo!
- Raghu!
- Gani!
- Mohit.
Santo!
Raghu!
Gani!
Mohit!
It means Sa... re... ga... ma... wow!
Tuneless police officer have their names in tune.
Sa... - Re... - Ga... - Ma... - Tunes of one instrument.
Santo!
What are you doing there?
Come out!
Of this instrument.
"- C'mon, hero is calling us."
"Whatever you say, but she's so charming."
Remember one thing.
We should not forget our objective for this girl.
This girl will not stay here for 18 days.
- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.
l..
I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Great!
Have this.
- Thank you!
Not so much!
Enough!
- Have some more!
You too have some.
My plate is already full.
I will take.
But you are not eating at all.
I am eating it.
"Enough, seema!"
- Please!
Thank you!
You too have some!
"- No. lt""s okay."
"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
"Why can't you harness that strength to eat?"""
"""But why?"
"Why do I need to eat?"""
Captain Carpenter.
"I would like to talk to Lieutenant Gerard, please."
Lieutenant Gerard isn't here.
Be glad to take a message.
I'd like to talk to him.
"It's about this fellow, uh, Kimble."
Kimble?
You have something on Kimble?
I sure have.
I'd like to say it to the lieutenant.
I'm afraid you'll have to say it to me.
Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?
- All girls here can.
- Can you show me?
- All right.
- Can you teach me?
"I can teach you something, too."
- Want me to teach you telepathy?
- What now?
"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!
- Try to make him do stuff.
- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.
- Dolt.
"- I swear, that wasn't me."
He did that on his own.
- There's something in there!
- Smells like a wolf.
Or a badger.
- Have you ever smelled a badger?
- A hundred times!
Too modern.
Too empty.
Too touristy.
Your knees gone yet?
- Not yet.
What are you doing here in Paris?
It's our wedding anniversary.
And you only have time just for each other?
Shut up!
Idiot.
You make my blood boil like nobody else!
Sign of a deep connection!
Once the kids have gone...
What's left of us?
Beckett says  'Do we mean love when we say love?'
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.
Oooh!
"- Oh God, Nick!"
You cannot love and hate the same person.
[laughing]
- It really hurts!
Usually in the space of 5 minutes in my experience.
I think we've earned a very good time.
People don't change.
They do.
They can get worse!
[French accent]
"Do I please you, monsieur?"
Here's the bill.
- That is quite a lot of money.
Get your coat.
If you can't trust your wife that much then go live happily by yourself.
What do you mean who?
"It's my friend, Misook."
Here check for yourself.
Hear that?
Bye!
Oh my god.
It flipped over.
"Uh, What happened?"
How old is your kid?!
- Eight!
- How old?!
First grade?
-You met him through the Internet.?
- He was closer than my husband...
I wasn't sure who my real husband was.
I'd get so confused...
You lived in a total illusion.
"Anyhow, love is an illusion!"
"You liked him so much that he felt burdened, right?"
Or Are you...maybe a perv?
Do you like to hit?
Or like to be hit?
Maybe to be bounded?
"- Um, isn't that the College guy?"
"- Uh, it is..."
Hey!
Hey!
College Student!
Are you just gonna ignore us?
Why would I ignore you?
I'm so tired I can't even see.
- Abi...- Huh?
"Okay, I'm coming."
I am so excited Fatmagül.My heart is beating like a drum.
"Meryem Abla said the results aren't announced yet.I mean the page is down, she said."
"- Okay, I'll get it.- My hands are sweaty, can you take it?"
Alright...
Fatmagül the page is open now.
Fatmagül bring that number of yours.So we can check it.
"Give it to me, canım."
It's so slow...
New customers have arrived.I shall go greet them.
"- Hello, welcome.- Hello, do you have tea?"
- Of course we do.- Can we have two teas?
- Coming right up.- Thank you.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Fatmagül...
- Well done girl.- What !?
"Yey, I passed it!"
I passed it.
"Abi, come here, I passed!"
Well done!
Didn't I tell you?
"- I told you, you would be successful.- Well done my clever sister."
"Thank you, Meryem Abla.If it wasn't for you, I--"
What did I do?
You did it alone.
- You gave me courage.- But the labor was on you.
- Thank God.- Let's give the news to Kerim as well.
"Sure, he was waiting for your call anyway."
- Ops...
They wanted two teas.- I'll get their teas.
"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.
- Go - I won't go..
What are you are going to do?
Narin..
Narin...
Narin???
"You went to Serdar, didn't you Narin??"
I know you went to Serdar!
"You won't sit at home, waiting for me!"
"What is there that you can't find here, I don't know!!!"
Good evening.
- Welcome...
- Thank you
Hello?
"Where are you, Narin?"
It is late.
I should go.
Let me drop you off.
"No, don't trouble yourself."
I can go by myself.
It is late.
It won't do to go by yourself this late.
"Go, my daughter."
"I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo."
"At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue..."
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!
When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!
Anthony Gonsalves.
Did I really make this?
I don't believe it.
I can't believe that I made this?
The way it has landed I am completely sure you've made it.
What did you say?
- That's why professor.. ..only you can tell me how I can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.
- You gave me.
"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"""I love you."""
"""Julie.."
"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.
- I see.
Thrice.
'The first time..'
"'I love you, Kamla.'"
'I want to marry you.'
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
Sit over here.
"Stop playing around, dad."
Wait a sec Young-hoon.
Will be with you shortly.
"Thought you were hurt, look well to me."
My sincere apology for being well.
Are these even washed?
Should've never come here!
"Well, Ji-hwan says you will wash them again, for sure and told me to soak them and hang."
And those... socks need to be sewed.
I'll let you pass just for today.
Are these rags or socks?
Shit!
I guess you're a writer.
Yeah.
A novel.
"Oh, I see."
Why do you look at me like that?
Do I look that handsome to you?
"Yes, you're handsome."
Kissing my ass?
So young yet corrupted already!
Um...
Did you want to tell me something?
Have a seat.
Okay.
I consider Dal-rae like a daughter
How long have you been a couple?
It's been about three months.
You two can't be serious then.
Huh?
Are you close to Ji-hwan?
Again you taunted me!
Duty is duty!
Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town?
"Friend, this is a small town."
But many activities are carried out here!
I will explain to you when l am free.
I will leave now.
"Listen.. don""t forget your friend for the sake of your duty!"
"All the best! - see you! sir, he is chief lnspector of customs."
Diwan Dinanath.
"Mr. Dinanath, how are you, sir?"
Fine.
Thank you.
How are you?
Fine.
Thank you.
I have heard a lot about you from lG.
Thanks.
I was waiting for you only. - come.
I have to go for my duty.
And you have come from a long journey.
You must be tired.
Rest for now.
Have dinner with me in the evening.
And we will discuss the matter there.
"Thank you, sir."
I am lucky that I got the chance to have home made dinner.
Pleasure is mine.
- Thank you.
"Thank you so much. - see you tonight, Mr. Diwan!"
Bye!
Rao.
"You're gonna get it now, you little Yank."
"Bov, you wanna make up for what you've done?"
Get my brother's family out of here.
Tommy!
"Don't you want to finish me off, then?"
"You're already finished, little Petey."
"The NTO will take care of you in a minute, you mug."
"We didn't kill your son, Tommy!"
You did!
"You should have protected him, mate!"
He was your son!
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
"- He was your son, Tommy!"
- Get in the fucking motor!
Get in the car!
- Get Pete!
Only a poor little Hammer!
His face was all battered and torn!
He made me feel sick!
I hit him with a brick!
Now the cunt's not laughing or singing No more!
"- He's not laughing or singing-- - No, Tommy, he's had enough!"
I'll get us out of here.
Go.
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!
Pete!
Fucking help him!
Pete Dunham's life taught me there's a time to stand your ground.
His death taught me there's a time to walk away.
I would never have the chance to thank him.
But I could live in a way that would honor him.
Fine.
I feel all right.
( ferry whistle blows )
We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!
And what kind of name is that for a chat room?
"""Welcoming Dumpy Housewives"" Weird taste!"
Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.
Let's eat first.
Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.
"- Hey, why are you getting in?"
- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.
There' no taxi here.
That's your problem.
Close the door!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
I was just kidding.. Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you climb up?
"Aren""t you ashamed?"
Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? show me your baskets!
Hey!
You want to seize our baskets!
The basket contains fishes and not gold!
I know you all very well!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
"What are you doing? constable, what are you doing?"
Are you mad?
Yes!
You have spoiled the fishes!
Now who will buy these fishes?
"Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. ..to check whether gold is hidden in it or not!"
Why are you after our fishes?
Go and check the fishes in the oceans!
Fine!
I am leaving!
I am leaving!
"Why are you screaming? seema, why are you running away from me?"
My friends have told me so many things about you.. ..that now I am afraid of you.
What did they tell you?
"- I won""t tell you!"
It will kill me!
Tell me!
What do your friends say? sit at a distance!
More! - oh God!
I said I won't charge you for this idol.. ..but I will have to pay the sage.
"Yes, of course."
Here you go.
100 rupees.
Only 100.. - Mahadev.
Mahadev.
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.
Do you how much I had at that time?
Only 20 rupees.
Only 20 rupees.
Remember?
So do you know what I did?
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And I gave that to him.
It's all about faith.
Anything you give is less.
Anything you give is less.
Wow.
What a thought.
"Not just my gold chain, I will give up my gold ring too."
That's it.
Here.
Here you go.
- Great.
Take of everything.
Take of everything.
- Take it.
"Great, great, great."
Glory to.. - Lord Krishna!
Glory.
"Now, where will this idol emerge from?"
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
- Yes.
- Or are you protecting someone?
No.
Or are you carrying the can since you don't got much time left?
- No.
"- Tell me, who wanted this from you?"
- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."
- What's your problem?
- What do you want?
We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.
"Okay, thanks."
You were on duty again last night?
You didn't sleep.
Was it hard last time you were in jail as well?
What is it to you?
Whatever man.
"Hey, what is this?"
Did it again?
You did it again?
You washed my pants with the letter in it?
Why don't you check it before?
What am I gonna do with this now?
"- I am sorry, abi."
- Fuck your apology.
When are you gonna stop being stupid?
You're the one who shouldn't have kept your letter in your pockets.
Fuck you.
Eat your breakfast.
Do it like he does.
Tell me!
What do they say?
"My friends say.. that by saying no, men become women""s slave."
ls that so? so you want to make me your slave?
- Yes.
What else did they say?
"My friends also say.. when men become fervent.. ..then they should meet the girl""s father and not the girl."
I think your friends have fallen in love with me.
And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you.
And they want to form a relationship with me. seema.. how is your friend?
ls she very beautiful?
ls she young?
- Yes!
ls she capricious?
- Why?
"What""s your problem?"
I have no problem!
Filthy man!
You think about other girls!
"Yes, now I will have to think!"
Why?
"What""s the flaw in me?"
"Not flaw, injustice!"
"I want to come closer to you and you are going away! seema.. you won""t go away from me, will you?"
- No.
Your love has made my plight bad!
"Yes, seema."
"You belong to me, don""t you?"
- Yes. only you dwell in my heart.
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open. only you dwell in my heart."
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."
I need to go.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Eom!
What is this money for?
Here is today's weather forecast.
Heavy clouds and showers are expected tonight.
How was it?
Was it okay?
Too slow.
It'll be night and raining by the time you finish.
"And smile, won't you?"
"Good, good."
Su-eun!
Let's do it again.
I can't hear you.
"Once more, please?"
I'm your only sister!
"So you're clumsy, aren't you?"
"You're a lousy artist, but your face is well-drawn."
I didn't know we had such a cutie in our park.
Oh?
This...
How did you know it was mine?
"Is there any other artist around here, dummy?"
It's all smudged.
Tell me it's a very important painting for you...
You could've just thrown it out.
But thanks anyway.
Damn!
You punk!
"I was going to be generous since you're cute, but..."
"Well, I'll let you off this time Today is your lucky day."
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
"No, let's take him right in."
( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
And the court wants to punish me for it.
Prince.
Will I be banished?
Will I have to go away again?
Will my mom have to go through that cause of me?
"No, Prince Yuning."
- Crown Prince.
- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.
"No, Yuning."
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box
Big fish little fish cardboard box Fill the trolley fill
"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

History.
Battle of Ortona
"The Battle of Ortona was a small, very violent battle fought between German and Canadian troops. It was fought on December 20–28, 1943. It was part of World War II."
"The battalion of German paratroops were from the German 1st Parachute Division under ""Generalleutnant"" Richard Heidrich. The Canadian forces were from the 1st Canadian Infantry Division under Major General Chris Vokes."
"It was part of the fighting on the Adriatic area in Italy. The battle has been called ""Little Stalingrad"" because of the violent, close fighting. The battle took place in the Adriatic Sea town of Ortona, with a population of 10,000."
Background.
"The Eighth Army's attack on the Winter Line defences started on 23 November. By the end of the month, Allied troops broke through the Gustav Line defences. The Allied troops were fighting towards the Moro river, near Ortona."
Ortona was one of Italy's few deep water ports on the east coast. The Allies wanted to capture the port. The Germans had constructed a series of defensive positions in the town.
The battle.
The Canadians had to battle the German 1st Parachute Division. These soldiers were experienced after many years of war. Adolf Hitler ordered them to defend Ortona.
The Canadian attack on the town was on December 20. The Germans had hidden machine guns and anti-tank guns in the town. This made it hard for Canadian tanks and infantry to move. The fighting was very violent. The soldiers fought for every house.
"After six days fighting, 2nd Brigade's third battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, joined the battle. Tanks from 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade also joined the battle."
"On 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the Germans withdrew from the town. The Canadians had 1,375 dead."
Battle of Anzio
"The Battle of Anzio, which is also called Operation Shingle (January 22, 1944) was an Allied sea landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces of Anzio and Nettuno, Italy."
The attack was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas. He wanted to get around German forces on the Winter Line. Then he wanted to attack Rome. Making a sea landing in a marshland needed to be done quickly.
The landing surprised the Germans. The Allies even got near Rome. The Allies got their men ready on the beach. The German commander in the Put his guns around the beach. The Germans also flooded the marsh with salt water.
"After a month of heavy fighting,"
the Allies finally got past the beaches in May. The Allies went north-west to Rome which was captured on 4 June.
The German Tenth Army at Cassino were able to go north of Rome. Then they got ready to defend the Gothic Line.
Background.
"At the end of 1943, following the Allied invasion of Italy, Allied forces were stuck at the Gustav Line. Thid was defensive line across Italy. The land of central Italy helped the defence."
Operation Shingle was planned by Winston Churchill in December 1943. He planned to land two divisions at Anzio and capture Rome.
"General Harold Alexander had thought of a plan using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have enough troops or a way to transport them."
"The Anzio and Nettuno beaches are on marshland. When Truscott's 3rd Division was selected for the attack, he said everyone would die. Lucas was told lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a landing in the Anzio/Nettuno area."
Plan.
"Planners thought that if German forces left the Gustav Line to defend against the Allied attack, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line. If troops were left on the Gustav Line, then the Allies could try to capture Rome."
"The Allies planned to attack from the south. They wanted to capture a beach near Anzio, move forward, and be ready to go to Rome."
Availability of naval forces.
One of the problems with the plan was there was mot enough landing ships.
"Only enough tank landing ships (LSTs) to land a single division were available. Later, Churchill made sure enough were available to land two divisions."

His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.

During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.

Non-violence.

"King thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated."
Boycotting.
"King suggested boycotting things sold by white businesses as a nonviolent way of protesting and getting people's attention. He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:"

"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality cooking television show that airs on Food Network. It began on August 11, 2013. It is hosted by Alton Brown."
Format.
"Four chefs are given three cooking challenges. Each challenge has a type of dish that the chefs have to make in 30 minutes. Before then, the chefs have one minute to get ingredients out of a pantry. After 30 minutes, a judge tastes each dish, and the chef with the worst dish is eliminated."
"At the start of the game, the chefs are each given $25,000. In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."

Cyrus' ""Who Owns My Heart"" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, ""Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?"" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of ""Who Owns My Heart"" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hot pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing on top of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up."

Chess databases.
"Chess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games."
"In practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand."
The existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.
ChessBase.
"ChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap."
New in Chess.
"This is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games."
Chessgames.
"Chessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database."
On-line playing sites.
"There are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play. The two leaders in this market are:"

Classes of natural numbers.
Prime numbers.
A prime number is a natural number which has only two divisors: 1 and itself.
Highly composite numbers.
"A highly composite number is a natural number that has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement."
The first 20 highly composite numbers are:
"1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560"
Perfect numbers.
A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive divisors (all divisors except itself).
The first 10 perfect numbers:
Integers.
"Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc."
Popular integers are −1 and 0.
Orders of magnitude.
"Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10""k"", where ""k"" is an integer. If ""k"" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation."
"Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, ""kilo-"" may be added to the beginning of ""gram."" This changes the meaning of ""gram"" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams."
Rational numbers.
"A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as and the denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as . Every integer is a rational number. This is because in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction."
"Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as ""three twenty-fifths"" (), ""nine seventy-fifths"" (), etc."
Irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.
Real numbers.
The real numbers are a superset(or category) of numbers. They cover algebraic and transcendental numbers.
Hypercomplex numbers.
A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.
Transfinite numbers.
"Transfinite numbers are numbers that are ""infinite"". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite."
Physical Constants.
Physical constants are constants that can be used in the universe to figure out information.

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."

Grotte Mandrin
"The Grotte Mandrin is a cave near Montélimar. It is near the small French town Malaverne, in the Drôme department. It is more like a shelter, that protects from the weather, and not really a cave. It is an archeological site: There are many well-preserved finds from the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic. The oldest layer of finds is 120,000 years old."
It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin.
Location.
"The Abri is about southeast of Malataverne town center. It is at the foot of an exposed limestone cliff at 245 m height. At the site, the valley is very narrow, only about . Important traffic routes pass through there: the A7, N7, D169 and the high-speed line LGV Méditerranée ."
Topography.
"Today, the Grotte Mandrin has a depth of . At some point part of it collapsed. Today, large boulders on the slope below are still there. The covered area was originally much larger. There is an opening of about facing north. At the front, the cave has a height of about . From the middle of the cave, it gets lower. At the back, the height is about less."
"In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed."
History.
"When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian)."
"The oldest known evidence that anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) were present in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria; this evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this ""baby tooth"" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human."
Superabundant number
A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944.
Definition.
"Any natural number ""n"" is called superabundant when a certain equation is true."
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
"An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (""σ""(""m""))/""m"" is 16/9. (""σ""(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number"
"The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... ."

Chicken
"Chicken (""Gallus gallus domesticus"") is a term which refers to a species of poultry. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around)."
"A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). Roosters do not have penises. A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks."
"When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this."
Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.
Eggs.
Chickens are well known for their eggs. Many people eat them for their breakfast. The eggs can be prepared in many different ways.
Meat.
"Because of their low cost, chicken meat (also called ""chicken"") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year. Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken and tandoori chicken."

"There are different cuts of chicken. Chicken meat can also be bought whole. The leanest part is known as the breast. Sliced pieces of the breast are known as the tender(loin). There are also wings, thighs, and legs (also known as drumsticks)."
Chicken and chickenpox.
"Chickenpox has nothing to do with chickens. When chickenpox was first described, people thought that the pox spots looked like chickpeas placed upon the skin. The Latin word for chickpeas is ""grana"". That is the original word that chickenpox got its name from."
Gaming.
In some parts of the world people breed chickens to fight. They bet money on which of two birds will win. In many places this is illegal.

"Milparinka, New South Wales"
"Milparinka is a very small town in New South Wales, Australia. About ten people live in Milparinka, which is about 296 kilometres north of Broken Hill. It is built beside a waterhole on Evelyn Creek, named by the explorer Charles Sturt after his wife in 1844. Sturt and his group had been trapped at a waterhole they called Depot Glen nearby on Preservation Creek for seven months while they waited for rain."
"Gold was found at Milparinka, which became the centre for the Albert Goldfields in the 1880s. Two other nearby gold towns, Albert and Mount Browne, were abandoned because of the lack of water. During the peak of the goldrush, Milparinka had a population of more than 3000 people. By 1893 most people had left. Today there are only a few buildings left, the hotel, the courthouse, police station, and the remains of the post office."
The courthouse was built of local sandstone in 1896. The final court session was in 1921. The building has been restored and is used as a local museum.
Skin cancer
"Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive."
"Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds."
"Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time. They do not usually spread, and rarely kill."
Area code 404
"Area code 404 is an area code for Georgia. It was one of the first area codes created in October 1947. It covered the entire state until it was split by 912 in 1954, 706 in 1992, and 770 in 1995. It now covers the Atlanta region of Georgia. It covers counties such as Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, Cobb, Douglas, and Gwinnett counties. It was overlaid by 678 in 1998, 470 in 2001, and 943 on March 15, 2022."
Isthmohyla pseudopuma
"The meadow tree frog or Gunther's Costa Rican tree frog (""Isthmohyla pseudopuma"") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. In Panama and parts of Costa Rica, it lives between 1000 and 2400 meters above sea level. On the Pacific side (west) of the mountains in Costa Rica, it lives no more than 864 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 37.6 to 42.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.1 and 45.6 mm long.
This frog is brown and light brown on the back and yellow on its belly. It has a white stripe on both back legs. Some of them have blue color on their middles.
Actions.
"This frog hides during the day in bromeliad plants and other plants with large leaves. At night, it goes to trees and bushes to look for food."
"These frogs lay eggs after heavy rains. The males go to water, deep water if they can, and sing for the females. The females choose the largest male frogs. The female lays 500 eggs at a time, 1800 to 2500 eggs per female per year."
"The tadpoles eat plants and dead things. They will also eat frog eggs and smaller tadpoles. They will eat eggs and tadpoles from other species or other Gunther's Costa Rican tree frogs. If the pond starts to dry up, the tadpoles become frogs quicker than if it did not dry up."
Threats.
"This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives, because of climate change, and because there is more ultraviolet B light than there was. This light can hurt this frog."
Area code 405
"Area code 405 is an area code created for Oklahoma. It was one of the first area codes created in October 1947. It initially covered the entire state of Oklahoma, but after it was split by 918 in 1953 and 580 in 1997, it now covers the central portion of the state. It was overlaid by 572 in 2021."
Failed supernova
"A failed supernova, also known as an unnova, is the opposite of a supernova. When a large enough star runs out of fuel, it turns into a red supergiant. When these stars die, they cause an incredible explosion. This is a supernova. In the case of a failed supernova, the star will just collapse into a black hole. It does not explode into a supernova."
Failed supernovas may be a cause of rogue planets. Rogue planets are planets without a star.

In that context, one of the planes is the standard, or reference. Many stars are in a galaxy that has a galactic plane which is used as reference. For a planet's orbit, the inclination is the angle to the ecliptic plane. For a moon, an inclination of 0 degrees means the orbiting body orbits the planet in its equatorial plane, in the same direction as the planet rotates."

Achievements.
"In the 11th century, Richard II of Normandy chose an Italian architect called William de Volpiano to build the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. Volpiano had already built the Abbey of Fécamp, in Normandy. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey. He chose to place the transept crossing at the top of the mount. He also built a lot of crypts and chapels below the ground. These are to support building above, because it is very heavy. Today, Mont-Saint-Michel has a church of Romanesque style."
"Robert de Thorigny was a great supporter of Henry II of England. Henry was also Duke of Normandy at this time. Thorigny made the structure of the buildings stronger. He also built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, the Breton ""Guy de Thouars"", a friend of the King of France, attacked the mount with an army. He set fire to the village and killed lots of people. However, he had to retreat (leave) under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire extended to the buildings, and the roofs burnt. Philip Augustus, Thorigny's friend, was unhappy about the cruel actions and the destruction. He offered Abbot Jourdain some money to build a new Gothic-style architectural set. The abbot added the refectory (""dining room"") and cloister."
"Charles VI added big fortifications to the abbey-mount. He also added building towers and courtyards, and he made the ramparts stronger."
Administration.
"The islet is part of the French commune of Mont-Saint-Michel. It is in the department of Manche, in Normandy. As of 2009, 44 people live there. The nearest large town, with a train station, is Pontorson. Mont-Saint-Michel is part of the Organization of World Heritage Cities."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is also the subject of a traditional rivalry between Normans and Bretons. Bretons say that the Couesnon River marks the limit between Normandy and Brittany. It is only because the river has changed its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side. This legend amuses the area's inhabitants. They state that the border is not located on the Couesnon river. They say it is on the mainland, to the west, at the foot of the solid mass of Saint-Brelade."
Population.
"Up to 20,000 people a day visit the city in July and August. Among the 43 inhabitants (2006), 5 were monks and 7 nuns."

Plan of attack.
"Clark made his plan on 18 March. He wanted destroy the maximum number of enemy forces, cross the Po and capture Verona."
"The Eighth Army was to go north west to capture Ferrara and Bondeno. The U.S. Fifth Army was to go past Bologna to surround German forces south of the Po. The Fifth Army was to go west towards Ostiglia. Next, the Allies would capture bridge across the Po and go north."
"The Fifth Army plan (Operation ""Craftsman"") aimed to pull German reserves away from Route 65. II Corps would then attack."
Battle.
"In the first week of April, attacks were launched on the right and left of the Allied lines. The goal was to draw German reserves away from the main attacks to come. Axis forces had to use sea, canal and river routes for supply. Axis shipping was being attacked in bombing raids."
"The main attack started on 6 April with an artillery bombing of the Senio defenses. On 9 April, 825 heavy bombers dropped bombs near the Senio. From 15:20 to 19:10, artillery was fired. As well, 28 Churchill Crocodiles and 127 Wasp flamethrower vehicles were sent out. By 12 April, the 8th Indian Division was on the far side of the Santerno. The British 78th Division moved to attack Argenta."

Partisans had captured the German garrison of 5,000."
Energy for other kinds of welding.
"OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal. This fuel gas is almost always acetylene. Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot, hotter than any other gas. That is why it is used most of the time. Other gases like propane, natural gas, or other industrial gases can be used too."
"Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld. These kinds of welding can get hot, but they do not make the metal melt. Forge welding is an example of this. Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat. It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge. This seems odd because metals are a solid. this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard. The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit."

The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that person's life, because they want to have power over that person's life, or for other sexual reasons. The stalker can make that person feel scared. They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker. Psychologists say stalking is a way of hurting someone's mind. Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that person's body by assaulting, raping or murdering that person."
Cyber-stalking.
Stalking can sometimes be done on the internet. This is called cyberstalking.

"There is a red fox that is very thirsty in the great forest. He wants to drink, so he steals an old woman's milk. She gets upset and cuts off his tail. To get back his tail, he tries to find some milk from a cow. The cow wants grass for him to give milk. He finds a grass but the grass wants some water. Again, he runs to stream to beg some water but the stream asks him to get a jug. Like this pattern, the red fox goes travel to find milk. Finally he meets kind miller and cries. The good miller gives him the grain and he brings it to a hen to get an egg. The egg is given for a peddler to get a bead. After all paying is done, he can get some milk for the old woman so she carefully sews his tail again."

Air raid on Bari
"The air raid on Bari was an air attack by German bombers on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy."
"It occurred on 2 December 1943 during World War II. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of ""Luftflotte"" 2 bombed ships from the Allied Italian campaign. They sunk 27 cargo and transport ships and a schooner in Bari harbour."
"The attack, which lasted one hour, destroyed the port. Not It was not fixed until February 1944. The attack was called the ""Little Pearl Harbor""."
The release of mustard gas from one of the cargo ships added to the deaths. The British and American governments hid the news about mustard gas and its effects on victims.
Background.
"In 1943, during the Italian campaign, the port of Bari in southern Italy was important for Allied forces. Ammunition, supplies, and provisions were unloaded from ships at the port, then moved to Allied forces."
Bari did not have good air defences. No RAF fighters were based there. There was not good anti-aircraft defences.
"The Allies did not think the Germans could bomb Bari. They thought that the ""Luftwaffe"" in Italy could not do a major attack."
German air raids by KG 54 had bombed the Naples port area four times in the previous month.
"Thirty ships of American, British, Polish, Norwegian and Dutch registry were in Bari Harbour on 2 December. The port was lit on the night of the raid to help the unloading of supplies."

"On the afternoon of 2 December, a ""Luftwaffe"" pilot flew over Bari. His report made Albert Kesselring order the raid."
The Germans thought that destroying the port might slow the advance of the British Eighth Army. Only 105 Ju 88 bombers were available.
"The attack started at 19:25, when two or three German aircraft circled the harbour at . They dropped ""Düppel"" (foil strips) to confuse Allied radar."
The German bomber force surprised the Allies. They bombed the harbour and its ships and many of the bombs hit targets. Two ammunition ships were bombed. A petrol pipeline was cut and the fuel caught fire. The fire spread to many of the ships.
Twenty-eight merchant ships with more than of cargo were sunk or destroyed. Twelve more ships were damaged. The port was closed for three weeks. It was reopened in February 1944.
"""John Harvey""."
"One of the destroyed vessels—the U.S. Liberty ship ""John Harvey""—had been carrying a secret cargo of 2000 M47A1 mustard gas bombs. Each held of the chemical. According to Royal Navy historian Stephen Roskill, the Mustard Gas had been sent to Europe to use if Germany used chemical warfare in Italy."
"The destruction of ""John Harvey"" caused liquid sulfur mustard from the bombs to spill into waters. The many sailors who had jumped into the water became covered with the chemical."
"Within a day, symptoms of mustard poisoning had appeared in 628 patients and medical staff. Symptoms included blindness and chemical burns."
"Hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who had been poisoned by sulfur mustard gas. By the end of the month, 83 of the 628 hospitalized military victims had died."
Cover-up.

"Dorothy Renée Ascherson (19 May 1915 – 30 October 2014), known professionally as Renée Asherson, was an English actress. Much of her theatrical career was spent in Shakespearean plays, appearing at such venues as the Old Vic, the Liverpool Playhouse, and the Westminster Theatre. Her first stage appearance was on 17 October 1935, aged 20, and her first major film appearance was in ""The Way Ahead"" (1944). Her last film appearance was in ""The Others"" (2001)."
"Her first stage appearance was in 1935. Her first feature movie was the 1944 movie ""The Way Ahead"". Her most recent motion picture was in 2001's ""The Others""."
"Asherson was married to fellow actor Robert Donat from 1953 until his death in 1958. His severe asthma led to their separation, although a reconciliation had seemed possible just before the end of his life. Although Donat had three children from his previous marriage, they had no children together."
"She never remarried. She died on 30 October 2014, aged 99. Among her surviving relatives is her nephew, the journalist Neal Ascherson."
"Goddess Panthoibi first met God Nongpok Ningthou (alias Angoupa Kainou Chingsangsompa) when she was wandering in the open meadows, bathing and sporting in the cool waters of the running river. She was attracted to his handsome looks and personality. The two fell in love at first sight. She was proposed by Nongpok Ningthou to elope with him. But the already married goddess did not accept the instant proposal very soon. It was because it was not even five days passed after her wedding. She insisted him to spend some time."
Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. This causes the in-laws of Panthoibi to have suspicion over her. Her mortal husband tried to win her heart many times. But all of these attempts failed. Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou finally eloped. They wore the attires of the .
"The two divine lovers ultimately got united on the sun-washed slopes of the Nongmaiching Hills. Their happy union was celebrated with dances and music by the gods (by the ""Langmai people"" and not the ""gods"" in another version). These celebration gave birth to the Lai Haraoba festival."
Another version.
"In another version of the story, Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou when she was helping her father at jhum cultivation (Slash-and-burn). The two fell in love at first sight without any talks. But Panthoibi got married to another man against her wish. She left her husband's house to search for her true lover. Nongpok Ningthou also left his home for the same purpose. The two lovers met at the Kangla. Kangla became the place of their divine union. So, it is considered to be a special place of coronation of the Meitei kings."
Panthoibi and the Sun God.
"According to the Numit Kappa text (c. 1st century), two suns shone in the ancient sky. One was wounded by an archer hero (""many men"" in some version). The two brother suns fled from their positions. They hid for ten long days. So, the world remain in darkness. No men could work. Crops perished. Cattles died. So, the ten godly kings (or ""kingly gods"") approached to many divinities. They requested each to with the Sun God. None succeeded to do so. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. It was because she knew many mysteries and secrets. So, she showed them magical ceremonies to the Sun God. They did the same to the Sun God. The unwounded Sun God returned. But the wounded one never returned."
Panthoibi and the weaving spider.
"Once Panthoibi saw a spider. It was producing fine threads. It was also making . From this, she got the knowledge. She started the art of weaving. The divine feminine association of the art signifies the association of females with weaving."
Pottery and Human Civilization.
"After the creation of the human beings, Panthoibi made their settlements and habitats. Human started eating and drinking. Panthoibi realised the need of vessels to store food and water. So, she started making pots. In the beginning, she lacked the idea how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - ""Nura Khudonglei"" (""""). She imitated the shape and the design of the flower. Then, she produced a pot. Since then, human civilization starting making pots for cooking food and drinking water."
Worship.
"Panthoibi is mainly worshipped by the Heisnam family of Meitei ethnicity. So, she is also known as ""Heisnam Lairembi"" (lit. Lairembi of the Heisnam)."
Identification with other deities.
"Panthoibi is regarded as one of the divine incarnations of Goddess Leimarel Sidabi. She is also regarded as an incarnation of goddess Nongthang Leima. She also has many forms including Phouoibi (goddess of grains). Goddess ""Haoreibi Shampubi"" (alias ""Haoreima"") is also regarded as an incarnation of Panthoibi."

Orange-thighed frog
"The orange-thighed frog, northern orange-eyed frog or lime tree frog (""Litoria xanthomera"") is a species of tree frogs. They live in tropical places in Queensland, Australia. They are green with orange eyes. They also look like the red-eyed tree frog. The orange-thighed frog is a medium-sized tree frog. They can reach up to 5.5 centimeters in length. It is a skinny frog with a thin body, flat head and large orange eyes."
"This frog lives in rainforests where the trees are close together. It spends almost all its time high in the trees. It only comes down from the tree to look for mates and lay eggs. Male orange-thighed frogs gather in groups in ponds. They call for a mate from branches or on the edge of the water. Their call is a long ""aaa-rk"". They mate with females after a heavy rainfall. Their eggs are brown and the female can lay from 800 to 1600 eggs. The orange-thighed frog's tadpole are similar to the red-eyed tree frogs."
"This frog was in danger because human beings would cut down its forests to take the wood to build things. Now, people visiting their forests for fun is a larger problem."

However, the genus ""Nectophrynoides"", their young will not develop from a tadpole stage."
True toads do not have any tooth. Their skin looks like warts. They have a pair of parotoid glands on the back of their heads. These glands has alkaloid poison. They get this type of poison from stress. They have also other toxins such as Bufotoxin. Male toads has a Bidder's organ. The organ will become an active ovary if conditions are right. They will then become a female.

The competitors compete against one another. The person who wins may get a prize. The prize might be a trophy or money."
"Competitions can be for lots of different things, for example, sport, writing, music, dancing, science, or chess."
Some competitions need a referee. The referee will make sure that the game is played fairly and that the competitors obey the rules. In events like music competitions there will often be an adjudicator who will decide which person they think is the best.

SimCity
SimCity is a computer game where the player has to build a city. They can do whatever they want to their city. It can be built from the ground up or it can be destroyed by a hurricane or a UFO.
History.
"""Sim City"" was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis. They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989."
It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.
Gameplay.
"At the start, the player has to build power plants. Power plants make power so the city can have electricity. By building power lines, power is connected to the different areas of the city. Water needs to be pumped in from a river using pipes to connect them to the city."
"Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commercial, or industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow."
"Roads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods."
Sequels.
"After the first game, many more were created. These were made up of three games, with spin-offs and expansion packs. These were:"
Doorstop
A doorstop (or door stop or doorstopper) is a tool.
"There are two types. One holds a door open (or ""stops"" it from closing), and the other stops the door from hitting a wall."
"Doorstops that keep the door from hitting a wall can be put on the door, or on the wall, or on the floor in front of the wall."
Doorstops that are used to keep a door open come in two varieties:
Digital rights management
"Digital rights management (DRM) is a way to make it difficult to copy music, movies, and computer programs. It is used to make people follow copyright laws. It works by using computer technologies."
"Many companies use DRM to protect their properties from copyright infringement, such as Sony, Microsoft and the BBC. Other companies also use DRM."
Some people do not like digital rights management. They think that DRM makes copying harder than copyright laws allow. The Free Software Foundation suggested that 'digital restrictions management' is a better name.
The name 'Dodo'.
"The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning ""disgusting bird"" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time."
"The ""Encarta Dictionary"" and the ""Chambers Dictionary of Etymology"" say ""dodo"" is a Portuguese word, coming from ""doido"". It means ""fool"" or ""crazy"". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, ""doo-doo""."
"In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island ."
Description.
"The dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting."
Extinction.
"The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct."
"The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."
Tolkāppiyam
Tolkaapiyam (தொல்காப்பியம்) is a book on grammar of the Tamil language.
Tol (தொல்) means Old and Kappiyam (காப்பியம்) means a literary work.
"The name of the author could not be identified (usually referred as ""Tholkappiyar"") and the work apparently relates to Grammar in Tamil."
"It is learnt that the author was one of the 12 disciples of Sage Agastya the Father of Tamil Grammar. This sage was living in the south near Madurai, during the visit of Lord Ram to the south in search of his wife, abducted by the Lankan King Ravan."
The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).
"Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same."
Great auk
"The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland. It lived mostly in the water, like a duck."
"Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word ""penguin"" was the Celtic word for ""great auk"". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks."
"The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain."
Abbey Road Studios
"Abbey Road Studios, usually called just ""Abbey Road"", are the recording studios in EMI's headquarters in St. John's Wood, London, England."
"Abbey Road had three different studios for most of its history. Other space was turned into a fourth studio later. Studio One is large, and used to be a ballroom. Symphony orchestras and very large bands and groups are recorded there. Studio Two is smaller, and works best for small combos or groups of musicians. Studio Three is much smaller, and is meant for soloists and duos. Studio Four is mostly for post-production, where changes are made to earlier recordings."
Ujamaa
"Ujamaa, meaning 'familyhood' is the group of ideas of Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. They are based on the traditional African society."
Prisoner
"A prisoner is a person who is forced to stay in a prison against their will. People who are suspected of a crime, for example, a murder, may be arrested and held in jail so they won't escape before their trial. After conviction a prisoner may be punished. For example, they may be imprisoned for a fixed number of years, or receive a life sentence meaning they stay in jail until they die."
Swift
The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
"The scientific name for the swift (""apus"") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, ""apous"" which means ""without feet"". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. It is often thought that if they land on ground, they cannot fly up again, but that is not true. They can take off but with difficulty."
Description.
"Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey."
"Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the shape of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape."
"Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer."
Nests.
"Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest."
"There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus ""Aerodramus"". In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China."
"Wangaratta, Victoria"
"Wangaratta is a city in the northeast of Victoria, Australia. About 19,000 people live there. It is about from Melbourne along the Hume Highway. The city of Benalla is to the south west, and Albury and Wodonga to the north east. The Ovens and King Rivers which flow from the Victorian Alps meet at Wangaratta. It is in the local government area of the Rural City of Wangaratta."
History.
"Gold was found in the area during the 1850s. A Post Office opened on 1 February 1843, as Ovens, and moved to the town and was renamed Wangaratta in 1854. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District (Victoria). They were also the first two inland offices."
"The small town of Glenrowan about 10 km away is known as the site of the final shootout that led to the capture of Australia's most famous bushranger, Ned Kelly."
"Chiltern, Victoria"
"Chiltern is a town in the north east of Victoria, Australia. It is between Wangaratta and Wodonga, in the Shire of Indigo. In 2006 there were 1063 people living in Chiltern. The town is close to the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park. Chiltern was once on the main road between Melbourne and Sydney but is now by-passed by the Hume Freeway a few kilometres to the east."
History.
"The area of Chiltern was on the Wahgunyah cattle run and was called Black Dog Creek. The township was named after the Chiltern Hills in England. It was surveyed in 1853 but not started until gold was found in 1858—59 during the great Victorian Gold Rush period. The Post Office opened on September 1, 1859."
"Many of Chiltern's old buildings are protected by the National Trust. In 1859, many shop-keepers and miners from around Beechworth and the Ovens Valley followed the gold rush and moved into Chiltern."
"The Grape Vine Hotel, on the corners of Main St and Conness St, has the largest grapevine in Australia, planted in 1867."
News release
"A press release, news release, media release, or press statement is a written or recorded communication for news reporters. Its purpose is to let them know about something that is news. These are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to editors at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television stations, and television networks. There are companies whose job is to send out this information."
"The use of a press release is common in public relations. People use this to get the media to take notice of them, or get publicity for a product, or event that they might be holding. A press release gives reporters the basic information they need to write a news story. Press releases can announce a range of news items such as: events, promotions, awards, new products and services, sales and other financial data, accomplishments, etc."
"A ""press statement"" is information given to reporters. This is an official statement or account of a news story that is specially written for newspapers and other news media for them to make known to the public."
Alice (song)
"""Alice"" is an alternative rock song written and performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne for the soundtrack to the 2010 movie ""Alice in Wonderland"", entitled ""Almost Alice"". The song is a mid-tempo ballad sung from the perspective of the film's lead character, Alice. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song after asking Disney executives and director Tim Burton for a role on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Butch Walker and mixed by Lavigne's former husband Deryck Whibley."

Composite number
"A composite number (or simply a ""composite"") is a natural number, that can be found by multiplying prime numbers."
"For example, the number ""9"" can be found by multiplying ""3"" by ""3"". Another example is the number ""12"", which is obtained by multiplying ""3"", ""2"" and ""2""."
All natural numbers (greater than 1) can be put in one of the two classes below:
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
"The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (also called the unique factorization theorem) is a theorem of number theory. The theorem says that ""every"" positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers (or the integer is itself a prime number). The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number. If two people found two different ways to write the number, the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written. For example, we can write:"
"and if somebody else finds ""another"" way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers, we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here. Finding the prime numbers is called factorization."
This theorem can be used in cryptography.
Proof.
"The first person who proved the theorem was Euclid. The first detailed and correct proof was in the ""Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"" by Carl Friedrich Gauß."
"Some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere. However, the theorem is ""not"" true in more general number systems, like . This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843, in his work on Fermat's last theorem. For more information about that: read ."
"The proof consists of two parts: ""first"" we show that every number can be written as a product of primes; ""second"" we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time, then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same."
First part of the proof.
"We show that if ""not"" every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, we end up in some kind of impossibility. So after that we conclude that it ""must"" be true that every number can be written as a product of primes."
"So, now see what happens when somebody says that he/she knows a positive integer, greater than 1, which can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. In that case we ask him/her to mention ""all"" the numbers, greater than 1, that can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. One of these numbers must be the ""smallest"": let's call it ""n"". Of course, this number ""n"" cannot be 1. Further, it cannot be a prime number, because a prime number is a 'product' of a single prime: itself. So it ""must"" be a product of numbers. Thus-"
"where both ""a"" and ""b"" are positive integers that are of course smaller than ""n"". But: ""n"" was the ""smallest"" number that can not be written as a product of primes. So it must be possible to write ""a"" and ""b"" as products of primes, because they are both smaller than ""n"". But then the product"
"can be written as a product of primes as well. This is an impossibility because we said that ""n"" can not be written as a product of primes."
We have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true. In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem.
Second part of the proof.
Now we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers.
"After some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults."
Species.
"How fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."
Zeulenroda-Triebes
Zeulenroda-Triebes is a German town in the rural district of Greiz in Thuringia.
"It has about 18,000 inhabitants. Most famous sight of the town is the beautiful town hall."
Harry Nilsson
"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 - January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter."
"Nilsson was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City. His paternal grandparents were Swedish."
"""Without her"" is one of his early hits. This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include ""Me And My Arrow"", ""Coconut"", ""Cuddly Toy"", ""Spaceman"", and ""One"". ""One"" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were ""Without You"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"". These songs were written by other people. ""Without You"" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was used in the 1969 movie ""Midnight Cowboy"". The song was written by Fred Neil."
"Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of ""You Can't Do That"". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music."
"Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named ""The Point!"". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. ""The Point!"" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, ""Cuddly Toy"" and ""Daddy's Song"", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas."
"Nilsson died of heart failure in Agoura Hills, California."
"The movie ""You've Got Mail"" uses several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack."
Acoustic guitar
"An acoustic guitar is a string instrument. It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (""pick""), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles."
How the guitar became a popular instrument.
"The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar."
Guitar and ukulele compared.
"The guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."
Flipper
"A flipper is a special kind of limb that is flattened like a paddle for moving through water. Many animals that live in water, such as whales and seals have flippers. The flipper of a fish is called a fin."
It can also be an item worn on the foot to help people swim more easily.
Coral fungi
"Coral fungi or clavarioid fungi, are mushrooms that are usually shaped like coral, but can also be shaped like forks, worms or clubs. They are rubbery and at times are brightly coloured."
"Originally, such fungi were put in the genus ""Clavaria"", and called ""clavarioid"", which means ""Clavaria""-like. It is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, we keep the informal (non-taxonomic) name of ""clavarioid fungi"", and it is frequently used in research papers."

Literary works.
"Bradford wrote ""Of Plymouth Plantation"". It was a history about Plymouth colony. It is often called a journal. It was a collection of what he saw and what he thought was important. This was written in two books. The first book was written in 1630 but the second was never finished. During the years 1646 and 1650, he wrote about the colony's history up to 1646."
"In ""Of Plymouth Plantation"", Bradford saw what was happening to be like what happened in the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, ""Bradford hoped to show the workings of God to future generations."" The book was not published until 1656, the year before his death, and it was well liked. Bradford has been called the father of American history. Many American authors have put what Bradford said in their books. Thomas Prence did so in his book named ""A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals."" Today it is considered very important and studied in American schools and colleges. Bradford's journal was included in another work entitled ""Mourt's Relation"". This was written in part by Edward Winslow, and made into a book in England in 1622."
Homeless Bird
"Homeless Bird is a book by Gloria Whelan, an American author, about life in India for a 13-year-old girl named Koly. Like many Indian girls her age, Koly becomes a teenage bride in an ""arranged marriage."" Her husband soon dies and Koly becomes a widow, living with her late husband's parents. When this situation doesn't last, Koly has to find a way to make her future."
"This book won the National Book Award in 2000 in the category of Young People's Literature. It has been translated into German, Spanish, and Polish."
Plot Summary.
"Koly is a 13 year-old girl who lives in Vrindavan India with her parents and two brothers. Based on Indian tradition, her family has made an arranged marriage for her. Her husband is a sickly, young boy named Hari. Once they are married, Koly must go to live with his family. But soon Koly finds out that Hari has tuberculosis and he will die very soon. Hari's parents had decided to take Hari to the Ganges River and Koly comes along too. While going to the city of the Ganges River, Hari dies. When Hari dies, Koly becomes a widow. Koly's sassur (father- in-law) is a kind man who teaches students. He teaches Koly to read and shows her a book of poems signed by the author Tagore. Koly's sass (mother-in-law) is not a nice woman. She treats Koly as just another mouth to feed."
Hari's sister Chandra is soon married. Koly is sad because Chandra was her friend and now she is leaving. Soon Koly's sassur dies and now both Koly and her sass are widows.
Sass and Koly are very poor. One day Sass gets a letter from her brother inviting them to live with him in Delhi. They make a stop in Vrindavan to pray at a temple. They take a rickshaw to the temple. Sass gives Koly money to buy lunch. Koly goes to buy the food but when she goes back to the temple her sass is not there. She looks around and cannot find her. Finally she sees the rickshaw driver. He tells her that her sass left on a train hours ago.
"Koly cries because her sass has left her. The rickshaw driver says to go to the temple and pray so the monks will give her food. Koly is very unhappy and scared. She sees the rickshaw driver again and he offers to bring her to a house for widows. At the home Koly meets a nice widow named Tanu. Together they find jobs making marigold garlands and beaded bracelets. However, Koly's talent is embroidery. She finally gets a job embroidering. Her new boss' name is Mr. Das."
"Koly also teaches the rickshaw driver, Raji, how to read. Raji owns a farm and drives rickshaws for money. They talk and become friends. However he leaves to fix his farm."
"At her new job, Koly makes friends with a girl named Mala. Mala is good at embroidery but very outspoken. Mala also steals expensive cloth and thread from Mr. Das. This later causes Mala to lose her job."
"Raji comes back and tells Koly that he is fixing up his farm and building a home. He wants Koly to come to his farm with him. She is confused until Raji says he wants her as his wife. Koly is surprised that Raji wants to marry her because she is a widow, and in her society it is shameful to be a widow. However Raji wants to marry Koly because he does not care about appearance and only wants someone he can talk to. Koly is still unsure but agrees to think about it."
Tanu and Koly finally have enough money to buy a room for more widows to live in. Koly decorates the room with embroidered quilts.
"In the summer Raji writes that he has built a room for her work on her embroidery. Koly is happy and agrees to marry him. She works on a wedding quilt and says they will marry when she is done embroidering it. She keeps her job, and agrees to take her work to Mr. Das every couple of weeks."
"Koly, just like the homeless bird in one of the Tagore poems, has finally found her home."

Anne Hutchinson
"Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - 20 August 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. Her parents are Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden. Her father, being a clergy, homeschooled Anne Hutchinson. She got more education than most other girls at that time. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology."
"Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony."
"Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans. Her death was regarded by some in Massachusetts Bay as evidence of divine judgment."

Puss in Boots
"""Puss in Boots"" is a fairy tale. It was written/recorded by Charles Perrault. The story is the classic ""animal as helper"" tale. It is about a cat who uses tricks and lies to gain power, money, and a princess in marriage for his lowborn master. The story first appeared in a handwritten manuscript in 1695 with four other tales by Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The book was a great success."
"A tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola's ""Le piacevoli notti"" () (1550-55) and another from Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1634) are similar to ""Puss in Boots"". Straparola's story was published in France in 1560. It may have influenced Perrault. ""Pentamerone"" was not published in France during Perrault's lifetime. It is not likely he knew Basile's tale."
Story.
"A miller dies. He leaves a cat to his youngest son. The cat requests a pair of boots. He tells the boy he will make his fortune. The cat makes friends with the king by bringing him wild game in the name of his master. One day, the king rescues the boy from drowning. He dresses him in clothes from his own wardrobe. The king's daughter falls in love with the handsome boy at once. The cat takes possession of a castle for his master by killing an ogre. The boy marries the king's daughter."
Golden Sun
"Golden Sun is a Game Boy Advance handheld role-playing video game. It was developed by Camelot and published in 2001 by Nintendo. It's the first of the ""Golden Sun"" series. In Japan, it's named Ōgon no Taiyō Hirakareshi Fūin (, meaning ""Golden Sun: The Broken Seal""). In 2003, the second of the series named """" was released. The game's ""Djinn"" setting is unusual."
"The game's story take place on a magic world named ""Weyard"". It's an alchemy world, and alchemy can be controlled by adepts. Long long ago, Alchemy was sealed, but one day some young adepts let it return to Weyard. To keep world safety, they have to travel to let alchemy be sealed again."
"IGN's Craig Harris said ""Golden Sun"" ""is the best game in all 2D-based Japanese RPG""."
Stories or Tales of Past Times
"Stories or Tales from Past Times () is a collection of eight fairy tales by Charles Perrault. It was published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin. The collection is also known as ""Mother Goose's Tales"" (). The eight tales are ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Bluebeard"", ""Puss in Boots"", ""Diamonds and Toads"", ""Cinderella"", ""Rickey with the Tuft"", and ""Hop o' My Thumb"". Later editions included three verse tales by Perrault: ""Griselda"", ""The Silly Wishes"", and ""Donkeyskin"". The stories have been translated into many languages. They have been published around the world."
Bluebeard
"""Bluebeard"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 titled ""Contes de ma mère l'oye"" (). The deluxe volume was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old niece of Louis XIV. It included four other tales by Perrault. ""Bluebeard"" was first published anonymously in January 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The tale is about a cruel man who murders his wives so that he will inherit their wealth. He puts their corpses in a secret room opened only by a magic key."
"Jacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The taboo of the forbidden room is found in eastern literature, and Barchilon writes that the tale has an ""Oriental character"". He points out that the French associated beards with Turkish fashions, and early illustrations depict Bluebeard wearing a turban-like headdress."
"Medieval murderer of children Gilles de Rais may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and Joan of Arc's military companion. His victims (mostly young boys) were said to number 140. The Breton king Comorre the Cursed (c.500 AD) is another candidate. Tales similar to ""Bluebeard"" include ""The Fitcher's Bird"" by the Brothers Grimm and the English tale ""Mr. Fox""."
Story.
"A rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the wedding (and before he travels to a far land on business), Bluebeard gives his wife the keys to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe."
All That Heaven Allows
"All That Heaven Allows is a 1955 romantic drama movie. It stars Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson. Douglas Sirk directed. It is based on a story by Edna L. Lee and Harry Lee. The movie was produced by Ross Hunter, and released by Universal Pictures. It was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry."

Because of this, Cary ends the relationship with Ron. Cary returns to her lonely life. She sees other women getting engaged and living lives of happiness. She finds the courage to defy social norms and commits to loving Ron."
Criticism.
Chibbley.
"Chibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship ""Picton Castle"". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because ""Picton Castle""’ was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea."
Convoy.
"Convoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS ""Hermione"". He was named ""Convoy"" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when ""Hermione"" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205."
Emmy.
"Emmy was the ship's cat on RMS ""Empress of Ireland"". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and ""Empress of Ireland"" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, ""Empress of Ireland"" ran into SS ""Storstad"" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. ""Empress of Ireland"" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people."
Felix.
"Felix was the ship's cat aboard ""Mayflower II"" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in ""National Geographic"" magazine, ""Life"" magazine, and ""Yankee"" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called ""Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures"". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation."
Mrs. Chippy.
"Mrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard ""Endurance"", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that ""Mrs. Chippy"" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name ""Mrs. Chippy,"" and kept using it."
"The ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive."
Simon.
"Simon was the ship's cat of HMS ""Amethyst"" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS ""Amethyst"" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of ""Amethyst""’s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits."
"After the ""Amethyst"" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in ""The Times"" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors."
Trim.
"Trim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim."
U-boat.
"U-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck."
Unsinkable Sam (Oscar).
"Oscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship ""Bismarck"". When ""Bismarck"" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS ""Cossack"". ""Cossack"" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS ""Ark Royal"". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed ""Unsinkable Sam."" He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich."
Ship's cats today.
"Starting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness)."
"Cats still ride on many private ships today. For example, ""Toolbox"" is a ship's cat who rides on the second ""Kalmar Nyckel""."
"American sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships ""Dove"" and ""Return of Dove"", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965)."
Calendula officinalis
"Calendula officinalis (pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold, garden marigold), is a plant in the genus ""Calendula"" of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to India. It was the state flower of Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar State, now part of Gujarat."
Uses.
Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add colour to salads or added to dishes as a garnish instead of saffron.
The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have been used as a herb and in salads.
"The flowers were used in Ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb and a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin."
"Wine making begins with growing red or white grapes. Wine grapes have thicker skins and bigger seeds compared to table grapes for eating. After the grapes are ripe, they are picked off the plants. There are different ways of picking (for example, using machines, or picking by hand, in the day, or at night)."
"After harvest, the grapes are crushed to release their juice, which is very sugary. Before, this was done by people stomping on grapes with their bare feet. Today, machines are used, but people sometimes use their bare feet in festivals. The person making the wine also decides now if the wine will be red, white, or rose:"
"Next, the sweet grape juice is fermented, by adding yeast. In a few days, the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol, and also releases carbon dioxide."
"After fermenting, the wine is stored for a while (called ""aging""). The person making the wine can make different choices, which will change the flavor of the wine. They can choose to store the wine in a steel container, or a barrel made of oak wood. If they choose wood, the wine will absorb some of the wood flavor, which wine drinkers call ""oakiness"". This process can take only a couple of weeks, up to several years, depending on what kind of flavor the wine maker wants."
"Lastly, the wine is bottled and sent to a customer, restaurant or store to be enjoyed."
Wine and people.
People have been making wine for about 5000 years.
Wine is a popular drink in many countries. The countries that drink the most wine (using numbers from the year 2000) are:
"However, if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine, the list is different:"
"Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay, and Slovenia."
Wine is made in many countries. The countries that make the most wine (using 2015 numbers) are:
"Italy, France, Spain, USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, South Africa, China and Germany."
Width
"Width or breadth is the side-to-side length, measuring across the object at right angles to the height."
"For example, the distance between the left side and right side of a chair is its width."
Water
"Water () is a transparent, tasteless, odourless, and almost colourless chemical substance and covers over 70% of Earth's surface. No known life can live without it."
"Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very cold (below ), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very hot (above ), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor. It is moved around in the water cycle. Water is essential for life."
Physical chemistry of water.
"Water is a fluid. Water is the only chemical substance on Earth that exists naturally in three states. There are over 40 anomalies (strange things) about water. Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water freezes, it expands by about 9%. This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes."
Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O.
"Like other liquids, water has a surface tension, so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface."
"Things having something to do with water may have ""hydro"" or ""aqua"" in their name, such as hydropower or aquarium, from the Greek and Latin names for water. It is also called the ""universal solvent"", because it dissolves many other compounds."
"In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color."
Uses of water.
"Plants and animals (including people) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place, and is the main part of blood. It keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin. Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive. Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body. Saliva, which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make urine. Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water, but this value differs with age; i.e. a foetus is 95% water inside."
"Water is the main component of drinks like milk, juice, and wine. Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients, things like sugar, fruit, and sometimes alcohol. Water that a person can drink is called ""potable water"" (or ""drinking water""). The water in oceans is salt water, but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water."
"Many places, including cities and deserts, don't have as much water as people want. They build aqueducts to bring water there."
"Though people can survive a few months without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few desert animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink."
"Water has no smell, taste, or color."
Guilt (law)
"In criminal law, a person is guilty if a court has decided they have done something illegal. If a person has broken a law by stealing, for example, they are guilty of a crime."
A person is guilty if a court says they are. The court has blamed them for doing something wrong. A guilty person is punished. The punishment is called the sentence.
Length
"Length is a measurement. A ruler can measure length. The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing. Short means a small length. Long means much length. Short and long are opposites. For two dimensional things, length is usually the longer side."
Length of Time.
Length also describes time.
Time Example.
"John sits down at one o'clock, or 1h. John waits until three o'clock, or 3h. John stands up at three o'clock, or 3h. John was sitting for 2 hours. The length of time John was sitting was two hours."
Weight
"The weight of an object (or the weight of an amount of matter) is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field. Weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass. For small objects on Earth, the weight force is directed towards the center of the planet. For larger objects, such as the Moon orbiting around the Earth, the force is directed towards the center of mass of the combined system."
"In common language, the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the Earth's surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history, weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing and to use kilograms and pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing."
Units of weight.
"The unit of weight in the International System of Units is the newton, which is represented by the symbol 'N'."
"Other units have been in use in the past but have been abandoned, such as the dyne (the unit of force in the old CGS system) or the kilogram-force, which is the force exerted on a"
kilogram of matter by a 'standard' Earth: a body with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.81 N at sea level.
Measuring weight.
"The weight of an object, or of an amount of matter, is typically measured with an instrument such as a spring scale. The scale includes a spring which provides a force to oppose the gravitational force on the object which is being weighed. The gravitational force pulls down, the spring pushes or pulls upwards. Typically, the scale has a readout which gives not the weight (which is a force) but rather the mass of the object. Spring scales are made with the assumption that they are being used on the surface of the Earth. If a spring scale was taken to the Moon it would give a misleading reading."
A balance style weighing scale is a device that compares the weights of two object in the same gravitational field: it determines whether one object is heavier or lighter than the other.
Weight is variable.
Weight is not an intrinsic property of matter because the local gravitational field that generates the force called weight is variable in space and time:
Truth
The truth is what is true. It may be everything that is true (reality) or just a part of it (a fact). It may also be a statement that is true: a truth. Things or statements that are not true are untrue or false. True things exist (or have existed); false things do not (or never have).
"Aristotle said: ""To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."" However, a statement may be about how things once were; this would be a true statement if it is clear that it is not a statement about how things are now. Most often, the tense of the verb will indicate this, but there may be other ways in which the statement is qualified: for example, by saying when the statement was true."
"Truth is a noun, and the corresponding adjective is true. The word ""true"" also functions as a noun, a verb and an adverb. The English word ""truth"" is from Old English ""tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ"", Middle English ""trewþe""."
Most of the discussion on truth is about one of two things:
Many philosophers have given opinions on these issues.
In Other words.
"The first ""The Legend of Zelda"" game was the fifth best-selling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. ""The Wind Waker"" was the fourth best-selling game for the GameCube. ""Twilight Princess"" had sold well. In the PAL region, which covers most of Asia, Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Western Europe, ""Twilight Princess"" is the best-selling ""Zelda"" game ever. During its first week, the game was sold with three out of every four Wii purchases. The game had sold 4.52 million copies on the Wii as of March 1, 2008. 1.32 million copies were sold on the GameCube as of March 31, 2007."
Awards and recognition.
"The name of the main character of the PC game ""Daikatana"", Hiro Miyamoto, is for Miyamoto. The character Gary Oak from the Pokémon anime series is named Shigeru in Japan. He is the rival of Ash Ketchum (called Satoshi in Japan). Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri was mentored by Miyamoto."
"In 1998, Miyamoto was the first person to be in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. In 2006, Miyamoto was made a ""Chevalier"" (knight) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres."
"On November 28, 2006, Miyamoto was in ""TIME Asia""'s ""60 Years of Asian Heroes,"" alongside Hayao Miyazaki, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Bruce Lee and the Dalai Lama. He was later one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 and also in 2008. At the Game Developers Choice Awards, on March 7, 2007, Miyamoto received the Lifetime Achievement Award. Both GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the ""Top Ten Game Creators"" and the ""Top 100 Game Creators of All Time""."
"He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in the Spanish-speaking world, the Prince of Asturias Award."
Personal Life.
"Miyamoto has a wife, Yasuko, and two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency. His daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he knows some English, he is not fluent and would rather speak in Japanese for interviews."
"Miyamoto usually does not sign autographs. He is worried that if he signs an autograph for one person, many other people will ask for autographs too. He also does not appear on Japanese television because he likes privacy. More foreign tourists than Japanese people recognize him."
"Miyamoto does not spend much time playing video games in his personal time. He likes playing the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He likes bluegrass music. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku. The dog was why Miyamoto wanted to create ""Nintendogs"". He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. He has been quoted as saying, ""Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock and roll."""
"Miyamoto like to move the furniture in his house, even late at night. He also said that he has a hobby of guessing how long something is, then checking to see if he was correct. He carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showed his hobby on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"". He also played the ""Super Mario Bros."" theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show."
Individual
Individual can be an adjective or a noun.
"As an adjective, a living thing that is individual is not in a group (by him/her/itself). An object that is individual is for only one person or thing (not shared by a group). Something that is individual can also be different from anyone else (unique)."
"As a noun, an individual is only one person or thing, not a group. An individual can also mean someone who is different from anyone else (one a kind)."
Truck
"A truck (or lorry in British English) is a motor vehicle used to transport goods. The word ""truck"" comes from the Greek word ""trochos"", which means ""wheel"". Most trucks use diesel fuel."
Sizes of trucks.
Light trucks.
"""Light trucks"" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb). Light trucks are only a little heavier than vans or pickup trucks, but require a special driver's license."
Medium trucks.
"""Medium trucks"" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size. Medium trucks have usually two axles: one at front and one at rear. The rear wheels may be coupled (that is: two wheels hitched together) to enable heavier load, but they may also be single."
Heavy trucks.
"""Heavy trucks"" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as ""lorries"". Usually heavy trucks have three axles: one at front and two at rear, and the rear axles have coupled wheels to enable heavy loads. Often heavy trucks pull trailers. They can be either ""full trailers"" which have both front and rear axles or boggies and their own brakes, and are connected to the towing truck with a towbar, or ""semi-trailers"", which are attached to a special kind of a truck called ""tractor unit"" with a turntable coupling (""fifth wheel""). A semi-trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit. The tractor unit has an engine and the semi-trailer does not. Driving a heavy truck requires a professional driver's license. Truck drivers are called ""truckers""."
"The laws of various countries say what kind of vehicle combinations are allowed. A semi-trailer can be converted into a full trailer with using a ""dolly"". A dolly is a small trailer which has only a bogie (= set of wheels), fifth wheel coupling for the semi-trailer and a towbar. Using a dolly, the semi-trailer can now be hitched to an ordinary cargo-carrying truck and does not need a tractor unit."
A heavy truck-trailer combination is often called a big rig or eighteen-wheeler.
"The largest heavy trucks are the Australian ""road trains"" which may have up to four semi-trailers coupled to a tractor in a train-like fashion and may carry up to 200 tonnes of cargo."
Body types.
"Box trucks or Dry vans (""tilts"" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making a closed cargo room. The rear has doors. Some have a side door."
"Concrete mixers have a turning drum on back. Turning it one way mixes the concrete. Turning it the other way pushes the concrete out. The concrete goes down ""chutes"" (like large pipes with an open top). On most trucks the concrete comes out the back. Some new types have the concrete goes over the cab and down chutes in the front. Concrete is very heavy and hard to mix. Concrete mixers have to be very heavy duty."
Wolf
"The wolf (""Canis lupus"") is a mammal of the order Carnivora. It is sometimes called timber wolf or grey wolf."
"It is the ancestor of the domestic dog. A recent study found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtze River in China."
"There are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, ""Canis lupus"" is IUCN graded as 'least concern'."
Appearance.
Adult wolves are usually in length from nose to tail depending on the subspecies. Wolves living in the far north tend to be larger than those living further south. As adults they may weigh typically between . The heaviest wolf recorded weighed .
"The wolf has a long muzzle, short ears, long legs, and a long bushy tail."
"Wolves usually measure at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the under-layer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, taupe, brown, and black."
Life.
"Wolves live in groups called ""packs"". They are pack hunters. The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. The leaders are called the parent (breeding) male and the parent (breeding) female. Their territory is marked by scent and howling; they will fight any intruders. Young wolves are called 'pups' or 'whelps'. Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter."
Wolves make a noise called a howl. They howl to communicate with each other from long distances and to mark the edges of their territory. Wolves have a complicated body language.
Wolves can run very fast and far. A wolf can run in a day.
Grey wolves can live six to eight years in the wild. They can live in captivity for up to 17 years.
Diet.
"Wolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size hoofed animals (unguligrades), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals."
"Wolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat."
Habitat.
"Wolves are found in Europe, Asia and North America. They can live in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, grasslands and sometimes around towns and cities."
Arctic wolf.
"The Arctic wolf may be a subspecies of the grey wolf. They live in the Canadian part of the Arctic Circle, as well as Greenland and Iceland."
"The habitat of Arctic wolves is very hostile. Not much is known about their lifestyle. They are more friendly than other wolves, but they can still be very aggressive."
"Their winter fur is highly resistant to the cold. Wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. Since about 1930, the skull of many Arctic wolves has become smaller. This might be because of hybridization between wolves and dogs. They are tall when they're adults. Adult arctic wolves weigh about . Arctic wolves live in a group of 7-20 wolves. They may live up to 5–10 years in the wild. They can live for 14 years if they are well cared for in a zoo."
Wolves and humans.
"Even though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets: they are a close relative of the wolf."
"A few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey."
Extinction in Britain.
Wolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting. The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands. There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen.
"Within the past ten years, there have been studies that are in favour of allowing new wolves to come and live in the English countryside and Scottish Highlands again. One study was in 2007. Researchers from Norway, Britain, and Imperial College London decided that wolves would help add back plants and birds that now are eaten by deer. The wolves would keep the deer population lower. People were generally positive, but farmers living in rural areas wanted to be paid for livestock that were killed by the wolves."
Frank Lampard
"Frank James Lampard (born 20 June 1978 in Romford, London, England) is an English former footballer and manager whose the current manager of Premier League club Everton. He was known at his playing time at Chelsea. He is the son of Frank Lampard Senior, a former West Ham and England player. Lampard went to Brentwood School in Essex, where amongst other subjects, he studied Latin and gained an A* grade."
Płońsk
"Płońsk is a city in Central Poland in the Masovian Voivodeship. It has a population of 23,000 and has an area of 12 km². It is the birthplace of the Zionist leader and first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion."
Frances Burney
"Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840) was an English novelist, diarist and playwright. She was also known as Fanny Burney. After her marriage, she was known as Madame d’Arblay. She was born in King's Lynn, England. She was born to musician Dr Charles Burney (1726 – 1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725 – 62). She mostly taught herself. She began writing what she called her ""scribblings"" when she was ten. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was published in 1778. This novel made her very famous. ""Cecilia"" came out in 1782. It was an even greater critical success. Her major novels, ""Evelina"", ""Cecilia"", and ""Camilla"" are about a young girl. The girls are clever and beautiful, but does not have a lot of experience. The girl goes out into the world and grows in character. Her books were liked by Jane Austen. In 1786, she became Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte. She wrote many journals and letters. Her journals and letters have interested historians. In 1793, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. They had a son in 1794. His name was Alexander. He was their only son. While living in France from 1802 to 1812, Burney wrote ""The Wanderer"". It was a novel about the French Revolution. It was published in 1814. Her last published work was the ""Memoirs of Doctor Burney"" (1832). She died in London in 6 January 1840. She was buried in Bath near her husband and son."
Family life.
"On 13 June 1752, Frances Burney was born in King's Lynn. She was baptized on the 7th of July. Her older brothers and sisters were Ester (Hetty) (1749 – 1832) and James (1750 – 1821). Her younger brothers and sisters were Susanna Elizabeth (1755-1800), Charles (1757-1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761 – 1838). Susanna Elizabeth became Frances Burney's close friend. James Burney became an admiral. He sailed with Captain James Cook on his second and third trips. The younger Charles Burney was a scholar. Her younger half-sister, Sarah Burney (1772 – 1844), also became a novelist. She published five works that she wrote herself. Esther Sleepe Burney also had two boys who died at birth."
First mother.
"Esther Sleepe Burney was three years older than Charles Burney. She had her oldest daughter, Esther, with Charles before they married. Frances Burney kept this as a ""family secret"". She even said nothing about the date of her father's marriage. Also, she did not say when his children were born in the ""Memoirs"". Some people have thought that she hid the dates to make everyone believe she published ""Evelina"" when 17."
"Her mother suddenly became sick. She took a trip to Bath and Bristol Hot Wells. This is where main character in ""Evelina"" go to try to become healthy again. However, she did not get better. The sickness was thought to be tuberculosis. It is also possible that it was cancer. In 1760, her mother, Esther Sleepe Burney, died. She was described by historians as a gentle woman of ""warmth and intelligence"". It is possible that Esther Burney's French birth influenced Burney's writing. One example is the conflicts between Madame Duval and Captain Mirvan in ""Evelina"". It may also have been one reason for her love of and marriage to Alexandre D'Arblay. Fanny was very shocked and sad when she heard that her mother was dead. Her neighbor, Mrs. Pringle, commented. She later said, ""...she never saw such affliction"" and that Fanny would ""take no comfort--&amp; was almost killed with [""sic""] Crying"". Her father, Charles Burney, was also very unhappy. He comforted himself with writing sad poems about his wife."
Father.
"Her father was respected by many people as a musician. He was also well-educated. He wished to show that a musician could be a gentleman. Frances Burney often saw many opera singers, dancers, musicians, and actors (like actors Garrick or Christopher Smart), that spoke in many kinds of languages. She mentioned him in ""Evelina"": ""Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so universally (everywhere) admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer...every look ""speaks""!...I am afraid you will think me mad (crazy), so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him."" She also saw more of the world than most ""young ladies"" could. She wrote down many rude things people said in her diaries. Traveller Richard Twiss once embarrassed the family by talking about improper things. He said that an immodest book, ""The Dictionary of Love"", was very good. After Twiss left, Burney wrote in her Diary, 'Even my gentle &amp; candid (truthful) Father says that ""he has quite mistaken the Thing,"" &amp; that he will never see a ""Table Cloth"" in his House again'."
"Some people have said that Burney may have been shy because of her father. People said that Mr. Burney's only fault was ""obsequiousness"" (too much serving to men). Frances never openly criticized her father. She even carefully destroyed everything bad about him. In her ""Memoirs"", she wrote that her father had no faults. However, she wrote explanations and excuses for things her father thought were right."
Second mother.
"In October 1767, her father married a rich widow. Her name was Elizabeth Allen. She already had three sons. The Burney children did not like their stepmother. Hester, Frances's older sister, married her cousin. His name was Charles Rosseau Burney. He was a musician. She married him in September 1770. She probably did this to leave her home. Because of this, Frances lost a sister who was like another mother. The Burney children did a ""secret war"" with Mrs. Allen. They called her ""Mrs. Precious"", ""Madam"", and ""the Lady"". A letter from Frances Burney to her sister Hester said, ""The excuse to be ""fudged"" up (made up, lied) for the purpose, I leave to your own ingenuity."" Although at this time Frances was 25 years old, she had to find an excuse to visit her married sister. Even their old friend, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp, joined in with mocking Mrs. Elizabeth Allen."
Education.
"Her father educated her sisters Esther and Susanna much more than Frances Burney. When she was eight, she still had not learned the alphabet. She was also so shy that visitors at her father's house called her the ""old lady"". Some scholars think she might have had a kind of dyslexia. Her brother used to play tricks on her by pretending to teach her to read and giving her a book upside-down. She did not find out that it was actually upside down and tried to read it. People said that ""the little dunce"" should be whipped. However, Esther Sleepe Burney always replied that ""she had no fears about Fanny"". Her sister Susanna said that Fanny has ""sense, sensibility, and bashfulness (shyness)"". She also added, ""I am afraid...that my sister Fanny is too reserved""."
"In 1763 or 1764, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp became close to the Burney family. He helped Frances write by asking for many journal-letters from her about her family and her life. He influenced her writing very much."
Works.
"Frances Burney d'Arblay made a new kind of English novel, recording things that happened from George III's madness to what happened after the Battle of Waterloo. She also wrote comedies that had a great influence on many writers to come. For example, Jane Austen found both the theme and the title for ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the last chapter of Frances Burney's novel ""Cecilia"". William Makepeace Thackeray, the writer of Vanity Fair, was also influenced by Burney. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was a new kind of fiction in English. It was a fiction where women in society were shown in realistic, modern ways - the novel of manners. ""She showed the manners and morals of polite society with a relish (liking) for the ridiculous (funny) and a respect for the conventional (traditional)"".(""Norton Anthology of Literature by Women"", p. 242) Burney was the first woman to make the writing of novels ""respectable"". Her second novel, ""Cecilia"", published in 1782, was an even greater critical success. Her third novel, ""Camilla"", was very popular; the sale was ""4 times that of ""Evelina"", &amp; nearly double that of ""Cecilia""""."

Works by Fanny Burney at Project Gutenberg
"Lake Placid, New York"
"Lake Placid is a village in northern New York State. It has a population of 2,638. It was founded in the early 1880s to look for iron. Today it is a ski resort. It has hosted the Winter Olympics twice, in 1932 and 1980."
Grebe
A grebe is a medium sized bird. They are in the family Podicipedidae. There are 22 species of grebe.
"Description, color and shape."
"Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the Little Grebe are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is webbed feet which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water."
"On his journey home, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus. They go inside his cave at the sight of sheep, cheese and milk. Polyphemus catches them and eats some of Odysseus' men. Odysseus tricks and blinds him and they escape. The Cyclops prays to his father Poseidon that Odysseus would not get home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home, Odysseus would lose all of his men, his ship and find trouble at home. This prayer becomes the plot line of the Odyssey."
The Sirens.
"Odysseus and his ship have to pass the Sirens' island. The Sirens were always singing very beautifully, so sailors would try to go to them, but their ships would get destroyed, and they would die."
"Odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears, so they will not hear the song of the sirens. He also tells his men to bind him to the ship's mast, so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song. His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore, because he is calm again. Then they can take the wax out of their ears, and free Odysseus."
Calypso.
"After escaping from the sea, and the death of his men, Odysseus comes to the island Ogygia. On this island lives the nymph Calypso, and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god Hermes came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus immortality (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife Penelope. So Odysseus built a raft and left her."
The Phaeacians.
"After a storm, Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians. There he is found by the king's daughter Nausicaä. Nausicaä brings him to the palace of her father, King Alkinoos. During his time there, Odysseus tell the story of his journey. After this, Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca."
Return home.
"During all this time, Penelope has been keeping the suitors at bay with a ruse (trick). She promises ""I will choose when I have finished weaving this cloth"", the cloth being a burial cloth for Odysseus' father. However, every night her servant unpicks the work of the previous day. The story is made more real by Penelope becoming restless. The goddess Athena causes Penelope to feel the need to display herself, and fan the flames of the suitors' desire."
"Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, where he disguises himself as a beggar. He goes to his home and meets his son Telemachus. Together they kill the suitors, who are trying to marry Penelope in order to gain his kingdom. Later, the families of the suitors come to kill Odysseus for revenge. The goddess Athena helps Odysseus by making them stop and give up the fight."
Mae West
"Mae West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress. She worked in vaudeville and later in movies. She is best-remembered for her dirty jokes and comedy movies."
"Her name when she was born was Mary Jane West. She was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and died in Hollywood, California. Her mother was a German immigrant and former model."
Lenny Bruce
"Lenny Bruce (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), was an American comedian. His real name was Leonard Alfred Schneider. He is considered an innovator of modern stand-up comedy and changed the way many people see comedians. His jokes and routines were very improper and off limits for the time and he got in a lot of trouble for them. He is considered a hero for the defense of the First Amendment rights in the United States, especially for free speech."
"In the 1960s he was the last person arrested for impersonating and swearing, overwatched by martial law and police and banned from many cities and comedy clubs."
"He appeared on the cover of The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album."
He died in 1966 of an accidental morphine overdose whist on trial.
"In 1970 the New York's highest court of appeals decided that he is ""not guilty for using bad words""."
Kimchi
"Kimchi (; ; ), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with many seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made from napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber as a main ingredient."
"Kimchi is usually very strong for non-Koreans. There are many different types and Koreans typically eat kimchi in every meal. It is a staple of Korean food. Kimchi can be stored for a long time and it does not go bad easily. However, when it is exposed to hot weather for certain time, kimchi turns sour. So, it should not be put out unless it is going to be eaten soon. In Korea kimchi pots are a common sight. They are large terra cotta pots where the kimchi is stored until it can be eaten or until it ferments. Kimchi usually takes about 2 weeks to ferment, but some varieties can be eaten right away. Some must be stored for over a year to be finished."
The fermentation gives the kimchi a pickle-like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good.
Varieties.
"Every different kind of kimchi has a special taste and a different amount of time to ferment. Baechu Kimchi is one of the most famous kimchi. Kkakdugi is made of cubed Korean radish (mu). It’s especially contains more water and is hard to chew. Baek kimchi uses milder ingredients. It’s not spicy. Chonggak kimchi has a smallish white radish that comes with a ponytail. Gat kimchi is made from dark green Korean mustard (gat) leaves and stems. These can be kept for months or even longer. As these age, they taste like lemons. Oi Sobagi has a refreshing, cool, and hot taste. Cucumber is the main ingredient for it. It can be kept for about a week. As it ages, it also taste like a lemon. Dongchimi is a food and a beverage all in one. When it ferments, it becomes sweet and taste a lot like lemon water. It can be kept for about a month."
Preparation.
"The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage, radish, garlic, red pepper, salt and sugar. The cabbage is soaked in salt water for a few hours. Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage. Red peppers are also rubbed in and most Kimchi has a lot of pepper in it. The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix. A little sugar is added to help the fermentation process along much in the same way beer is made. The amounts of each ingredient vary between the type of kimchi you are making and the personal taste of the maker. Most kimchi has a special taste with shrimp or fish. The kimchi is allowed to ferment for a period of time, usually outdoors in a large kimchi pot. It is also quite common for these pots to be buried under ground. Kimchi can be kept for a long time and does not go bad. Koreans make kimchi with their families in December."
Amazon River
"The Amazon River (also called ""Rio Amazonas"" in Portuguese and Spanish) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries. It flows through the tropical forests of South America, mainly in Brazil. Its headwaters are in the Andes Mountains in Peru, on the western edge of South America and flows eastward into the Atlantic Ocean near the equator."
"The Amazon River moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season, parts of the Amazon exceed in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called ""The Sea"", but it is not the world's ""longest"" river system. The world's longest river is the Nile River, with the Amazon being second-longest."
Overview.
"All the main tributaries to the Amazon River have their own names. They start in the mountains (Andes) as clear water with high oxygen content, and connect with the other rivers as they all flow towards the mouth of the Amazon."
"The water of the Amazon ends up full of mud. This is especially true of its Rio Negro tributary). In the nutritious mud live a huge number of insects, small crustacea, parasites. On these small fry live predators, birds, fish and life generally. The mud is what causes this huge array of life. The mud has nutrients, and on this the flies and fish all the other animals depend."
Size and path.
"It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length. As the studies have come up with different numbers, it is therefore difficult to give an exact number. The length also changes in the rainy season. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of . The Amazon may have a length of . The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at . In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of ."
"A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of . This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon. Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over ."
"The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the ""River Sea."" The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru. Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil, and most of South America, to the city of Iquitos in Peru."
"One characteristic of the Amazon river is the ""Brazo Casiquiare"", a water connection to the Orinoco river into Venezuela, that connects the two basins."
Estuary.
"The estuary of the Amazon is about wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is wide, and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames river in England."
"Along the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about . The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called a tidal bore. Locally it is known as ""pororoca"". The pororoca occurs where the water is less than deep. It starts with a loud noise, and advances at a speed of . The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach . The place has become popular for river surfing."
Uses.
The Amazon River has many uses:
"""Uses"" suggests that the wonders of the Earth are there for our taking. They are not. It is up to us what we do, and the Amazon has already been greatly damaged by greed and corruption. Logging its trees and changing the ecosystem to farmland is already far advanced."
Bridges.
"There are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, so there is no need to build a bridge. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro (a tributary of the Amazon)."
"The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Most cities are on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. Many native people live in the Amazon, such as the Urarina who live in Peru."
Trade route.
"Big ocean boats can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers (900 miles) from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m (26 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point."
Pyramid
"A pyramid is a structure, usually made of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures."
"The word ""pyramid"" comes from the Greek word ""pyramis"" which meant ""wheat cake."" The ancient Egyptian word for them was something like ""Mer"". The Great Pyramid of Giza was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world."
The first pyramids were built in 2630 B.C. The oldest known pyramid was made for king Djoser of the third Dynasty.
Egyptian pyramids.
"In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in the tombs of huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today."
"The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is in the Giza Necropolis in Saqqara, near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. Herodotus was told by his Egyptian guides that it took twenty years for a force of 100,000 slaves to build the pyramid (with another ten years to build a stone causeway that connected to a temple in the valley below)."
"People once thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recent evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. Many valuable items were buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures."
A large statue of a Sphinx stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh.
Ascent stage.
"This was the roundish upper half of the LM, the command center and crew cabin as well as the launching rocket for leaving the moon."
"To save weight, there were no seats for the men. They would stand, loosely held in place by straps. In front and on either side of them were control panels for the LM’s guidance, communication, environment and propulsion systems. On the left side, there was a window by which commander could look out to steer the LM. Overhead in the middle section was the of diameter hatch where the astronauts transferred to and from the Command Module when two vehicles were linked. LM’s ascent rocket to meet Command Module was below the deck of the midsection. Although ascent rocket was small, it was sufficient because the moon’s weak gravity – one-sixth that of earth’s – meant that the LM would not require a strong push to rise from the lunar surface."
First flight of Lunar Module.
"On Monday, January 22, 1968, a 16-ton unmanned Lunar Module surrounded by a protective shield stood on top of a two-stage Saturn 1-B rocket called Apollo 5. This flight was made to do two important tests. One was to check separating stage from main rocket. The second was to check test firing of the descent engine, but this mission did not succeed. The Apollo 5 test ended after eight hours, and the LM remained in earth orbit. It eventually dropped into the atmosphere and burned up."
Mont-Saint-Michel
"Le Mont-Saint-Michel (; ) is an island and commune in Normandy, France. It is in the Manche department. It is located about one kilometre () from the country's northwestern coast. It is at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches. It is in size and it has a population of 44 (2009). People that live there are called the ""Montois""."
"The island has had strategic fortifications since ancient times. The name ""Mont-Saint-Michel"" comes from the monastery built there in the eighth century AD. The way in which the town is built is an example of how feudal society worked. At the top there is God, the abbey and monastery. Below this, there are the great halls, then stores and houses. At the bottom, outside the walls, there are the houses of fishermen and farmers."
"Mont-Saint-Michel is one of France's most famous landmarks. The island and its bay are part of the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Every year, more than 3 million people visit it."
Geography.
Formation.
"In prehistoric times, the ""Mont"" was on dry land. It is now a rocky tidal island. Sea levels became higher and erosion changed the landscape of the coast. Several layers of granite or granulite came to the surface in the bay. These layers of rock resisted the damage by the ocean better than the other rocks around them. These included Lillemer, the Mont-Dol, Tombelaine (a small island just to the north), and Mont Tombe, which later became Mont-Saint-Michel. The mount has a circumference of about 960 metres (3,150 ft). It is 92 metres (301 ft) above sea level at its highest point."
Tides.
"The difference between the high and low water marks is about . Medieval pilgrims who crossed the flat land sometimes called the mount ""St. Michael in peril of the sea"". Today, it can still be dangerous for visitors who do not use the causeway. It can be a risk to walk across the sands from the opposite coast. This is because of quicksand."
"Polderisation and occasional flooding have created salt marsh meadows. They are ideal for sheep. The meat has a good flavour because of the sheep's diet. The ""pré salé"" (salt meadow, in French) is home to ""agneaux de pré-salé"" (salt meadow lamb). This is made into a local specialty (a famous type of food). The local lamb is sometimes on the menus of restaurants in the area."
Tidal island.
"Before 2013, Mont-Saint-Michel was linked to the mainland with a tidal causeway. It was a path covered at high tide and shown at low tide. This connection changed over the centuries. The coastal flats (the sand) have been polderised to make pastureland. This means Mont-Saint-Michel became closer to the coast. The Couesnon River was canalised. This helped make the flow of water similar every time the tide rises or falls. However, it developed a silting-up of the bay. In 1879, the tidal causeway was changed into a raised, dry causeway. This stopped the tide from cleaning the silt around the mount."
"On 16 June 2006, the French prime minister and regional authorities announced a €164 million project (""Projet Mont-Saint-Michel""). The wanted to build a hydraulic dam using the waters of the river Couesnon and of tides. This would help remove all of the silt deposited by the rising tides. It would make Mont-Saint-Michel an island again."
The construction of the dam began in 2009. It was completed in 2013. The project was also to remove the causeway and its visitor car-park. The new car-park is on the mainland. It is about two kilometres () from the island. Visitors can use small shuttle buses to cross the causeway. The bridge is also open to pedestrians and vehicles without a motor.
"Architect Dietmar Feichtinger designed the bridge. It opened to the public on 22 July 2014. The bridge lets the waters go freely around the island. It makes the dam more efficient. The project cost €209 million, €45 million more than planned. President François Hollande officially opened the bridge."
"Sometimes, weather conditions make the tide very high. This is called a ""supertide"". For example, the sea completely covered the new bridge on 21 March 2015. It was the highest sea level for at least 18 years. Many people travelled to Mont-Saint-Michel to take photos."
History.
"Mont-Saint-Michel was an Armorican stronghold of Gallo-Roman culture in the sixth and seventh centuries. In the seventh century, the Franks took the mount. From about the fifth to the eighth century, Mont-Saint-Michel was part of a region called Neustria. At the start of the ninth century, it was an important place in the marches of Neustria."
"Before the eighth century, the island was called ""Mont Tombe"" (). The Catholic Church built the first religious building in the eighth century, and the mount became Mont-Saint-Michel. According to legend, the Archangel Michael appeared in 708 to St. Aubert, the bishop of Avranches. The angel told him to build a church on the mount. Aubert didn't listen to the angel until Michael burned a hole in the bishop's skull with his finger."
"The king of the Franks could not defend his kingdom against the attacks of the Vikings. The king agreed to give the Cotentin peninsula and the Avranchin, including Mont-Saint-Michel, to the Bretons in the 867 Treaty of Compiègne. For a short time, the mount belonged to the Bretons. In effect, these lands and Mont-Saint-Michel never belonged to the duchy of Brittany. They remained separate bishoprics from the newly created Breton archbishopric of Dol. When Rollo named Franco as archbishop of Rouen, the diocese of Rouen took the lands and the mount. They became part of Normandy once again, but not officially."
"The mount became strategically important again in 933 when William ""Long Sword"" (the Duke of Normandy) annexed the Cotentin Peninsula from the weakened Dukes of Brittany. This made the mount part of Normandy officially. This is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates (helps remember) the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The tapestry shows Harold, Earl of Wessex helping two Norman knights from the quicksand around Mont-Saint-Michel during a battle with Conan II, Duke of Brittany. Norman dukes paid for the development of the abbey in the following centuries. It became a good example of Norman architecture."
"In 1067, the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel gave its support to Duke William of Normandy in his claim to the throne of England. William gave houses and grounds on the English side of the Channel as a reward. These included a small island off the southwestern coast of Cornwall. It became a Norman priory named St Michael's Mount of Penzance. It looks similar to Mont-Saint-Michel."
"During the Hundred Years' War, the English made many attacks on the island. They were not able to take it due to the abbey's very good fortifications. The English first attacked the mount in 1423, and then again in 1433. Thomas Scalles was the leader of the English army. Scalles left two wrought iron bombards when he stopped his attack. They are still there today. They are known as ""les Michelettes"". The resistance at Mont-Saint-Michel gave hope to the French, especially Joan of Arc."
"When Louis XI of France founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469, he wanted the church of Mont-Saint-Michel to become the chapel for the Order. However, it was far from Paris so this was not possible."
"The wealth and influence of the abbey helped other foundations, for example St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. However, it started to become less popular as a centre of pilgrimage due to the Reformation. At the time of the French Revolution, there were almost no monks living there. The republicans closed the abbey. It became a prison. At first, this was to hold clerical enemies of the French republic. Later, there were also important political prisoners at the mount. In 1836, famous figures, such as Victor Hugo, started a campaign to restore the mount. The prison closed in 1863, and the mount became a historic monument in 1874. Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay became UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979. The factors for listing included cultural, historical, and architectural importance, as well as man-made and natural beauty."
Abbey design.
Inspiration and references.
"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut. She was an abolitionist. Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act. This law punished people who helped slaves run away. It also made the North stop and return the South's black runaways. Mrs. Edward Beecher wrote to Harriet (""Hattie""), ""If I could use a pen as you can, I would write something that will make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is."" At that time, Stowe was a wife with six children who sometimes wrote for magazines. Her son, Charles Stowe, said that his mother read this letter out loud to her children. When she finished the letter, she stood up, and with ""an expression on her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child"", she said, ""I ""will"" write something...I will if I live."" That is how ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began."
"According to Stowe, she began thinking about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly"" as she was in a church in February 1851. She had a vision of a Christian black man being beaten and praying for the people who were beating him as he died. She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson. Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves. She was also helped by the book ""American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses"" by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimké sisters. Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Tom's Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"In her book ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"" (1853), Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". However, later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published."
Publication.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" began in a series in an anti-slavery newspaper, ""The National Era"". ""The National Era"" had also printed other works Stowe had written. Because everybody liked the story so much, John P. Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book. Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book. However, she finally agreed. John Jewett, sure that the book would be popular, asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book. In March 20, 1852, the finished book came out. By June it was selling ten thousand copies a week. By October American sales alone were 150 thousand copies. In the first year it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold, and it was translated into many important languages."
Summary.
"Eliza's escape, Tom is sold."
"A Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby is afraid of losing his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife, Emily Shelby, are kind to their slaves, he decides to sell two of them: Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of his wife's maid Eliza. Emily Shelby is shocked and unhappy because she promised Eliza that she would not sell her son. George Shelby, her son, is unhappy because he admires Uncle Tom as his friend and Christian."
"When Eliza hears about Mr. Shelby's plans to sell her son, she decides to run away with her only son. She writes a letter saying sorry to Mrs. Shelby and runs away that night."
"Meanwhile, Uncle Tom is sold and put into a boat, which sails down the Mississippi River. There, he makes friends with a girl called Evangeline (""Eva""). When Eva falls into the water and he saves her, Eva's father, Augustine St. Clare, buys Tom. Eva and Tom become good friends because they both love Jesus very deeply."
"Eliza's family hunted, Tom's life with St. Clare."
"During Eliza's escape, she meets her husband, George Harris, who had run away before her. They decide to try to run away to Canada. However, they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family, so that George shoots Loker. Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell. Because of this, she persuades her husband to take him to a Quaker town to get better. The gentle Quakers change Tom Loker greatly."
"In St. Clare's house, St. Clare argues with his sister, Miss Ophelia. She thinks that slavery is wrong, but is prejudiced against blacks. St. Clare buys Topsy, a black child, and challenges Miss Ophelia to educate her. Miss Ophelia tries, but fails."
"After Tom has lived with St. Clare for about two years, Eva becomes very sick. She has a vision of heaven before she dies. Because of her death, many people change. Miss Ophelia loses her prejudice of black people, Tospy decides to become ""good"", and St. Clare decides to free Tom."
Tom's life with Simon Legree.
"St. Clare, however, is hurt when he tries to stop a fight at a tavern and dies. Because of this, he cannot keep his promise to free Tom. His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree takes Tom to Louisiana. There, he meets other slaves, including Emmeline (who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves. Legree beats him, and decides to destroy Tom's faith in God. However, Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves. At the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another black slave. Her two children had been sold, and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold, too."
"Loker has been changed because of the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up, but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva. He decides to continue to be a Christian, even if he has to die. Cassy and Emmeline, with Tom’s encouragement, run away. They cleverly use Legree’s superstitious fears to help them. When Tom does not tell Legree where they are, Legree tells his men to beat him to death. Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies, and they feel sorry and become Christians. George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him. He is very angry and sad. However, Tom, saying smilingly, “Who,—who,—who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” dies."
Important characters.
Uncle Tom.
"Uncle Tom, the title character of the story, is a patient, noble, unselfish black slave. Stowe wanted him to be a “noble hero”: in the book, he stands up for what he believes in. Even though they do not want to, even his enemies admire him."
"Recently, however, his name has also been used negatively. People often think of ""Uncle Tom"" as an old black man trying to make his masters happy, as people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery. However, others argue that this is not true. First of all, Uncle Tom is not really old - he is only eight years older than Mr. Shelby, which shows that he is probably around fifty. Also, Tom is not happy with slavery. His acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery. It is because of his religious faith, which tells him to love everyone. Wherever Uncle Tom goes, he loves and spreads comfort and kindness. He helps slaves escape, such as Eliza, Emmeline and Cassy. He also refuses to beat other slaves. Because of this, he is beaten himself. Stowe was not trying to make Tom an example for ""blacks"" but for white ""and"" black people. She says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish like Uncle Tom, slavery would be impossible."
Eliza Harris.
"Eliza Harris is Mrs. Shelby's favorite maid, George Harris' wife, and Harry's mother. Eliza is a brave, intelligent, and very beautiful young slave. Eliza loves her son, Harry, very much. It is possible her love for him was even greater because she lost two of her first infant children. Her motherly love is shown when she bravely escapes with her son. Perhaps the most well-known part of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is the part where Eliza escapes on the Ohio River with Harry."
"This escape is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. In Rankin's story, in February, 1838, a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley, Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north."
Eva.
"Eva ""Evangeline"" St. Clare is St. Clare and Marie's angelic daughter. She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold. Eva asks her father to buy Tom. She says, ""I want to make him happy"". Through her, Tom becomes St. Clare's leading coachman and Eva's ""especial attendant (helper)...Tom had...orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him,—orders which our readers may fancy (imagine) were far from disagreeable to him."" She is very beautiful: ""Her form was the perfection of childish beauty...Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of features than for a singular (strange) and dreamy earnestness (seriousness) of expression...all marked her out (made her different) from the other children, and made every one turn and look after her""."
"To Tom, she ""...seemed something almost divine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered (looked) out upon him...he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament."" He says that ""She's got the Lord's mark in her forehead."" Eva is an almost perfect, Christ-like child. She is very sad about slavery. She does not see the difference between blacks and whites. She talks very much about love and forgiveness. Even Topsy is touched by her love. Eva becomes one of the most important people in Tom's life."
Ophelia St. Clare.
"Ophelia St. Clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in the novel. St. Clare calls her, ""...desperately ... good; it tires me to death to think of it."" She does not like slavery. However, she does not like to be touched or come close to any black person as a human being. When she first saw Eva ""...shaking hands and kissing"" with the blacks, she declared that it had ""...fairly turned her stomach (made her feel sick)."" She adds, ""I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't have anything hurt; but as to kissing...How can she?"""
"She has a ""clear, strong, active mind"", and is very practical. However, she has a warm heart, which she shows in her love for St. Clare and Eva. Ophelia hates slavery, but has a deep prejudice against blacks. St. Clare, as a challenge to her, buys Topsy. He tells her to try educating her. At first she tries to teach and help Topsy simply because of duty. However, Stowe says that duty is not enough: there must be love. Eva's death changes Ophelia. When Topsy cries, """"She"" said she ""loved"" me...there an't (is not) ""nobody"" left now...!"" Ophelia gently says, as ""honest tears"" fell down her face, ""Topsy, you poor child...""I"" can love you, though I am not like that dear little child. I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love you...and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl."" Stowe thought that there were many people like Miss Ophelia St. Clare, who did not like slavery but could not think of blacks as people. She wanted to write about such problems through Miss Ophelia."
Important themes.
His government was able to raise more money because they stopped paying money to the Roman Catholic Church and because they closed down the monasteries. But he also spent far more money on his own enjoyment and on wars with France and Scotland. These wars did not achieve much. He made the Royal Navy much bigger and made other improvements to the armed forces.
"Early in his reign he was seen as a very handsome young man who had studied a lot and enjoyed sports, music and writing. Later in his reign he became weak, ill and hugely obese. He also became unpredictable, bad-tempered and unable to admit to making mistakes. He died at the age of 55 in 1547. The next king was his son Edward VI."
Early life.
"Henry was born at Greenwich Palace on 28 June 1491, and was the son of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. He was one of their seven children. Four of them survived infancy  – Arthur, Prince of Wales; Margaret; Henry; and Mary ."
"He had his own servants and minstrels, including a fool named John Goose. He even had a whipping boy who was punished for Henry when he did something wrong. Prince Henry enjoyed music and jousting was very good at both of them. At the age of 10, he could play many instruments, including the fife, harp, viola and drums. Henry was a scholar, linguist, musician and athlete at his early age. He could speak fluent Latin, French and Spanish. He had the best tutors and he also had to learn jousting, archery, hunting and other military arts. Henry was very religious."
"Henry's older brother Arthur was the heir to the throne. This means he would have become the king when Henry VII died. Arthur married a Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon (her name in Spanish was Catalina de Aragon). Prince Arthur died a few months later. He was 15 years old, and Henry was 10 years old. After his brother died, Henry was the heir to the throne."
"While his father was alive he was watched closely, because the King feared for the safety of his only remaining male heir. Henry could go out only through a private door, and then he was watched by specially appointed people. No one could speak to Henry. He spent most of his time in his room, which could only be entered through his father’s bedroom. Henry never spoke in public, unless it was to answer a question from his father. He kept his enthusiastic personality under control on public occasions because he feared his father's temper. He was given little training for his future role as King by his father and relied heavily on his counselors in the early years of his reign. In 1509, Henry VII died of tuberculosis as well and his son became King Henry VIII. He was 17 years old."
Reign.
Early years.
"Three months after becoming king, Henry married Catherine of Aragon. They tried to have children, as Henry wanted a son who could be the next king. In 1511, she gave birth to a son who they named Henry, but he died seven weeks later. She later gave birth to a girl, the future Queen Mary I. All her other children were stillborn (died before birth). He did have one son (Henry Fitzroy) through a woman he was not married to. This son could not become king."
"Early on, Henry had two of his father's advisors executed. They were not popular and Henry claimed they had been stealing from the money they had been looking after. Henry would often execute anyone he did not like during the rest of his reign. From 1514, Thomas Wolsey became an important advisor to Henry. Wolsey helped Henry change the government to give the king more power. Wolsey later became a cardinal, making him an important figure in the church."
"At first, Henry wanted to be friends with the King of France. But soon, he instead joined with Spain, the Pope and the Holy Roman Empire to weaken France. He dreamed of gaining more lands in France. The results were mixed: England won some battles against France in 1513. The alliance weakened France`s power over the Pope. Scotland invaded England in 1514 but lost badly at the Battle of the Flodden. But Henry spent a lot of money and did not gain much land."
"In 1520, an event named; 'The Field of the Cloth of Gold', took place in Calais (at the time, the city was part of England rather than France). It was held to celebrate peace between France and England because they had been at war for a long time. Loads of money was spent on it. People enjoyed music, dancing, food, wine and culture for two-and-a-half weeks. Henry famously wrestled King Francis I of France and lost. Despite this, England and France were soon fighting again. After they signed a treaty in 1525, there was less fighting."
Split with Rome.
"The most important event that happened in England when Henry was the king was the country's change in religion. At first, there was no sign that Henry would do this. Eight years into Henry's reign, the Protestant Reformation began in Germany. Until then, all of Western Europe had been part of the Roman Catholic Church. When the Reformation began, some countries broke away from the Roman Catholic Church to form Protestant churches. At first, Henry was against this. The Reformation did not spread to England straight away. But by the 1530s, there were many powerful people in England who liked the idea of the Reformation."
"Henry became desperate to have a son. By 1527, Henry was wanting to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. The Roman Catholic Church said he could not divorce without asking the Pope. Henry asked the Pope, but the Pope would not do this. The Pope said it went against the teachings of the church. Henry blamed Wolsey for failing to change the Pope's mind. He sacked Wolsey and ordered him to be put on trial, though Wolsey died before the trial could happen. After that, Thomas More became his main advisor. But More opposed the divorce, so he was replaced a few years later by Thomas Cromwell. Henry also chose a man called Thomas Cranmer to be the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry knew that Cranmer would do what he wanted, and Cranmer agreed that Henry could have a divorce from Catherine. The Pope did not know this, so he let Cranmer become the archbishop."
"A powerful ruler might have forced the Pope to change his mind, but the most powerful rulers would have opposed the divorce. Catherine's nephew was Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and Catherine came from Spain, the largest Catholic country. In 1534, attempts to reach an agreement over the divorce failed."
"Henry asked Parliament to pass the Act of Supremacy, which meant that the king, not the pope, was the head of the church in England. This created the new Church of England. The Pope was so angry that he excommunicated Henry, meaning Henry was thrown out of the church. Henry then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader. Anyone who refused was punished. Among those killed were Thomas More and his old teacher John Fisher."
"Henry was not a true Protestant. He wanted the Church of England to be similar to the Roman Catholic Church but under his control. Some Protestants were even executed, including Anne Askew. However, Henry was easily led by people like Thomas Crownell, Thomas Cranmer and Anne Bolyen, who secretly wanted the country to become Protestant. It was not until the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I that the Church of England became fully Protestant."
"Henry and Cromwell thought that monasteries, in which Roman Catholic monks and nuns lived, had more money and land than the monks and nuns needed. Henry forced the monks and nuns to move out of the monasteries. Then Henry gave their money and land to men who supported him. Most of the men who received money and land from the closed monasteries were Protestants. This event was called the dissolution of the monasteries."
Later marriages.
"After his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn, who was younger than Catherine and still able to have children. Henry soon became unhappy with the marriage. He and Anne did not get on well as they had before they married. Anne had many enemies in the government, including Henry's most loyal minister, Thomas Cromwell. Henry was also unhappy that Anne, just like Catherine, only had a daughter and no sons. Henry started looking for another wife."
"In January 1536, Henry fell off a horse while jousting and was badly injured. He took a long time to wake up and his leg was wounded. The wound never properly healed, and he had painful ulcers on his leg for the rest of the his life. This meant it was hard for him to do exercise, so after this he started to become obese. The head injury may have also caused him to become more bad-tempered."
"Later that year, Cromwell helped Henry to find a way to get rid of Anne, by finding people who said that she had been the lover of several other men. Anne was put on trial and found guilty, and she was executed by having her head chopped off by a French swordsman."
"Henry's third wife was Jane Seymour. She soon gave birth to a son called Edward. Although this made Henry very happy, a few days later Jane died. Henry had loved her very much and he never got over his sadness at her death. He lost interest in everything, and became bigger in size. He became angry with Thomas Cromwell when Cromwell suggested that he should get married again after Jane's death."
"After a while, Henry changed his mind. As he still only had one son, he realised that it might be a good idea to marry again, and he agreed to marry Anne of Cleves, a German princess. When Anne arrived, Henry did not think she was as pretty as she looked in the pictures he had seen, and he was not satisfied with her. Anne was also unhappy and agreed to be divorced from Henry after only a few months. Cromwell had helped arrange the marriage. Henry was angry with Cromwell and had him executed."
"In the meantime, Henry had noticed a young lady at court, called Catherine Howard, and thought that she might make a good wife. Catherine Howard was a cousin of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry and Catherine got married in 1540, but Catherine was much younger than Henry and she soon got tired of him and started to flirt with other men. After they had been married for just over a year, Henry found out that Catherine had been having an affair with someone else. She was found guilty of treason and was executed, just like Anne Boleyn had been a few years before."
"Henry's sixth and last wife was called Catherine Parr. She was a woman in her thirties who had already been married twice. Her first two husbands had been much older than she was, and both had died. Henry thought that she would be more sensible and faithful than his other wives, and he turned out to be right. Catherine Parr stayed married to Henry for over three years until he died, but they did not have any children."
"After divorcing Catherine of Aragon, Henry began to suffer many different ailments, he never again regained health. He died on 28 January 1547 at the age of 55 and was buried in Windsor Castle. Henry was the father of two queens and one king. They were Mary I of England, Elizabeth I of England, and Edward VI of England. None of them had any children of their own."
"In 1536, the Act of Union was passed under Henry's rule which had a long-lasting effect on Wales as a nation. The Act of Union meant that Welsh people were forced to speak English and things such as road signs were translated into English. The royal family, who were based in London, were now officially in charge of Wales. However, the Act also meant that Welsh citizens were given the same legal rights as the English so there was an upside to this new law."
Personality.
Henry often liked to be captured in his portraits with either food or pets. He had many pets. Henry was often seen with his dog. He owned a white pug and was very aware of how much his dog represented him as a wealthy man.
"To do this, we use the following lemma: if a prime number ""p"" divides a product ""ab"", then it divides ""a"" or it divides ""b"" (Euclid's lemma)."
"First we now prove this lemma. Well, assume now that ""p"" does not divide ""a"". Then ""p"" and ""a"" are coprime and we have that says that there must be integers ""x"" and ""y"" such that"
"Multiplying everything with ""b"" gives"
"Remember that ""ab"" could be divided by ""p"". So now, on the left-hand side we have two terms that are divisible by ""p"". So the term on the right-hand side is also divisible by ""p"". We have now proven that if ""p"" does not divide ""a"", it must divide ""b"". That proves the lemma."
"Now we will prove that we can write an integer greater than 1 in ""only one"" way as a product of prime numbers. Take two products of primes ""A"" and ""B"" which have the same outcome. So we know for the outcome of the products that ""A"" = ""B"". Take any prime ""p"" from the first product ""A"". It divides the ""A"", so it also divides ""B"". Using several times the lemma that we just proved, we can see that ""p"" must then divide at least one factor ""b"" of ""B"". But the factors are all primes themselves, so also ""b"" is prime. But we know that ""p"" is also prime, so ""p"" must be equal to ""b"". So now we divide ""A"" by ""p"" and also divide ""B"" by ""p"". And we get a result like ""A*"" = ""B*"". Again we can take a prime ""p"" from the first product ""A*"" and find out that is equal to some number in the product ""B*"". Continuing in this way, at the end we see that the prime factors of the two products must be exactly the same. This proves that we can write a positive integer as a product of primes in only one unique way."
A Portuguesa
"""A Portuguesa"" ), meaning ""Song of the Portuguese"" ( 'The Portuguese [Song]') is the national anthem of Portugal, adopted in 1911. It was composed by Alfredo Keil, and its lyrics (words) were written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça in response to the British Ultimatum for Portuguese troops to get rid of their positions in Africa between the (now former) colonies of Mozambique and Angola in the (also known as the Pink Map)."
Welding
"Welding is a way of heating pieces of metal using electricity or a flame so that they melt and stick together. There are many kinds of welding, including arc welding, resistance welding, and gas welding. The most common type is arc welding. Anyone who is near arc welding needs to wear a special helmet or goggles because the arc is so bright. Looking at the arc without visual protection may cause permanent eye damage. It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something like a sunburn. Hot sparks from the weld can burn any skin that is showing. One kind of welding that does not use an arc is Oxy-fuel welding (OFW), sometimes called gas welding. OFW uses a flame to heat up the metal. There are other kinds of welding that do not use an arc."
Arc Welding.
Any welding process that utilizes an electric arc is known as arc welding. The common forms of arc welding include:
Arc welding heats metals by making a high-current electric arc between pieces of metal to be joined and an electrode.
"Use of the electrode varies based on the type of welding process. In SMAW, GMAW, and related welding processes, the electrode is consumed and becomes part of the weld. The electrode is usually made of the same kind of metal to be welded. Because the electrode is consumed by the welding process, the electrode must constantly be fed into the weld. The SMAW welding process features a ""stick"" electrode impregnated with a weld promoter known as flux, clamped to the end."
"The GMAW welding process uses a thin wire on a rotating spool, as a continuous electrode. The size of this electrode varies from around 0.635 millimeters to about 4 millimeters. The welding machine has a motor-driven spool inside that feeds the wire electrode into the weld."
"The TIG welding (GTAW) process features an electrode that is not consumed by the welding process as the metal that makes up the weld does not have any electricity flowing through it. The electrode is made of Tungsten, so used as it will not melt while immersed in the electrical arc. A filler metal, in the form of a rod, can be used to add metal to the weld area."
Almost all welding uses filler metal to fill in the small gap between the metal pieces. The extra metal helps to make the weld strong. Sometimes welds need to be made without any filler metal. Welding with no filler metal is called autogenous welding.
Shielding in arc welding.
"All types of welding require that the hot metal have protection. Dirt, rust, grease, and even the oxidation of the metal under the weld process can prevent a proper weld joint. As such all weld processes use one of two protection methods: flux, and shielding gas."
"Welding flux may be used in a solid, liquid, or paste form. During welding, the flux will melt and some of it will evaporate. This creates a small pocket of gas around the weld. This pocket of gas prevents oxidation of the metal under weld. Melted flux, through a corrosive reaction, cleans contaminants that prevent a proper weld. After welding, the flux solidifies. This layer of solid flux is called slag, and must be removed from the weld. The SMAW weld process most commonly uses flux, and is most commonly used on steel."
"Shielding gas protects the weld by being a pocket of gas around the weld. The purpose of this gas is to keep normal air out, especially oxygen. It is different from flux because there is no liquid on the weld. There is only a gas around the weld. Because there is no liquid, it will not clean up dirt and other things on the metal. This means that the metal has to be clean before it is welded. If it is not, the dirt and other things could cause problems. The gases that are usually used are argon, helium, and a mixture that is 3 parts argon and one part carbon dioxide. Other mixtures of gases can have nitrogen, hydrogen, or even a little bit of oxygen in them. One kind of welding that uses shielding gas is gas metal arc welding. It is usually used in factories to make things."
"Welding that uses flux is easier to do outside when it is windy. This is because the liquid flux is protecting the hot metal and it will not blow away. Also, the flux is always making the pocket of gas which keeps the electric arc from going out. Welding that uses shielding gas usually cannot be used outside because the gas would blow away if there were any wind."
Other kinds of welding.
"Some kinds of welding do not use an electric arc. They might use a flame, electricity without an arc, an energy beam, or physical force. The most common type of welding that does not use an arc is called gas welding. In gas welding, a flammable(meaning it will burn) gas and oxygen are combined and burn at the end of a torch. Gas welding does not need any special shielding because a flame which is adjusted right has no extra oxygen in it. It is still important to make sure the metal is clean. The flame heats up the metal so much that it melts. When both the pieces of metal are melted at the edge, the liquid metal becomes one piece."
"The other kind of welding that does not use an arc still uses electricity. It is called resistance welding. With this kind, two pieces of thin metal are pinched together and then electricity is made to go through them. This makes the metal get really hot and melt where it is pinched together. The two pieces melt together at that place. Sometimes this is called spot welding because the welding can only happen at one small place(or spot) at a time."
Forge welding is the first kind of welding that ever was used. Forge welding needs the two pieces of metal to so hot that they almost melt. Then they are beat together with hammers until they are one piece.
"The other kinds of welding that do not use an arc are hard to do, and usually new. They are expensive too. Most of these kinds of welding are only done where specially needed. They might use an electron beam, laser, or ultrasonic sound waves."
Energy for welding.
"Every kind of welding needs to use energy. This energy is usually heat, but sometimes force is used to make a weld. When heat is used, it can be from electricity or from fire."
Power supplies for arc welding.
"A lot of electricity is used in arc welding. Some kinds of welding use alternating current like the electricity that buildings use. Other kinds use direct current like the electricity in a car or most things with a battery. Almost all kinds of welding use a lower voltage than the electricity that comes from a power plant. Arc welding requires using a special power supply that makes the electricity from the power plant usable for welding. A power supply lowers the voltage and controls the amount of current. The power supply usually has controls on it that allow these things to be changed. For kinds of arc welding that use alternating current, sometimes the power supply can do special things to make the electricity alternate differently. Some power supplies do not plug into a power plug, but instead generate their own electricity. These kind of power supplies have an engine that turns a generator head to make the electricity. The engine might run on gasoline, diesel fuel, or propane."
Yeah.
"And our kids are,"
we've got some children
"and they're not, not used to it, you know, on a daily basis."
"They, they, uh,"
How old are your kids?
"Oh, from fourteen down to seven."
Okay.
You sound like you've got some small ones in the background.
One.
Is that right?
Our first.
He's about eleven weeks now.
"Oh, great."
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Where are you from?
"Uh, originally?"
Uh-huh.
West Virginia.
Okay.
"Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country"
"but,"
I've been to Charleston.
"Charleston, West Virginia?"
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway?"
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"Right,"
"and I, I, I mean, I don't know how,  how old your mom is,"
"she's probably,"
"let's see my mother's in her early sixties,"
so.
"She's, she's about forty."
"Okay,"
"I'm thirty-eight,"
your mother's
I just turned thirty-eight.
"Um, yes"
"I'm laughing,"
oh my God.
It does start to creep up.
Uh-huh.
"No,"
"um, but it's okay,"
"don't ever let age,"
"I mean, I don't"
Okay.
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men.
"I, I just turned twenty-three, uh,  April twentieth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I'm still going, you know, oh my God, I'm getting so old."
"I just,"
"because me, myself, I just like to move really, really quickly."
"Yeah,"
"an,"
"I like to,"
"anything I do,"
I got out of school quick.
"I'm, you know,  I'm working quick."
We had a house in Port Aransas.
Oh okay.
"It's a little fishing village that is, Corpus."
"That's close to, uh, South Padre."
"Well, uh, South Padre is on down the bend"
Oh Corpus.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
"it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in that region."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Small island.
Yeah.
"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."
"Oh, okay."
"Yes,"
"because I have relatives who live in Houston,"
"so when would go, and we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,"
"yeah,"
like what your talking about.
"Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston this, this summer, even with all the oil spills and everything,"
"I mean, I was, oh, it was horrible."
Was it bad?
"I well never, ever go back."
"I don't think. Uh,"
"Oh, I hate to hear that."
"and,"
"yeah,"
"Um. Okay,"
"well, I guess I got to get going,"
"Okay,"
"well, um, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess"
"Got to go take care of the children,"
"All right,"
nice talking with you.
"Yeah,"
nice talking with you.
"Are you calling from Texas, by the way?"
"No,"
I'm in California .
"Oh, okay,"
the first person I've talked to outside of Texas.
"Yeah,"
"there must be Texas people, as near as I can tell."
Well.
"Yeah,"
"okay,"
"well, thank you very much."
"Okay,"
"well, I'm from the ."
Bye-bye.
"All right,"
bye-bye.
"Okay,"
we're rolling.
"I, uh,"
"what, what would you, what would, has your experience lead you to advise, uh, if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy,"
what would you say?
"Well, I'd encourage it."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck."
"Uh, what sort of camping do you like to do the most?"
"Uh, well, I, I do, uh, real rough type camping."
I have a motor home
"Huh, rough type, huh"
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh.
"Oh, yeah,"
motor homes can be a lot of fun.
"Yeah,"
they really are.
Yeah.
They really are.
"I've, I've enjoyed it."
"I've never actually done any, uh, like tent camping,"
"Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too."
Yeah.
How about you?
"Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping."
Uh-huh.
"This summer we went to, uh, the Smokey Mountain National Park. And, uh, stayed about three or four days in there."
"Oh, how great."
It was wonderful.
"Oh, yeah."
Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.
Um.
And the days were nice and warm
"and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days."
Uh-huh.
That's great.
"Well, of course, being raised on the water I'd never swim in it."
yeah.
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
"Swimming is for swimming, pool."
Yeah.
That's why they call them swimming pools
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's where you swim.
You do not swim in the ocean.
No.
No.
No.
Not anymore.
"I've seen what comes out of the ocean,"
"and I have no desire to share, any space with anything like that."
"But, really, but huge sharks are down there."
Uh-huh.
I mean incredibly large sharks.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night"
Uh-huh.
"it was incredible the size of them,"
Wow.
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties
Uh-huh.
"and it, you know,"
"so, just strung up,"
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
"yeah,"
"just,"
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
"My name is, uh, Donna Donahue,"
"and I live in Plano, Texas."
Hi.
"My name is Lowell,"
"and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, do you want to start"
or should I start?
Go right ahead.
"Okay, um,"
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in.
"We have, um, three children,"
"and, um, they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball"
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"I, I've used that quite a bit"
"and it, and it seems to work real well."
Uh-huh.
"Uh,"
Um.
"And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey"
"and and,"
"Yeah,"
"that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time."
Yeah.
"You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that,"
but I always cooked them ahead of time
"and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it."
Uh-huh.
Have you ever had that?
No.
"What,"
"Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp"
"and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make."
Uh-huh.
The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
"Oh, I'll bet."
"Yeah,"
"I don't like the can, but the fresh."
Yeah.
You know.
I'll have to try that.
"Yeah,"
that was really good.
"I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,"
"and then I,"
"And your time,"
then you're that much farther ahead
Yeah.
"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons."
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
Right.
I've seen them
"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in"
"and,"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
That's neat.
"I went there,"
we have Home Depot out here.
I don't know if you've heard of it.
I went
and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
Yes.
We have one.
I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
Huh.
"Oh, I'm, I'm sure."
"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again."
A band saw?
What?
I did it through Adult Ed again.
Uh-huh.
"And the teacher was one of these negative people,"
"oh that's dangerous,"
You too.
"Uh-huh,"
thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye now.
Okay.
"What kind of pet do you have, Gail?"
"Well, I don't."
I have children
"Oh, you have children"
I have little children.
"Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets,"
but we've had lots of them in the past.
Have you?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, what have you had?"
"Well, we had a dog before we moved here."
"Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us."
"We came from Colorado,"
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds.
Oh.
"Okay,"
"I've ,"
"Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up."
Uh-huh.
"Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer,"
and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
"It's usually friends from church and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring."
Yeah.
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something.
"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,"
yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
yeah.
Uh.
It's a lot more relaxing.
"I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone."
Well you see all that on T V
and I could never be that person.
Huh-uh.
"It just, uh, I'm just not,"
"well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back."
Yeah
"And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church"
"and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff"
"and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out"
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm
Yeah
"I guess,"
Do you work?
"No,"
I don't.
Do you stay home with kids?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
which my son goes hunting.
He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know."
"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"
right.
Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and it's changed their perspective.
"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
Uh-huh.

"Well, that's, that's great."
"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
"Well that's,"
"Like I said, I think it does,"
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
Yes.
Well
"Well, I guess, um,"
did you have anything else?
"No,"
no
I guess that's about all.
Okay.

"Okay,"
"is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?"
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
"Yeah,"

Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away

There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"

"And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now."
And what are you going to buy?
"I I don't know,"
"we're either going to buy a pick up,"
or we're going to buy a van.
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,"

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."
Torres Amat died in Madrid on 29 December 1847.

"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott. He entered a Catholic seminary, but left without taking orders. He went to Paris and engaged in journalism, and taught science and classics in the Athlone and Sligo Intermediate schools. In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900.

"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing.

The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"". The gameplay itself was described as a ""dull maze plod"" with unresponsive and repetitive action."
"However, all the reviewers highlighted the colourful, detailed graphics, with presentation comparable with Players' previous titles."

= = = Belmont railway station (Harrow) = = =
"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."
The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.

"MLB. He signed with the Dodgers and made his MLB debut in 2014. He played primarily shortstop in Cuba, but played third base and left field for the Dodgers, who released him in 2016."
"As a member of Cuba's Las Tunas team in the Cuban National Series, Guerrero was named to the 2010–2011 All-Star team as well as playing for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2012 Haarlem Baseball Week and the 2011 World Port Tournament. He was part of the initial roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but did not make the final roster and reportedly sat out the regular season because he was upset at his snub."
"He defected from Cuba in 2013 and obtained residency in Haiti. He began training in the Dominican Republic and on September 9, 2013, it was reported that he had been cleared by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to sign with U.S. teams."
"Guerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years. The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22."
"Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289."
"Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes."
"During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats."
"In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense."
"In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks."
"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."
"His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average."
"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8."
"On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2."
"On December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal."

= = = Perry (car) = = =
"The Perry was a British car made by the Perry Motor Company based in Tyseley, Birmingham who made cars between 1913 and 1916."
"The company can trace its roots back to 1824 with James and Stephen Perry making pens in a workshop in London, later moving to Birmingham and building bicycles. By the late 1890s they were having financial problems and were bought by James William Bayliss, part owner of the Bayliss-Thomas car making company."
"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."

The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title ""Worst Week of My Life"", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed."
"The series aired on CBS Mondays at 9:30pm ET/PT, following ""Two and a Half Men"". The premiere attracted 11 million viewers but lost a third of its lead-in audience. Ratings dropped to a low of 8.4 million viewers with the sixth episode, then began to climb steadily. They reached a high of 12.12 million viewers with the eleventh episode but declined afterwards. The season finale titled ""The Epidural"" aired on February 16, 2009."
"On May 20, 2009, CBS announced its new season schedule and canceled ""Worst Week"". A previously unaired episode entitled ""The Party"" aired on June 6, 2009. ""Worst Week"" is set in Manassas, Virginia."
"Verne Gay of ""Newsday"" graded it A and said it ""may be the best new comedy on network TV this season."""
"Less enthusiastic was Tim Goodman of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"", who said, ""Though there are plenty of hard-earned (some might say forced) laughs here and Bornheimer is a real find, you can't help but wonder how they'll keep up the pace. After all, the British series ran for only two seasons and had a mere seven episodes each season...So how is CBS going to stretch this into 22 episodes without stretching it too thin?...In many ways, ""Worst Week"" seems incapable of being made into an American version (there were previous attempts that failed), because not only does the title not make sense, but not having a payoff for all the freaky, not-so-karmic woes Sam endures will be frustrating to the viewing audience . . . [It] is a series that may end up being on a short leash."""
"Linda Stasi of the ""New York Post"" called it ""one of the worst new shows of the week"" and added, ""Only a man (or a couple of them) could get paid big bucks in Hollywood to come up with such a lame-o rip-off and perpetuate the fantasy that gorgeous women can't help but to love out-of-shape guys who do everything wrong."""

"The personal weapon of reservists in this unit was the Steyr AUG automatic rifle. Officers and senior NCOs carried the 9 mm H&K USP pistol, which had replaced the Browning Hi-Power in 2007. The 7.62 mm FN MAG machine gun replaced the Bren gun as the section light machine gun."
The unit also trained on anti-tank weapons such as the 84 mm Carl Gustav recoilless rifle and the 84 mm SRAAW.
"Men and women ages 17–34 could join the unit by applying to their local battery office. The unit had batteries in Cork City and in Templemore, Thurles and Nenagh.

OB 293 was a North Atlantic convoy which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
"It was notable for seeing the loss to the Kriegsmarine (KM) of , with her commander KL Günther Prien, the person responsible for the sinking of two years previously."
"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"The church was largely rebuilt in 1856-1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area."

The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door.

"In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland."
"The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation."
"The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield. His benefice still provides funding for the current secondary school in Normanton, the Freeston Business and Enterprise College."
"In 1906, a medieval altar slab bearing five incised crosses was found under the sanctuary floor, where it had probably lain since the reformation. It now stands in the Lady Chapel and is used for weekly Eucharist."
"There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave."
"The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War."
"The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts."

The second is two-handled porringer inscribed ""The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699"""
"In ""Normanton, Past and Present,"" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: ""The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton. The Favells were an important Normanton family and were resident here in the early part of the 17th century. On the south chancel floor are memorial slabs of the Favells bearing the dates 1698, 1714, 1777 and others in the 18th century. Here also is a large altar tomb of the Malletts and Levetts. The Mallets it would seem were a very ancient family, as we are told their ancestors flourished here in the middle of the 13th century. The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets. On the wall above the tomb is an undated tablet recording that 'Mrs. Elizabeth Levett made benefaction for the poor of Normanton and Snydale, and for teaching poor children.' There also are tombs of the Torres mentioned under Snydale."""

= = = Phileine Says Sorry = = =
"Phileine Says Sorry () is a Dutch/American 2003 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Jan Westdijk. It is based on the novel ""Phileine zegt sorry"" by Ronald Giphart."
"The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York."
"On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early."
"In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife."
"Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others."
"On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end."
"At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant."
"A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage."
"The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument."
"The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi."
"The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: ""Sorry that I exist."""
= = = Liuva II = = =
"Liuva II, ( 584 – June/July 603), youthful son of Reccared, was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 601 to 603. He succeeded Reccared at only eighteen years of age."
"In the spring of 602, the Goth Witteric, one of the conspirators with Sunna de Mérida to reestablish Arianism in 589, was given command of the army to repulse the Byzantines. From his position of power at the head of the army, he surrounded himself with people in his confidence. When it came time to expel the Byzantines, Witteric instead used his troops to strike at the king in the spring of 603. Invading the royal palace, and deposing the young king, he counted on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. Witteric cut off the king's right hand and later had him condemned and executed in the summer of 603."
= = = William Howard Taft National Historic Site = = =
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site is a historic house at 2038 Auburn Avenue in the Mount Auburn Historic District of Cincinnati, Ohio, a mile (1.6 km) north of Downtown. It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. The two-story Greek Revival house, built circa 1835, is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city."
"William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General."
"The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival."
"Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise."
"The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector."
"William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister."
"In the 13th century, (this conflict formed the backdrop for some of Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"", completed in 1320)."
"A crossroads near the rue Camollia. On the outskirts of Sienna, the banned Guelphs and the reigning Ghibellines fight. The Guelphs are led by Orso who had been banished for having dared to throw a garland to the Ghibelline Cordelia Saracini. From the battle the guelfes emerge victorious at the portcullis of the Saracini palace. Orso demands that Cordelia appear at the balcony and open the gates to the town. Cordelia replies to him: « … now is not the time to open the gates, when thieves are in the town! » Orso give orders for an assault, the gate rises and he enters the Saracini palace bent on vengeance. Rather than throw Cordelia from the window as the screaming crowd demands, he drags her half-strangled back into the palace."
"Premier tableau – a great hall in the Seigniory palace. Despite their apparent victory, the Guelphs only control but half of the city. Among the dead on the Ghibelline side is Andreino, the fifteen-year-old son of Uberta, Cordelia's old nurse. The Guelphs request a truce in order to tend to the injured and bury the dead : plague is feared. The Saracini palace is on fire. Cordelia comes back, alive, but tells her brothers Ercole and Giugurta, as well as her nurse, that she has been raped by a man of whom all she can remember is the voice."
"Deuxième tableau – the cathedral square. Guelphs and Ghibellines attend the solemn mass for the Virgin in the cathedral. At the point of coming to blows, the Bishop Azzolino steps forward and upbraids them : « Siennois, is this what you call a truce for the Virgin ? Church is God's house alone ! – Faithless and unworthy Christians put your weapons down or I will close these doors and will open them only to admit your coffins! » They defer in the face of the threat; Orso only speaking a word but it is enough for Cordelia to recognize as she follows the men into the church."
"Premier tableau – a cloister. While Cordelia recognizes Orso as her torturer, Uberta learns by chance that the killer of her son is also Orso ! The two women argue over which should kill him. Cordelia decides with her plea : « You only mourn a death; I, I mourn myself, alive! ». Cordelia strikes Orso, and he falls to the ground, his throat cut with a dagger thrust. As a fight ensues, his men carry him, still breathing, to the shade of a church porch. When Cordelia and Uberta retrace steps to finish their vengeance, they cannot find the body and wonder if he was only injured. Cordelia cries out : « God of vengeance ! let him be dead ! I will not finish the task ! »."
"Deuxième tableau – the square. Cordelia discovers Orso in agony and pleading for a drink. Faced with this suffering, she pities him and pours fresh water on his lips."
"Premier tableau – a room in the Saracini palace. Cordelia has concealed Orso in the burnt palace. Giugurta, beaten, must flee the town. He wants to leave the palace by the gardens but to do that must pass through the room where Orso is hiding, convalescent. Cordelia puts him off with such insistence that Uberta becomes suspicious. A horrific explanation finally reveals the truth to Uberta, but Cordelia asks for mercy in the name of Andreino who would have condemned this bloody sacrifice. Cordelia and Orso find themselves alone. Two images alternate in the mind of Orso : the woman who stabbed him and the woman who saved him. The two make one victim of him; his repentance bursts forth and to restore her honour he asks to marry her. Cordelia replies that he is also guilty to his country riven by war. Orso promises her : « You will see me again when I have triumphed over discord and vanquished hatred! » He leaves the palace and it is announced that Giugurta has been arrested by the Guelphs, masters of the city."
"Deuxième tableau – ruins of the old Seigniory palace. The captured Ghibelline prisoners including Giurgurta are about to be executed. Orso enters and proposes to the people that the prisoners be freed, in order to march against the Emperor laying siege to the city and demanding 50,000 florins to lift the siege. The people accept. As they set off for battle Giugurta catches a glance and words from Cordelia to Orso, and says that he will return and question her after the battle."
"Sienna cathedral. The Siennese return victorious. Cordelia, frightened by her brother's threats has taken refuge in the cathedral. Giugurta find her there having extracted the information before killing Uberta. After proud protests, Cordelia faints on the altar steps, and he takes advantage to make her swallow poison. The victors come in with Orso at their head. Cordelia has convulsions which are mistaken for the plague. The crowd disperses in horror, and Orso takes Cordelia in his arms. So doing, he condemns himself to be trapped with her in the place tainted by the plague. At their pleas, Azollino joins them in marriage. Alone, they exchange parting words : Orso's wound has re-opened, and the two lovers die side by side."

"Bill grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and as a child, his mother was a prostitute and drug addict who was often beaten in front of him. He had to steal, to eat from trash cans, and once was caught trying to break into a bicycle store to try to steal something to sell for food."
"The few friends he had were mostly in street gangs, and Bill drank and smoked cannabis often. His mother was often evicted, and he lived in foster homes. Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him in as he was about to enter junior high in Roy, Utah. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said."
"Because of his grandmother's influence, he began going to school and started to participate in track and field at Roy High School, due to his great speed. He persevered to become an Olympian, and his coaches encouraged him greatly as well. He soon became a decathlete. He went to Weber State University and there he won the junior nationals in 1992. Additionally he played American football in high school."
"Schuffenhauer's Olympics dream as a track and field athlete came to an end in 2000. While training for Sydney, he suffered a bad ankle injury and he could barely walk. When his friend told him that the U.S. Olympic team was practicing bobsledding in Park City, he took the chance to go and observe.

= = = Trams in New Zealand = = =
"Trams in New Zealand were a major form of transport from the 19th century into the mid-20th century. New Zealand's first (horse) tramway was established in 1862 (Nelson), followed by a steam tramway in 1871 (Thames), and the first electric tramway in 1900 (Maori Hill, Dunedin). The tram systems in the main centres, and in some smaller towns, were soon electrified. By the 1950s, all systems were in the process of being replaced by trolley-buses or buses. The last tram service closed in 1964, in Wellington. A tram running parallel with a public road opened in Western Springs, Auckland, in 1980 and a central city loop line in Christchurch in 1995. Both are heritage lines."
"Some moves are proceeding to extend tram use in New Zealand again. In Auckland, the MOTAT line was extended in 2006–07 to reach a second site of the museum, and the former Auckland Regional Council promoted the creation of an Auckland waterfront tram line, originally with MOTAT vehicles, but will initially operate former Melbourne trams leased from Bendigo Tramways Company Limited. The Auckland Tramway Limited opened 6 August 2011 with the support of Waterfront Auckland (later merged into Panuku Development Auckland) and the new Auckland Council."
"In Christchurch, the city loop is currently operating on a limited circuit after being reopened 27 November 2013 following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011 which halted services while the CBD was closed off. The tramway was being extended in several small stages starting late 2000s and was nearly complete when the 2011 earthquake struck. While these proposals are all officially heritage / tourist lines, there is some investigation into later extension or conversion for normal transport use. This line was extended in 2014 with the reopening of the full pre-earthquake circuit and the opening of the nearly complete extension through the mall and High Street."
"In 1862 the first horse tramway in New Zealand, between Nelson and the port, opened as part of the Dun Mountain Railway, built to export ore from the mine in the hills above Nelson. Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864."
"Horse-drawn lines also opened in the main centres; Auckland and Devonport in 1886, Dunedin 1879, Christchurch 1880 and Dunedin 1879."
"At Grahamstown (now Thames) in the North Island where gold had also been found, a steam tramway to Tararu was opened on 2 December 1871, but closed on 11 November 1874, due to 'not sufficient traffic'. A steam locomotive for the tramway was built at Mechanics Bay in 1872 by Fraser and Tinne."
"As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region."
"The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction."
"The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898."
"The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938."
"Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum."
"From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance."

Contrast with probable prime, which is likely (but not certain) to be prime, based on the output of a probabilistic primality test. In principle, every prime number can be proved to be prime in polynomial time by using the AKS primality test. In practice, other methods which guarantee that their result is prime, but which do not work for all primes, are useful for the random generation of provable primes."

"There are thieves who are ruining the timeline of the Tales legends, and they have to be stopped. Dr. White now needs Frio and Kyaro to help stop the thieves and brings with him the aid of the heroes from Tales of Symphonia, Destiny, and Eternia."
"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, and selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block him/her. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle."

"""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" (also titled ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album ""Distant Light"", it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 1.5 million copies in the United States and two million worldwide. It reached No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in September 1972. ""Billboard"" ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972."
"On the day ""Long Cool Woman"" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording."
"The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song ""Green River"". According to Clarke, the song was written ""in about five minutes""."
"In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a smash hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan’s ""Alone Again (Naturally)"". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that ""it wasn't unfortunate"", since he had co-written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song."
"Eleanor Rigby is a 2004 novel by Douglas Coupland, about a lonely woman at ages 36 and 42. The novel is written as a first-person narrative by the main character, Liz Dunn."
"The novel centres on changes to Liz's life when someone from her past unexpectedly re-enters her life. It is written in a light, often comic, tone, but resonates on many deeper issues, including loneliness, family, religious visions and multiple sclerosis."
"Two distinct plot movements are separated by a break in the narrative flow. The first part of the novel involves two retellings: the story of Liz Dunn’s trip to Europe and her pregnancy, and the story of the re-emergence into her life of her child, Jeremy, who is dying of multiple sclerosis."
"As a teenager, Liz goes on a trip to Europe, her one big expressive moment. On this trip, while drunk, she loses her virginity in Italy to a man she cannot remember. From this experience, she becomes pregnant with Jeremy, who is put up for adoption, and goes in and out of foster families for much of his young life."
"Jeremy arrives back into Liz’s life when she is at a low point of loneliness. His illness is terminal, and because of drug abuse, he has only a short time to live. Jeremy’s introduction into Liz’s life rattles the lonely world she has constructed, opening up her and her world."
"The first part of the novel, narrated by Liz, jumps between these two moments, constantly reminding the reader that these are moments in the past. There is a symbolic page break between the first section, which takes place in the past, and the second section, which takes place in the novel’s present."
"In the present, Jeremy has died. Liz finds a meteorite that she takes to be a very precious object. She sleeps with it under her pillow to keep it close. She eventually, through a list of circumstances, decides to travel to Europe to find Jeremy’s father, a trip which again leads her to a world of excitement, police and army incidents, and a reunion with Jeremy’s father."
"Liz Dunn is the protagonist of this novel. She is an overweight, lonely woman, who lives a removed solitary existence. Her apartment, for instance, can only accommodate one person."
"Coupland has spoken extensively about the character of Liz Dunn, claiming that she was his most realistic character."
"Liz’s son Jeremy, who was sent out for adoption, has a terminal case of multiple sclerosis. He has traveled through the foster-care system of British Columbia, residing with many families who abused him. He eventually reconnects with Liz after finding her and registers her as his next of kin for emergencies. When he is hospitalized, Liz reconnects with her son."
"Jeremy is cheerful in the face of his condition, happy with the life that he has left to lead. He eventually becomes a successful mattress salesman in the time leading up to his death. He experiences visions of a post-apocalyptic future, which enthralls Liz. He envisions a future where crops have gone foul and farmers ask a divine voice for guidance."
The inspiration for Eleanor Rigby was loneliness. Coupland suffered through a period in his early twenties he describes as being caused by loneliness.
"The novel is named after The Beatles' song of the same name. The song reference was inspired from a moment in Coupland's past. Coupland heard the song ""on a friend's mother's record player. And the story threw me: 'Oh my God, what happened to her?' The lyrics didn't tell you much but in my head I always saw her as an only child of very old parents who didn't have a clue and she was left in a rectory and died without leaving any mark anywhere ... The book's not like that, of course, but it's the mood and the way Liz describes herself."" The song itself features in the narrative as it is Liz Dunn's email address."

= = = Rubber chicken = = =
"A rubber chicken is a prop used in comedy. The phrase is also used as a description for food served at speeches, conventions, and other large meetings, and as a metaphor for speechmaking."
A rubber chicken is an imitation plucked fowl made in a latex injection mold.
"The origin of the rubber chicken is obscure, but is possibly based on the use of pig bladders, which were inflated, attached to a stick and used as props or mock-weapons by jesters in the days before the development of plastic and latex. Chicken corpses were readily available; therefore jesters could employ them as variations of slapsticks."
"One account attributes the first use of a prop chicken to John Holmberg, the Swedish black-faced clown of the early 1900s. Holmberg would perform with his pockets full of fake food to mock the gluttony reportedly prevalent among the upper classes at the time."
A claim that the symbol originated during the French Revolution with soldiers hanging a chicken from their muskets for luck is printed on the tag of rubber chickens manufactured by Archie McPhee.
"The term ""rubber chicken"" is used disparagingly to describe the food served at political or corporate events, weddings, and other gatherings where there are a large number of guests who require serving in a short timeframe. Often, pre-cooked chicken is held at serving temperature for some time and then dressed with a sauce as it is served. Consequently, the meat may be tough or “rubbery.” Someone who ""travels the rubber chicken circuit"" is said to do so by attending or making speeches at many such gatherings, often as part of political campaigning."

"Originally from Minnetonka, Minnesota, at the age of 16, she relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado to train with noted coach Carlo Fassi. Trenary won the U.S. junior title in 1985. During a warm-up in 1985, she collided with another skater, whose blade sliced Trenary's calf muscles and severed an artery in her left leg."

"Fucked Up is a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario, formed in 2001. The band consists of Damian Abraham (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Ben Cook (guitar, vocals), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals)."
"To date the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for their second studio album, ""The Chemistry of Common Life"". In 2018, the band released its fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"", after a hiatus. Driven by Haliechuk, it is a concept album focusing on the band's recurring character David, and featuring several guest lead vocalists, alongside Abraham, Falco, and Haliechuk."
"The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for Cursed). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco)."
"Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of 7"" records. The band released the """"No Pasaran"""" 7"" in May 2002. The ""Police"" 7"" was released on March 2003, quickly followed the ""Baiting the Public"" 7"" in May 2003. Two more 7""'s followed in 2004, the ""Dance of Death"" single, and the ""Litany"" 4-song ep. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ""Epics in Minutes"" CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16 mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show."
"The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of Sigils) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12""s, the ""Looking for Gold"" 12"", and the live ""Let Likes be Cured by Likes"" 12"". The ""Looking for Gold"" 12"" contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute drum solo and contained 5 minutes of whistling."
"In the summer of 2004 the band released the ""Generation"" 7"" and 12"" eps. After touring for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ""Hidden World"" album to labels, ending with the band signing to Jade Tree Records for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to Deranged Records, which released it as a double album in November 2006."
"Several other records, such as ""Year of the Dog"" 12"" were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007 marked the band's live television debut on ""MTV Live"", where they were introduced as ""Effed Up"". During their performance of their song ""Baiting the Public"", the majority of the audience were moshing and causing damage to the set (also visible was a cut on Damian's forehead), resulting in a sum of $2,000 in damages. This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ""MTV Live"" performances."
"On October 9, 2008 the band returned to MTV Live, this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs, but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew."
"On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was ""f**king out of control terrifying."""
"In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ""Burn"", directed by Richard Roepnack. The performance was positively reviewed in the ""New York Times"", although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks."
"The band signed to Matador Records in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the ""Year Of The Pig"" 12"" single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7""es, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast."
"On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, ""The Chemistry Of Common Life."" It has received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine and many more. The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14. They were joined by musical guests including Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, Moby, John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, members of Endless Boogie, Les Savy Fav, Dinosaur Jr., and others."
"In November 2008, the band participated with other similarly named bands, including Holy Fuck, Fuck, and Fuck Buttons in the ""Festival of the Fuck Bands"" music festival in the village of Fucking, Austria."
"In 2009, Damian Abraham was invited to become a regular guest (appearing one to three times a month) on the Fox News show ""Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld"", which he had previously appeared on twice."
"In 2009 Fucked Up took part in an interactive documentary series called City Sonic. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, had lead singer Damian Abraham inside Rotate This talking about his love of vinyl and punk music."
"Fucked Up were confirmed to play the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. The band also confirmed they will play their annual Halloween gig in Toronto, October 31, 2010. The band had initially cancelled the event due to scheduled tour with Against Me!. ""We were going to go on this tour in the UK with this band Against Me!, but then they cancelled all their shows for some reason (they never told us) so the tour isn't happening so we'll be in Toronto so we figure what the hell."" They were joined by The Sadies at The Garrison, Toronto."
"In February 2011, the band toured Australia for the first time as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Additionally, the band played some select side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as The Bronx, Terror, H20, Trash Talk and Polar Bear Club."
"On June 7, 2011, Fucked Up released their third studio album, ""David Comes to Life"". A self-professed ""rock opera"" set in Thatcherite Britain, it tells a story of love, loss and redemption. The story is complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators. The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It has received wide critical acclaim."
"In November 2011 it was announced that the band would be going on hiatus, as Abraham is not able to handle raising a family and tour the same time."
"In December 2011, Spin magazine named ""David Comes to Life"" its No. 1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing ""Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic."""
"On February 7, 2012, the band was listed as one of the acts to be featured during the Orion Music + More Festival. The event took place June 23–24, 2012 in Atlantic City, New Jersey and was curated by Metallica. The band was also listed to play Fun Fun Fun Fest in November, 2012, in Austin, Texas."
"In August 2012, Fucked Up was nominated for the Polaris Music Prize for the second time. The shortlist nomination described ""David Comes to Life"" as follows: ""Excessive? Sure. Ridiculous? At times. Brilliant? Sounds pretty damn close to it."""
"In March 2014, Fucked Up announced their fourth LP, named ""Glass Boys"", which was released by Matador Records on June 3, 2014."
"Avatars of the band and their songs ""Paper the House"" and ""Queen of Hearts"" were featured in the 2016 video game ""LOUD on Planet X""."
"In 2016 the band released the ""Zanzibar"" soundtrack, recorded in 2011, to Tod Browning's silent movie from 1928 ""West of Zanzibar"" starring Lon Chaney."
"In 2018 the band announced their fifth studio album, ""Dose Your Dreams"" which was released on October 5 via Merge Records."
"In January 2008, Fucked Up, along with Xiu Xiu, filed a lawsuit against ""Rolling Stone"" and Camel Cigarettes for an advertisement that included both bands in an ""Indie Rock Universe"" special. The advertisement apparently portrayed the bands as supporters of Camel. Pink Eyes stated that ""The fact that ""Fucked Up"" was mentioned in there wasn't some great coincidence. This isn't a case of subliminal advertising, where we're claiming that there were penises in the shadows — our name is right there. Maybe they thought we were too stupid to know what was going on."""
"Diabolique is a 1996 American psychological thriller film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, written by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Don Roos, and starring Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, and Kathy Bates. The plot follows the wife and mistress of an abusive schoolmaster who find themselves stalked by an unknown assailant after murdering him and disposing of his body."
"The film is a remake of the French film ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) directed by Clouzot, which was based on the novel ""She Who Was No More"" () by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac."
"Mia Baran is a devout Catholic schoolteacher at a boys' school outside Pittsburgh where her husband, Guy, is schoolmaster. Guy is abusive to the weak Mia, a former nun who suffers from cardiomyopathy; his mistress, Nicole Horner, a fellow teacher at the school, is protective of Mia. When both women grow tired of his abuses, they collaborate to murder him in an apartment owned by a family friend of Nicole's. The women lure him there, and Mia drugs him before they successfully drown him in a bathtub. They wrap his body in a shower curtain and place it in a wicker box."
"While en route to the school, Nicole crashes Guy's car in a pileup on the interstate, but the wicker box goes unnoticed by authorities. The women arrive at the school in the middle of the night, and dump Guy's corpse in the unkempt swimming pool on the property, staging his death as an accidental drowning. When his body fails to rise to the surface after several days, Nicole has the pool drained, but Guy's body is nowhere to be found. The women subsequently discover photos taken of them on the day of Guy's murder, and believe someone is blackmailing them."
"After reading about the discovery of a John Doe in a nearby river, Mia goes to view the body at the sheriff's station, but finds it is not Guy. There, she attracts the attention of Shirley Vogel, a retired police officer-turned-private investigator who offers to look into Guy's disappearance. Nicole is resistant, and Shirley quickly becomes suspicious of the women. Their fears of a blackmailer are confirmed when Mia discovers the shower curtain used to conceal Guy's body hanging in her bathroom window."
"Shirley confronts Mia with the accident report from Guy's car, and surmises that Guy was en route to see her in Pittsburgh on the day he disappeared. Mia grows increasingly paranoid, believing Guy is alive and stalking the women. This fear increases when two videographers filming an event at the school capture an image of Guy standing in one of the building's windows. Later, while investigating the school's basement, Shirley is attacked and knocked unconscious."
"That night, Mia finds Guy floating in her bathtub, and witnesses him rise from the water. Terrified, she loses consciousness and collapses, apparently suffering a heart attack. Nicole arrives, and it is revealed that she and Guy had planned the series of events to scare Mia to the point of heart failure. Nicole laments, however, and tells Guy she had wanted to call it off. While overlooking Mia's body, Nicole realizes she is in fact not dead; when Guy realizes she is alive, he attacks both women, knocking Nicole unconscious."
"Mia flees downstairs, and Guy tackles her to the ground in front of the pool and attempts to drown her. Nicole manages to stop him by driving a garden rake into his head, and he falls into the pool. As Nicole attempts to revive Mia, Guy pulls her into the pool and tries to drown her. Mia enters the pool, and together, both women successfully drown him. They exit the pool and are confronted by Shirley, who punches Mia in the face; willing to cover for the women, she explains it will help prove self-defense in Guy's murder. Mia walks away from the pool, distraught, and Shirley smokes a cigarette while watching Guy's body sink to the bottom."
"Filming took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The St. Philomena School was used as the primarily filming location."
"The movie was compared unfavorably to the original movie, and received overall negative reviews. It currently holds a 'rotten' 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for ""Worst New Star"" (as the new ""serious"" Sharon Stone) for this film and ""Last Dance"", where she lost to Pamela Anderson for ""Barb Wire""."
"The movie was a box office bomb, grossing far below its $45 million budget."

"The Blephariceridae, commonly known as net-winged midges, are a nematoceran family in the order Diptera. The adults resemble crane flies except with a projecting anal angle in the wings, and different head shape, absence of the V on the mesonotum, and more laterally outstretched, forward-facing legs. They are uncommon, but dozens of genera occur worldwide, and over 200 species."
"They are found near fast-flowing streams where the larvae live. Blepharicerid larvae are filter feeders and have suckers on their abdominal sternites, used to adhere to rocks in the torrents in which they live. These suckers are sometimes called creeping welts. These are of unique evolutionary origin within the Diptera."
"One recent classification based largely on fossils treats this family as the sole member of its infraorder, but this has not gained wide acceptance."

Beckham was the last member of the Spice Girls to release a solo album. The album's lead single, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" was released on 17 September 2001. The second single, ""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002. A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised, following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved."
"The album was a success, reached number ten in the United Kingdom and number twenty on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart."
"Initially, the album was to be titled ""Innocent Girl"" and set to be released on 27 August 2001, but was released on 1 October. Beckham revealed that she felt she had ""a lot to prove"" with the album's release: ""When I started recording this album, I had a lot to prove. I want to prove I can sing and dance and have a vision. I'm really baring my soul on this. I hope people like it. When I was with the other girls I never did a lot of the singing, so this is the first time that people are going to see me and what I am capable of"". She added that she hoped the album would do well ""and I can have a successful solo career""."
"The album did not include the hit ""Out of Your Mind"", but spawned two singles, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" and ""A Mind of Its Own"" which managed to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom."
"""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" was released on 17 September 2001 as the lead single from the album. In the United Kingdom, the single faced competition in a hugely hyped chart battle with Kylie Minogue's single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". On the chart date of 29 September 2001, ""Not Such an Innocent Girl"" debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart with first week sales of 35,000 units, while ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" debuted at number one with first week sales of 306,000 units. It has sold about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001. It sold 36,000 copies in its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and about 80,263 copies altogether becoming the 163rd best seller of 2001."
"The music video has a futuristic theme and features two Victorias: one dressed in all-white with blonde hair (""the good girl""), and the other in all-black with jet black hair (""the bad girl""). The video culminates into a ""dance-off"" and motorcycle race between the two Victorias. The complex video was shot almost entirely on a green set with a great deal of post-production, making it one of the most complex solo Spice Girl videos to date."
"""A Mind of Its Own"" was released on 11 February 2002 as the second single from her debut self-titled solo album (2001). It peaked and debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and sold 56,570 becoming the 173rd best seller of 2002. There is a French version of the song called ""Mon Coeur N'en Fait Qu'a Sa Tete"" (an adaptation of the title into French, or ""my heart does what it wants to do"")."
"A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on ""Friday Night's All Wright"". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,; but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: ""No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue."""
"""Victoria Beckham"" faced a chart battle during the album's release week with Kylie Minogue's ""Fever"". Both singers had previously faced a battle in the singles' chart, when their singles were released on the same day. However, Beckham's album debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on 13 October 2001, whilst Minogue's album topped the charts. ""Victoria Beckham"" charted for three weeks on the chart. However, the album has only sold 50,000 copies overall in the United Kingdom, while costing £5 million to produce. After ""Being Victoria Beckham"", an official documentary that aired in March 2002, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number sixty-seven."
"Upon its release, the album received mixed to negative reviews. The BBC Music described the album as ""a mish-mash affair of gushy sentiment and wishy-washy RnB"" whilst ""NME"" called the album ""a new low in shameless pop slaggery""."

"""Why"" can be played by two to four players aged 12 to adult. The four gamepiece characters are each humorous allusions to detectives of popular media fiction: Sergeant Monday (Sergeant Friday), Dick Crazy (Dick Tracy), Charlie Clam (Charlie Chan), and Shylock Bones (Sherlock Holmes). The six ""ghosts"" in the game are each based on actual historical figures: Daniel Boone, Pocahontas, Napoleon, Nero, Cleopatra and Henry the Eighth. The weapons in the game are a rope, a gun, poison, and an ax. The motive cards include the ""Jealousy,"" ""Lover's Quarrel,"" ""Self Defense,"" and can be used only in conjunction with Alfred Hitchcock ""It's A Mystery To Me"" card."
"The object of the game is to capture one ghost, one weapon, and one motive card. There are four cards for each ghost and weapon. An alternative way to win is capturing the six Alfred Hitchcock cards and the ""It's A Mystery To Me"" card. Each player is dealt seven cards and start out in the Living Room. The remaining cards are dealt evenly into the six rooms. A player can only have up to seven cards in his or her hand at one time. A player is able to obtain more cards from the lawn, from another player, or from another room."
"To acquire cards from the lawn, a player must first make it to the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or the player's normal roll. Then they have to prove they have that type of card by showing it and then flipping over the card they want. If they are correct, they take the card. If they are incorrect, they must put down the card they thought it was and take the wrong card. For one player to take from another, they must be on the same space as each other or in the same room. A player challenges another player's card by first proving that they have one of its set. If they do have the card, they must give it to the player or they can give them a ""No Clue"" card and this card is removed from the game. If they do not have the card, they are then able to challenge that player for a card with the same rules applying. The player's turn ends after this. To get a card from a room, they must first make it to the room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through the regular roll. Then they pick up the top card and discard the same card or another card if applicable into the lawn."
"To begin the game, each player rolls the dice to see who goes first. The player with the highest roll begins and play proceeds to the left. If a player rolls 7, 11, or doubles they are able to advance to any room of their choosing. Otherwise, they advance through the hallway spaces. They can travel in either direction, but cannot backtrack."
"If all cards have been taken from the rooms then the required cards for winning must be in either a players hand or in the lawn. All players advance through the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through a standard dice roll. Once all the players are in the Living Room a new set of rules is followed."
"A player can challenge another player if they roll a 7, 11, or doubles with standard challenge rules applying. A player can pick from the lawn if they roll an odd number. Standard discard rules apply except when a player discards one of their cards back into the lawn, they place it face-up. If a player rolls an even number, they lose their turn."
"For two players, only 34 of 60 cards are used. Three complete ghosts, two complete weapons, three motive, and three ""No Clue"" cards are removed from the pack. Additionally only rooms 1-4 are used and 5 and 6 are left empty. For three players, only 48 of 60 cards are used. Two complete ghosts and one complete weapon is removed from the pack. All six rooms are still used."
"If a player wants a card from the Lawn and they don't have one of that kind in their hand, they may falsely identify the card wanted, in order to pick it up. For example: If a player was collecting Cleopatra cards and another player wished to hinder him, they may pick up a Cleopatra card from the lawn in this way: Show any card from their hand such as an Ax, point to the Cleopatra card on the lawn and say, ""This is an Ax card."" Since they pointed to the wrong card (on purpose), now they must pick up the Cleopatra card and lay down the Ax card."
"For a more difficult game, cards are kept on the lawn face down until the end of the game. Also players may complete and lay down more than one Ghost to increase their Rewards. However, to end the game, the Mystery must be solved as before. Now players add up their Rewards, counting their cards on the table and in their hands. One complete ghost or weapon is worth $500.00. One complete Alfred Hitchcock is worth $1000.00. The player that ends the game earns $1000.00 as well. Motive and ""No Clue"" cards have no value. $200.00 is deducting for each part of Alfred a player has at the end of the game or the ""It's A Mystery to Me"" card. With these additional rules, each player receiving the largest reward wins the game."
= = = Subsonic aircraft = = =
"A subsonic aircraft is an aircraft with a maximum speed less than the speed of sound (Mach 1). The term technically describes an aircraft that flies below its critical Mach number, typically around Mach 0.8. All current civil aircraft, including airliners, helicopters and airships, as well as many military types, are subsonic."
"Although high speeds are usually desirable in an aircraft, supersonic flight requires much bigger engines, higher fuel consumption and more advanced materials than subsonic flight. A subsonic type therefore costs far less than the equivalent supersonic design, has greater range and causes less harm to the environment."
"The less harsh subsonic environment also allows a much wider range of aircraft types, such as balloons, airships and rotorcraft, allowing them to fill a much wider range of roles."
"Subsonic flight is characterised aerodynamically by incompressible flow, where dynamic pressure changes due to motion through the air cause the air to flow away from areas of high dynamic pressure to areas of lower dynamic pressure, leaving the static pressure and density of the surrounding air constant. At high subsonic speeds, compressibility effects begin to appear."
"The propeller is one of the most efficient sources of thrust available and is common on subsonic aeroplanes and airships. Sometimes it is enclosed in the form of a ducted fan. At higher subsonic speeds and at high altitudes, such as attained by most airliners, the high-bypass turbofan becomes necessary. Pure jets such as the turbojet and ramjet are inefficient at subsonic speeds and not often used."
"The span and area of a wing are both important to the lift characteristics. They are related by the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the span, measured from tip to tip, to the average chord, measured from leading edge to trailing edge."
"The aerodynamic efficiency of a wing is described by its lift/drag ratio, with a wing giving high lift for little drag being the most efficient. A higher aspect ratio gives a higher lift/drag ratio and so is more efficient."
"The drag of a wing consists of two components, the induced drag, which is related to the production of lift, and the profile drag, largely due to skin friction which is contributed to by the whole wing area. It is therefore desirable for a wing to have the least area compatible with the desired lift characteristics. This is best achieved with a high aspect ratio, and high-performance types often have this kind of wing."
"But other considerations such as light weight, structural stiffness, manoeuvrability, ground handling and so on often benefit from a shorter span and, consequently a less efficient wing. Small, low-altitude general aviation planes typically have aspect ratios of six or seven; airliners of 12 or more; and high-performance sailplanes of 30 or more."
"At speeds above the critical Mach number, the airflow begins to become transonic, with local airflow in some places causing small sonic shock waves to form. This soon leads to the shock stall, causing a rapid increase in drag. The wings of fast subsonic craft such as jet airliners tend to be swept in order to delay the onset of these shock waves."
"In theory, induced drag is at its minimum when the span wise distribution of lift is elliptical. A number of factors influence induced drag, however, and as a practical matter a wing of elliptical planform, like that of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter of World War II, is not necessarily the most efficient. The wings of jet airliners, which are highly optimized for efficiency, are far from elliptical in shape."
"The ratio of tip chord to root chord is called the taper ratio. Taper has the desirable effect of reducing the root bending stress by shifting the lift inboard, but it has been argued by some noted designers, including John Thorp and Karl Bergey, that an untapered rectangular planform is best for aeroplanes of less than 6,000 pounds gross weight."

"Izumrud (, meaning ""Emerald"") was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy, and the lead ship in the two-ship . ""Izumrud"" and her sister ship were based on the German-built ."
"""Izumrud"" was ordered as part of the Imperial Russian Navy's plan to expand the Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur and Vladivostok to counter the growing threat posed by the Imperial Japanese Navy towards Russian hegemony in Manchuria and Korea."
"""Izumrud"" was laid down at the Nevsky Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 1 January 1901. However, construction was delayed due to priority given to completion of . The ""Zakladka"", or formal ceremony of laying a plate, took place on 14 June 1902. ""Izumrud"" was launched on 1 October 1903. Construction continued to be plagued by delays, including an ice storm in December. However, with the start of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904, construction efforts were greatly accelerated."
"""Izumrud"" was formally commissioned in January 1904 and she was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet."
"Under the overall command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, ""Izumrud"" was part of the Second Pacific Squadron intended to relieve the Japanese siege of Port Arthur. Captained by Commander Vasili Fersen, she participated in the decisive Battle of Tsushima from 27–28 May 1905. At the end of the battle, Fersen refused to obey the order of Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov to surrender, and used her speed to escape through the Japanese blockade. However, on the night of 28 May, she ran aground in Vladimir Bay in the Russian Maritime Province. She was destroyed by explosive charges set by her crew, who later reached Vladivostok by land."
